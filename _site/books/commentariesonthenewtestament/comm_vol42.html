PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Commentaries of Calvin on the Epistles of Paul
are generally considered to be among the most successful of his Expositions of
Scripture. In the writings, indeed, of one whose vast powers have been applied
to the exposition of nearly the whole of the Inspired Volume, and whose rare
endowments, as an interpreter of Scripture, have drawn forth expressions of the
profoundest admiration even from the most inveterate adversaries of the system
of doctrine maintained by him, there is room for some diversity of opinion as to
the particular portions of Divine truth which he has most successfully
expounded. It is mentioned by <i>M. Teissier</i>, in his extracts from <i>M. de
Thou&#8217;s</i> History, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
&#8220;although all the works of Calvin have merited the esteem of persons of
good taste, he has in the opinion of some succeeded best in unfolding the
doctrine of Providence,&#8221;while, according to <i>Joseph Scaliger</i>, who
&#8220;reckoned Calvin to have had a divine genius, and to have excelled in the
explication of Scripture, so that no one among the ancients could be
compared&#8221;to him, &#8220;the best of his theological treatises was his
Commentary on Daniel.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">While, however, there may be some difference of
opinion among the many admirers of Calvin as to the particular portion of his
expository writings, in which his vast powers shine forth to most advantage,
there can be no question that his expositions of the Epistles of Paul are
singularly felicitous. It is stated by <i>Tholuck</i>, in his view of Calvin as
an interpreter of the Holy Scriptures, that among his Commentaries on the new
Testament, &#8220;those on the Epistles of Paul are by far the best,&#8221;and
that &#8220;in the Pauline Epistles, he merges himself in the spirit of the
Apostle, and becoming one with him, as every one clearly feels, he deduces
everywhere the explanation of that which is particular from that which is
general.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> A
similar view of the peculiar excellence of Calvin&#8217;s expositions of the
Epistles of Paul is given by <i>B&ouml;hmer</i>, of Berlin, in his introduction
to the Epistle to the Colossians, (as quoted by the late <i>Dr. Pye Smith</i>,
in his encomium on the writings of Calvin.) &#8220;John Calvin well merited the
epithet, often given to him, of The Great Divine. Independent, in the highest
degree, of other men, he most often discerns, with piercing eye, the spiritual
mind of Paul, and with his masterly command of language, makes it so clear, that
both the most learned student of theology, and the plain affectionate believer,
are equally benefited and satisfied.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa3</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That the Expository Treatises of Calvin on
Paul&#8217;s Epistles should be considered by the most eminent critics to be
peculiarly successful is the more remarkable, when we take into view the
disadvantageous circumstances under which most, if not all, of them were
prepared. His Commentaries on six of Paul&#8217;s Epistles were written by him
(as we are informed by <i>Beza</i>, in his Life of Calvin 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa4</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) in
1548, a year of most harassing conflict with the enemies of the truth. His
Correspondence, however, at this period, clearly shews that his devout mind
found tranquility in an assurance of Divine support. In writing to
<i>Brentius</i>, who was then living in exile at Basle, he says: &#8220;Amidst
all these calamities one consideration supports and refreshes my mind: I assure
myself that God, in commencing the wonderful restoration of his Church, which we
have witnessed, has not held out a vain and transient hope to us, but has begun
a work that he will not fail to accomplish in spite of the malice of men and the
opposition of Satan. In the meantime let us patiently undergo the purification
which is necessary for us.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It
manifestly appears, also, from the Dedicatory Epistle prefixed to his
Commentaries on four of Paul&#8217;s Epistles, addressed to Christopher, Duke of
Wirtemberg, that he had found the Epistles of Paul peculiarly consoling to his
mind amidst outward troubles. Calvin is thought, indeed, to have had a marked
resemblance in disposition and character to the great Apostle of the Gentiles,
so that he has been termed by an eloquent writer, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa6</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;the Paul of the Reformation,&#8221;&#8212; a circumstance which is
thought to have contributed to render him more successful in the exposition of
Paul&#8217;s&#8217; Epistles, while, as is justly observed by the Translator of
Calvin on Galatians and Ephesians in the <i>Biblical Cabinet</i>, (vol. 30.)
&#8220;the chief cause unquestionably lay in his singularly clear perception of
that system of doctrine which Paul was honored to
declare.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS stands associated with
a most interesting event in the history of the progress of Christianity. While
the charge given to the Apostles as to the universal promulgation of the Gospel
was most explicit, it was in a gradual manner, and for the most part under the
guidance of circumstances seemingly fortuitous, that their sphere of labor was
extended. &#8220;Beginning at
Jerusalem,&#8221;(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422447&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
24:47,) as expressly instructed by their Master, they would, to all appearance,
have continued to pursue their labors in and around that city, had not
occurrences taken place from time to time, and these, too, of an untoward
nature, considered in themselves, which led them to extend the benefits of the
Gospel to countries more and more remote from their original sphere of
labor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Philippi was the first place in Europe in which the
Gospel of Christ was proclaimed, and it is sufficiently manifest from
Luke&#8217;s narrative, that the introduction of the Gospel at that time into
Europe was not the result of any preconcerted plan on the part of the Apostles
themselves. Had they been left to their own choice, they would, it appears, have
disseminated the Gospel in Bithynia, or some other province of Asia Minor; but,
instead of this, they were specially directed by the Spirit of God to
&#8220;come over into
Macedonia,&#8221;(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
16:9,) by which means the Gospel was for the first time introduced into Europe.
And when we consider the important place which Europe has held during so many
ages in connection with the progress of Christianity, and more especially the
high honor assigned to European Christians, as being chiefly instrumental in its
diffusion throughout the world, we cannot fail to mark with deep interest the
circumstances connected with the first preaching of the Gospel at Philippi.
&#8220;The little rill,&#8221;says <i>Foster</i>, &#8220;near the source of one
of the great American rivers, is an interesting object to the traveler, who is
apprized, as he steps across it, or walks a few miles along its bank, that this
is the stream which runs so far, and which gradually swells into so immense a
flood.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For a
similar reason, the preaching of the Gospel by Paul in the hearing of a few
women by a river&#8217;s side near Philippi, trivial as the circumstance may
appear in itself, becomes invested with the deepest interest, when viewed in
connection with the state and prospects of Christianity at the present
day.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">While Luke makes mention only of two individuals
&#8212; Lydia and the Jailer &#8212; with their respective households, as the
fruits of the first preaching of the Gospel at Philippi, it clearly appears,
from the Epistle to the Philippians, that from these small beginnings a
flourishing Christian Church had sprung up, which, at the time when the Epistle
was written, was in so prosperous a state, that the Apostle, who reproves so
sharply the Churches of Corinth and Galatia, finds no occasion for censuring the
Philippians, but commends in the highest terms their exemplary
deportment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Philippi was originally called <i>Crenides</i>, from
the numerous <i>fountains</i> of water in its neighborhood, and afterwards
<i>Dathos</i>, or <i>Datos</i>, from its gold and silver mines. The city
received the name of Philippi from Philip, father of Alexander the Great, by
whom it was rebuilt and greatly enlarged. It is celebrated in profane history,
as is noticed by Calvin in the Argument on the Epistle to the Philippians, for a
signal victory which was gained by Octavius, afterwards Augustus C&aelig;sar,
and Antony over Brutus and Cassius; and it is not a little remarkable, that a
city which was the scene of a victory that decided the fate of the Roman Empire,
should have been afterwards illustrious as the scene of a nobler victory,
intimately connected with the signal triumph of the Gospel in
Europe.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Epistle bears evidence of having been written by
Paul when a prisoner for the sake of Christ; and there seems every reason to
believe that it was written by him during his first imprisonment at Rome. <i>Dr.
Paley</i>, in his Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;, adduces a variety of arguments,
founded on incidental notices in the Epistle itself, to prove that it was
written &#8220;near the conclusion of St. Paul&#8217;s imprisonment at Rome, and
after a residence in that city of considerable duration.&#8221;It is generally
believed to have been written about A.D. 62. The Epistle
&#8220;breathes,&#8221;says <i>Barnes</i>, &#8220;the spirit of a ripe
Christian, whose piety was mellowing for the harvest; of one who felt that he
was not far from heaven, and might soon be with Christ .... At the mercy of such
a man as Nero; a prisoner; among strangers, and with death staring him in the
face, it is natural to suppose that there would be a peculiar solemnity,
tenderness, pathos, and ardor of affection breathing through the entire Epistle.
Such is the fact; and in none of the writings of Paul are these qualities more
apparent than in this letter to the Philippians.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE EPISTLE TO THE COLOSSIANS is generally supposed
to have been written by PAUL about A.D. 62, in the ninth year of the reign of
the Emperor Nero. It bears evidence of having been written during Paul&#8217;s
first imprisonment at Rome. The Apostle, in the course of the Epistle, makes
repeated allusions to the circumstance of his being at the time in
&#8220;bonds&#8221;(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
4:18) for the sake of Christ. Colosse (or, as several ancient manuscripts read,
Colass&aelig;) was, at the time when the Epistle to the Colossians was written,
a flourishing city in the south of Phrygia, situated most picturesquely under
the immense range of Mount Cadmus, and near the confluence of the rivers Lycus
and Meander; but, about a year after Paul&#8217;s Epistle was written, was,
along with the neighboring cities of Laodicea and Hierapolis, destroyed by an
earthquake, as is noticed by Calvin in the Argument of the Epistle. The site of
the ancient city, the only remaining vestiges of which consist of arches,
vaults, squared stones, and broken pottery, is now occupied by the village of
Khonas, in which, as stated by the General Assembly&#8217;s Deputation to
Palestine in 1839, &#8220;a band of about thirty Greek Christians are
found.&#8221;  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa8</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It has been matter of controversy by whom the Church
of Colosse was planted. <i>Dr. Lardner</i> adduces a variety of considerations
tending to shew that it was founded by Paul, chiefly the following: &#8212;That
as Paul was twice in Phrygia, as stated by Luke,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
16:6, and 18:23,) it is extremely probable, that on one or other of those
occasions he was at Colosse, and planted a Church there; that he expresses
himself toward the close of the first chapter in such terms as seem to imply
that he had himself dispensed the Gospel to the Colossians, and that the general
tenor of the Epistle seems to indicate that he is not writing to strangers, but
to persons with whom he had been personally conversant, and to whom he had been,
under God, the instrument of conversion. On the other hand, many distinguished
commentators are of opinion that the Church of Colosse was not founded by Paul.
Calvin, in the Argument of the Epistle, speaks of the Colossians as having been
instructed in the Gospel, <i>not</i> by Paul, but by Epaphras and other
Ministers. <i>Hug</i> and <i>Koppe</i> are decidedly of opinion that Paul did
not plant the Church of Colosse, and had no personal acquaintance with the
Christians there. <i>Davenant</i> is of opinion that the Church of Colosse was
planted by Epaphras. <i>Byfield</i>, in his Exposition of the Colossians, thinks
it probable that the Church of Colosse was planted, <i>not</i> by Paul, but by
Epaphras or Archippus. <i>Doddridge</i> thinks the Epistle &#8220;contains no
argument from whence it can certainly be inferred that he&#8221;(PAUL)
&#8220;was personally acquainted with the Colossians.&#8221;<i>Scott</i>, in his
Preface to the Epistle, gives it as his &#8220;decided <i>opinion</i>, that the
evidence against the Apostle&#8217;s having been at Colosse is far stronger than
any that has been adduced on the affirmative side of the question.&#8221;In
short, there is no inconsiderable force in the arguments adduced on both sides,
and &#8220;uncertainty still lies on the dispute whether Paul was ever at
Colosse.&#8221;  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa9</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">While, however, there is so much uncertainty as to
the person by whom the Church of Colosse was planted, that uncertainty, it is to
be noticed, does not by any means arise from any indication of comparative
indifference on the part of the Apostle Paul to the welfare of the Colossian
converts in the Epistle which he addresses to them. While a prisoner at Rome for
the sake of the Gospel, he had heard with deep concern of the insidious attempts
which had been made by certain false teachers to draw off the Colossian
Christians from the doctrine in which they had been instructed. It is not
certain what were the precise tenets, that were attempted to be disseminated
among them. There seems to have been a strange blending of the doctrines of the
Essenes with the subtleties of Platonism, and the asceticism of Oriental
Philosophy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The general scope of the Epistle is briefly stated by
<i>Davenant</i> as follows &#8212; that the hope of man&#8217;s salvation is
placed entirely in Christ alone, and that consequently we must rest satisfied
with faith in Christ, and live according to the rule laid down in the Gospel, to
the rejection of Mosaic ceremonies and philosophical speculations. The attentive
reader of the New Testament cannot fail to observe a striking similarity between
the Epistle to the Colossians and that addressed to the Ephesians, not merely in
their general structure, but also in the subjects treated of, and even in the
order and connection in which they are introduced &#8212; a closeness of
resemblance which clearly indicates, not merely that the Epistles were written
by the same person, and about the same time, but also that the Churches to whom
they were addressed, were in many respects similarly situated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Among the expository treatises on the Epistle to the
Colossians, there is, apart from that of Calvin, no one that better deserves, or
will more amply repay attentive perusal, that that of <i>Bishop Davenant</i>, as
a sound, judicious, and eminently practical exposition of a portion of the New
Testament, in which the distinctive doctrines and principles of Christianity are
so largely brought into view. It deserves also to be mentioned in connection
with this, that <i>Mr. Howe</i>, in his funeral sermon on the death of his
intimate friend, the Revelation Richard Adams of Oxford, afterwards of London,
speaks with high commendation of his &#8220;judicious and dilucid expositions of
the Epistles to the Philippians and the Colossians &#8212; which was the part he
bore in the supplement to that useful work &#8212; the English Annotations on
the Bible, by the <i>Revelation Mr. Matthew Pool</i>.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa10</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE FIRST EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS is generally
believed to have been the first Epistle written by PAUL to any of the Churches
of Christ. It appears to have been written towards the close of A.D. 52, about
two years subsequently to the introduction of the Gospel into Thessalonica by
the instrumentality of Paul and Silas. Thessalonica was a large and populous
city, situated on the Thermean Bay. The city was originally called Therm&aelig;,
but came to receive the name of Thessalonica from Philip, King of Macedon, by
whom it was rebuilt and enlarged, in memory of the <i>victory</i> which he there
gained over the <i>Thessalians</i>. Its present name is Saloniki &#8212;
manifestly a corruption of Thessalonica. It contains a population of 70,000, and
is a city of great commercial importance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the account which Luke gives of the introduction
of the Gospel into Thessalonica, mention is made of Paul&#8217;s entering into a
Synagogue of the Jews and &#8220;reasoning with them three Sabbath days out of
the
Scriptures.&#8221;(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
17:2.) This was the means of converting to the Christian faith some of his
Jewish hearers; but, as is manifest from Paul&#8217;s First Epistle to the
Thessalonians, the converts gained were chiefly from among the idolatrous
Gentiles. Thessalonica &#8220;adored many gods, but principally Jupiter, as the
father of Hercules, the alleged founder of its ancient royal family.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> A
violent tumult which had been raised against PAUL and SILAS by the unbelieving
Jews constrained them to quit Thessalonica on a sudden, and escape to Berea, and
afterwards to Athens; and the abrupt manner in which the Apostle&#8217;s labors
at Thessalonica were broken off, seems to have led him to feel the more
solicitous as to the prosperity of the Gospel in that city, and to have given
occasion for the Church of the Thessalonians being favored to receive the
earliest of PAUL&#8217;S Epistles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The First Epistle to the Thessalonians concludes with
a special direction that we do not find to be given in connection with any other
of Paul&#8217;s Epistles:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I charge you by
the Lord, that this Epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520527&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Thessalonians 5:27.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The strict charge thus given as to the public reading
of the Epistle is justly adduced by <i>Paley</i>, in his Hor&aelig;
Paulin&aelig;, as a most convincing evidence of the authenticity of the Epistle.
&#8220;Either the Epistle was publicly read in the Church of Thessalonica during
St. Paul&#8217;s lifetime, or it was not. If it was, no publication could be
more authentic, no species of notoriety more unquestionable, no method of
preserving the integrity of the copy more secure. If it was not, the clause we
produce would remain a standing condemnation of the forgery, and, one would
suppose, an invincible impediment to its success.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is an interesting circumstance, that the first
Epistle written by Paul to any Christian Church affords a most pleasing view of
the fruits of the Gospel among the Christians to whom it is addressed; while it
presents a most attractive picture of zeal and devotedness on the part of the
writer. &#8220;If I wished,&#8221;says <i>Fuller</i> of Kettering, &#8220;to be
impressed with a pattern of a Christian minister, I would study the second
chapter of this Epistle&#8221;(1st Thessalonians); &#8220;and if I wished to see
a pattern of a Christian people, I know not where I could look better than to
the Church of the Thessalonians.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
general design of the Epistle is to express the high satisfaction afforded to
the mind of the writer by the favorable accounts which had been brought him by
Timothy respecting the Christians at Thessalonica, as well as to encourage them
to stedfast adherence to the truth amidst more than ordinary temptations to
apostasy. &#8220;Imagine,&#8221;says <i>Benson</i>, in his Preface to the
Epistle, &#8220;the Great Apostle of the Gentiles to be full of a just
resentment and generous indignation against his countrymen, the unbelieving
Jews, who had lately treated him and them so maliciously; and at the same time
having the most tender and parental care and affection for the young converts at
Thessalonica, and you will have the very posture of his mind during the writing
of this Epistle, for these two things appear everywhere throughout the
Epistle.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE SECOND EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS appears to
have been written a short time after PAUL&#8217;S former Epistle to that Church.
The Apostle had learned, that some expressions in his former Epistle in
reference to the hopes of Christians beyond the grave had been misapprehended by
the Thessalonian converts, as though he had intended to intimate that
Christ&#8217;s second advent was near at hand. In correcting this mistaken idea,
he takes occasion to predict a great apostasy that was to overspread to a large
extent the Christian Church, and when we consider how directly opposed
&#8220;The Mystery Of
Iniquity&#8221;(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;530207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 2:7) here predicted is to the nature of Christianity, and how
unlikely the breaking out of such a system of error must have appeared at the
time when the prediction was given forth, this portion of the Apostolical
Writings must be regarded as affording unequivocal evidence of their Divine
authority. It is not a little remarkable that the Apostle Paul, in one of the
earliest of his Epistles, and when writing to a Church that was in a most
flourishing condition, foretells with the utmost distinctness and minuteness,
the rise and progress of a system of delusive error, which was not to be fully
developed until several centuries subsequently to the time when the prediction
was committed to writing; while it manifests itself even at the present day so
strikingly in accordance with Paul&#8217;s prediction, that no historian of
recent times could have furnished a more accurate delineation of the appalling
system in all its leading features, than was thus presented to the mind of Paul
eighteen hundred years ago by the Spirit of Inspiration. This the Second Epistle
to the Thessalonians, while it is the shortest of Paul&#8217;s Epistles to the
Churches, is invested with more than ordinary interest, as predicting the rise,
progress, and final destinies of the Papal system.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;The Epistle naturally divides itself,&#8221;as
is remarked by <i>Dr. Adam Clarke</i>, &#8220;into three parts, and each is
contained in a separate chapter:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>&#8220;Part I., Chapter
1,</b></font><font face="Palatino"> contains the Address, and Motives of
Consolation in their afflicted and persecuted state.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>&#8220;Part II., Chapter
2,</b></font><font face="Palatino"> is partly Prophetical, and partly Didactic.
It contains the doctrine concerning Christ&#8217;s Coming to Judgment, and a
Prophecy concerning some future but great Apostasy from the Christian
Faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>&#8220;Part III., Chapter
3.,</b></font><font face="Palatino"> is wholly Hortatory, and contains a number
of important Advices relative to Christian Virtues and a proper behavior in
those situations in life in which it had pleased God to call
them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Reader will find prefixed to the present
translation of Calvin&#8217;s Commentary on the COLOSSIANS, a copy of the
Translator&#8217;s &#8220;Epistle Dedicatorie &#8220;to the old English
translation of Calvin&#8217;s Commentary on that Epistle, published in black
letter in 1581. The Translator, who gives merely his initials, (R.V.,) appears
to have been Robert Vahne, or Vaughan, who published also in 1581 a translation
of Calvin&#8217;s Commentary on the Galatians. The title-page is as follows:

<div><font face="Palatino">Maturinus Corderius, (<i>Mathurin Cordier</i>,) to
whom CALVIN dedicates his Commentary on the First Epistle to the Thessalonians,
was, as stated by <i>Beza</i>, in his Life of Calvin, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa13</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;a man of great worth and erudition, and in the highest repute in almost
all the schools of France as a teacher of youth.&#8221;He taught at Paris,
Nevers, Bordeaux, Neufchatel, Lausanne, and Geneva. He was the author of the
&#8220;Colloquies,&#8221;so much used in the education of youth throughout
Europe. CALVIN was his pupil at the <i>College de la Marche</i>. He died at
Geneva, where he taught till within a few days of his death, in 1564, at the age
of eighty-five.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Benedict Textor, to whom CALVIN dedicates his
Commentary on the <i>Second</i> Epistle to the Thessalonians, appears to have
been the son or nephew of Jean Tixier de Ravisi, or Ravisius Textor (Lord of
Ravisi,) who was Rector of the University of Navarre at Paris, and was the
author of various works. He died in 1524. There is a small volume still extant
containing &#8220;Epistles&#8221;(to the number of 149,) which appears to have
been written by a relative of Benedict Textor. It bears date 1602, and is
entitled &#8220;Epistol&aelig; Joannis Ravisii Textoris (Nivernensis) &#8212;

<div><font face="Palatino">While The Commentaries of Calvin everywhere abound
with important statements in reference to Popery, so that the reader will find
able and successful refutations of the errors of that corrupt and delusive
system brought forward in connection with the interpretation of passages of the
Word of God, which might have seemed to have no particular bearing on the Papal
system, and introduced by him for the most part with less abruptness than is to
be observed in the writings of some of his contemporaries, the present Volume of
his Commentaries is rendered the more interesting, and will, we trust, under the
Divine blessing, be productive of the greater utility, in the present eventful
times, from its containing Calvin&#8217;s exposition of a portion of THE NEW
TESTAMENT that presents the minutest and most comprehensive view that is to be
found in any part of the Sacred Writings, of the rise, progress, and ultimate
overthrow of Antichrist.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>ON</b></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE EPISTLE OF
PAUL TO THE PHILIPPIANS</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is generally know that PHILIPPI was a city of
Macedonia, situated on the confines of Thrace, on the plains of which
<i>Pompey</i> was conquered by <i>Caesar;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa14</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  and<i>
Brutus </i>and<i> Cassius</i> were afterwards conquered by <i>Antony</i> and
<i>Octavius</i>. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa15</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Thus
Roman insurrections rendered this place illustrious by two memorable
engagements. When PAUL was called into Macedonia by an express revelation, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
first founded a Church in that city, (as is related by LUKE in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
16:12,) which did not merely persevere steadfastly in the faith, but was also,
in process of time, as this Epistle bears evidence, enlarged both in the number
of individuals, and in their proficiency in respect of
attainments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The occasion of Paul&#8217;s writing to the
Philippians was this, &#8212; As they had sent to him by Epaphroditus , their
pastor, such things as were needed by him when in prison, for sustaining life,
and for other more than ordinary expenses, there can be no doubt that
Epaphroditus explained to him at the same time the entire condition of the
Church, and acted the part of an adviser in suggesting those things, respecting
which they required to be admonished. It appears, however, that attempts had
been made upon them by false apostles, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who
wandered hither and thither, with the view of spreading corruptions of sound
doctrine; but as they had remained steadfast in the truth, the Apostle commends
their steadfastness. Keeping, however, in mind human frailty, and having,
perhaps, been instructed by Epaphroditus that they required to be seasonably
confirmed, lest they should in process of time fall away, he subjoins such
admonitions as he knew to be suitable to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And having, first of all, with the view of securing
their confidence, declared the pious attachment of his mind towards them, he
proceeds to treat of himself and of his bonds, lest they should feel dismayed on
seeing him a prisoner, and in danger of his life. He shews them, accordingly,
that the glory of the gospel is so far from being lessened by this means, that
it is rather an argument in confirmation of its truth, and he at the same time
stirs them up by his own example to be prepared for every event. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He at
length concludes the <i>First Chapter</i> with a short exhortation to unity and
patience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, ambition is almost invariably the mother
of dissensions, and comes, on this account, to open a door for new and strange
doctrines, he, in the commencement of the <i>Second Chapter</i>, entreats them,
with great earnestness, to hold nothing more highly in esteem than humility and
modesty. With this view he makes use of various arguments. And that he may the
better retain them, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
promises to send Timothy to them shortly, nay more, he expresses a hope of being
able to visit them himself. He afterwards assigns a reason for delay on the part
of Epaphroditus.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa20</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>Third Chapter</i> he inveighs against the
false apostles, and sets aside both their empty boastings and the doctrine of
circumcision, which they eagerly maintained. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> To all
their contrivances he opposes the simple doctrine of Christ. To their arrogance 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
opposes his former life and present course of conduct, in which a true image of
Christian piety shone forth. He shews, also, that the summit of perfection, at
which we must aim during our whole life, is this &#8212; to have fellowship with
Christ in his death and resurrection; and this he establishes by his own
example.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He begins the <i>Fourth Chapter</i> with particular
admonitions, but proceeds afterwards to those of a general nature. He concludes
the Epistle with a declaration of his gratitude to the PHILIPPIANS, that they
may not think that what they had laid out for relieving his necessities had been
ill bestowed.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Paul and Timotheus, servants of
Jesus Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> While Paul is accustomed,
in the inscription of his epistles, to employ titles of distinction, with the
view of procuring credit for himself and his ministry, there was no need of
lengthened commendations in writing to the Philippians, who had known him by
experience as a true Apostle of Christ, and still acknowledged him as such
beyond all controversy. For they had persevered in the calling of God
steadfastly, and in an even tenor. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa24</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bishops</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
He names the <i>pastors</i> separately, for the sake of honor. We may, however,
infer from this, that the name of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bishop</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is common to all the ministers of the Word, inasmuch as he assigns several
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bishops</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to one Church. The titles, therefore, of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bishop</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and <i>pastor</i>, are synonymous. And this is one of the passages which Jerome
quotes for proving this in his epistle to Evagrius, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and in
his exposition of the Epistle to Titus. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa26</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Afterwards 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> there
crept in the custom of applying the name of <i>bishop</i> exclusively to the
person whom the presbyters in each church appointed over their company. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa28</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It
originated, however, in a human custom, and rests on no Scripture authority. I
acknowledge, indeed, that, as the minds and manners of men are, there cannot be
order maintained among the ministers of the word, without one presiding over the
others. I speak of particular bodies, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa29</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> not of
whole provinces, much less of the whole world. Now, although we must not contend
for words, it were at the same time better for us in speaking to follow the Holy
Spirit, the author of tongues, than to change for the worse forms of speech
which are dictated to us by Him. For from the corrupted signification of the
word this evil has resulted, that, as if all the presbyters 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> were
not colleagues, called to the same office, one of them, under the pretext of a
new appellation, usurped dominion over the others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Deacons</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
This term may be taken in two ways &#8212; either as meaning administrators, and
curators of the poor, or for elders, who were appointed for the regulation of
morals. As, however, it is more generally made use of by Paul in the former
sense, I understand it rather as meaning stewards, who superintended the
distributing and receiving of alms. On the other points consult the preceding
commentaries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I give
thanks</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He begins with thanksgiving 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> on two
accounts &#8212; <i>first</i>, that he may by this token shew his love to the
Philippians; and secondly, that, by commending them as to the past, he may
exhort them, also, to perseverance in time to come. He adduces, also, another
evidence of his love &#8212; the anxiety which he exercised in supplications. It
is to be observed, however, that, whenever he makes mention of things that are
joyful, he immediately breaks forth into thanksgiving &#8212; a practice with
which we ought also to be familiar. We must, also, take notice, what things they
are for which he gives thanks to God, &#8212; the fellowship of the Philippians
in the gospel of Christ; for it follows from this, that it ought to be ascribed
to the grace of God. When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon every remembrance of
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means, &#8220;As often as I remember
you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Always in every
prayer</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Connect the words in this manner:
&#8220;<i>Always presenting prayer for you all in every prayer of
mine.</i>&#8221;For as he had said before, that the remembrance of them was an
occasion of joy to him, so he now subjoins, that they come into his mind as
often as he prays. He afterwards adds, that it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with joy
</i></font><font face="Palatino">that he presents prayer in their behalf.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Joy</i></font><font face="Palatino">
refers to the past;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prayer</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to the future. For he rejoiced in their auspicious beginnings, and was desirous
of their perfection. Thus it becomes us always to rejoice in the blessings
received from God in such a manner, as to remember to ask from him those things
that we are still in need of.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For your
fellowship</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now, passing over the other
clause, states the ground of his joy &#8212; that they had come into the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fellowship of the
gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, had become partakers of the
gospel, which, as is well known, is accomplished by means of faith; for the
gospel appears as nothing to us, in respect of any enjoyment of it, until we
have received it by faith. At the same time the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fellowship</i></font><font face="Palatino">
may be viewed as referring to the common society of the saints, as though he had
said that they had been associated with all the children of God in the faith of
the gospel. When he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
the first day</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he commends their promptitude in
having shewn themselves teachable immediately upon the doctrine being set before
them. The phrase <i>until now</i> denotes their perseverance. Now we know how
rare an excellence it is, to follow God immediately upon his calling us, and
also to persevere steadfastly unto the end. For many are slow and backward to
obey, while there are still more that fall short through fickleness and
inconstancy.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa32</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Persuaded of this very
thing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> An additional ground of joy is furnished
in his confidence in them for the time to come. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
some one will say, why should men dare to assure themselves for to-morrow amidst
so great an infirmity of nature, amidst so many impediments, ruggednesses, and
precipices? 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Paul,
assuredly, did not derive this confidence from the steadfastness or excellence
of men, but simply from the fact, that God had manifested his love to the
Philippians. And undoubtedly this is the true manner of acknowledging
God&#8217;s benefits &#8212; when we derive from them occasion of hoping well as
to the future. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For as
they are tokens at once of his goodness, and of his fatherly benevolence towards
us, what ingratitude were it to derive from this no confirmation of hope and
good courage! In addition to this, God is not like men, so as to be wearied out
or exhausted by conferring kindness. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let,
therefore, believers exercise themselves in constant meditation upon the favors
which God confers, that they may encourage and confirm hope as to the time to
come, and always ponder in their mind this syllogism: God does not forsake the
work which his own hands have begun, as the Prophet bears witness,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
138:8;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
64:8;) we are the work of his hands; therefore he will complete what he has
begun in us. When I say that we are the work of his hands, I do not refer to
mere creation, but to the calling by which we are adopted into the number of his
sons. For it is a token to us of our election, that the Lord has called us
effectually to himself by his Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is asked, however, whether any one can be certain
as to the salvation of others, for Paul here is not speaking of himself but of
the Philippians. I answer, that the assurance which an individual has respecting
his own salvation, is very different from what he has as to that of another. For
the Spirit of God is a witness to me of my calling, as he is to each of the
elect. As to others, we have no testimony, except from the outward efficacy of
the Spirit; that is, in so far as the grace of God shews itself in them, so that
we come to know it. There is, therefore, a great difference, because the
assurance of faith remains inwardly shut up, and does not extend itself to
others. But wherever we see any such tokens of Divine election as can be
perceived by us, we ought immediately to be stirred up to entertain good hope,
both in order that we may not be envious 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> towards
our neighbors, and withhold from them an equitable and kind judgment of charity;
and also, that we may be grateful to God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa38</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This,
however, is a general rule both as to ourselves and as to others &#8212; that,
distrusting our own strength, we depend entirely upon God
alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Until the day of Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The chief thing, indeed, to be
understood here is &#8212; until the termination of the conflict. Now the
conflict is terminated by death. As, however, the Spirit is accustomed to speak
in this manner in reference to the last coming of Christ, it were better to
extend the advancement of the grace of Christ to the resurrection of the flesh.
For although those who have been freed from the mortal body do no longer contend
with the lusts of the flesh, and are, as the expression is, beyond the reach of
a single dart, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> yet
there will be no absurdity in speaking of them as in the way of advancement, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa40</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
inasmuch as they have not yet reached the point at which they aspire, &#8212;
they do not yet enjoy the felicity and glory which they have hoped for; and in
fine, the day has not yet shone which is to discover the treasures which lie hid
in hope. And in truth, when hope is treated of, our eyes must always be directed

valuators of the gifts of God if we do not reckon as children of God those in
whom there shine forth those true tokens of piety, which are the marks by which
the Spirit of adoption manifests himself. Paul accordingly says, that equity
itself dictates to him, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that he
should hope well of the Philippians in all time to come, inasmuch as he sees
them to be associated with himself in participation of grace. It is not without
due consideration that I have given a different rendering of this passage from
that of Erasmus, as the judicious reader will easily perceive. For he states
what opinion he has of the Philippians, which was the ground of his hoping well
respecting them. He says, then, that they are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>partakers with him of the same
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino"> in his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bonds</i></font><font face="Palatino">,

<div><font face="Palatino">To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have them in his
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is to reckon them as such in the inmost
affection of his heart. For the Philippians had always assisted Paul according
to their ability, so as to connect themselves with him as associates for
maintaining the cause of the gospel, so far as was in their power. Thus,
although they were absent in body, yet, on account of the pious disposition
which they shewed by every service in their power, he recognises them as in
bonds along with him. &#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
have you</i></font><font face="Palatino">, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in my

grace</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; in what?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in my

acknowledged them to be such, it was reasonable that he should hope well
respecting them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of my grace and in the
bonds.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It were a ludicrous thing in the view of
the world to reckon a prison to be a benefit from God, but if we estimate the
matter aright, it is no common honor that God confers upon us, when we suffer
persecution for the sake of his truth. For it was not in vain that it was
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Blessed shall ye be, when
men shall afflict and harass you with all kinds of reproaches for my

5:11)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us therefore bear in remembrance also, that we
must with readiness and alacrity embrace the fellowship of the cross of Christ
as a special favor from God. In addition to

he subjoins the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>defense and
confirmation of the gospel,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that he may express
so much the better the honourableness of the service which God has enjoined upon
us in placing us in opposition to his enemies, so as to bear testimony to his
gospel. For it is as though he had entrusted us with the defense of his gospel.
And truly it was when armed with this consideration, that the martyrs were
prepared to contemn all the rage of the wicked, and to rise superior to every
kind of torture. And would that this were present to the mind of all that are
called to make a confession of their faith, that they have been chosen by Christ
to be as advocates to plead his cause! For were they sustained by such
consolation they would be more courageous than to be so easily turned aside into
a perfidious revolt. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa44</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, however, some one will inquire, whether the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>confirmation of the
gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino"> depends on the steadfastness of men. I
answer, that the truth of God is in itself too firm to require that it should
have support from any other quarter; for though we should all of us be found
liars, God, nevertheless, remains true.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:4.) There is, however, no absurdity in saying, that weak consciences are
confirmed in it by such helps. That kind of confirmation, therefore, of which
Paul makes mention, has a relation to men, as we learn from our own experience
that the slaughter of so many martyrs has been attended at least with this
advantage, that they have been as it were so many seals, by which the gospel has
been sealed in our hearts. Hence that saying of Tertullian, that &#8220;the
blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church,&#8221;&#8212; which I have
imitated in a certain poem: &#8220;But that sacred blood, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the
maintainer of God&#8217;s honor, will be like seed for producing

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For God is my

affection for them, and, with the view of giving proof of it, he makes use of an
oath, and that on good grounds, because we know how dear in the sight of God is
the edification of his Church. It was, too, more especially of advantage, that
Paul&#8217;s affection should be thoroughly made known to the Philippians. For
it tends in no small degree to secure credit for the doctrine, when the people
are persuaded that they are beloved by the teacher. He calls God as a witness to
the truth, inasmuch as he alone is the Truth, and as a witness of his affection,
inasmuch as he alone is the searcher of hearts. In the word rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>long
after</i></font><font face="Palatino">, a particular term is made use of instead
of a general, and it is a token of affection, inasmuch as we
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>long

us.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowels of

intimate that his affection is holy and pious. For the man that loves according
to the flesh has respect to his own advantage, and may from time to time change
his mind according to the variety of circumstances and seasons. In the meantime
he instructs us by what rule the affections of believers ought to be regulated,
so that, renouncing their own will, they may allow Christ to sit at the helm.
And, unquestionably, true love can flow from no other source than from the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowels of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and this, like a goad, ought to affect
us not a little &#8212; that Christ in a manner opens his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowels</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
that by them he may cherish mutual affection between us.

had simply touched upon in one word in passing. He states, accordingly, the sum
of those things which he asked from God in their behalf, that they also may
learn to pray after his example, and may aspire at proficiency in those gifts.
The view taken by some, as though the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love of the
Philippians</i></font><font face="Palatino"> denoted the Philippians themselves,
as illiterate persons are accustomed very commonly to say, &#8220;Your
reverence,&#8221;&#8212; &#8220;Your paternity,&#8221;is absurd. For no instance
of such an expression occurs in the writings of Paul, nor had such fooleries
come into use. Besides, the statement would be less complete, and, independently
of this, the simple and natural meaning of the words suits admirably well. For
the true attainments of Christians are when they make progress in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>understanding</i></font><font face="Palatino">,

Accordingly the particle
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
according to the idiom of the Hebrew tongue, is taken here to mean
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
as I have also rendered it, unless perhaps one should prefer to explain it as
meaning <i>by</i>, so as to denote the instrument or formal cause. For, the
greater proficiency we make in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
so much the more ought our <i>love</i> to increase. The meaning in that case
would be, &#8220;That your love may increase according to the measure of

Christian wisdom &#8212; to know what is advantageous or expedient &#8212; not
to torture the mind with empty subtleties and speculations. For the Lord does
not wish that his believing people should employ themselves fruitlessly in
learning what is of no profit: From this you may gather in what estimation the
Sorbonnic theology ought to be held, in which you may spend your whole life, and
yet not derive more of edification from it in connection with the hope of a
heavenly life, or more of spiritual advantage, than from the demonstrations of
Euclid. Unquestionably, although it taught nothing false, it well deserves to be
execrable, on the ground that it is a pernicious profanation of spiritual
doctrine. For <i>Scripture is useful</i>, as Paul says, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 3:16, but <i>there</i> you will find nothing but cold subtleties of

he had desired that they should be pure and upright in the sight of God, so he
now desires that they should lead an honorable life in the sight of men, that
they may not injure their neighbors by any evil examples. This exposition I do
not reject: the <i>passive</i> signification, however, is better suited to the
context, in my opinion. For he desires wisdom for them, with this view &#8212;
that they may with unwavering step go forward in their calling until the <i>day
of Christ</i>, as on the other hand it happens through ignorance, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa49</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that we
frequently slip our foot, stumble, and turn aside. And how many stumbling blocks
Satan from time to time throws in our way, with the view of either stopping our
course altogether, or impeding it, every one of us knows from his own
experience.</font><br></div>

life, for a good conscience produces its fruits by means of works. Hence he
desires that they may be fruitful in good works for the glory of God. Such
fruits, he says, are by Christ, because they flow from the grace of Christ. For
the beginning of our well-doing is, when we are sanctified by his Spirit, for he
rested upon him, that we might all receive of his fullness.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:16.) And as Paul here derives a similitude from trees, we are <i>wild
olive-trees,</i>
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451124&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:24,) and unproductive, until we are ingrafted into Christ, who by his living
root makes us fruitbearing trees, in accordance with that saying,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
15:1,) <i>I am the vine, ye are the branches.</i> He at the same time shews the
end &#8212; that we may promote the glory of God. For no life is so excellent in
appearance as not to be corrupted and become offensive in the view of God, if it
is not directed towards this object.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul&#8217;s speaking here of works under the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
is not at all inconsistent with the gratuitous righteousness of faith. For it
does not immediately follow that there is righteousness wherever there are the
fruits of righteousness, inasmuch as there is no righteousness in the sight of
God, unless there be a full and complete obedience to the law, which is not
found in any one of the saints, though, nevertheless, they bring forth,
according to the measure, the good and pleasant 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> fruits
of righteousness, and for this reason, that, as God begins righteousness in us,
through the regeneration of the Spirit, so what is wanting is amply supplied
through the remission of sins, in such a way that all righteousness,
nevertheless, depends upon faith.</font><br></div>

experience, how much the flesh is wont to be offended by the abasement of the
cross. We allow, indeed, Christ crucified to be preached to us; but when he
appears in connection with his cross, then, as though we were thunderstruck at
the novelty of it, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa51</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> we
either avoid him or hold him in abhorrence, and that not merely in our own
persons, but also in the persons of those who deliver to us the gospel. It may
have happened to the Philippians, that they were in some degree discouraged in
consequence of the persecution of their Apostle. We may also very readily
believe, that those bad workmen 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa52</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who
eagerly watched every occasion, however small, of doing injury, did not refrain
from triumphing over the calamity of this holy man, and by this means making his
gospel contemptible. If, however, they were not successful in this attempt, they
might very readily calumniate him by representing him as hated by the whole
world; and at the same time leading the Philippians to dread, lest, by an
unfortunate association with him, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they
should needlessly incur great dislike among all; for such are the usual
artifices of Satan. The Apostle provides against this danger, when he states
that the gospel had been promoted by means of his bonds. The design,
accordingly, of this detail is, to encourage the Philippians, that they may not
feel deterred

praetor,

consequently, became customary to employ the term <i>praetorium</i> in war to
mean the tent, either of the consul, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or of
the person who <i>presided</i>, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa61</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> while
in the city it denoted the palace of Caesar, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa62</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> from
the time that the Cesars took possession of the monarchy. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa63</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Independently of this, the bench of praetor is also called the
<i>praetorium</i>.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa64</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Many of the
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this instance we are taught that
the tortures of the saints, endured by them in behalf of the gospel, are a
ground of confidence 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa65</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to us.
It were indeed a dreadful spectacle, and such as might tend rather to dishearten
us, did we see nothing but the cruelty and rage of the persecutors. When,
however, we see at the same time the hand of the Lord, which makes his people
unconquerable, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> under
the infirmity of the Cross, and causes them to triumph, relying upon this, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa67</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> we
ought to venture farther than we had been accustomed, having now a pledge of our
victory in the persons of our brethren. The knowledge of this ought to overcome
our fears, that we may speak boldly in the midst of dangers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Some
indeed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here is another fruit of Paul&#8217;s
bonds, that not only were the brethren stirred up to confidence by his example
&#8212; some by maintaining their position, others by becoming more eager to
teach &#8212; but even those who wished him evil were on another account stirred
up to publish the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Some, I say, from
contention</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here we have a lengthened detail,
in which he explains more fully the foregoing statement; for he repeats that
there are two classes of men that are stirred up by his bonds to preach Christ
&#8212; the one influenced by contention, that is, by depraved affection &#8212;
the other by pious zeal, as being desirous to maintain along with him the
defense of the gospel. The former, he says, do not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>preach Christ
purely</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because it was not a right zeal. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa68</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For the
term does not apply to doctrine, because it is possible that the man who teaches
most purely, may, nevertheless, not be of a sincere mind. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa69</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now,
that this impurity was in the mind, and did not shew itself in doctrine, may be
inferred from the context. Paul assuredly would have felt no pleasure in seeing
the gospel corrupted; yet he declares that he rejoices in the preaching of those
persons, while it was not simple or sincere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is asked, however, how such preaching could be
injurious to him? I answer, that many occasions are unknown to us, inasmuch as
we are not acquainted with the circumstances of the times. It is asked farther,
&#8220;Since the gospel cannot be preached but by those that understand it, what
motive induced those persons to persecute the doctrine of which they
approved?&#8221;I answer, that ambition is blind, nay, it is a furious beast.
Hence it is not to be wondered if false brethren snatch a weapon from the gospel
for harassing good and pious pastors. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa71</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Paul,
assuredly, says nothing here 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa70</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of
which I have not myself had experience. For there are living at this very day
those who have preached the gospel with no other design, than that they might
gratify the rage of the wicked by persecuting pious pastors. As to Paul&#8217;s
enemies, it is of importance to observe, if they were Jews, how mad their hatred
was, so as even to forget on what account they hated him. For while they made it
their aim to destroy him, they exerted themselves to promote the gospel, on
account of which they were hostile to him; but they imagined, no doubt, that the
cause of Christ would stand or fall 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa72</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in the
person of one individual. If, however, there were envious persons, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa73</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who
were thus hurried away by ambition, we ought to acknowledge the wonderful
goodness of God, who, notwithstanding, gave such a prosperous issue to their
depraved affections.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That for the
defense</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Those who truly loved Christ reckoned
that it would be a disgrace to them if they did not associate themselves with
Paul as his companions, when maintaining the cause of the gospel; and we must
act in such a manner, as to give a helping hand, as far as possible, to the
servants of Christ when in difficulty. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa74</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Observe, again, this expression &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the defense of the

so great an honor, what excuse shall we have, if we shall be traitors to his

he has spoken might detract from the acceptableness of the doctrine, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa77</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he says
that this ought to be reckoned of great importance, that they nevertheless
promoted the cause of the gospel, whatever their disposition might be. For God
sometimes accomplishes an admirable work by means of wicked and depraved
instruments. Accordingly, he says that he rejoices in a happy result of this
nature; because this one thing contented him &#8212; if he saw the kingdom of
Christ increasing &#8212; just as we, on hearing that that impure dog Carolus 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa78</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was
scattering the seeds of pure doctrine at Avignon and elsewhere, we gave thanks
to God because he had made use of that most profligate and worthless villain for
his glory: and at this day we rejoice that the progress of the gospel is
advanced by many who, nevertheless, had another design in view. But though Paul
rejoiced in the advancement of the gospel, yet, had the matter been in his hand,
he would never have ordained such persons as ministers. We ought, therefore, to
rejoice if God accomplishes anything that is good by means of wicked persons;
but they ought not on that account to be either placed by us in the ministry, or
looked upon as Christ&#8217;s lawful ministers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I know
that</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> As some published the gospel with
the view of rendering Paul odious, in order that they might kindle up against
him the more the rage of his enemies, he tells them beforehand that their wicked
attempts will do him no harm, because the Lord will turn them to a contrary
design. &#8220;Though they plot my destruction, yet I trust that all their
attempts will have no other effect but that Christ will be glorified in me
&#8212; which is a thing most salutary to me.&#8221; For it is evident from what
follows, that he is not speaking of the safety of the body. But whence this
confidence on the part of Paul? It is from what he teaches elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450828&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:28,) &#8212; that all things contribute to the advantage of God&#8217;s true

conspire together for their ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Through your
prayer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> That he may stir them up to pray
more ardently, he declares that he is confident that the Lord will give them an
answer to their prayers. Nor does he use dissimulation: for he who depends for
help on the prayers of the saints relies on the promise of God. In the mean
time, nothing is detracted from the unmerited goodness of God, on which depend
our prayers, and what is obtained by means of them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
supply</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Let us not suppose, that because he
joins these two things in one connection, they are consequently alike. The
statement must, therefore, be explained in this manner: &#8212; &#8220;I know
that all this will turn out to my advantage, through the administration of the
Spirit, you also helping by prayer,&#8221;&#8212; so that the supply of the
Spirit is the efficient cause, while prayer is a subordinate help. We must also
observe the propriety of the Greek term, for

is employed to mean the furnishing of what is wanting, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa79</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> just as

destitute.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls him, too, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit of Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, to intimate, that if we are Christians,
he is common to all of us, inasmuch as he was poured upon him with all fullness,
that, according to the measure of his grace, he might give out, so far as is
expedient, to each of his members.</font><br></div>

what do you derive that knowledge?&#8221;he answers, &#8220;From hope.&#8221;For
as it is certain that God does not by any means design to frustrate our hope,
hope itself ought not to be wavering. Let then the pious reader carefully
observe this adverb <i>secundum</i>,
(</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according
to</i></font><font face="Palatino">,) that he may be fully assured in his own
mind, that it is impossible but that the Lord will fulfill our expectation,
inasmuch as it is founded on his own word. Now, he has promised that he will
never be wanting to us even in the midst of all tortures, if we are at any time
called to make confession of his name. Let, therefore, all the pious entertain
hope after Paul&#8217;s example, and they will not be put to
shame.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With all
confidence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We see that, in cherishing
hope, he does not give indulgence to carnal desires, but places his hope in
subjection to the promise of God.

he, &#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will be magnified in
my body, whether by life or by

however, of the body, he intimates that, amongst the conflicts of the present
life, he is in no degree doubtful as to the issue, for we are assured as to this
by God. If, accordingly, giving ourselves up to the good pleasure of God, and
having in our life the same object in view as Paul had, we expect, in whatever
way it may be, a prosperous issue, we shall no longer have occasion to fear lest
any adversity should befall us; for if we live and die to him, we are his in
life and in death.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:8.) He expresses the way in which
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ will be
magnified</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; by full assurance. Hence it
follows, that through our fault he is cast down and lowered, so far as it is in
our power to do so, when we give way through fear. Do not those then feel
ashamed who reckon it a light offense to tremble, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa80</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> when

feel, who are so shamelessly impudent as to have the hardihood even to excuse
renunciation?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as

past experience of the grace of God. Thus, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For to me to
live</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Interpreters have hitherto, in my
opinion, given a wrong rendering and exposition to this passage; for they make
this distinction, that Christ was life to Paul, and death was gain. I, on the
other hand, make Christ the subject of discourse in both clauses, so that he is
declared to be gain in him both in life and in death; for it is customary with
the Greeks to leave the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pro&gt;v</font><font face="Palatino">
to be understood. Besides that this meaning is less forced, it also corresponds
better with the foregoing statement, and contains more complete doctrine. He
declares that it is indifferent to him, and is all one, whether he lives or
dies, because, having Christ, he reckons both to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gain</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
And assuredly it is Christ alone that makes us happy both in death and in life;
otherwise, if death is miserable, life is in no degree happier; so that it is
difficult to determine whether it is more advantageous to live or to die <i>out
of Christ</i>. On the other hand, let Christ be with us, and he will bless our
life as well as our death, so that both will be happy and desirable for
us.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if to live in the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As persons in despair feel in perplexity
as to whether they ought to prolong their life any farther in miseries, or to
terminate their troubles by death, so Paul, on the other hand, says that he is,
in a spirit of contentment, so well prepared for death or for life, because the
condition of believers, both in the one case and in the other, is blessed, so
that he is at a loss which to choose.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If it is worth
while</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> that is, &#8220;If I have reason
to believe that there will be greater advantage from my life than from my death,
I do not see which of them I ought to
prefer.&#8221;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To live in the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is an expression which he has made use
of in contempt, from comparing it with a better life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I am in a
strait</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Paul did not desire to live with
any other object in view that that of promoting the glory of Christ, and doing
good to the brethren. Hence he does not reckon that he has any other advantage
from living than the welfare of the brethren. But so far as concerns himself
personally, it were, he acknowledges, better for him to die soon, because he
would be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By his choice, however, he shews
what ardent love glowed in his breast. There is nothing said here as to earthly
advantages, but as to spiritual benefit, which is on good grounds supremely
desirable in the view of the pious. Paul, however, as if forgetful of himself,
does not merely hold himself undetermined, lest he should be swayed by a regard
to his own benefit rather than that of the Philippians, but at length concludes
that a regard to them preponderates in his mind. And assuredly this is in
reality to live and die to Christ, when, with indifference as to ourselves, we
allow ourselves to be carried and borne away withersoever Christ calls
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having a desire to be set free and
to be with Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> These two things must
be read in connection. For death of itself will never be desired, because such a
desire is at variance with natural feeling, but is desired for some particular
reason, or with a view to some other end. Persons in despair have recourse to it
from having become weary of life; believers, on the other hand, willingly hasten
forward to it, because it is a deliverance from the bondage of sin, and an
introduction into the kingdom of heaven. What Paul now says is this; &#8220;I
desire to die, because I will, by this means, come into immediate connection
with Christ.&#8221;In the mean time, believers do not cease to regard death with
horror, but when they turn their eyes to that life which follows death, they
easily overcome all dread by means of that consolation. Unquestionably, every
one that believes in Christ ought to be so courageous as to <i>lift up his
head</i> on mention being made of death, delighted to have intimation of his
<i>redemption</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
21:28.) From this we see how many are Christians only in name, since the greater
part, on hearing mention made of death, are not merely alarmed, but are rendered
almost lifeless through fear, as though they had never heard a single word
respecting Christ. O the worth and value of a good conscience! Now faith is the
foundation of a good conscience; nay more, it is itself goodness of
conscience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To be set
free</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This form of expression is to be
observed. Profane persons speak of death as the destruction of man, as if he
altogether perished. Paul here reminds us, that death is the separation of the
soul from the body. And this he expresses more fully immediately afterwards,
explaining as to what condition awaits believers after death &#8212; that of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dwelling with
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We are <i>with Christ</i> even
in this life, inasmuch as the <i>kingdom of God is within us</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421721&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
17:21,) and <i>Christ dwells in us by faith,</i>
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:17,) and has promised that he <i>will be with us even unto the end of the
world</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

said to be at present at a <i>distance</i> from him. See

Corinthians 5:6. This passage is of use for setting aside the mad fancy of those
who dream that souls sleep when separated from the body, for Paul openly

acknowledge himself to have been disappointed of his expectation, are of opinion
that he was afterwards freed from bonds, and went over many countries of the
world. Their fears, however, as to this are groundless, for the saints are
accustomed to regulate their expectations according to the word of God, so as
not to promise themselves more than God has promised. Thus, when they have a
sure token of God&#8217;s will, they in that case place their reliance also upon
a sure persuasion, which admits of no hesitation. Of this nature is a persuasion
respecting a perpetual remission of sins, respecting the aid of the Spirit for
the grace of final perseverance, (as it is called,) and respecting the
resurrection of the flesh. Of this nature, also, was the assurance of the
Prophets respecting their prophecies. As to other things, they expect nothing
except conditionally, and hence they subject all events to the providence of
God, who, they allow, sees more distinctly than they. To

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Only in a manner worthy of the
gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We make use of this form of expression,
when we are inclined to pass on to a new subject. Thus it is as though he had
said, &#8220;But as for me, the Lord will provide, but as for you, etc.,
whatever may take place as to me, let it be your care, nevertheless, to go
forward in the right course.&#8221;When he speaks of a pure and honorable
conversation as being worthy of the gospel, he intimates, on the other hand,
that those who live otherwise do injustice to the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That whether I
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> As the Greek phrase made use of by
Paul is elliptical, I have made use of <i>videam, (I see,)</i> instead of
<i>videns (seeing.)</i> If this does not appear satisfactory, you may supply the
principal verb <i>Intelligam, (I may learn,)</i> in this sense: &#8220;Whether,
when I shall come and see you, or whether I shall, when absent, hear respecting
your condition, I may learn in both ways, both by being present and by receiving
intelligence, that ye </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stand in
one spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>&#8221;We need not, however,
feel anxiety as to particular terms, when the meaning is
evident.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Stand in one
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This, certainly, is one of the
main excellences of the Church, and hence this is one means of preserving it in
a sound state, inasmuch as it is torn to pieces by dissensions. But although
Paul was desirous by means of this antidote to provide against novel and strange
doctrines, yet he requires a twofold unity &#8212; of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and <i>soul</i>. The <i>first</i> is, that we have like views; the
<i>second</i>, that we be united in heart. For when these two terms are
connected together, <i>spiritus (spirit)</i> denotes the <i>understanding</i>,
while <i>anima (soul)</i> denotes the <i>will</i>. Farther, agreement of views
comes first in order; and then from it springs union of
inclination.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Striving together for the
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This is the strongest bond of
concord, when we have to fight together under the same banner, for this has
often been the occasion of reconciling even the greatest enemies. Hence, in
order that he may confirm the more the unity that existed among the Philippians,
he calls them to notice that they are fellow-soldiers, who, having a common
enemy and a common warfare, ought to have their minds united together in a holy
agreement. The expression which Paul has made use of in the Greek
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sunaqlou~ntev th~|
pi&gt;stei</font><font face="Palatino">) is ambiguous. The old interpreter
renders it <i>Collaborantes fidei, (laboring together with the faith.)</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa83</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Erasmus renders it <i>Adiuvantes fidem, (Helping the faith,)</i> as if
meaning, that they gave <i>help</i> to the <i>faith</i> to the utmost of their
power. As, however, the dative in Greek is made use of instead of the ablative
of instrumentality, (that language having no ablative,) I have no doubt that the
Apostle&#8217;s meaning is this: &#8220;Let the faith of the gospel unite you
together, more especially as that is a common armory against one and the same
enemy.&#8221;In this way the particle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">su&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
which others refer to <i>faith</i>, I take as referring to the Philippians, and
with greater propriety, if I am not mistaken. In the first place, every one is
aware how effectual an inducement it is to concord, when we have to maintain a
conflict together; and farther, we know that in the spiritual warfare we are
armed with the <i>shield of faith</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:16,) for repelling the enemy; nay, more, faith is both our panoply and our
victory. Hence he added this clause, that he might shew what is the end of a
pious connection. The wicked, too, conspire together for evil, but their
agreement is accursed: let us, therefore, contend with one mind under the banner
of faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And in nothing
terrified</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The second thing which he recommends
to the Philippians is fortitude of mind, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa84</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
they may not be thrown into confusion by the rage of their adversaries. At that
time the most cruel persecutions raged almost everywhere, because Satan strove
with all his might to impede the commencement of the gospel, and was the more
enraged in proportion as Christ put forth powerfully the grace of his Spirit. He
exhorts, therefore, the Philippians to stand forward undaunted, and not be
thrown into alarm.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which is to them a manifest
proof</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is the proper meaning of the Greek
word, and there was no consideration that made it necessary for others to render
it <i>cause.</i> For the wicked, when they wage war against the Lord, do already
by a trial-fight, as it were, give a token of their ruin, and the more fiercely
they insult over the pious, the more do they prepare themselves for ruin. The
Scripture, assuredly, nowhere teaches, that the afflictions which the saints
endure from the wicked are the <i>cause</i> of their salvation, but Paul in
another instance, too, speaks of them as a <i>manifest token</i> or
<i>proof</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;530105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 1:5,) and instead of
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e]ndeixin</font><font face="Palatino">,
which we have here, he in that passage makes use of the term
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e]ndeigma</font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This,
therefore, is a choice consolation, that when we are assailed and harassed by
our enemies, we have an evidence of our salvation. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa86</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
persecutions are in a manner seals of adoption to the children of God, if they
endure them with fortitude and patience: the wicked give a token of their
condemnation, because they stumble against a stone by which they shall be
bruised to pieces.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402144&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
21:44.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that from
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is restricted to the last clause,
that a taste of the grace of God may allay the bitterness of the cross. No one
will naturally perceive the cross a token or evidence of salvation, for they are
things that are contrary in appearance. Hence Paul calls the attention of the
Philippians to another consideration &#8212; that God by his blessing turns into
an occasion of welfare things that might otherwise seem to render us miserable.
He proves it from this, that the endurance of the cross is the gift of God. Now
it is certain, that all the gifts of God are salutary to us.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">, says
he,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> it is given, not only to
believe in Christ, but also to suffer for
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Hence even the sufferings
themselves are evidences of the grace of God; and, since it is so, you have from
this source a token of salvation. Oh, if this persuasion were effectually
inwrought in our minds &#8212; that persecutions 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa87</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are to
be reckoned among God&#8217;s benefits, what progress would be made in the
doctrine of piety! 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
yet, what is more certain, than that it is the highest honor that is conferred
upon us by Divine grace, that we suffer for his name either reproach, or
imprisonment, or miseries, or tortures, or even death, for in that case he
adorns us with his markes of distinction. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
more will be found that will rather bid God retire with gifts of that nature,
than embrace with alacrity the cross when it is presented to them. Alas, then,
for our stupidity! 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa90</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
believe</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He wisely conjoins faith with the
cross by an inseparable connection, that the Philippians may know that they have
been called to the faith of Christ on this condition &#8212; that they endure
persecutions on his account, as though he had said that their adoption can no
more be separated from the cross, than Christ can be torn asunder from himself.
Here Paul clearly testifies, that faith, as well as constancy in enduring
persecutions, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is an
unmerited gift of God. And certainly the knowledge of God is a wisdom that is
too high for our attaining it by our own acuteness, and our weakness shews
itself in daily instances in our own experience, when God withdraws his hand for
a little while. That he may intimate the more distinctly that both are
unmerited, he says expressly &#8212; for Christ&#8217;s sake, or at least that
they are given to us on the ground of Christ&#8217;s grace; by which he excludes
every idea of merit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage is also at variance with the doctrine of
the schoolmen, in maintaining that gifts of grace latterly conferred are rewards
of our merit, on the ground of our having made a right use of those which had
been previously bestowed. I do not deny, indeed, that God rewards the right use
of his gifts of grace by bestowing grace more largely upon us, provided only you
do not place merit, as they do, in opposition to his unmerited liberality and
the merit of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having the same
conflict</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He confirms, also, by his own example
what he had said, and this adds no little authority to his doctrine. By the same
means, too, he shews them, that there is no reason why they should feel troubled
on account of his bonds, when they behold the issue of the
conflict.</font><br></div>

tenderness in this exhortation, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa92</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in
which he entreats by all means the Philippians mutually to cherish harmony among
themselves, lest, in the event of their being torn asunder by intestine
contentions, they should expose themselves to the impostures of the false
apostles. For when there are disagreements, there is invariably a door opened
for Satan to disseminate impious doctrines, while agreement is the best bulwark
for repelling them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As the term
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">paraklh&gt;sewv</font><font face="Palatino">
is often taken to mean <i>exhortation</i>, the commencement of the passage might
be explained in this manner: &#8220;If an exhortation which is delivered in the
name and by the authority of Christ, has any weight with you.&#8221; The other
meaning, however, corresponds better with the context: &#8220;If there is among

alleviate my griefs, and if you would afford me

me in the exercise of love; if you take into view that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fellowship of the

feeling of humanity and mercy resides in you, which might stir you up to
alleviate my miseries, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fulfill ye
my joy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. From this we may infer, how great
a blessing unity in the Church is, and with what eagerness pastors should
endeavor to secure it. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa93</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We must
also at the same time take notice, how he humbles himself by beseechingly
imploring their pity, while he might have availed himself of his paternal
authority, so as to demand respect from them as his sons. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa94</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He knew
how to exercise authority when it was necessary, but at present he prefers to
use entreaties, because he knew that these would be better fitted to gain an
entrance into their affections, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa95</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
because he was aware that he had to do with persons who were docile and
compliant. In this manner the pastor must have no hesitation to assume different
aspects for the sake of the Church. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa96</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fulfil ye my
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here again we may see how little anxiety
he had as to himself, provided only it went well with the Church of Christ. He
was kept shut up in prison, and bound with chains; he was reckoned worthy of
capital punishment &#8212; before his view were tortures &#8212; near at hand
was the executioner; yet all these things do not prevent his experiencing
unmingled joy, provided he sees that the Churches are in a good condition. Now
what he reckons the chief indication of a prosperous condition of the Church is
&#8212; when mutual agreement prevails in it, and brotherly harmony. Thus the
137th Psalm teaches us in like manner, that our crowning joy is the remembrance
of Jerusalem.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
137:6.) But if this were the completion of Paul&#8217;s joy, the Philippians
would have been worse than cruel if they had tortured the mind of this holy man
with a twofold anguish by disagreement among themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye think the same
thing</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The sum is this &#8212; that they be
joined together in views and inclinations. For he makes mention of agreement in
doctrine and mutual love; and afterwards, repeating the same thing, (in my
opinion,) he exhorts them to be of one mind, and to have the same views. The
expression </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt;
aujto&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">,
(</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the same
thing</i></font><font face="Palatino">,) implies that they must accommodate
themselves to each other. Hence the beginning of love is harmony of views, but
that is not sufficient, unless men&#8217;s hearts are at the same time joined
together in mutual affection. At the same time there were no inconsistency in
rendering it thus: &#8212; &#8220;that ye may be of the same mind &#8212; so as
to have mutual love, to be one in mind and one in views;&#8221;for participles
are not unfrequently made use of instead of infinitives. I have adopted,
however, the view which seemed to me less forced.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But by
humility.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For both diseases he brings forward
one remedy &#8212; <i>humility</i>, and with good reason, for it is the mother
of moderation, the effect of which is that, yielding up our own right, we give
the preference to others, and are not easily thrown into agitation. He gives a
definition of true humility &#8212; when every one esteems himself less than
others. Now, if anything in our whole life is difficult, this above everything
else is so. Hence it is not to be wondered if humility is so rare a virtue. For,
as one says, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa100</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;Every one has in himself the mind of a king, by claiming everything for
himself.&#8221;See! here is pride. Afterwards from a foolish admiration of
ourselves arises contempt of the brethren. And so far as we from what Paul here
enjoins, that one can hardly endure that others should be on a level with him,
for there is no one that is not eager to have superiority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is asked, how it is possible that one who is
in reality distinguished above others can reckon those to be superior to him who
he knows are greatly beneath him? I answer, that this altogether depends on a
right estimate of God&#8217;s gifts, and our own infirmities. For however any
one may be distinguished by illustrious endowments, he ought to consider with
himself that they have not been conferred upon him that he might be
self-complacent, that he might exalt himself, or even that he might hold himself
in esteem. Let him, instead of this, employ himself in correcting and detecting
his faults, and he will have abundant occasion for humility. In others, on the
other hand, he will regard with honor whatever there is of excellences, and will
by means of love bury their faults. The man who will observe this rule, will
feel no difficulty in preferring others before himself. And this, too, Paul
meant when he added, that they ought not to have every one a regard to
themselves, but to their neighbors, or that they ought not to be devoted to
themselves. Hence it is quite possible that a pious man, even though he should
be aware that he is superior, may nevertheless hold others in greater
esteem.</font><br></div>

us in Christ. I have retained the passive form of the verb, though I do not
disapprove of the rendering given it by others, because there is no difference
as to meaning. I merely wished that the reader should be in possession of the

humility consisted in his abasing himself from the highest pinnacle of glory to
the lowest ignominy: <i>our</i> humility consists in refraining from exalting
ourselves by a false estimation. <i>He</i> gave up his right: all that is

with the Father, as he says in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
17:5. For in the wisdom of God, prior to his assuming our flesh, there was
nothing mean or contemptible, but on the contrary a magnificence worth of God.
Being such as he was, he could, without doing wrong to any one,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shew himself equal with

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he would not have
thought,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> it is as though he had said, &#8220;He
knew, indeed, that this was lawful and right for him,&#8221;that we might know

rendered in the indicative &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
thought</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but the connection requires the
subjunctive. It is also quite a customary thing for Paul to employ the past
indicative in the place of the subjunctive, by leaving the potential particle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">a]n</font><font face="Palatino">,
as it is called, to be supplied &#8212; as, for example, in

however, must perceive that Paul treats hitherto of Christ&#8217;s glory, which
tends to enhance his abasement. Accordingly he mentions, not what Christ did,
but what it was allowable for him to do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, that man is utterly blind who does not
perceive that his eternal divinity is clearly set forth in these words. Nor does
Erasmus act with sufficient modesty in attempting, by his cavils, to explain
away this passage, as well as other similar passages. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa105</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
acknowledges, indeed, everywhere that Christ is God; but what am I the better
for his orthodox confession, if my faith is not supported by any Scripture
authority? I acknowledge, certainly, that Paul does not make mention here of
Christ&#8217;s divine essence; but it does not follow from this, that the
passage is not sufficient for repelling the impiety of the Arians, who pretended
that Christ was a created God, and inferior to the Father, and denied that he
was consubstantial. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa106</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
where can there be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>equality with
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> without <i>robbery</i>, excepting only
where there is the essence of God; for God always remains the same, who cries by
Isaiah, <i>I live; I will not</i> give my glory to another.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
48:11.) <i>Form</i> means figure or appearance, as they commonly speak. This,
too, I readily grant; but will there be found, apart from God, such a
<i>form</i>, so as to be neither false nor forged? As, then, God is known by
means of his excellences, and his works are evidences of his eternal Godhead,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:20,) so Christ&#8217;s divine essence is rightly proved from Christ&#8217;s
majesty, which he possessed equally with the Father before he humbled himself.
As to myself, at least, not even all devils would wrest this passage from me
&#8212; inasmuch as there is in God a most solid argument, from his glory to his
essence, which are two things that are inseparable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Emptied
himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>emptying</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is the same as the abasement, as to which we shall see afterwards. The
expression, however, is used,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eumfatikwte&gt;rwv</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>more emphatically</i>,) to mean, &#8212; being brought to nothing. Christ,
indeed, could not divest himself of Godhead; but he kept it concealed for a
time, that it might not be seen, under the weakness of the flesh. Hence he laid
aside his glory in the view of men, not by lessening it, but by concealing
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is asked, whether he did this as man? Erasmus
answers in the affirmative. But where was the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>form of God</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">before he became man? Hence we must reply, that
Paul speaks of Christ wholly, as he was <i>God manifested in the flesh</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:16;) but, nevertheless, this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>emptying</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is applicable exclusive to his humanity, as if I should say of man, &#8220;Man
being mortal, he is exceedingly senseless if he thinks of nothing but the
world,&#8221;I refer indeed to man wholly; but at the same time I ascribe
mortality only to a part of him, namely, to the body. As, then, Christ has one
person, consisting of two natures, it is with propriety that Paul says, that he
who was the Son of God, &#8212; in reality equal to God, did nevertheless lay
aside his glory, when he in the flesh manifested himself in the appearance of a
servant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is also asked, secondly, how he can be said to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>emptied</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
while he, nevertheless, invariably proved himself, by miracles and excellences,
to be the Son of God, and in whom, as John testifies, there was always to be
seen a glory worthy of the Son of God?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:14.) I answer, that the abasement of the flesh was, notwithstanding, like a
vail, by which his divine majesty was concealed. On this account he did not wish
that his transfiguration should be made public until after his resurrection; and
when he perceives that the hour of his death is approaching, he then says,
<i>Father, glorify thy Son</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
17:1.) Hence, too, Paul teaches elsewhere, that he was <i>declared to be the Son
of God</i> by means of his resurrection.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:4.) He also declares in another place,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 13:4,) that he <i>suffered through the weakness of the flesh</i>. In
fine, the image of God shone forth in Christ in such a manner, that he was, at
the same time, abased in his outward appearance, and brought down to nothing in
the estimation of men; for he carried about with him the <i>form of a
servant</i>, and had assumed our nature, expressly with the view of his being a
servant of the Father, nay, even of men. Paul, too, calls him the Minister of
the Circumcision,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:8;) and he himself testifies of himself, that he <i>came to minister</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402028&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
20:28;) and that same thing had long before been foretold by Isaiah &#8212;
<i>Behold my servant</i>, etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the likeness of
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Geno&gt;menov</font><font face="Palatino">
is equivalent here to <i>constitutus</i> &#8212; (<i>having been appointed.</i>)
For Paul means that he had been brought down to the level of mankind, so that
there was in appearance nothing that differed from the common condition of
mankind. The Marcionites perverted this declaration for the purpose of
establishing the phantasm of which they dreamed. They can, however, be refuted
without any great difficulty, inasmuch as Paul is treating here simply of the
manner in which Christ manifested himself, and the condition with which he was
conversant when in the world. Let one be truly man, he will nevertheless be
reckoned unlike others, if he conducts himself as if he were exempt from the
condition of others. Paul declares that it was not so as to Christ, but that he
lived in such a manner, that he seemed as though he were on a level with
mankind, and yet he was very different from a mere man, although he was truly
man. The Marcionites therefore shewed excessive childishness, in drawing an
argument from similarity of condition for the purpose of denying reality of
nature.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa107</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Found</i></font><font face="Palatino">
means here, <i>known</i> or <i>seen</i>. For he treats, as has been observed, of
estimation. In other words, as he had affirmed previously that he was truly God,
the equal of the Father, so he here states, that he was reckoned, as it were,
abject, and in the common condition of mankind. We must always keep in view what
I said a little ago, that such abasement was voluntary.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He became
obedient</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Even this was great humility &#8212;
that from being Lord he became a servant; but he says that he went farther than
this, because, while he was not only immortal, but the Lord of life and death,
he nevertheless became obedient to his Father, even so far as to endure death.
This was extreme abasement, especially when we take into view the kind of death,
which he immediately adds, with the view of enhancing it. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa108</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For by
dying in this manner he was not only covered with ignominy in the sight of God,
but was also accursed in the sight of God. It is assuredly such a pattern of
humility as ought to absorb the attention of all mankind; so far is it from
being possible to unfold it in words in a manner suitable to its
dignity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore God hath highly
exalted</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By adding consolation, he shews that
abasement, to which the human mind is averse, is in the highest degree
desirable. There is no one, it is true, but will acknowledge that it is a
reasonable thing that is required from us, when we are exhorted to imitate
Christ. This consideration, however, stirs us up to imitate him the more
cheerfully, when we learn that nothing is more advantageous for us than to be
conformed to his image. Now, that all are happy who, along with Christ,
voluntarily abase themselves, he shews by his example; for from the most abject
condition he was exalted to the highest elevation. Every one therefore that
humbles himself will in like manner be exalted. Who would now be reluctant to
exercise humility, by means of which the glory of the heavenly kingdom is
attained?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage has given occasion to sophists, or
rather they have seized hold of it, to allege that Christ merited first for
himself, and afterwards for others. Now, in the first place, even though there
were nothing false alleged, it would nevertheless be proper to avoid such
profane speculations as obscure the grace of Christ &#8212; in imagining that he
came for any other reason than with a view to our salvation. Who does not see
that this is a suggestion of Satan &#8212; that Christ suffered upon the cross,
that he might acquire for himself, by the merit of his work, what he did not
possess? For it is the design of the Holy Spirit, that we should, in the death
of Christ, see, and taste, and ponder, and feel, and recognize nothing but
God&#8217;s unmixed goodness, and the love of Christ toward us, which was great
and inestimable, that, regardless of himself, he devoted himself and his life
for our sakes. In every instance in which the Scriptures speak of the death of
Christ, they assign to us its advantage and price; &#8212; that by means of it
we are redeemed &#8212; reconciled to God &#8212; restored to righteousness
&#8212; cleansed from our pollutions &#8212; life is procured for us, and the
gate of life opened. Who, then, would deny that it is at the instigation of
Satan that the persons referred to maintain, on the other hand, that the chief
part of the advantage is in Christ himself &#8212; that a regard to himself had
the precedence of that which he had to us &#8212; that he merited glory for
himself before he merited salvation for us?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, I deny the truth of what they allege, and I
maintain that Paul&#8217;s words are impiously perverted to the establishment of
their falsehood; for that the expression, <i>for this cause</i>, denotes here a
consequence rather than a reason, is manifest from this, that it would otherwise
follow, that a man could merit Divine honors, and acquire the very throne of God
&#8212; which is not merely absurd, but even dreadful to make mention of. For of
what exaltation of Christ does the Apostle here speak? It is, that everything
may be accomplished in him that God, by the prophet Isaiah, exclusively claims
to himself. Hence the glory of God, and the majesty, which is so peculiar to
him, that it cannot be transferred to any other, will be the reward of
man&#8217;s work!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again, if they should urge the mode of expression,
without any regard to the absurdity that will follow, the reply will be easy
&#8212; that he has been given us by the Father in such a manner, that his whole
life is as a mirror that is set before us. As, then, a mirror, though it has
splendor, has it not for itself, but with the view of its being advantageous and
profitable to others, so Christ did not seek or receive anything for himself,
but everything for us. For what need, I ask, had he, who was the equal of the
Father, of a new exaltation? Let, then, pious readers learn to detest the
Sorbonnic sophists with their perverted speculations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hath given him a
name</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Name</i></font><font face="Palatino">
here is employed to mean dignity &#8212; a manner of expression which is
abundantly common in all languagges &#8212; &#8220;Jacet <i>sine nomine</i>
truncus; He lies a headless <i>nameless</i> carcass.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa109</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
mode of expression, however, is more especially common in Scripture. The meaning
therefore is, that supreme power was given to Christ, and that he was placed in
the highest rank of honor, so that there is no dignity found either in heaven or
in earth that is equal to his. Hence it follows that it is a Divine name. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa110</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This,
too, he explains by quoting the words of Isaiah, where the Prophet, when
treating of the propagation of the worship of God throughout the whole world,
introduces God as speaking thus: &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I live: every knee
will bow to me, and every tongue will swear to me,&#8221;etc.

45:23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, it is certain that adoration is here meant,
which belongs peculiarly to God alone. I am aware that some philosophise with
subtlety as to the name
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
as though it were derived from the ineffable name Jehovah. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa111</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In the
reason, however, which they advance, I find no solidity. As for me, I feel no
pleasure in empty subtleties; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa112</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and it
is dangerous to trifle in a matter of such importance. Besides, who does not see
that it is a forced, and anything rather than a genuine, exposition, when Paul
speaks of Christ&#8217;s whole dignity, to restrict his meaning to two
syllables, as if any one were to examine attentively the letters of the word
<i>Alexander</i>, in order to find in them the greatness of the name that
Alexander acquired for himself. Their subtlety, therefore, is not solid, and the
contrivance is foreign to Paul&#8217;s intention. But worse than ridiculous is
the conduct of the Sorbonnic sophists, who infer from the passage before us that
we ought to bow the knee whenever the name of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is pronounced, as though it were a magic word which had all virtue included in
the sound of it. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa113</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Paul,
on the other hand, speaks of the honor that is to be rendered to the Son of
God&#8212;not to mere syllables.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every knee might
bow</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though respect is shewn to men also be
means of this rite, there can nevertheless be no doubt that what is here meant
is that adoration which belongs exclusively to God, of which the bending of the
knee is a token. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa114</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As to
this, it is proper to notice, that God is to be worshipped, not merely with the
inward affection of the heart, but also by outward profession, if we would
render to him what is his due. Hence, on the other hand, when he would describe
his genuine worshippers, he says that they</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">have not bowed the knee
to the image of
Baal.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;111918&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Kings 19:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a question arises &#8212; whether this
relates to the divinity of Christ or to his humanity, for either of the two is
not without some inconsistency, inasmuch as nothing new could be given to his
divinity; and his humanity in itself, viewed separately, has by no means such
exaltation belonging to it that it should be adored as God? I answer, that this,
like many things else, is affirmed in reference to Christ&#8217;s entire person,
viewed as <i>God manifested in the flesh</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:16.) For he did not abase himself either as to his humanity alone, or
as to his divinity alone, but inasmuch as, clothed in our flesh, he concealed
himself under its infirmity. So again God exalted his own Son in the same flesh,
in which he had lived in the world abject and despised, to the highest rank of
honor, that he may sit at his right hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul, however, appears to be inconsistent with
himself; for in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:11, he quotes this same passage, when he has it in view to prove that Christ
will one day be the judge of the living and the dead. Now, it would not be
applicable to that subject, if it were already accomplished, as he here
declares. I answer, that the kingdom of Christ is on such a footing, that it is
every day growing and making improvement, while at the same time perfection is
not yet attained, nor will be until the final day of reckoning. Thus both things
hold true &#8212; that all things are now subject to Christ, and that this
subjection will, nevertheless, not be complete until the day of the
resurrection, because that which is now only begun will then be completed.
Hence, it is not without reason that this prophecy is applied in different ways
at different times, as also all the other prophecies, which speak of the reign
of Christ, do not restrict it to one particular time, but describe it in its
entire course. From this, however, we infer that Christ is that eternal God who
spoke by Isaiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Things in heaven, things on earth,
things under the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since Paul represents
all things from heaven to hell as subject to Christ, Papists trifle childishly
when they draw purgatory from his words. Their reasoning, however, is this
&#8212; that devils are so far from bowing the knee to Christ, that they are in
every way rebellious against him, and stir up others to rebellion, as if it were
not at the same time written that they <i>tremble</i> at the simple mention of
God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;590219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
2:19.) How will it be, then, when they shall come before the tribunal of Christ?
I confess, indeed, that they are not, and never will be, subject of their own
accord and by cheerful submission; but Paul is not speaking here of voluntary
obedience; nay more, we may, on the contrary, turn back upon them an argument,
by way of <i>retortion</i>,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">antistre&gt;fon</font><font face="Palatino">,)
in this manner:&#8212;&#8221;The fire of purgatory, according to them, is
temporary, and will be done away at the day of judgment: hence this passage
cannot be understood as to purgatory, because Paul elsewhere declares that this
prophecy will not be fulfilled until Christ shall manifest himself for
judgment.&#8221;Who does not see that they are twice children in respect of
these disgusting frivolities?

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
etc. He concludes the whole of the preceding exhortation with a general
statement &#8212; that they should humble themselves under the Lord&#8217;s
hand, for that will very readily secure, that, laying aside all arrogance, they
will be gentle and indulgent to each other. This is the only befitting way in
which the mind of man may learn gentleness, when one who, while viewing himself
apart, pleased himself in his hiding-places, comes to examine himself as
compared with God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As ye have always
obeyed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He commends their previous obedience,
that he may encourage them the more to persevere. As, however, it is the part of
hypocrites to approve themselves before others, but so soon as they have
withdrawn from public view, to indulge themselves more freely, as if every
occasion of reverence and fear were removed, he admonishes them not to shew
themselves <i>obedient in his presence merely</i>, but also, and even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>much more, in his
absence</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For if he were present, he could
stimulate and urge them on by continued admonitions. Now, therefore, when their
monitor is at a distance from them, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa116</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> there
is need that they should stir up themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With fear and
trembling</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this way he would have the
Philippians testify and approve their obedience &#8212; by being submissive and
humble. Now the source of humility is this &#8212; acknowledging how miserable
we are, and devoid of all good. To this he calls them in this statement. For
whence comes pride, but from the assurance which blind confidence produces, when
we please ourselves, and are more puffed up with confidence in our own virtue,
than prepared to rest upon the grace of God. In contrast with this vice is that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to which he exhorts. Now, although exhortation comes before doctrine, in the
connection of the passage, it is in reality after it, in point of arrangement,
inasmuch as it is derived from it. I shall begin, accordingly, with
doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is God that
worketh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is the true engine for bringing
down all haughtiness &#8212; this the sword for putting an end to all pride,
when we are taught that we are utterly nothing, and can do nothing, except
through the grace of God alone. I mean supernatural grace, which comes forth
from the spirit of regeneration. For, considered as men, we already
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>are, and live and move in
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441728&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
17:28.) But Paul reasons here as to a kind of <i>movement</i> different from
that universal one. Let us now observe how much he ascribes to God, and how much
he leaves to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are, in any action, two principal departments
&#8212; the inclination, and the power to carry it into effect. Both of these he
ascribes wholly to God; what more remains to us as a ground of glorying? Nor is
there any reason to doubt that this division has the same force as if Paul had
expressed the whole in a single word; for the inclination is the groundwork; the
accomplishment of it is the summit of the building brought to a completion. He
has also expressed much more than if he had said that God is the Author of the
beginning and of the end. For in that case sophists would have alleged, by way
of cavil, that something between the two was left to men. But as it is, what
will they find that is in any degree peculiar to us? They toil hard in their
schools to reconcile with the grace of God free-will &#8212; of such a nature, I
mean, as they conceive of &#8212; which might be capable of turning itself by
its own movement, and might have a peculiar and separate power, by which it
might co-operate with the grace of God. I do not dispute as to the name, but as
to the thing itself. In order, therefore, that free-will may harmonize with
grace, they divide in such a manner, that God restores in us a free choice, that
we may have it in our power to <i>will</i> aright. Thus they acknowledge to have
received from God the power of willing aright, but assign to man a good
inclination. Paul, however, declares this to be a work of God, without any
reservation. For he does not say that our hearts are simply turned or stirred
up, or that the infirmity of a good will is helped, but that a good inclination
is wholly the work of God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa117</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, in the calumny brought forward by them against
us &#8212; that we make men to be like stones, when we teach that they have
nothing good, except from pure grace, they act a shameless part. For we
acknowledge that we have from nature an inclination, but as it is depraved
through the corruption of sin, it begins to be good only when it has been
renewed by God. Nor do we say that a man does anything good without willing it,
but that it is only when his inclination is regulated by the Spirit of God.
Hence, in so far as concerns this department, we see that the entire praise is
ascribed to God, and that what sophists teach us is frivolous &#8212; that grace
is offered to us, and placed, as it were, in the midst of us, that we may
embrace it if we choose; for if God did not work in us efficaciously, he could
not be said to produce in us a good inclination. As to the second department, we
must entertain the same view. &#8220;God,&#8221;says he, &#8220;is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">  JO ejnergw~n to
ejnergei~n</font><font face="Palatino"><i> he that worketh in us to
do.</i>&#8221;He brings, therefore, to perfection those pious dispositions which
he has implanted in us, that they may not be unproductive, as he promises by
Ezekiel, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will cause them
to walk in my
commandments.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
11:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From this we infer that perseverance, also, is his
free gift.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to his good
pleasure.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some explain this to mean &#8212; the
good intention of the mind. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa118</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I, on
the other hand, take it rather as referring to God, and understand by it his
benevolent disposition, which they commonly call <i>beneplacitum</i>, (<i>good
pleasure</i>.) For the Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujdoki&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">
is very frequently employed in this sense; and the context requires it. For Paul
has it in view to ascribe everything to God, and to take everything from us.
Accordingly, not satisfied with having assigned to God the production both of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>willing</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>doing</i></font><font face="Palatino">
aright, he ascribes both to his unmerited mercy. By this means he shuts out the
contrivance of the sophists as to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>subsequent
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which they imagine to be the reward of
merit. Hence he teaches, that the whole course of our life, if we live aright,
is regulated by God, and that, too, from his unmerited
goodness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With fear and
trembling</i></font><font face="Palatino">. From this Paul deduces an
exhortation &#8212; that they must
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with fear work out their own
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He conjoins, as he is accustomed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trembling</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
for the sake of greater intensity, to denote &#8212; serious and anxious fear.
He, accordingly, represses drowsiness as well as confidence. By the term
<i>work</i> he reproves our indolence, which is always ingenious in seeking
advantages. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa119</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now it
seems as if it had in the grace of God a sweet occasion of repose; for if He
<i>worketh in us</i>, why should we not indulge ourselves at our ease? The Holy
Spirit, however, calls us to consider, that he wishes to work upon living
organs, but he immediately represses arrogance by recommending
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trembling</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The inference, also, is to be carefully observed:
&#8220;You have,&#8221;says he, &#8220;all things from God; therefore be
solicitous and humble.&#8221;For there is nothing that ought to train us more to
modesty and fear, than our being taught, that it is by the grace of God alone
that we stand, and will instantly fall down, if he even in the slightest degree
withdraw his hand. Confidence in ourselves produces carelessness and arrogance.
We know from experience, that all who confide in their own strength, grow
insolent through presumption, and at the same time, devoid of care, resign
themselves to sleep. The remedy for both evils is, when, distrusting ourselves,
we depend entirely on God alone. And assuredly, that man has made decided
progress in the knowledge, both of the grace of God, and of his own weakness,
who, aroused from carelessness, diligently seeks 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa120</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
God&#8217;s help; while those that are puffed up with confidence in their own
strength, must necessarily be at the same time in a state of intoxicated
security. Hence it is a shameless calumny that Papists bring against us, &#8212;
that in extolling the grace of God, and putting down free-will, we make men
indolent, shake off the fear of God, and destroy all feeling of concern. It is
obvious, however, to every reader, that Paul finds matter of exhortation here
&#8212; not in the doctrine of Papists, but in what is held by us.
&#8220;God,&#8221;says he,
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>works all things in
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> therefore submit to him with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221;I
do not, indeed, deny that there are many who, on being told that there is in us
nothing that is good, indulge themselves the more freely in their vices; but I
deny that this is the fault of the doctrine, which, on the contrary, when
received as it ought to be, produces in our hearts a feeling of
concern.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Papists, however, pervert this passage so as to shake
the assurance of faith, for the man that trembles 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa121</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is in
uncertainty. They, accordingly, understand Paul&#8217;s words as if they meant
that we ought, during our whole life, to waver as to assurance of salvation. If,
however, we would not have Paul contradict himself, he does not by any means
exhort us to hesitation, inasmuch as he everywhere recommends confidence and
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">plhrofori&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>full assurance</i>. The solution, however, is easy, if any one is desirous of
attaining the true meaning without any spirit of contention. There are two kinds
of fear; the one produces anxiety along with humility; the other hesitation. The
<i>former</i> is opposed to fleshly confidence and carelessness, equally as to
arrogance; the latter, to assurance of faith. Farther, we must take notice,
that, as believers repose with assurance upon the grace of God, so, when they
direct their views to their own frailty, they do not by any means resign
themselves carelessly to sleep, but are by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of dangers stirred up to prayer. Yet, so far is this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino">
from disturbing tranquillity of conscience, and shaking confidence, that it
rather confirms it. For distrust of ourselves leads us to lean more confidently
upon the mercy of God. And this is what Paul&#8217;s words import, for he
requires nothing from the Philippians, but that they submit themselves to God
with true self-renunciation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Work out your own
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As Pelagians of old, so Papists at
this day make a proud boast of this passage, with the view of extolling
man&#8217;s excellence. Nay more, when the preceding statement is mentioned to
them by way of objection, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is
God that worketh in us,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> etc., they immediately
by this shield ward it off (so to speak) &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Work out your own
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Inasmuch, then, as the work is
ascribed to God and man in common, they assign the half to each. In short, from
the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>work</i></font><font face="Palatino">
they derive free-will; from the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino">
they derive the merit of eternal life. I answer, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is taken to mean the entire course of our calling, and that this term includes
all things, by which God accomplishes that perfection, to which he has
predestinated us by his gracious choice. This no one will deny, that is not
obstinate and impudent. We are said to perfect it, when, under the regulation of
the Spirit, we aspire after a life of blessedness. It is God that calls us, and
offers to us salvation; it is our part to embrace by faith what he gives, and by
obedience act suitably to his calling; but we have neither from ourselves. Hence
we act only when he has prepared us for acting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word which he employs properly signifies &#8212;
to continue until the end; but we must keep in mind what I have said, that Paul
does not reason here as to how far our ability extends, but simply teaches that
God acts in us in such a manner, that he, at the same time, does not allow us to
be inactive, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa122</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
exercises us diligently, after having stirred us up by a secret influence. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa123</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Without
murmurings</i></font><font face="Palatino">. These are fruits of that humility
to which he had exhorted them. For every man that has learned carefully to
submit himself to God, without claiming anything for himself, will also conduct
himself agreeably among men. When every one makes it his care to please himself,
two faults prevail: First, they calumniate one another; and secondly, they
strive against one another in contentions. In the <i>first</i> place,
accordingly, he forbids malignity and secret enmities; and then,
<i>secondly</i>, open contentions. He adds, <i>thirdly</i>, that they give no
occasion to others to complain of them &#8212; a thing which is wont to arise
from excessive moroseness. It is true that hatred is not in all cases to be
dreaded; but care must be taken, that we do not make ourselves odious through
our own fault, so that the saying should be fulfilled in us, <i>They hated me

were even more intermingled, inasmuch as there could scarcely be found a single
pious family that was not surrounded on all sides by unbelievers. So much the
more does Paul stir up the Philippians to guard carefully against all
corruptions. The meaning therefore is this: &#8220;You are, it is true, inclosed
in the midst of the wicked; but, in the mean time, bear in mind that you are, by
God&#8217;s adoption, separated from them: let there be, therefore, in your
manner of life, conspicuous marks by which you may be distinguished. Nay more,
this consideration ought to stir you up the more to aim at a pious and holy
life, that we may not also be a part of the

<div><font face="Palatino">As to his calling them a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wicked and crooked
generation</i></font><font face="Palatino">, this corresponds with the
connection of the passage. For he teaches us that we must so much the more
carefully take heed on this account &#8212; that many occasions of offense are
stirred up by unbelievers, which disturb their right course; and the whole life
of unbelievers is, as it were, a labyrinth of various windings, that draw us off
from the right way. They are, however, notwithstanding, epithets of perpetual
application, that are descriptive of unbelievers of all nations and in all ages.
For if the heart of man is wicked and unsearchable,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
17:9,) what will be the fruits springing from such a root? Hence we are taught
in these words, that in the life of man there is nothing pure, nothing right,
until he has been renewed by the Spirit of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Among whom shine
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The termination of the Greek word is
doubtful, for it might be taken as the <i>indicative</i> &#8212; <i>ye
shine</i>; but the <i>imperative</i> suits better with the exhortation. He would
have unbelievers be as lamps, which shine amidst the darkness of the world, as
though he had said, &#8220;Believers, it is true, are children of the night, and
there is in the world nothing but darkness; but God has enlightened you for this
end, that the purity of your life may shine forth amidst that darkness, that his
grace may appear the more illustrious.&#8221;Thus, also, it is said by the
Prophet,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The Lord will
arise upon thee,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and his glory will

<div><font face="Palatino">He adds immediately afterwards, &#8220;The Gentiles
shall walk in thy light, and kings in the brightness of thy
countenance.&#8221;Though Isaiah speaks there rather of doctrine, while Paul
speaks here of an exemplary life, yet, even in relation to doctrine, Christ in
another passage specially designates the Apostles the <i>light of the world</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

luminaries is, that they carry the

life,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> by which they are enlightened, that they
may give light also to others. Now he alludes to lamps, in which wicks are
placed that they may burn, and he makes us resemble the lamps; while he compares
the word of God to the wick, from which the light comes. If you prefer another
figure &#8212; we are candlesticks: the doctrine of the gospel is the candle,
which, being placed in us, diffuses light on all sides. Now he intimates, that
we do injustice to the word of God, if it does not shine forth in us in respect
of purity of life. This is the import of Christ&#8217;s saying,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;No man lighteth a

carried by it, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa131</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
inasmuch as we are founded upon it. The manner, however, of carrying it, of
which Paul speaks, is, that God has intrusted his doctrine with us on condition,
not that we should keep the light of it under restraint, as it were, and
inactive, but that we should hold it forth to others. The sum is this: that all
that are enlightened with heavenly doctrine carry about with them a light, which
detects and discovers their crimes, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa132</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> if
they do not walk in holiness and chastity; but that this light has been kindled
up, not merely that they may themselves be guided in the right way, but that
they may also shew it to others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may have
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That he may encourage them the more, he
declares that it will turn out to his glory, if he has not labored among them in
vain. Not as if those who labored faithfully, but unsuccessfully, lost their
pains, and had no reward of their labor. As, however, success in our ministry is
a singular blessing from God, let us not feel surprised, if God, among his other
gifts, makes this the crowning one. Hence, as Paul&#8217;s Apostleship is now
rendered illustrious by so many Churches, gained over to Christ through his
instrumentality, so there can be no question that such trophies 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa133</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> will
have a place in Christ&#8217;s kingdom, as we will find him saying a little
afterwards, <i>You are my crown</i>.

ourselves, and all that we have before God, and have placed in Christ all our
ground of glorying, it is, at the same time, allowable for us to glory through
Christ in God&#8217;s benefits, as we have seen in the First Epistle to the

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I should be
offered.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa136</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Greek word is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">spe&gt;ndomai</font><font face="Palatino">,
and accordingly there appears to be an allusion to those animals, by the
slaughter of which agreements and treaties were confirmed among the ancients.
For the Greeks specially employ the term
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sponda&lt;v</font><font face="Palatino">
to denote the victims by which treaties are confirmed. In this way, he calls his
death the confirmation of their faith, which it certainly would be. That,
however, the whole passage may be more clearly understood, he says that he
offered sacrifice to God, when he consecrated them by the gospel. There is a
similar expression in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:16; for in that passage he represents himself as a priest, who <i>offers
up</i> the Gentiles to God by the gospel. Now, as the gospel is a spiritual
sword for slaying victims, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa137</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so
faith is, as it were, the oblation; for there is no faith without mortification,
by means of which we are consecrated to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He makes use of the terms,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kai&lt;
leitourgi&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sacrifice and
service</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the <i>former</i> of which refers to
the Philippians, who had been offered up to God; and the <i>latter</i> to Paul,
for it is the very act of sacrificing. The term, it is true, is equivalent to
<i>administration</i>, and thus it includes functions and offices of every kind;
but here it relates properly to the service of God &#8212; corresponding to the
phrase made use of by the Latins &#8212; <i>operari sacris</i> &#8212; (to be
<i>employed in sacred rites</i>. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa138</font></sup><font face="Palatino">) Now
Paul says that he will rejoice, if he shall be offered up upon a sacrifice of
this nature &#8212; that it may be the more ratified and confirmed. This is to
teach the gospel from the heart &#8212; when we are prepared to confirm with our
own blood what we teach.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From this, however, a useful lesson is to be gathered
as to the nature of faith &#8212; that it is not a vain thing, but of such a
nature as to consecrate man to God. The ministers of the gospel have, also, here
a singular consolation in being called priests of God, to present victims to
him;  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa139</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for with what ardor ought that man to apply himself to the pursuit of preaching,
who knows that this is an acceptable sacrifice to God! The wretched Papists,
having no knowledge of this kind of sacrifice, contrive another, which is utter
sacrilege.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I rejoice with
you,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> says he &#8212; so that if it should
happen that he died, they would know that this took place for their profit, and
would receive advantage from his death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rejoice
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the alacrity which he thus discovers, he
encourages the Philippians, and enkindles in them a desire to meet death with
firmness, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa140</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
inasmuch as believers suffer no harm from it. For he has formerly taught them
that death would be <i>gain</i> to himself,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
1:21;) here, on the other hand, he is chiefly concerned that his death may not
disconcer the Philippians. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa141</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He,
accordingly, declares that it is no ground of sorrow; nay, that they have
occasion of joy, inasmuch as they will find it to be productive of advantage.
For, although it was in itself a serious loss to be deprived of such a teacher,
it was no slight compensation that the gospel was confirmed by his blood. In the
mean time, he lets them know that to himself personally death would be matter of
joy. The rendering of Erasmus, taking it in the present tense, <i>Ye
rejoice</i>, is altogether unsuitable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He promises them the coming of Timothy,
that, from their expecting him, they may bear up more courageously, and not give
way to impostors. For as in war an expectation of help animates soldiers, so as
to keep them from giving way, so this consideration, too, was fitted to
encourage greatly the Philippians: &#8220;There will one come very shortly, who
will set himself in opposition to the contrivances of our enemies.&#8221;But if
the mere expectation of him had so much influence, his presence would exert a
much more powerful effect. We must take notice of the condition 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa142</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; in respect of which he submits himself to the providence of God, forming
no purpose, but with <i>that</i> leading the way, as assuredly it is not
allowable to determine anything as to the future, except, so to speak, under the
Lord&#8217;s hand. When he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that I may be in
tranquillity</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he declares his affection towards
them, inasmuch as he was so much concerned as to their dangers, that he was not
at east until he received accounts of their prosperity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have no man
like-minded</i></font><font face="Palatino">. While some draw another meaning
from the passage, I interpret it thus: &#8220;I have no one equally
well-affected for attending to your interests.&#8221;For Paul, in my opinion,
compares Timothy with others, rather than with himself, and he pronounces this
eulogium upon him, with the express design that he may be the more highly
esteemed by them for his rare excellence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For all seek their own
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He does not speak of those who had
openly abandoned the pursuit of piety, but of those very persons whom he
reckoned brethren, nay, even those whom he admitted to familiar intercourse with
him. These persons, he nevertheless says, were so warm in the pursuit of their
own interests, that they were unbecomingly cold in the work of the Lord. It may
seem at first view as if it were no great fault to seek one&#8217;s own profit;
but how insufferable it is in the servants of Christ, appears from this, that it
renders those that give way to it utterly useless. For it is impossible that the
man who is devoted to self, should apply himself to the interests of the Church.
Did then, you will say, Paul cultivate the society of men that were worthless
and mere pretenders? I answer, that it is not to be understood, as if they had
been intent exclusively on their own interests, and bestowed no care whatever
upon the Church, but that, taken up with their own individual interests, they
were to some extent negligent to the promotion of the public advantage of the
Church. For it must necessarily be, that one or other of two dispositions
prevails over us &#8212; either that, overlooking ourselves, we are devoted to
Christ, and those things that are Christ&#8217;s, or that, unduly intent on our
own advantage, we serve Christ in a superficial manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From this it appears, how great a hinderance it is to
Christ&#8217;s ministers to seek their own interests. Nor is there any force in
these excuses: &#8220;I do harm to no one &#8220;&#8212; &#8220;I must have a
regard, also, to my own advantage&#8221;&#8212; &#8220;I am not so devoid of
feeling as not to be prompted by a regard to my own advantage.&#8221;For you
must give up your own right if you would discharge your duty: a regard to your
own interests must not be put in preference to Christ&#8217;s glory, or even
placed upon a level with it. Whithersoever Christ calls you, you must go
promptly, leaving off all other things. Your calling ought to be regarded by you
in such a way, that you shall turn away all your powers of perception from
everything that would impede you. It might be in your power to live elsewhere in
greater opulence, but God has bound you to the Church, which affords you but a
very moderate sustenance: you might elsewhere have more honor, but God has
assigned you a situation, in which you live in a humble style: 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa143</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> you
might have elsewhere a more salubrious sky, or a more delightful region, but it
is here that your station is appointed. You might wish to have to do with a more
humane people: you feel offended with their ingratitude, or barbarity, or pride;
in short, you have no sympathy with the disposition or the manners of the nation
in which you are, but you must struggle with yourself, and do violence in a
manner to opposing inclinations, that you may 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa144</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> keep
by the trade you have got; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa145</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for
you are not free, or at your own disposal. In fine, forget yourself, if you
would serve God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If, however, Paul reproves so severely those who were
influenced by a greater concern for themselves than for the Church, what
judgment may be looked for by those who, while altogether devoted to their own
affairs, make no account of the edification of the Church? However they may now
flatter themselves, God will not spare them. An allowance must be given to the
ministers of the Church to seek their own interests, so as not to be prevented
from seeking the kingdom of Christ; but in that case they will not be
represented as seeking their own interests, as a man&#8217;s life is estimated
according to its chief aim. When he says <i>all</i>, we are not to understand
the term denoting universality, as though it implied that there was no
exception, for there were others also, such as Epaphroditus, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa146</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
there were few of these, and he ascribes to all what was very generally
prevalent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, however, we hear Paul complaining, that in that
golden age, in which all excellences flourished, that there were so few that
were rightly affected, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa147</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> let us
not be disheartened, if such is our condition in the present day: only let every
one take heed to himself, that he be not justly reckoned to belong to that
catalogue. I should wish, however, that Papists would answer me one question
&#8212; where Peter was at that time, for he must have been at Rome, if what
they say is true. O the sad and vile description that Paul gave of him! They
utter, therefore, mere fables, when they pretend that he at that time presided
over the Church of Rome. Observe, that the edification of the Church is termed
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>things of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because we are truly engaged in his
work, when we labor in the cultivation of his vineyard.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the
proof</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is literally, <i>ye know the proof of
him</i>, unless you prefer to understand it in the imperative mood, <i>know
ye</i>; (for there had scarcely been opportunity during that short time to make
trial,) but this is not of great moment. What is chiefly to be noticed is, that
he furnishes Timothy with an attestation of fidelity and modesty. In evidence of
his fidelity, he declares, that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>served with him in the
gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for such a connection was a token of
true sincerity. In evidence of his modesty, he states, that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>submitted to him as to a
father</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is not to be wondered, that this
virtue is expressly commended by Paul, for it has in all ages been rare. At the
present day, where will you find one among the young that will give way to his
seniors, even in the smallest thing? to such an extent does impertinence triumph
and prevail in the present age! In this passage, as in many others, we see how
diligently Paul makes it his aim to put honor upon pious ministers, and that not
so much for their own sakes, as on the ground of its being for the advantage of
the whole Church, that such persons should be loved and honored, and possess the
highest authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I trust that I
myself</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He adds this, too, lest they should
imagine that anything had happened to change his intention as to the journey of
which he had previously made mention. At the same time, he always speaks
conditionally &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If it shall
please the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For although he expected
deliverance from the Lord, yet there having been, as we have observed, no
express promise, this expectation was by no means settled, but was, as it were,
suspended upon the secret purpose of God.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I thought it necessary to send to
you Epaphroditus</i></font><font face="Palatino">. After having encouraged them
by the promise of his own coming and that of Timothy, he fortifies them also for
the present, by sending previously Epaphroditus, that in the mean time, while he
waited the issue of his own affairs, (for this was the cause of his delay,) they
might not be in want of a pastor who should take care that matters were properly
managed. Now, he recommends Epaphroditus by many distinctions &#8212; that he is
his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and helper in the affairs of the gospel &#8212; that he is his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fellow-soldier</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
by which term he intimates what is the condition of the ministers of the gospel;
that they are engaged in an incessant warfare, for Satan will not allow them to
promote the gospel without maintaining a conflict. Let those, then, who prepare
themselves for edifying the Church, know that war is denounced against them, and
prepared. This, indeed, is common to all Christians &#8212; to be soldiers in
the camp of Christ, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa148</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for
Satan is the enemy of all. It is, however, more particularly applicable to the
ministers of the word, who go before the army and bear the standard. Paul,
however, more especially might boast of his military service, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa149</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
inasmuch as he was exercised to a very miracle in every kind of contest. He
accordingly commends Epaphroditus, because he had been a companion to him in his
conflicts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Apostle</i></font><font face="Palatino">
here, as in many other passages, is taken generally to mean any evangelist, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa150</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> unless
any one prefers to understand it as meaning an ambassador sent by the
Philippians, so that it may be understood as conjoining these two things &#8212;
an ambassador to afford service to Paul. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa151</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
former signification, however, is in my opinion more suitable. He mentions also,
among other things, to his praise, that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ministered to him in
prison</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; a matter which will be treated
of more fully ere long.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He longed after
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is a sign of a true pastor, that while
he was at a great distance, and was willingly detained by a pious engagement, he
was nevertheless affected with concern for his flock, and a longing after them;
and on learning that his sheep were distressed on his account, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa152</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he was
concerned as to their grief. On the other hand, the anxiety of the Philippians
for their pastor is here discovered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But God had mercy on
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He had expressed the severity of the
disease &#8212; that Epaphroditus had been sick, so that life was despaired of,
in order that the goodness of God might shine forth more clearly in his restored
health. It is, however, surprising that he should ascribe it to the mercy of God
that Epaphroditus had had his period of life prolonged, while he had previously
declared that he desired death in preference to life.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
1:23.) And what were better for us than that we should remove hence to the
kingdom of God, delivered from the many miseries of this world, and more
especially, rescued from that bondage of sin in which he elsewhere exclaims that
he is <i>wretched</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450724&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:24,) to attain the full enjoyment of that liberty of the Spirit, by which we
become connected with the Son of God? 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa153</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It
were tedious to enumerate all the things which tend to make death better than
life to believers, and more to be desired. Where, then, is there any token of
the mercy of God, when it does nothing but lengthen out our miseries? I answer,
that all these things do not prevent this life from being, nevertheless,
considered in itself, an excellent gift of God. More especially those who live
to Christ are happily exercised here in hope of heavenly glory; and accordingly,
as we have had occasion to see a little ago, life is gain to them. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa154</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Besides, there is another thing, too, that is to be considered &#8212; that it
is no small honor that is conferred upon us, when God glorifies himself in us;
for it becomes us to look not so much to life itself, as to the end for which we
live.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But on me also, lest I should have
sorrow.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Paul acknowledges that the death of
Epaphroditus would have been bitterly painful to him, and he recognises it as an
instance of God&#8217;s sparing mercy toward himself, that he had been restored
to health. He does not, therefore, make it his boast that he has the
<i>apathy</i>
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpa&gt;qeian</font><font face="Palatino">)
of the Stoics, as if he were a man of iron, and exempt from human affections. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa155</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;What then!&#8221;some one will say, &#8220;where is that unconquerable
magnanimity?&#8212;where is that indefatigable perseverance?&#8221;I answer,
that Christian patience differs widely from philosophical obstinacy, and still
more from the stubborn and fierce sterness of the Stoics. For what excellence
were there in patiently enduring the cross, if there were in it no feeling of
pain and bitterness? But when the consolation of God overcomes that feeling, so
that we do not resist, but, on the contrary, give our back to the endurance of
the rod,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
50:5,) we in that case present to God a sacrifice of obedience that is
acceptable to him. Thus Paul acknowledges that he felt some uneasiness and pain
from his bonds, but that he nevertheless cheerfully endured these same bonds for
the sake of Christ. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa156</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
acknowledges that he would have felt the death of Epaphroditus an event hard to
be endured, but he would at length have brought his temper of mind into
accordance with the will of God, although all reluctance was not yet fully
removed; for we give proof of our obedience, only when we bridle our depraved
affections, and do not give way to the infirmity of the flesh.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa157</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Two</i> things, therefore, are to be observed: in
the <i>first</i> place, that the dispositions which God originally implanted in
our nature are not evil in themselves, because they do not arise from the fault
of corrupt nature, but come forth from God as their Author; of this nature is
the grief that is felt on occasion of the death of friends: in the <i>second</i>
place, that Paul had many other reasons for regret in connection with the death
of Epaphroditus, and that these were not merely excusable, but altogether
necessary. This, in the first place, is invariable in the case of all believers,
that, on occasion of the death of any one, they are reminded of the anger of God
against sin; but Paul was the more affected with the loss sustained by the
Church, which he saw would be deprived of a singularly good pastor at a time
when the good were so few in number. Those who would have dispositions of this
kind altogether subdued and eradicated, do not picture to themselves merely men
of flint, but men that are fierce and savage. In the depravity of our nature,
however, everything in us is so perverted, that in whatever direction our minds
are bent, they always go beyond bounds. Hence it is that there is nothing that
is so pure or right in itself, as not to bring with it some contagion. Nay more,
Paul, as being a man, would, I do not deny, have experienced in his grief
something of human error, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa158</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for he
was subject to infirmity, and required to be tried with temptations, in order
that he might have occasion of victory by striving and
resisting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have sent him the more
carefully</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The presence of Epaphroditus was no
small consolation to him; yet to such a degree did he prefer the welfare of the
Philippians to his own advantage, that he says that he rejoices on occasion of
his departure, because it grieved him that, on his account, he was taken away
from the flock that was intrusted to him, and was reluctant to avail himself of
his services, though otherwise agreeable to him, when it was at the expense of
loss to them. Hence he says, that he will feel more happiness in the joy of the
Philippians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Receive him with all
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He employs the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to mean sincere and abundant. He also recommends him again to the Philippians;
so intent is he upon this, that all that approve themselves as good and faithful
pastors may be held in the highest estimation: for he does not speak merely of
one, but exhorts that all such should be held in estimation; for they are
precious pearls from God&#8217;s treasuries, and the rarer they are, they are so
much the more worthy of esteem. Nor can it be doubted that God often punishes
our ingratitude and proud disdain, by depriving us of good pastors, when he sees
that the most eminent that are given by him are ordinarily despised. Let every
one, then, who is desirous that the Church should be fortified against the
stratagems and assaults of wolves, make it his care, after the example of Paul,
that the authority of good pastors be established; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa159</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as, on
the other hand, there is nothing upon which the instruments of the devil are
more intent, than on undermining it by every means in their
power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because for the work of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I consider this as referring to that
infirmity, which he had drawn down upon himself by incessant assiduity. Hence he
reckons the distemper of Epaphroditus among his excellences, as it certainly was
a signal token of his ardent zeal. Sickness, indeed, is not an excellence, but
it is an excellence not to spare yourself that you may serve Christ.
Epaphroditus felt that his health would be in danger if he applied himself
beyond measure; yet he would rather be negligent as to health than be deficient
in duty; and that he may commend this conduct the more to the Philippians, he
says that it was a filling up of their
deficiency,</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fa160</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because, being situated at a distance,
they could not furnish aid to Paul at Rome. Hence Epaphroditus, having been sent
for this purpose, acted in their stead.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fa161</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He speaks of the services rendered to
him as the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>work of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as assuredly there is nothing in which we
can better serve God, than when we help his servants who labor for the truth of
the gospel.</font><br></div>

goes before, for as Satan never ceased to distress them with daily rumors, he
bids them divest themselves of anxiety and be of good courage. In this way he
exhorts them to constancy, that they may not fall back from the doctrine which
they have once received. The phrase
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>henceforward</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

not so necessary to enter into any regular disputation with the view of refuting

instance tending to shew that the Holy Spirit in his organs 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa170</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> has
not in every case avoided wit and humor, yet so as at the same time to keep at a
distance from such pleasantry as were unworthy of his majesty. There are
innumerable examples in the Prophets, and especially in Isaiah, so that there is
no profane author that abounds more in agreeable plays upon words, and
figurative forms of expression. We ought, however, more carefully still to
observe the vehemence with which Paul inveighs against the false Apostles, which
will assuredly break forth wherever there is the ardor of pious zeal. But in the
mean time we must be on our guard lest any undue warmth or excessive bitterness
should creep in under a pretext of zeal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says, that to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>write the same things is not
grievous to him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he seems to intimate
that he had already written on some other occasion to the Philippians. There
would, however, be no inconsistency in understanding him as meaning, that he now
by his writings reminds them of the same things as they had frequently heard him
say, when he was with them. For there can be no doubt that he had often
intimated to them in words, when he was with them, how much they ought to be on
their guard against such pests: yet he does not grudge to repeat these things,
because the Philippians would have incurred danger in the event of his silence.
And, unquestionably, it is the part of a good pastor, not merely to supply the
flock with pasture, and to rule the sheep by his guidanee, but to drive away the
wolves when threatening to make an attack upon the fold, and that not merely on
one occasion, but so as to be constantly on the watch, and to be indefatigable.
For as <i>thieves and robbers
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
10:8) are constantly on the watch for the destruction of the Church, what excuse
will the pastor have if, after courageously repelling them in several instances,
he gives way on occasion of the ninth or tenth attack?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says also, that a repetition of this nature is
profitable to the Philippians, lest they should be&#8212;as is wont to happen
occasionally&#8212;of an exceedingly fastidious humor, and despise it as a thing
that was superfluous. For many are so difficult to please, that they cannot bear
that the same thing should be said to them a second time, and, in the mean time,
they do not consider that what is inculcated upon them daily is with difficulty
retained in their memory ten years afterwards. But if it was profitable to the
Philippians to listen to this exhortation of Paul&#8212;to be on their guard
against wolves, what do Papists mean who will not allow that any judgment should
be formed as to their doctrine? For to whom, I pray you, did Paul address
himself when he said, <i>Beware? </i>Was it not to those whom they do not allow
to possess any right to judge? And of the same persons Christ says, in like
manner, </font><br></div>

recommended to us in the gospel, and consists of confidence in God, and

exclusively pressed upon them by the false Apostles.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">But here some one will ask, whether <i>truth excludes

Lord&#8217;s Supper. I answer, that this principle must always be kept in view,
that figures were abolished by the advent of Christ, and that circumcision gave
way to baptism. It follows, also, from this principle, that the pure and
genuine&#8217;worship of God is free from the legal ceremonies, and that
believers have the true circumcision without any figure.</font><br></div>

words, he gives the name of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to everything that is apart from Christ. He thus reproves, and in no slight
manner, the perverse zealots the law, because, not satisfied with Christ, they
have recourse to grounds of glorying apart from him. He has employed the terms
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glorying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>having
confidence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to denote the same thing.
For confidence lifts up a man, so that he ventures even to glory, and thus the
two things are connected.</font><br></div>

of the disposition exercised by him, but he intimates, that he has also ground
of glorying, if he were inclined to imitate their folly. The meaning therefore
is, &#8220;My glorying, indeed, is placed in Christ, but, were it warrantable to
glory in the flesh, I have also no want of materials.&#8221;And from this we
learn in what manner to reprove the arrogance of those who glory in something
apart from Christ. If we are ourselves in possession of those very things in
which they glory, let us not allow them to triumph over Christ by an unseemly
boasting, without retorting upon them also our grounds of glorying, that they
may understand that it is not through envy that we reckon of no value, nay, even
voluntarily renounce those things on which they set the highest. value. Let,
however, the conclusion be always of this nature&#8212;that all confidence in
the flesh is vain and preposterous.</font><br></div>

on a level with any one of them, he even gives himself the preference to them.
Hence he cannot on this account be suspected, as though he were envious of their
excellence, and extolled Christ with the view of making his own deficiencies
appear the less inconsiderable. He says, therefore, that, if it were coming to
be matter of dispute, he would be superior to others. For they had nothing (as
we shall see erelong) that he had not on his part equally with them, while in
some things he greatly excelled them. He says, not using the term in its strict
sense, that he has </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>confidence in
the flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>on the ground that, while not
placing confidence in them, he was furnished with those grounds of fleshly

however, in the sense, for the meaning is, that he was circumcised in the proper
manner, and according to the appointment of the law 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa171</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. Now
this customary circumcision was reckoned of superior value; and, besides, it was
a token of the race to. which he belonged; on which he touches immediately
afterwards. For the case was not the same as to foreigners, for after they had
become <i>proselytes </i>they were circumcised in youth, or when grown up to
manhood, and sometimes even in old age. He says, accordingly, that he is of the
<i>race of Israel. </i>He names the tribe 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa172</font></sup><font face="Palatino">,&#8212;not,
in my opinion, onthe ground that the <i>tribe of Benjamin </i>had a
superiorityof excellence above others, but for shewing more fully that he
belonged to the race of Israel, as it was the custom that every one was numbered
according to his particular tribe. With the same view he adds still farther,
that he is an </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hebrew of the,
Hebrews</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For this name was the most
ancient, as being that by which Abraham himself is designated by Moses.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
14:13.) 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa173</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
sum, therefore, is this &#8212; that Paul was descended from the seed of Jacob
from the most ancient date, so that he could reckon up grandfathers and
great-grandfathers, and could even go still farther back.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the law, a
Pharisee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Having spoken of the nobility
of his descent, he now proceeds to speak of special endowments of persons, as
they are called. It is very generally known, that the sect of the Pharisees was
celebrated above the others for the renown in which it was held for sanctity and
for doctrine. He states, that he belonged to that sect. The common opinion is,
that the Pharisees were so called from a term signifying <i>separation </i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa174</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>but I approve rather of what I learned at one time from Capito, a man of
sacred memory 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa175</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, that
it was because they boasted that they were endowed with the gift of
<i>interpreting </i>Scripture, for
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;rp</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(parash,) </i>among the Hebrews, conveys the idea of <i>interpretation.</i>

</i>While others declared themselves to be <i>literals</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa177</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>they preferred to be regarded as <i>Pharisees</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa178</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as being in possession of the interpretations of the ancients. And assuredly
it is manifest that, under the pretext of antiquity, they corrupted the whole of
Scripture by their invent ions; but as they, at the same time, retained some
sound interpretations, handed down by the ancients, they were held in the
highest esteem</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what is meant by the clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>For unquestionably nothing is more
opposed to the law of God than sects, for in it is communicated the truth of
God, which is the bond of unity. Besides this, Josephus tells us in the 13th
book of his Antiquities, that all the sects took their rise during the high
priesthood of Jonathan. Paul employs the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>not in its strict sense, to denote the doctrine of religion, however much
corrupted it was at that time, as Christianity is at this day in the Papacy. As,
however, there <i>were </i>many that were in the rank of teachers, who were less
skillful, and exercised 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa179</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
makes mention also of his <i>zeal. </i>It was, indeed, a very heinous sin on the
part of Paul to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>persecute the
Church</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but as he had to dispute with
unprincipled persons, who, by mixing up Christ with Moses, <i>pretended </i>zeal
for the law, he mentions, on the other hand, that he was so keen a zealot of the
law, that on that ground </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
persecuted the Church</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
As to the righteousness which is in the law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>There can be no doubt he means by this the entire righteousness of the law,
for it were too meagre a sense to understand it exclusively of the ceremonies.
The meaning, therefore, is more general&#8212;that he cultivated an integrity of
life, such as might be required on the part of a man that was devoted to the
law. To this, again, it is objected, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness of the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is perfect in the sight of God. For
the sum of it is &#8212;that men be; fully devoted to God, and what beyond this
can be desired for the attainment of perfection? I answer, that Paul speaks here
of that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>which would satisfy the common opinion of mankind. For he separates the law
from Christ. Now, what is the law without Christ but a dead letter? To <i>make
</i>the matter plainer, I observe, that there are two righteousnesses of the
law. The one is <i>spiritual&#8212;perfect </i>love to God, and our neighbors:
it is contained in doctrine, and had never an existence in the life of any man.
The other is <i>literal&#8212;such </i>as appears in the view of men, while, in
the mean time, hypocrisy reigns in the heart, and there is in the sight of God
nothing but iniquity. Thus, the law has two aspects; the one has an eye to God,
the other to men. Paul, then, was in the judgment of men holy, and free from all
censure&#8212;a rare commendation, certainly, and almost unrivalled; yet let us
observe in what esteem he held it.</font><br></div>

What things were gain to me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He says,
that those things were gain to him, for ignorance of Christ is the solereason
why we are puffed up with a vain confidence. Hence, where we see a false
estimate of one&#8217;s own excellence, where we see arrogance, where we see
pride, <i>there </i>let us be assured that Christ is not known. On the other
hand, so soon as Christ shines forth all those things that formerly dazzled our
eyes with a false splendor instantly vanish, or at least are disesteemed. Those
things, accordingly, which had been <i>gain </i>to Paul when he was as yet
blind, or rather had imposed upon him under an appearance of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he acknowledges to have been <i>loss </i>to him, when he has been
enlightened. Why <i>loss? </i>Because they were hinderances in the way of his
coming to Christ. What is more hurtful than anything that keeps us back from
drawing near to Christ? Now he speaks chiefly of his own
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>for we are not received by Christ, except as naked and emptied of our own
righteousness. Paul, accordingly, acknowledges that nothing was so injurious to
him as his own righteousness, inasmuch as he was by means of it shut out from
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nay more, I
reckon.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He<i> </i>means, that he
continues to be of the same mind, because it often happens, that, transported
with delight in new things, we forget everything else, and afterwards we regret
it. Hence Paul, having said that he renounced all hinderances, that he might
gain Christ, now adds, that he continues to be of this mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the sake of the excellency of
the knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He extols the gospel in
opposition to all such notions as tend to beguile us. For there are many things
that have an appearance of excellence, but the knowledge of Christ surpasses to
such a degree everything else by its sublimity 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa181</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, that,
as compared with it, there is nothing that is not contemptible. Let us,
therefore, learn from this, what value we ought to set upon the knowledge of
Christ alone. As to his calling him <i>his Lord, </i>he does this to express the
intensity of his feeling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For whom I have suffered the loss
of all things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He<i> </i>expresses more
than he had done previously; at least he expresses himself with greater
distinctness. It is a similitude taken from seamen, who, when urged on by danger
of shipwreck, throw everything overboard, that, the ship being lightened, they
may reach the harbour in safety. Paul, then, was prepared to lose everything
that he had, rather than be deprived of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is asked, whether it is necessary for us to
renounce riches, and honors, and nobility of descent, and even external
righteousness, that we may become <i>partakers of Christ,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
3:14,) for all these things are gifts of God, which, in themselves, are not to
be despised? I answer, that the Apostle does not speak here so much of the
flyings themselves, as of the quality of them. It is, indeed, true, that the
kingdom of heaven is like a <i>precious pearl, </i>for the purchase of which no
one should hesitate to sell everything that he has
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401346&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:46.) There is, however, a difference between the substance of things and the
quality. Paul did not reckon it necessary to disown connection with his own
tribe and with the race of Abraham, and make himself an alien, that he might
become a Christian, but to renounce dependence upon his descent. It was not
befitting, that from being chaste he should become unchaste; that from being
sober, he should become intemperate; ,and that from being respectable and
honorable, he should become dissolute; but that he should divest himself of a
false estimate of his own righteousness, and treat it with contempt. We, too,
when treating of the righteousness of faith, do not contend against the
substance of works, but against that quality with which the sophists invest
them, inasmuch as they contend that men are justified by them. Paul, therefore,
divested himself &#8212; not of works, but of that mistaken confidence in works,
with which he had been puffed up.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to riches and honors, when we have divested
ourselves of attachment to them, we will be prepared, also, to renounce the
things themselves, whenever the Lord will require this from us, and so it ought
to be. It is not expressly necessary that you be a poor man, in order that you
may be Christian; but if it please the Lord that it should be so, you ought to
be prepared to endure poverty. In fine, it is not lawful for Christians to have
anything apart from Christ. I consider as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>apart from
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>everything that is a hinderance
in the way of Christ alone being our ground of glorying, and having an entire
sway over us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I count the but
refuse.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he not merely by words, but
also by realities, amplifies greatly what he had before stated. For those who
cast their merchandise and other things into the sea, that they may escape in
safety, do not, therefore, despise riches, but act as persons prepared rather to
live in misery and <i>want</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa182</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>than to be drowned along with their riches. They part with them, indeed, but
it is with regret and with a sigh; and when they have escaped, they bewail the
loss of them. Paul, however, declares, on the other hand, that he had not merely
abandoned everything that he formerly reckoned precious, but that they were like
<i>dung, </i>offensive to him, or were disesteemed like things that are thrown
awayin contempt. Chrysostom renders the word&#8212;<i>straws. </i>Grammarians,
however, are of opinion, that
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sku&gt;balon</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is employed as though it were
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kusi&gt;balon
</font><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8212; what is thrown to dogs</i>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may, gain

that we cannot </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gain Christ
</i></font><font face="Palatino">otherwise than by losing everything that we
have. For he would have us rich by his grace alone: he would have him alone be
our entire blessedness. Now, in what way we must suffer the loss of all things,
has been already stated&#8212;in such a manner that nothing will turn us aside
from confidence in Christ alone. But if Paul, with such innocence and integrity
of life, did not hesitate to reckon his own righteousness to be <i>loss </i>and
<i>dung, </i>what mean those Pharisees of the present day, who, while covered
over with every kind of wickedness, do nevertheless feel no shame in extolling
their own merits in opposition to Christ?</font><br></div>

however, in a very indifferent manner, as though it had no peculiar force. If

means&#8212;to recover what you have voluntarily given up, (as Budaeus shews by
various examples,) I have not hesitated to differ from the opinion of others.
For, in this way, the meaning will be more <i>complete, </i>and the doctrine the
more ample&#8212;that Paul renounced everything that he had, that he might
recover them in Christ; and this corresponds better with the word <i>gain,
</i>for it means that it was no trivial or ordinary <i>gain, </i>inasmuch as
Christ contains everything in himself. And, unquestionably, we lose nothing when
we come to Christ naked and stript. of everything, for those things which we
previously imagined, on false grounds, that we possessed, we then begin really
to acquire. He, accordingly, shews more fully, how great the riches of Christ,
because we obtain and <i>find </i>all things in him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not having mine own
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here we have a remarkable
passage, if any one is desirous to have a particular description of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
of faith, </i>and to understand its true nature. For Paul here makes a
comparison between two kinds of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>The one he speaks of as belonging to the man, while he calls it at the same
time the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness of the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>the <i>other, </i>he tells us, is
from God, is obtained through faith, and rests upon faith in Christ. These he
represents as so directly opposed to each other, that they cannot stand
together. Hence there are two things that are to be observed here. In the
<i>first </i>place, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness of the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>must be given up and renounced, that
you may be righteous through faith; and <i>secondly, </i>that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness of
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>comes forth from God, and does not
belong to the individual. As to both of these we have in the present day a great
controversy with Papists; for on the one hand, they do not allow that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness of
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is altogether from God, but
ascribe it partly to man; and, on the other hand, they mix them together, as if
the one did not destroy the other. Hence we must carefully examine the several
words made use of by Paul, for there is not one of them that is not very
emphatic.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that believers have no righteousness of
their own. Now, it cannot be denied, that if there were any righteousness of
works, it might with propriety be said to be ours. Hence he leaves no room
whatever for the righteousness of works. Why he calls it the righteousness of
the law, he shows in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:5; because this is the sentence of the law, <i>He that doeth these things
shall live in them. </i>The law, therefore, pronounces the man to be righteous
through works. Nor is there any ground for the cavil of Papists, that all this
must be restricted to ceremonies. For in the <i>first </i>place, it is a
contemptible frivolity to affirm that Paul was righteous only through
ceremonies; and <i>secondly, </i>he in this way draws a contrast between those
two kinds of righteousness &#8212; the one being of man, the other, from God. He
intimates, accordingly, that the one is the reward of works, while the other is
a free gift from God. He thus, in a general way, places man&#8217;s merit in
opposition to Christ&#8217;s grace; for while the law brings works, faith
presents man before God as naked, that he may be clothed with the righteousness
of Christ. When, therefore, he declares that the righteousness of faith is from
God, it is not simply because faith is the gift of God, but because God
justifies us by his goodness, or because we receive by faith the righteousness
which he has conferred upon us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may know
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He points out the efficacy and
nature of faith&#8212;that it is the knowledge of Christ, and that, too, not
bare or indistinct, but in such a manner that the power of his resurrection is
felt.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Resurrection</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he employs as meaning, the completion of redemption, so that it comprehends
in it at the same time the idea of death. But as it is not enough to know Christ
as crucified and raised up from the dead, unless you experience, also, the fruit
of this, he speaks expressly of efficacy 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa186</font></sup><font face="Palatino">.Christ
therefore is rightly known, when we feel how powerful his death and resurrection
are, and how efficacious they are in us. Now all things are there furnished to
us&#8212;expiation and destruction of sin, freedom from condemnation,
satisfaction, victory over death, the attainment of righteousness, and the hope
of a blessed immortality.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the fellowship of his
sufferings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Having spoken of that
freely-conferred righteousness, which was procured for us through the
resurrection of Christ, and is obtained by us through faith, he proceeds to
treat of the exercises of the pious, and that in order that it might not seem as
though he introduced an inactive faith, which produces no effects in the life.
He also intimates, indirectly, that these are the exercises in which the Lord
would have his people employ themselves; while the false Apostles pressed
forward upon them the useless elements of ceremonies. Let every one, therefore,
who has become through faith a partaker of all Christ&#8217;s benefits,
acknowledge that a condition is presented to him&#8212;that his whole life be
conformed to his death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, however, a twofold participation and
fellowship in the death of Christ. The <i>one </i>is inward&#8212;what the
Scripture is wont to term the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mortification of the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>crucifixion of the old
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>of which Paul treats in the sixth
chapter of the Romans; the <i>other </i>is outward&#8212;what is termed the
<i>mortification of the outward man. </i>It is the endurance of the Cross, of
which he treats in the eighth chapter of the same Epistle, and here also, if I
do not mistake. For after introducing along with this the <i>power of his
resurrection, </i>Christ crucified is set before us, that we may follow him
through tribulations and distresses; and hence the resurrection of the dead is
expressly made mention of, that we may know that we must die before we live.
This is a continued subject of meditation to believers so long as they sojourn
in this world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, however, is a choice consolation, that in all
our miseries we are partakers of Christ&#8217;s Cross, if we are his members; so
that thrc,ugh afflictions the way is opened up for us to everlasting
blessedness, as we read elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">If we die with him, we
shall also live with him; if we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Timothy 2:11,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must all therefore be prepared for this&#8212;that
our whole life shall represent nothing else than the image of death, until it
produce death itself, as the life of Christ is nothing else than a prelude of
death. We enjoy, however, in the mean time, this consolation&#8212;that the end
is everlasting blessedness. For the death of Christ is connected with the
resurrection. Hence Paul says, that he is conformed to his death, that he may
attain the glory of the resurrection. The phrase, <i>if by any means, </i>does
not indicate doubt, but expresses difficulty, with a view to stimulate our
earnest endeavor
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa187</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for it
is no light contest, inasmuch as we must struggle against so many and so serious
hinderances.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not as though I had already
apprehended</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Paul insists upon <i>this,
</i>that he may convince the Philippiaris that he thinks of nothing but
Christ&#8212;knows nothing else&#8212;desires nothing else&#8212;is occupied
with no other subject of meditation. In connection with this, there is much
weight in what he now adds&#8212;that he himself, while he had given up all
hinderances, had nevertheless not attained <i>that </i>object of aim, and that,
on this account, he always aimed and eagerly aspired at something further. How
much more was this incumbent on the Philipplans, who were still far behind
him?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is asked, however, what it is that Paul says he
has not yet attained? For unquestionably, so soon as we are by faith ingrafted
into the body of Christ, we have already entered the kingdom of God, and, as it
is stated in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:6, we already, in hope, <i>sit in heavenly places. </i>I answer, that our
salvation, in the mean time, is in hope, so that the inheritance indeed is
secure; but we nevertheless have it not as yet in possession. At the same time,
Paul here looks at something else&#8212;the advancement of faith, and of that
mortification of which he had made mention. He had said that he aimed and
eagerly aspired at the resurrection of the dead through fellowship in the Cross
of Christ. He adds, that he has not as yet arrived at this. At what? At the
attainment of having entire fellowship in Christ&#8217;s sufferings, having a
full taste of the power of his resurrection, and knowing him perfectly. He
teaches, therefore, by his own example, that we ought to make progress, and that
the knowledge of Christ is an attainment of such difficulty, that even those who
apply themselves exclusively to it, do nevertheless not attain perfection in it
so long as they live. This, however, does not detract in any degree from the
authority of Paul&#8217;s doctrine, inasmuch as he had acquired as much as was
sufficient for discharging the office committed to him. In the mean time, it was
necessary for him to make progress, that this divinely-furnished instructor of
all might be trained to humility.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As also I have been
apprehended</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This clause he has inserted
by way of correction, that he might ascribe all his endeavors to the grace of
God. It is not of much importance whether you read <i>as, </i>or <i>in so far
as; </i>for the meaning in either case remains the same&#8212;that Paul was
apprehended by Christ, that he might apprehend Christ; that is, that he did
nothing except under Christ&#8217;s influence and guidance. I have chosen,
however, the more distinct rendering, as it seemed to be
optional.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I reckon not myself to have as
yet apprehended</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He does not here call
in question the certainty of his salvation, as though he were still in suspense,
but repeats what he had said before&#8212;that he still aimed at making farther
progress, because he had not yet attained the end of his calling. He shews this
immediately after, by saying that he was intent on this one thing, leaving off
everything else. Now, he compares our life to a race-course, the limits of which
God has marked out to us for running in. For as it would profit the runner
nothing to have left the starting-point, unless he went forward to the goal, so
we must also pursue the course of our calling until death, and must not cease
until we have obtained what we seek. Farther, as the way is marked out to the
runner, that he may not fatigue himself to no purpose by wandering in this
direction or in that, so there is also a goal set before us, towards which we
ought to direct our course undeviatingly; and God does not permit us to wander
about heedlessly. Thirdly, as the runner requires to be free from entanglement,
and not stop his course on account of any impediment, but must continue his
course, surmounting every obstacle, so we must take heed that we do not apply
our mind or heart to anything that may divert the attention, but must, on the
contrary, make it our endeavor, that, free from every distraction, we may apply
the whole bent of our mind exclusively to God&#8217;s calling. These three
things Paul comprehends in one similitude. When he says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>does this one
thing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and forgets all things that are
behind, he intimates his assiduity, and excludes everything fitted to distract.
When he says that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>presses
toward the mark</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he intimates that he is
not wandering from the way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Forgetting those things that are
behind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He alludes to runners, who do
not turn their eyes aside in any direction, lest they should slacken the speed
of their course, and, more especially, do not look behind to see how much ground
they have gone over, but hasten forward unremittingly towards the goal, Thus
Paul teaches us, that he does not think of what he has been, or of what he has
done, but simply presses forward towards the appointed goal, and that, too, with
such ardor, that he runs forward to it, as it were, with outstretched arms. For
a metaphor of this nature is implied in the participle which he employs. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa189</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Should any one remark, by way of objection, that the
remembrance of our past; life is of use for stirring us up, both because the
favors that have been already conferred upon us give us encouragement to
entertain hope, and because we are admonished by our sins to amend our course of
life, I answer, that thoughts of this nature do not turn away our view from what
is before us to what is behind, but rather help our vision, so that we discern
more distinctly the goal. Paul, however, condemns here such looking back, as
either destroys or impairs alacrity. Thus, for example, should any one persuade
himself that he has made sufficiently great progress, reckoning that he has done
enough, he will become indolent, and feel inclined to <i>deliver up the lamp</i>
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa190</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to others; or, if any one looks back with a feeling of regret for the
situation that he has abandoned, he cannot apply the whole bent of his mind to
what he is engaged in. Such was the nature of the thoughts from which
Paul&#8217;s mind required to be turned away, if he would in good earnest follow
out Christ&#8217;s calling. As, however, there has been mention made here of
endeavor, aim, course, perseverance, lest any one should imagine that salvation
consists in these things, or should even ascribe to human industry what comes
from another quarter, with the view of pointing out the cause of all these
things, he adds&#8212;in </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ
Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As many as are
perfect</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Lest any one should understand
this as spoken of the generality of mankind, as though he were explaining the
simple elements to those that are mere children in Christ, he declares that it
is a rule which all that are perfect ought to fol1ow. Now, the rule is
this&#8212;that we must renounce confidence in all things, that we may glory in
Christ&#8217;s righteousness alone, and preferring it to everything else, aspire
after a participation in his sufferings, which may be the means of conducting us
to a blessed resurrection. Where now will be that state of perfection which
monks dream of&#8212;where the confused medley of such
contrivances&#8212;-where, in short, the whole system of Popery, which is
nothing else than an imaginary perfection, that has nothing in common with this
rule of Paul? Undoubtedly, whoever will understand this single term, will
clearly perceive that everything that is taught in the Papacy, as to the
attainment of righteousness and salvation, is nauseous dung.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If in anything
otherwise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By the same means he both
humbles them, and inspires them with good hope, for he admonishes them not to be
elated in their ignorance, and at the same time he bids them be of good courage,
when he says that we must wait for the revelation of God. For we know how great
an obstacle to truth obstinacy is. This, therefore, is the best preparation for
docility&#8212;when we do not take pleasure in error. Paul, accordingly, teaches
indirectly, that we must make way for the revelation of God, if we have not yet
attained what we seek. Farther, when he teaches that we must advance by degrees,
he encourages them not to draw back in the middle of the course. At the same
time, he maintains beyond all controversy what he has previously taught, when he
teaches that others who differ from him will have a revelation given to them of
what they do not as yet know. For it is as though he had said, &#8212;
&#8220;The Lord will one day shew you that the very thing which I have stated is
a perfect rule of true knowledge and of right living.&#8221;No one could speak
in this manner, if he were not fully assured of the reasonableness and accuracy
of his doctrine. Let us in the mean time learn also from this passage, that we
must bear for a time with ignorance in our weak brethren, and forgive them, if
it is not given them immediately to be altogether of one mind with us. Paul felt
assured as to his doctrine, and yet he allows those who could not as yet receive
it time to make progress, and he does not cease on that account to regard them
as brethren, only he cautions them against flattering themselves hi their
ignorance. The rendering of the Latin copies

part, I rather prefer a different reading, implying that Paul exhorts the

with a <i>pure conscience,

understandings to Christ. For in the imitating of Paul all these excellences are
included-pure zeal, fear of the Lord, modesty, self-renunciation, docility,
love, and desire of concord. He bids them, however, be at one and the same time
imitators of him; that is, all with one consent, and with one
mind.</font><br></div>

opinion, is this- </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Many walk who
mind earthly things, </i></font><font face="Palatino">meaning by this, that
there are many who creep upon the ground
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa193</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, not
feeling the power of God&#8217;s kingdom. He mentions, however, in connection
with this, the marks by which such persons may be distinguished. These we will
examine, each in its order. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>earthly
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>some understand ceremonies, and
the outward elements of the world, which cause true piety to be forgotten, I
prefer, however, to view the term as referring to carnal affection, as meaning
that those who are not regenerated by the Spirit of God think of nothing but the
world. This will appear more distinctly from what follows; for he holds them up
to odium on this ground&#8212;that, being desirous exclusively of their own
honor, ease, and gain, they had no regard to the edification of the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of whom I have told you
often</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He shews that it is not without
good reason that he has often warned the Philippians, inasmuch as he now
endeavors to remind them by letter of the same things as he had formerly spoken
of to them when present with them. His tears, also, are an evidence that he is
not influenced by envy or hatred of men, nor by any disposition to revile, nor
by insolence of temper, but by pious zeal, inasmuch as he sees that the Church
is miserably destroyed 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa194</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by
such pests. It becomes us, assuredly, to be affected in such a manner, that on
seeing that the place of pastors is occupied by wicked and worthless persons, we
shall sigh, and give evidence, at least by our tears, that we feel deeply
grieved for the calamity of the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is of importance, also, to take notice of whom
Paul speaks&#8212;not of open enemies, who were avowedly desirous that doctrine
might be undermined&#8212;but of impostors and profligates, who trampled under
foot the power of the gospel, for the sake of ambition or of their own belly.
And unquestionably persons of this sort, who weaken the influence of the
ministry by seeking their own interests 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa195</font></sup><font face="Palatino">,
sometimes do more injury than if they openly opposed Christ. We must, therefore,
by no means spare them, but must point them out with the finger, as often as
there is occasion. Let them complain afterwards, as much as they choose, of our
severity, provided they do not allege anything against us that it is not in our
power to justify from Paul&#8217;s example.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they are the enemies of the
cross of Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some explain <i>cross
</i>to mean the whole mystery of redemption, and they explain that this is said
of them, because, by preaching the law, they made void the benefit of
Christ&#8217;s death. Others, however, understand it as meaning, that they
shunned the cross, and were not prepared to expose themselves to dangers for the
sake of Christ. I understand it, however, in a more general way, as meaning
that, while they pretended to be friends, they were, nevertheless, the worst
enemies of the gospel. For it is no unusual thing for Paul to employ the term
<i>cross to </i>mean the entire preaching of the gospel. For as he says
elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">If any man is in Christ,
let him be a new
creature.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2

the Philippians, appalled by the danger, may be so much the more carefully on
their guard, that they may not involve themselves in the ruin of those persons.
As, however, profligates of this description, by means of show and various
artifices, frequently dazzle the eyes of the simple for a time, in such a manner
that they are preferred even to the most eminent servants of Christ, the Apostle
declares, with great confidence 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa197</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, that
the glory with which they are now puffed up will be exchanged for
ignominy.</font><br></div>

circumcision and other ceremonies, he says that they did not do so from zeal for
the law, but with a view to the favor of men, and that they might live
peacefully and free from annoyance. For they saw that the Jews burned with a
fierce rage against; Paul, and those like him, and that Christ could not be
proclaimed by them in purity with any other result, than that of arousing
against themselves the same rage. Accordingly, consulting their own ease and
advantage, they mixed up these corruptions with the view of mitigating the
flames of others.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa198</font></sup><br></div>

empty shows, in which pretended ministers of the gospel are accustomed to glory,
and he indirectly holds up to odium all their objects of aim 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa199</font></sup><font face="Palatino">,
because, by flying about above the earth, they do not aspire towards heaven. For
he teaches that nothing is to be reckoned of any value except God&#8217;s
spiritual kingdom, because believers ought to lead a heavenly life in this
world. <i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They mind

befitting that we, whose
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>conversation is in

them.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa200</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We
are, it is true, intermingled here with unbelievers and hypocrites; nay more,
the chaff has more of appearance in the granary of the Lord than wheat. Farther,
we are exposed to the common inconveniences of this earthly life; we require,
also, meat and drink, and other necessaries, but we must, nevertheless, be
conversant with heaven in mind and affection. For, on the one hand, we must pass
quietly through this life, and, on the other hand, we must be dead to the world
that Christ may live in us, and that we, in our turn, may live to him. This
passage is a most abundant source of many exhortations, which it were easy for
any one to elicit from it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whence
also.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From the connection that we have
with Christ, he proves that our citizenship 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa201</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is a
heaven, for it is not seemly that the members should be separated from their
Head. Accordingly, as Christ is in heaven, in order that we may be conjoined
with him, it is necessary that we should in spirit dwell apart from this world.
Besides,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">where our treasure is,
there is our heart
also.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
6:21.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Christ, who is our blessedness and glory, is in
heaven: let our souls, therefore, dwell with him on high. On this account he
expressly calIs him <i>Savior. </i>Whence does salvation come to us? Christ will
come to us from heaven as a <i>Savior. </i>Hence it were unbefitting that we
should be taken up with this earth 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa202</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. This
epithet, <i>Savior, </i>is suited to the Connection of the passage; for we are
said to be in heaven in respect of our minds on this account, that it is from
that source alone that the hope of salvation beams forth upon us. As the coming
of Christ will be terrible to the wicked, so it rather turns away their minds
from heaven than draws them thither: for they know that he will come to them as
a Judge, and they shun him so far as is in their power. From these words of Paul
pious minds derive the sweetest consolation, as instructing them that the coming
of Christ is to be desired by them, inasmuch as it will bring salvation to them.
On the other hand, it is a sure token of incredulity, when persons tremble on
any mention being made of it. See the <i>eighth </i>chapter of the Romans.
While, however, others are transported with vain desires, Paul would have
believers contented with Christ alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, we learn from this passage that nothing mean
or earthly is to be conceived of as to Christ, inasmuch as Paul bids us look
upward to heaven, that we may seek him. Now, those that reason with subtlety
that Christ is not shut up or hid in some corner of heaven, with the view of
proving that his body is everywhere, and fills heaven and earth, say indeed
something that is true, but not the whole: for as it were rash and foolish to
mount up beyond the heavens, and assign to Christ a station, or seat, or place
of walking, in this or that region, so it is a foolish and destructive madness
to draw him down from heaven by any carnal consideration, so as to seek him upon
earth. Up, then, with our hearts 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa203</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, that
they may be with the Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who will
change</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this argument he stirs up the
Philipplans still farther to lift up their minds to heaven, and be wholly
attached to Christ&#8212;because this body which we carry about with us is not
an everlasting abode, but a frail tabernacle, which will in a short time be
reduced to nothing. Besides, it is liable to so many miseries, and so many
dishonorable infirmities, that it may justly be spoken of as <i>vile </i>and
full of ignominy. Whence, then, is its restoration to be hoped for? From heaven,
at Christ&#8217;s coming. Hence there is no part of us that ought not to aspire
after heaven with undivided affection. We see, on the one hand, in life, but
chiefly in death, the present meanness of our bodies; the glory which they will
have, conformably to Christ&#8217;s body, is incomprehensible by us: for if the
disciples could not endure the slight taste which he afforded 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa204</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in his
transfiguration,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
17:6,) which of us could attain its fullness? Let us for the present be
contented with the evidence of our adoption, being destined to know the riches
of our inheritance when we shall come to the enjoyment of them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the
efficacy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As nothing is more difficult
to believe, or more at variance with carnal perception, than the resurrection,
Paul on this account places before our eyes the boundless power of God, that it
may entirely remove all doubt; for distrust arises from this&#8212;that we
measure the thing itself by the narrowness of our own understanding. Nor does he
simply make mention of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>power</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but also of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>efficacy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which is the effect, or power showing itself in action, so to speak. Now,
when we bear in mind that God, who created all things out of nothing, can
command the earth, and the sea, and the other elements, to render back what has
been committed to them 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa205</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, our
minds are immediately roused up to a firm hope&#8212;nay, even to a spiritual
contemplation of the resurrection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is of importance to take notice, also, that
the right and power of raising the dead, nay more, of doing everything according
to his own pleasure, is assigned to the person of Christ&#8212;an encomium by
which his Divine majesty is illustriously set forth. Nay, farther, we gather
from this, that the world was created by him, for to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>subject all things to
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>belongs to the Creator
alone.</font><br></div>

appellations

at the same time are not dictated by flattery, but by sincere affection. He

had been gained over through his instrumentality persevering in the faith 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa207</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, he

approved of by him. At the same time, the particle <i>so </i>might be taken as
referring to the doctrine going before; but the former view is more suitable, so
that, by praising their present condition, he exhorts them to perseverance. They
had already, it is true, given some evidence of their constancy. Paul, however,
well knowing human weakness, reckons that they have need of confirmation for the
future.</font><br></div>

received opinion that Paul was desirous to settle a quarrel, I know not of what
sort, between those two women. While I am not inclined to contend as to this,
the words of Paul do not afford ground enough for such a conjecture to satisfy
us that it really was so. It appears, from the testimony which he gives in their
favor, that they were very excellent women; for he assigns to them so much honor
as to call them fellow-soldiers in the gospel

Hence, as their agreement was a matter of great moment

he stirs them up particularly to concord.</font><br></div>

speaks of agreement, he adds also the bond of it&#8212;<i>in the</i> <i>Lord.

whether he addresses here a man or a woman. At the same time there is excessive
weakness in the argument of Erasmus, who infers that it is a woman from the
circumstance, that mention is made here of other women&#8212;as though he did
not immediately subjoin the name of Clement in the same connection. I refrain,
however, from that dispute: only I maintain that it is not Paul&#8217;s wife
that is designated by this appellation. Those who maintain this, quote Clement
and Ignatius as their authorities. If they quoted correctly, I would not
certainly despise men of such eminence. But as writings are brought forward from
Eusebius

<div><font face="Palatino">Let us, therefore, inquire as to the thing itself,
without taking any false impression from the opinions of men. When Paul wrote

<div><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He wrote that Epistle at Ephesus 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa215</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whenhe
was prepared to leave it. Not long after, he proceeded to Jerusalem, where he
was put in prison, and sent to Rome. Every one must perceive how unsuitable a
period of time it would have been for marrying a wife, spent by him partly in
journeying, and partly in prison. In addition to this, he was even at that time
prepared to endure imprisonment and persecutions, as he himself testifies,
according to Luke.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
21:1.3.) I am, at the same time, well aware what objection is usually brought
forward in opposition to thist&#8212; that Paul, though married, refrained from
conjugal intercourse. The words, however, convey another meaning, for he is
desirous that unmarried persons may have it in their power to remain in the same
condition with himself. Now, what is that condition but celibacy? As to their
bringing forward that passage&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Is it not lawful for me

occasions, and in which it is probable he never remained so much as two whole
months? In fine, nothing is more unlikely than that he speaks here of his wife;
and to me it does not seem probable that he speaks of any female. I leave it,
however, to the judgment of my readers. The word which Paul makes use of here

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>book of
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is the roll of the righteous, who
are predestinated to life, as in the writings of Moses.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;023232&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
32:32.) God has this roll beside himself in safe keeping. Hence the book is
nothing else than His eternal counsel, fixed in His own breast. In place of this
term, Ezekiel employs this <i>expression&#8212;the writing of the house of
Israel. </i>With the same view it is said in</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Let them be blotted out

rashly in usurping to himself the right of pronouncing as to the secrets of God,
I answer, that we may in some measure form a judgment from the token by which
God manifests his election, but only in so far as our capacity admits. In all
those, therefore, in whom we see the marks of adoption shine forth, let us in
the mean time reckon those to be the sons of God until the <i>books are opened,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;662012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Revelation

to God alone now to <i>know them that are his,

submit themselves to Christ as their Shepherd

betake themselves to his fold, and remain there constantly. It is our part to
set so high a value upon the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which he confers
peculiarly on his elect, that they shall be to us the seals, as it were, of an
election which is hid from us.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rejoice in the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is an exhortation suited to the
times; for, as the condition of the pious was exceedingly troublous, and dangers
threatened them on every side, it was possible that they might give way,
overcome by grief or impatience 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa221</font></sup><font face="Palatino">.Hence
he enjoins it upon them, that, amidst circumstances of hostility and
disturbance, they should nevertheless
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rejoice in the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa222</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as assuredly these spiritual consolations, by means of which the Lord
refreshes and gladdens us, ought <i>then </i>most of all to show their efficacy
when the whole world tempts us to despair. Let us, however, in connection with
the circumstances of the times, consider what efficacy there must have been in
this word uttered by the mouth of Paul, who might have had special occasion of
sorrow 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa223</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For if
they are appalled by persecutions, or imprisonments, or exile, or death, here is
the Apostle setting himself forward, who, amidst imprisonments, in the very heat
of persecution, and in fine, amidst apprehensions of death, is not merely
himself joyful, but even stirs up others to joy. The sum, then, is
this&#8212;that come what may, believers, having the Lord standing on their side
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa224</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, have
amply sufficient ground of joy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The repetition of the exhortation serves to give
greater force to it: Let this be your strength and stability, to <i>rejoice in
the Lord, </i>and that, too, not for a moment merely, but so that your joy in
him may be perpetuated 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa225</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. For
unquestionably it differs from the joy of the world in this respect - that we
know from experience that the joy of the world is deceptive, frail, and fading,
and Christ even pronouces it to be accursed
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420625&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
6:25). Hence, tht only is a settled joy in God which is such as is never taken
away from us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your
moderation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This may be explained in two
ways. We may understand him as bidding them rather give up their right, than
that any one should have occasion to complain of their sharpness or severity.
<i>&#8220;Let </i>all that have to deal with you have experience of your equity
and humanity.&#8221;In this way to <i>know, </i>will mean to <i>experience.
</i>Or we may understand him as exhorting them to endure all things with
equanimity 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa226</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. This
latter meaning I rather prefer; for is a term that is made use of by the Greeks
themselves to denote moderation of spirit&#8212;when we are not easily moved by
injuries, when we are not easily annoyed by adversity, but retain equanimity of
temper. In accordance with this, Cicero makes use of the following
expression,&#8212; &#8220;My mind is tranquil, which takes everything in good
part.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa227</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Such
equanimity&#8212;which is as it were the mother of patience &#8212;he requires
here on the part of the Philippians, and, indeed, such as will manifest itself
to all, according as occasion will require, by producing its proper effects. The
term <i>modesty </i>does not seem appropriate here, because Paul is not in this
passage cautioning them against haughty insolence, but directs them to conduct
themselves peaceably in everything, and exercise control over themselves, even
in the endurance of injuries or inconveniences.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord is at
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here we have an <i>aaticipation,
</i>by which he obviates an objection that might be brought forward. For carnal
sense rises in opposition to the foregoing statement. For as the rage of the
wicked is the more inflamed in proportion to our mildness 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa228</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, and
the more they see us prepared for enduring, are the more emboldened to inflict
injuries, we are with difficulty induced to <i>possess our souls in patience.
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
21:19.) Hence those proverbs,&#8212; &#8220;<i>We </i>must howl when among
wolves.&#8221;&#8221;Those who act like sheep will quickly be devoured by
wolves.&#8221;Hence we conclude, that the ferocity of the wicked must be
repressed by corresponding violence, that they may not insult us with impunity 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa229</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. To
such considerations Paul here opposes confidence in Divine providence. He
replies, I say, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Lord is
at hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>whose power can overcome their
audacity, and whose goodness can conquer their malice. He promises that he will
aid us, provided we obey his commandment. Now, who would not rather be protected
by the hand of God alone, than have all the resources of the world at his
command?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here we have a most beautiful sentiment, from which
we learn, in the <i>first </i>place, that ignorance of the providence of God is
the cause of all impatience, and that this is the reason why we are so quickly,
and on trivial accounts, thrown into confusion 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa230</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, and
often, too, become disheartened because we do not recognize the fact that the
Lord cares for us. On the other hand, we learn that this is the only remedy for
tranquillizing our minds&#8212;when we repose unreservedly in his providential
care, as knowing that we are not exposed either to the rashness of fortune, or
to the caprice of the wicked 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa231</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, but
are under the regulation of God&#8217;s fatherly care. In fine, the man that is
in possession of this truth, that God is present with him, has what he may rest
upon with security.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are, however, two ways in which
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is said to be <i>at
</i>hand&#8212;either because his judgment is at hand, or because he is prepared
to give help to his own people, in which sense it is made use of here; and also
in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19E518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
145:18, <i>The Lord is near to all that call upon him. </i>The meaning therefore
<i>is,&#8212; </i>&#8220;Miserable were the condition of the pious, if the Lord
were at a distance from them.&#8221;But as he has received them under his
protection and guardianship, and defends them by his hand, which is everywhere
present, let them rest upon this consideration, that they may not be intimidated
by the rage of the wicked. It is well known, and matter of common occurrence,
that the term solicitudo (carefulness) is employed to denote that anxiety which
proceeds from distrust of Divine power or help.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But in all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is the singular number that
is made use of by Paul, but is the neuter gender; the expression, therefore, is
equivalent to <i>omni negotio, (in every matter,</i>) for (<i>prayer</i>) and
(<i>supplication</i>) are feminine nouns. In these words he exhorts the
Philippians, as David does all the pious in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
55:22, and Peter also in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:7, to <i>cast all their care upon the Lord. </i>For we are not made of
iron  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa232</font></sup><font face="Palatino">,
so as not to be shaken by temptations. But this is our consolation, this is our
solace &#8212;to deposit, or (to speak with greater propriety) to disburden in
the bosom of God everything that harasses us. Confidence, it is true, brings
tranquil!ity to our minds, but it is only in the event of our exercising
ourselves in prayers. Whenever, therefore, we are assailed by any temptation,
let us betake ourselves forthwith to prayer, as to a sacred asylum. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa233</font></sup><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>requests</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he employs here to denote desires or wishes. He would have us make these
known to God by prayer and supplication, as though believers poured forth their
hearts before God, when they commit themselves, and all that they have, to Him.
Those, indeed, who look hither and thither to the vain comforts of the world,
may appear to be in some degree relieved; but there is one sure
refuge&#8212;-leaning upon the Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With
thanksgiving</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As many often pray to God
amiss 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa234</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, full
of complaints or of murmurings, as though they had just ground for accusing him,
while others cannot brook delay, if he does not immediately gratify their
desires, Paul on this account conjoins thanksgiving with prayers. It is as
though he had said, that those things which are necessary for us ought to be
desired by us from the Lord in such a way, that we, nevertheless, subject our
affections to his good pleasure, and give thanks while presenting petitions.
And, unquestionably, gratitude 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa235</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> will
have this effect upon us&#8212;that the will of God will be the grand sum of our
desires.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the peace of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some, by turning the future tense
into the optative mood, convert this statement into a prayer, but it is without
proper foundation. For it is a promise in which he points out the advantage of a
firm confidence in God, and invocation of him. <i>&#8220;If </i>you do
that,&#8221;says he,
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the peace of God
will keep your minds and hearts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221;
</i>Scripture is accustomed to divide the soul of man, as to its frailties, into
two parts&#8212;the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>means the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>understanding</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>while the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>denotes all the <i>disposition </i>or <i>inclinations. </i>These two terms,
therefore, include the entire soul, in this sense,&#8212; &#8220;The peace of
God will guard you, so as to prevent you from turning back from God in wicked
thoughts or desires.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is on good ground that he calls it the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>inasmuch as it does not depend on
the present aspect of things 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa236</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, and
does not bend itself to the various shiftings of the world 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa237</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, but
is founded on the firm and immutable word of God. It is on good grounds, also,
that he speaks of it as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>surpassing all understanding or
perception</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for nothing is more foreign
to the human mind, than in the depth of despair to exercise, nevertheless, a
feeling of hope, in the depth of poverty to see <i>opulence, </i>and in the
depth of weakness to keep from giving way, and, in fine, to promise ourselves
that nothing will be wanting to us when we are left destitute of all things; and
all this in the grace of God alone, which is not itself known otherwise than
through the word, and the inward earnest of the Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Finally</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>What follows consists of general exhortations which relate to the whole of
life. In the <i>first </i>place, he commends <i>truth, </i>which is nothing else
than the integrity of a good conscience, with the fruits of it: <i>secondly,
gravity, </i>or <i>sanctity, </i>for 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa238</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
denotes both&#8212;an excellence which consists in this, that we walk in a
manner <i>worthy of our vocation,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:1,) keeping at a distance from all profane filthiness: <i>thirdly, justice,
</i>which has to do with the mutual intercourse of mankind&#8212;-that we do not
injure any one, that we do not defraud any one: and, <i>fourthly, purity,
</i>which denotes chastity in every department of life. Paul, however, does not
reckon all these things to be sufficient, if we do not at the same time endeavor
to make ourselves agreeable to all, in so far as we may lawfully do so in the
Lord, and have regard also to our good name. For it is in this way that I
understand the words</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any
praise</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa239</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, <i>anything praiseworthy, </i>for amidst such a corruption of
manners there is so great a perversity in men&#8217;s judgments that praise is
often bestowed 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa240</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> upon
what is blameworthy, and it is not allowable for Christians to be desirous even
of true praise among men, inasmuch as they are elsewhere forbidden to <i>glory,
except in God alone.
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:31.) Paul, therefore. does not bid them try to gain applause or
commendation by virtuous actions, nor even to regulate their life according to
the judgments of the people, but simply means, that they should devote
themselves to the performance of good works, which merit commendation, that the
wicked, and those who are enemies of the gospel, while they deride Christians
and cast reproach upon them, may, nevertheless, be constrained to commend their
deportment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word <i>, </i>however, among the Greeks, is
employed, like <i>cogitare </i>among the Latins, to mean, <i>meditate</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa241</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Now <i>meditation </i>comes first, afterwards follows
<i>action.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>

and received, and heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this
accumulation of terms he intimates, that he was assiduous in inculcating these
things. <i>&#8220;This </i>was my doctrine&#8212;my instruction&#8212;my
discourse among you.&#8221;Hypocrites, on the other hand, insisted upon nothing
but ceremonies. Now, it was a dishonorable thing to abandon the holy instruction
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa242</font></sup><font face="Palatino">,which
they had wholly imbibed, and with which they had been thorouglly
imbued.</font><br></div>

speaker 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa243</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> should
be, that he may speak, not with his mouth merely, but by his life, and procure
authority for his doctrine by rectitude of life. Paul, accordingly, procures
authority for his exhortation on this ground, that he had, by his life no less
than by his mouth, been a leader and master of virtues.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the God of
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. He </i>had spoken of the <i>peace of
God; </i>he now more particularly confirms what he had said, by promising that
God himself, the Author of peace, will be with them. For the presence of God
brings us every kind of blessing: as though he had said, that they would feel
that God was present with them to make all things turn out well and
prosperously, provided they apply themselves to pious and holy

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I
rejoiced</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now declares the gratitude
of his mind towards the Philippians, that they may not regret their beneficence 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa244</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, as is
usually the case when we think that our services are despised, or are reckoned
of no account. They had sent him by Epaphroditus supplies for the relief of his
necessity; he declares that their present had been acceptable to him, and he
says, that he rejoiced that they had plucked up new vigor so as to exercise care
respecting him. The metaphor is borrowed from trees, the strength of which is
drawn inward, and lies concealed during winter, and begins to flourish 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa245</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in
spring. But immediately afterwards subjoining a correction, he qualifies what he
had said, that he may not seem to reprove their negligence in the past. He says,
therefore, that they had formerly, too, been concerned respecting him, but that
the circumstances of the times had not admitted of his being sooner relieved by
their benignity. Thus he throws the blame upon the want of opportunity. I take
the phrase as referring to the person of Paul, and that is its proper
signification, as well as more in accordance with the connection of Paul&#8217;s
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not that I speak with respect to
want</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here we have <i>a second
</i>correction, by which he guards against its being suspected that his spirit
was pusillanimous and broken down by adversities. For it was of importance that
his constancy and moderation should be known by the Philippians, to whom he was
a pattern of life. Accordingly he declares, that he had been gratified by their
liberality in such a way that he could at the same time endure want with
patience.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Want</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>refers here to disposition, for that man can never be poor in mind, who is
satisfied with the lot which has been assigned to him by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In what state I
am</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he, that is, <i>&#8220;Whatever
</i>my condition may be, I am satisfied with it.&#8221;Why? because saints know
that they thus please God. Hence they do not measure sufficiency by abundance,
but by the will of God, which they judge of by what takes place, for they are
persuaded that their affairs are regulated by his providence and good
pleasure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I know both how to be
abased</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There follows here a
distinction, with the view of intimating that he has a mind adapted to bear any
kind of condition 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa246</font></sup><font face="Palatino">.
Prosperity is wont to puff up the mind beyond measure, and adversity, on the
other hand, to depress. From both faults he declares himself to be free.

he,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> to be

abasement with patience. is made use of twice, but in the former instance it is
employed as meaning, to <i>excel; </i>in the <i>second </i>instance, as meaning,
to <i>abound, </i>so as to correspond with the things to which they are exposed.
If a man knows to make use of present abundance in a sober and temperate manner,
with thanksgiving, prepared to part with everything whenever it may be the good
pleasure of the Lord, giving also a share to his brother, according to the
measure of his ability, and is also not puffed up, that man has learned to
<i>excel, </i>and to <i>abound. </i>This is a peculiarly excellent and rare
virtue, and much superior to the endurance of poverty. Let all who wish to be
Christ&#8217;s disciples exercise themselves in acquiring this knowledge which
was possessed by Paul, but in the mean time let them accustom themselves to the
endurance of poverty in such a manner that it will not be grievous and
burdensome to them when they come to be deprived of their
riches.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

he had boasted of things that were very great 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa247</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, in
order that this might not be attributed to pride or furnish others with occasion
of foolish boasting, he adds, that it is by Christ that he is endowed with this
fortitude. &#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I can do all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>&#8221; says <i>he,
&#8220;</i>but it is in Christ, not by my own power, for it is Christ that
supplies me with strength.&#8221; Hence we infer, that Christ will not be less
strong and invincible in us also, if, conscious of our own weakness, we place
reliance upon his power alone. When he says <i>all things, </i>he means merely
those things which belong to his calling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.

well</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>How prudently and cautiously he
acts, looking round carefully in both directions, that he may not lean too much
to the one side or to the other. By proclaiming in magnificent terms his
steadfastness, he meant to provide against the Philippians supposing that he had
given way under the pressure of want?
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa248</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He now
takes care that it may not, from his speaking in high terms, appear as though he
despised their kindness&#8212;a thing that would not merely shew cruelty and
obstinacy, but also haughtiness. He at the same time provides for this, that if
any other of the servants of Christ should stand in need of their assistance
they may not be slow to give him help.</font><br></div>

added by way of excuse, inasmuch as he often received something from them, for
if the other Churches had discharged their duty, it might have seemed as though
he were too eager to receive. Hence in clearing himself he praises them, and in
praising them he modestly excuses others. We must also, after Paul&#8217;s
example, take heed lest the pious, on seeing us too much inclined to receive
from others, should on good grounds reckon us to be insatiable.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You also
know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he. <i>&#8220;I </i>do not
require to call in other witnesses, for ye yourselves also know.&#8221;For it
frequently happens, that when one thinks that others are deficient in duty, he
is the more liberal in giving assistance.Thus the liberality of some escapes the
notice of others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the matter of giving and
receiving</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He alludes to pecuniary
matters, in which there are two parts, the one <i>receiving, </i>the other
<i>expending. </i>It is necessary that these should be brought to an equality by
mutual compensation. There was an account of this nature carried on between Paul
and the Churches 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa249</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. While
Paul administered the gospel to them, there was an obligation devolving upon
them in return for supplying what was necessary for the support of his life, as
he says elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">If we dispense to you
spiritual thinqs, is it a great matter if you give in return carnal things?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1

<div><font face="Palatino">Hence, if the other churches had relieved
Paul&#8217;s necessities, they would have been giving nothing gratuitously, but
would have been simply paying their debt, for they ought to have aclcnowledged
themselves indebted to him for the gospel. This, however, he acknowledges, had
not been the case, inasmuch as they had not laid out anything on his account.
What base ingratitude, and how very unseemly, to treat such an Apostle with
neglect, to whom they knew themselves to be under obligation beyond their power
to discharge! On the other hand, how great the forbearance of this holy man, to
bear with their inhumanity with so much gentleness and indulgence, as not to
make use of one sharp word by way of accusing them!</font><br></div>

that it was an indirect hint

so much his own advantage as theirs. &#8220;While I receive from you,&#8221;says
he, <i>&#8220;there </i>is proportionably much advantage that redounds to
yourselves; for there are just so many articles that you may reckon to have been
transferred to the table of accounts.&#8221;The meaning of this word 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa252</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is
connected with the similitude formerly employed of exchange or compensation in
pecuniary matters.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b><i>.

and abound</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He declares in more explicit
terms, that he has what is sufficient, and honors their liberality with a
remarkable testimony, by saying, that he <i>has been filled. </i>It was
undoubtedly a moderate sum that they had sent, but he says, that by means of
that moderate sum he is filled to satiety. It is, however, a more distinguished
commendation that he bestows upon the gift in what follows, when he calls it a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sacrifice acceptable, and
presented as the odour of a good fragrance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>For what better thing can be desired than that our acts of kindness should
be sacred offerings, which God receives from our hands, and takes pleasure in
their sweet odour? For the same reason Christ says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whatsoever ye shall have done
unto one of the least of these, ye have done it unto
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The similitude of <i>sacrifices, </i>however, adds
much emphasis, by which we are taught, that the exercise of love which God
enjoins upon us, is not merely a benefit conferred upon man, but is also a
spiritual and sacred service which is performed to God, as we read in the
Epistle to the Hebrews, that he is <i>well pleased with such sacrifices.
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
13:16.) Alas for our indolence! 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa253</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8212;which
appears in this, that while God invites us with so much kindness to the honor of
priesthood, and even puts sacrifices in our hands, we nevertheless do not
sacrifice to him, and those things which were set apart for sacred oblations we
not only lay out for profane uses, but squander them wickedly upon the most
polluted contaminations. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa254</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
the altars, on which sacrifices from our resources ought to be presented, are
the poor, and the servants of Christ. To the neglect of these some squander
their resources on every kind of luxury, others upon the palate, others upon
immodest attire, others upon magnificent dwellings.

expressly makes mention of God as <i>his, </i>because he owns and acknowledges
as done to himself whatever kindness is shewn to his servants. They had
therefore been truly sowing in the Lord&#8217;s field, from which a sure and
abundant harvest might be expected. Nor does he promise them merely a reward in
the future life, but even in respect of the necessities of the present life:
<i>&#8220;Do </i>not think that you have impoverished yourselves; God, whom I
serve, will abundantly furnish you with everything necessary for you.&#8221;The
phrase, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in

noticed; for it is no common evidence of divine mercy, that the gospel had made
its way into that sink of all crimes and iniquities. It is also the more to be
admired, in proportion as it is a rare thing for holiness to reign in the courts
of sovereigns. The conjecture formed by some, that Seneca is here referred to
among others, has no appearance of foundation; for he never gave any evidence,
even the smallest, of his being a Christian; nor did he belong to the

COLOSSIANS.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THERE were three neighboring cities in Phrygia, as
made mention of by PAUL in this Epistle &#8212; LAODICEA, Hierapolis, and
COLOSSE which, as <i>Orosius</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> informs
us, were overthrown 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by an
earthquake till the times of the emperor <i>Nero</i>. Accordingly, not long
after this Epistle was written, three Churches of great renown perished by a
mournful as well as horrible occurrence &#8212; a bright mirror truly of divine
judgment, if we had but eyes to see it. The COLOSSIANS had been, not indeed by
PAUL, but with fidelity and purity by EPAPHRAS and other ministers, instructed
in the gospel; but immediately afterwards, Satan had, with his <i>tares</i>,
crept in,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401325&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:25,)  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
according to his usual and invariable manner, that he might there pervert the
right faith.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb4</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some are of opinion that there were two classes of
men that endeavored to draw aside the COLOSSIANS from the purity of the gospel;
&#8212; that, on the one hand, the philosophers, by disputing in reference to
stars, fate, and trifles of a like nature, and that the Jews, on the other hand,
by urging the observance of their ceremonies, had raised up many mists with the
view of throwing Christ into the shade. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Those,
however, who are of this opinion are influenced by a conjecture of exceedingly
little weight &#8212; on the ground that PAUL makes mention of <i>thrones</i>,
and <i>powers</i>, and heavenly creatures. For as to their adding also the term
<i>elements</i>, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it is
worse than ridiculous. As, however, it is not my intention to refute the
opinions of others, I shall simply state what appears to me to be the truth, end
what may be inferred by sound reasoning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the first place, it is abundantly evident, from
PAUL&#8217;S words, that those profligates were intent upon this &#8212; that
they might mix up Christ with Moses, and might retain the shadows of the law
along with the gospel. Hence it is probable that they were Jews. As, however,
they coloured over their fallacies with specious disguises, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> PAUL, on
this account, calls it a <i>vain</i> <i>philosophy</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:8) At the same time, in employing that term, he had in his eye, in my opinion,
the speculations with which they amused themselves, which were subtle, it is
true, but at the same time useless and profane: for they contrived a way of
access to God through means of angels, and put forth many speculations of that
nature, such as are contained in the books of Dionysius on the Celestial
Hierarchy, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> drawn
from the school of the Platonists. This, therefore, is the principal object at
which he aims &#8212; to teach that all things are in Christ, and that he alone
ought to be reckoned amply sufficient by the Colossians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The order, however, which he follows is this: &#8212;
After the inscription usually employed by him, he commends them, with the view
of leading them to listen to him more attentively. He then, with the view of
shutting up the way against all new and strange contrivances, bears testimony to
the doctrine which they had previously received from EPAPHRAS. Afterwards, in
entreating that the Lord would increase their faith, he intimates that something
is still wanting to them, that he may pave the way for imparting to them more
solid instruction. On the other hand, he extols with suitable commendations the
grace of God towards them, that they may not lightly esteem it. Then follows the
instruction, in which he teaches that all parts of our salvation are to be found
in Christ alone, that they may not seek anything elsewhere; and he puts them in
mind that it was in Christ that they had obtained every blessing that they
possessed, in order that they might the more carefully make it their aim to
retain him to the end. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And,
truly, even this one article were of itself perfectly sufficient to lead us to
reckon this Epistle, short as it is, to be an inestimable treasure; for what is
of greater importance in the whole system of heavenly doctrine than to have
Christ drawn to the life, that we may distinctly behold 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> his
excellence, his office, and all the fruits that arise to us from
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For in this respect especially we differ from
Papists, that while we are both of us called Christians, and profess to believe
in Christ, they picture to themselves one that is torn, disfigured, divested of
his excellence, denuded of his office, in fine, such as to be a spectre 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb11</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">rather than Christ himself: we, on the other hand,
embrace him such as he is here described by PAUL &#8212; loving and efficacious.
This Epistle, therefore, to express it in one word, distinguishes the true
Christ from a fictitious one 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb12</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino">than which nothing better or more excellent
can be desired. Towards the end of the <i>First</i> <i>Chapter</i> he again
endeavors to secure authority for himself from the station assigned him, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb13</font></sup><font face="Palatino">and in
magnificent terms extols the dignity of the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>Second</i> <i>Chapter</i> he opens up more
distinctly than he had done the reason which had induced him to write &#8212;
that he might provide against the danger which he saw to be impending over them,
while he touches, in passing, on the affection which he cherishes towards them,
that they may know that their welfare is the object of his concern. From this he
proceeds to exhortation, by which he applies the foregoing doctrine, as it were,
to present use; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb14</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  for he
bids them rest in Christ alone, and brands as vanity everything that is apart
from Christ. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb15</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
speaks particularly of circumcision, abstinence from food, and of other outward
exercises &#8212; in which they mistakingly made the service of God to consist;
and also of the absurd worship of angels, whom they put in Christ&#8217;s room.
Having made mention of circumcision, he takes occasion to notice also, in
passing, what is the office, and what is the nature of ceremonies &#8212; from
which he lays it down as a settled point that they have been abrogated by
Christ. These things are treated of till the end of the <i>Second</i>
<i>Chapter</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>Third</i> <i>Chapter</i>, in opposition to
those vain prescriptions, to the observance of which the false apostles were
desirous to bind believers, he makes mention of those true offices of piety in
which the Lord would have us employ ourselves; and he begins with the very
<i>spring-head</i> &#8212; that is, mortification of the flesh and newness of
life. From this he derives the <i>streams</i> &#8212; that is, particular
exhortations, some of which apply to all Christians alike, while others relate
more especially to particular individuals, according to the nature of their
calling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the beginning of the <i>Fourth</i> <i>Chapter</i>
he follows out the same subject: afterwards, having commended himself to their
prayers, he shews by many tokens 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb16</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  how
much he loves them, and is desirous to promote their welfare.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Paul an
Apostle.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I have already, in repeated instances,
explained the design of such inscriptions. As, however, the COLOSSIANS had never
seen him, and on that account his authority was not as yet so firmly established
among them as to make his private name 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by
itself sufficient, he premises that he is an Apostle of Christ set apart by the
will of God. From this it followed, that he did not act rashly in writing to
persons that were not known by him, inasmuch as he was discharging an embassy
with which God had intrusted him. For he was not bound to one Church merely, but
his Apostleship extended to all. The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saints</i></font><font face="Palatino">
which he applies to them is more honorable, but in calling them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faithful
brethren,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he allures them more willingly to
listen to him. As for other things, they may be found explained in the foregoing
Epistles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We give thanks to
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He praises the faith and love of the
Colossians, that it may encourage them the more to alacrity and constancy of
perseverance. Farther, by shewing that he has a persuasion of this kind
respecting them, he procures their friendly regards, that they may be the more
favourably inclined and teachable for receiving his doctrine. We must always
take notice that he makes use of thanksgiving in place of congratulation, by
which he teaches us, that in all our joys we must readily call to remembrance
the goodness of God, inasmuch as everything that is pleasant and agreeable to us
is a kindness conferred by him. Besides, he admonishes us, by his example, to
acknowledge with gratitude not merely those things which the Lord confers upon
us, but also those things which he confers upon others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But for what things does he give thanks to the Lord?
For the <i>faith</i> and <i>love</i> of the Colossians. He acknowledges,
therefore, that both are conferred by God: otherwise the gratitude were
pretended. And what have we otherwise than through his liberality? If, however,
even the smallest favors come to us from that source, how much more ought this
same acknowledgment to be made in reference to those two gifts, in which the
entire sum of our excellence consists?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the God and
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb18</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Understand the expression thus &#8212; <i>To</i> <i>God</i> <i>who</i> <i>is</i>
<i>the</i> <i>Father</i> <i>of</i> <i>Christ</i>. For it is not lawful for us to
acknowledge any other God than him who has manifested himself to us in his Son.
And this is the only key for opening the door to us, if we are desirous to have
access to the true God. For on this account, also, is he a Father to us, because
he has embraced us in his only begotten Son, and in him also sets forth his
paternal favor for our contemplation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Always for
you,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some explain it thus &#8212; We
<i>give</i> <i>thanks</i> <i>to</i> <i>God</i> <i>always</i> <i>for</i>
<i>you</i>, that is, <i>continually</i>. Others explain it to mean &#8212;
<i>Praying</i> <i>always</i> <i>for</i> <i>you</i>. It may also be interpreted
in this way, &#8220;Whenever we pray for you, we at the same time give thanks to
God;&#8221; and this is the simple meaning, &#8220;We give thanks to God, and we
at the same time pray.&#8221; By this he intimates, that the condition of
believers is never in this world perfect, so as not to have, invariably,
something wanting. For even the man who has begun admirably well, may fall short
in a hundred instances every day; and we must ever be making progress while we
are as yet on the way. Let us therefore bear in mind that we must rejoice in the
favors that we have already received, and give thanks to God for them in such a
manner, as to seek at the Same time from him perseverance and
advancement.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>.
</i></b><i>Having heard of your faith.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This was
a means of stirring up his love towards them, and his concern for their welfare,
when he heard it that they were distinguished by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
And, unquestionably, gifts of God that are so excellent ought to have such an
effect upon us as to stir us up to love them wherever they appear. He uses the
expression, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that we may always bear in mind that
Christ is the proper object of faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He employs the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i> <i>towards</i>
<i>the</i> <i>saints</i></font><font face="Palatino">, not with the view of
excluding others, but because, in proportion as any one is joined to us in God,
we ought to embrace him the more closely with special affection. True love,
therefore, will extend to mankind universally, because they all are our flesh,
and <i>created</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>image</i> <i>of</i> <i>God</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
4:6;) but in respect of degrees, it will begin with those who are of the
<i>household</i> <i>of</i> <i>faith</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the hope which is laid up
for you in heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For the <i>hope</i> of
eternal life will never be inactive in us, so as not to produce <i>love</i> in
us. For it is of necessity, that the man who is fully persuaded that a treasure
of life is laid up for him in heaven will aspire thither, looking down upon this
world. Meditation, however, upon the heavenly life stirs up our affections both
to the worship of God, and to exercises of love. The Sophists pervert this
passage for the purpose of extolling the merits of works, as if the hope of
salvation depended on works. The reasoning, however, is futile. For it does not
follow, that because hope stimulates us to aim at upright living, it is
therefore founded upon works, inasmuch as nothing is more efficacious for this
purpose than God&#8217;s unmerited goodness, which utterly overthrows all
confidence in works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, however, an instance of <i>metonymy</i> in
the use of the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hope,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
as it is taken for the thing hoped for. For the hope that is in our hearts is
the glory which we hope for in heaven. At the same time, when he says, that
there is a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hope</i></font><font face="Palatino">
that is </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>laid up for us in
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means, that believers ought to feel
assured as to the promise of eternal felicity, equally as though they had
already a treasure laid up 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in a
particular place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of which ye heard before.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">As eternal salvation is a thing that surpasses
the comprehension of our understanding, he therefore adds, that the assurance of
it had been brought to the Colossians by means of the gospel; and at the same
time he says in the outset, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb20</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  that
he is not to bring forward anything new, but that he has merely in view to
confirm them in the doctrine which they had previously received. Erasmus has
rendered &#8212; <i>it</i> <i>the</i> <i>true</i> <i>word</i> <i>of</i>
<i>the</i> <i>gospel</i>. I am also well aware that, according to the Hebrew
idiom, the genitive is often made use of by Paul in place of an epithet; but the
words of Paul here are more emphatic. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For he
calls the gospel, </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kay
ejxoch&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>by</i> <i>way</i> <i>of</i>
<i>eminence</i>,) the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word of
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, with the view of putting honor upon it,
that they may more steadfastly and firmly adhere to the revelation which they
have derived from that source. Thus the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is introduced by way of <i>apposition</i>. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb22</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As also in all the world it
brings forth fruit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This has a tendency both to
confirm and to comfort the pious &#8212; to see the effect; of the gospel far
and wide in gathering many to Christ. The faith of it does not, it is true,
depend on its success, as though <i>we</i> should believe it on the ground that
<i>many</i> believe, it. Though the whole world should fail, though heaven
itself should fall, the conscience of a pious man must not waver, because God,
on whom it is founded, does nevertheless remain true. This, however, does not
hinder our faith from being confirmed, whenever it perceives God&#8217;s
excellence, which undoubtedly shews itself with more power in proportion to the
number of persons that are gained over to Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In addition to this, in the multitude of the
believers at that time there was beheld an accomplishment of the many
predictions which extend the reign of Christ from the East to the West. Is it a
trivial or common aid to faith, to see accomplished before our eyes what the
Prophets long since predicted as to the extending of the kingdom of Christ
through all countries of the world? What I speak of, there is no believer that
does not experience in himself. Paul accordingly had it in view to encourage the
Colossians the more by this statement, that, by seeing in various places the
fruit and progress of the gospel, they might embrace it with more eager zeal.
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Aujxano&gt;menon</font><font face="Palatino">,
which I have rendered <i>propagatur</i>, (<i>is</i> <i>propagated</i>,) does not
occur in some copies; but, from its suiting better with the context, I did not
choose to omit it. It also appears front the commentaries of the ancients that
this reading was always the more generally received. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb23</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Since the day ye heard it, and knew
the grace.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he praises them on account of
their docility, inasmuch as they immediately embraced sound doctrine; and he
praises them on account of their constancy, inasmuch as they persevered in it.
It is also with propriety that the faith of the gospel is called the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowledge of God&#8217;s
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for no one has ever tasted of the gospel
but the man that knew himself to be reconciled to God, and took hold of the
salvation that is held forth in Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"> means <i>truly</i> and <i>without</i>
<i>pretense</i>; for as he had previously declared that the gospel is undoubted
truth, so he now adds, that it had been purely administered by them, and that
<i>by</i> <i>Epaphras</i>. For while all boast that they preach the gospel, and
yet at the same time there are many <i>evil</i> <i>workers</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
3:2,) through whose ignorance, or ambition, or avarice, its purity is
adulterated, it is of great importance that faithful ministers should be
distinguished from the less upright. For it is not enough to hold the term
gospel, unless we know that this is the true gospel &#8212; what was preached by
Paul and Epaphras. Hence Paul confirms the doctrine of Epaphras by giving it his
approbation, that he may induce the Colossians to adhere to it, and may, by the
same means, call them back from those profligates who endeavored to introduce
strange doctrines. He at the same time dignifies Epaphras with a special
distinction, that he may have more authority among them; and lastly, he presents
him to the Colossians in an amiable aspect, by saying that he had borne
testimony to him of their love. Paul everywhere makes it his particular aim,
that he may, by his recommendation, render those who he knows serve Christ
faithfully, very dear to the Churches; as, on the other hand, the ministers of
Satan are wholly intent on alienating, by unfavourable representations, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb24</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  the

to the service of piety,

for them in his thanksgivings, so he now shews it still farther in the
earnestness of his prayers in their behalf. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And,
assuredly, the more that the grace of God is conspicuous in any, we ought in
that proportion specially to love and esteem them, and to be concerned as to
their welfare. But what does he pray for in their behalf? That they may know God
more fully; by which he indirectly intimates, that something is still wanting in
them, that he may prepare the way for imparting instruction to them, and may
secure their attention to a fuller statement of doctrine. For those who think
that they have already attained everything that is worthy of being known,
despise and disdain everything farther that is presented to them. Hence he
removes from the Colossians an impression of this nature, lest it should be a
hinderance in the way of their cheerfully making progress, and allowing what had
been begun in them to receive an additional polish. But what knowledge does he
desire in their behalf? The knowledge of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the divine
will</i></font><font face="Palatino">, by which expression he sets aside all
inventions of men, and all speculations that are at variance with the word of

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in all

God, of which he had made mention, was the only rule of right knowledge. For if
any one is desirous simply to know those things which it has pleased God to
reveal, that is the man who accurately knows what it is to be truly wise. If we
desire anything beyond that, this will be nothing else than to be foolish, by
not keeping within due bounds. By the word

<div><font face="Palatino">So long as men are regulated by their own carnal
perceptions, they have also their own wisdom, but it is of such a nature as is
mere vanity, however much they may delight themselves in it. We see what sort of
theology there is under the Papacy, what is contained in the books of
philosophers, and what wisdom profane men hold in estimation. Let us, however,
bear in mind, that the wisdom which is alone commended by Paul is comprehended

make proficiency in God&#8217;s school &#8212; that we may

life, that we have not in vain been taught by God. Whoever they may be that do
not direct their endeavors towards this object, may possibly toil and labor
much, but they do nothing better than wander about in endless windings, without
making any progress. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb28</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Farther,
he admonishes us, that if we would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>walk worthy of

regulate our whole course of life according to the will of God, renouncing our
own understanding, and bidding farewell to all the inclinations of our

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unto all

<i>well-pleasing</i>. Hence if it is asked, what kind of life is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>worthy of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, let us always keep in view this definition
of Paul &#8212; that it is such a life as, leaving the opinions of men, and
leaving, in short, all carnal inclination, is regulated so as to be in
subjection to God alone. From this follow good works, which are the fruits that
God requires front us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Increasing, in the knowledge of
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He again repeats, that they have not
arrived at such perfection as not to stand in need of farther increase; by which
admonition he prepares them, and as it were leads them by the hand, to an
eagerness for proficiency, that they may shew themselves ready to listen, and
teachable. What is here said to the Colossians, let all believers take as said
to themselves, and draw from this a common exhortation that we must always make
progress in the doctrine of piety until death.</font><br></div>

have both a sound understanding and the right use of it, so also now he prays
that they may have courage and constancy. In this manner he puts them in mind of
their own weakness, for he says, that they will not be strong otherwise than by
the Lord&#8217;s help; and not only so, but with the view of magnifying this
exercise of grace the more, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to his glorious
power.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;So far from any one being able to
stand, through dependence on his own strength, the power of God shews itself
illustriously in helping our infirmity.&#8221; Lastly, he shews in what it is
that the strength of believers ought to display itself &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in all patience and
long-suffering.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For they are constantly, while
in this world, exercised with the cross, and a thousand temptations daily
present themselves, so as to weigh them down, and they see nothing of what God
has promised. They must, therefore, arm themselves with an admirable patience,

to be met with in the Latin versions, <i>this</i> is more in accordance with the

by alacrity of mind, and will never be maintained with fortitude by any one that

thanks.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Again he returns to thanksgiving, that
he may take this opportunity of enumerating the blessings which had been
conferred upon them through Christ, and thus he enters upon a full delineation
of Christ. For this was the only remedy for fortifying the Colossians against
all the snares, by which the false Apostles endeavored to entrap them &#8212; to
understand accurately what Christ was. For how comes it that we are
<i>carried</i> <i>about</i> <i>with</i> <i>so</i> <i>many</i> <i>strange</i>
<i>doctrines</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
13:9) but because the excellence of Christ is not perceived by us? For Christ
alone makes all other things suddenly vanish. Hence there is nothing that Satan
so much endeavors to accomplish as to bring on mists with the view of obscuring
Christ, because he knows, that by this means the way is opened up for every kind
of falsehood. This, therefore, is the only means of retaining, as well as
restoring pure doctrine &#8212; to place Christ before the view such as he is
with all his blessings, that his excellence may be truly
perceived.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The question here is not as to the name. Papists in
common with us acknowledge one and the same Christ; yet in the mean time how
great a difference there is between us and them, inasmuch as they, after
confessing Christ to be the Son of God, transfer his excellence to others, and
scatter it hither and thither, and thus leave him next to empty, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or at
least rob him of a great part of his glory, so that he is called, it is true, by
them the Son of God, but, nevertheless, he is not such as the Father designed he
should be towards us. If, however, Papists would cordially embrace what is
contained in this chapter, we would soon be perfectly agreed, but the whole of
Popery would fall to the ground, for it cannot stand otherwise than through
ignorance of Christ. This will undoubtedly be acknowledged by every one that
will but consider the main article 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb32</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  of
this first chapter; for his grand object here is that we may know that Christ is
the beginning, middle, and end &#8212; that it is from him that all things must
be sought &#8212; that nothing is, or can be found, apart from him. Now,
therefore, let the readers carefully and attentively observe in what colors Paul
depicts Christ to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath made us
meet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He is still speaking of the
<i>Father</i>, because he is the beginning, and efficient cause (as they speak)
of our salvation. As the term <i>God</i> is more distinctly expressive of
majesty, so the term </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father
</i></font><font face="Palatino">conveys the idea of clemency and benevolent
disposition. It becomes us to contemplate both as existing in God, that his
majesty may inspire us with fear and reverence, and that his fatherly love may
secure our full confidence. Hence it is not with our good reason that Paul has
conjoined these two things, after all, you prefer the rendering which the old
interpreter has followed, and which accords with some very ancient Greek
manuscripts. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb33</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  At the
same time there will be no inconsistency in saying, that he contents himself
with the single term,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Farther, as it is necessary that his incomparable grace should be expressed by
the term <i>Father</i>, so it is also not less necessary that we should, by the
term <i>God</i>, be roused up to admiration of so great goodness, that he, who
is God, has condescended thus far. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb34</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But for what kindness does he give thanks to God? For
his having <i>made</i> him, and
others,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> meet to be partakers of
the inheritance of the saints.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For we are born
children of wrath, exiles from God&#8217;s kingdom. It is God&#8217;s adoption
that alone </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>makes us

election. The Spirit of regeneration is the seal of adoption. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
light,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that there might be a contrast &#8212;
as opposed to the darkness of Satan&#8217;s kingdom.

and thick darkness the nations; but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his
glory shall be seen upon thee.</font><br></div>

and afterwards the whole world, and Satan, the Prince of darkness,

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb38</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  From
this you may gather that the whole world, with all its pretended wisdom and
righteousness, is regarded as nothing but darkness in the sight of God, because,
apart, from the kingdom of Christ, there is no light.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hath translated us into the

our blessedness &#8212; when we are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>translated into the
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of Christ, because we <i>pass</i>
<i>from</i> <i>death</i> <i>into</i> <i>life</i>. (1 John 3:14.) This, also,
Paul ascribes to the grace of God, that no one may imagine that he can attain so
great a blessing by his own efforts. As, then, our deliverance from the slavery
of sin and death is the work of God, so also our passing into the kingdom of
Christ. He calls Christ the Son of his love, or the Son that is beloved by God
the Father, because it is in him alone that his soul takes pleasure, as we read
in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
17:5, and in whom all others are beloved. For we must hold it as a settled
point, that we are not acceptable to God otherwise than through Christ. Nor can
it be doubted, that Paul had it in view to censure indirectly the mortal enmity
that exists between men and God, until love shines forth in the
Mediator.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In whom we have redemption.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He now proceeds to set forth in order, that all
parts of our salvation are contained in Christ, and that he alone ought to shine
forth, and to be seen conspicuous above all creatures, inasmuch as he is the
beginning and end of all things. In the <i>first</i> place, he says that we have
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>redemption</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb39</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  and
immediately explains it as meaning the <i>remission</i> <i>of</i> <i>sins</i>;

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb40</font></sup><font face="Palatino">For,
unquestionably, when God remits our transgressions, he exempts us from
condemnation to eternal death. This is our liberty, this our glorying in the
face of death &#8212; that our sins are not imputed to us. He says that this
redemption was procured through the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blood of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for by the sacrifice of his death all
the sins of the world have been expiated. Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that
this is the sole price of reconciliation, and that all the trifling of Papists

is solid, let us take notice, that the term

Christ is called the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>image of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> on this ground &#8212; that he makes God in
a manner visible to us. At the same time, we gather also from this his
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oJmoousi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>identity</i> <i>of</i> <i>essence</i>, for Christ would not truly represent
God, if he were not the essential Word of God, inasmuch as the question here is
not as to those things which by communication are suitable also to creatures,
but the question is as to the perfect wisdom, goodness, righteousness, and power
of God, for the representing of which no creature were competent. We shall have,
therefore, in this term, a powerful weapon in opposition to the Arians, but,
notwithstanding, we must begin with that reference 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that I
have mentioned; we must not insist upon the essence alone. The sum is this
&#8212; that God in himself, that is, in his naked majesty, is <i>invisible</i>,
and that not to the eyes of the body merely, but also to the understandings of
men, and that he is revealed to us in Christ alone, that we may behold him as in
a mirror. For in Christ he shews us his righteousness, goodness, wisdom, power,
in short, his entire self. We must, therefore, beware of seeking him elsewhere,
for everything that would set itself off as a representation of God, apart from
Christ, will be an idol.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The first-born of every

immediately added &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For in

verses afterwards, called the

he is not called the

simply on the ground of his having preceded all creatures in point of time, but
because he was begotten by the Father, that they might be created by him, and
that he might be, as it were, the substance or foundation of all things. It was
then a foolish part that the Arians acted, who argued from this that he was,
consequently, a creature. For what is here treated of is, not what he is in
himself, but what he accomplishes in others.</font><br></div>

the term, which we are not to imagine to be such as our mind can conceive of,
but such as is suitable to God himself. We see the sun and moon, and the whole
adorning of heaven, but the glory of God&#8217;s kingdom is hid from our
perception, because it is spiritual, and above the heavens. In fine, let us
understand by the term </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thrones
</i></font><font face="Palatino">that seat of blessed immortality which is
exempted from all change.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the other terms he undoubtedly describes the
angels. He calls them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>powers,
principalities,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dominions,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
not, as if they swayed any separate kingdom, or were endowed with peculiar
power,  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb44</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but because they are the ministers of Divine power and dominion. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb45</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  It is
customary, however, that, in so far as God manifests his power in creatures, his
names are, in that proportion, transferred to them. Thus he is himself alone
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
but those are also called <i>lords</i> and <i>fathers</i> whom he dignifies with
this honor. Hence it comes that angels, as well as judges, are called
<i>gods</i>. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb46</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  Hence,
in this passage also, angels are signalized by magnificent titles, which
intimate, not what they can do of themselves, or apart from God, but what God
does by them, and what functions he has assigned to them. These things it
becomes us to understand in such a manner as to detract, nothing from the glory
of God alone; for he does not communicate his power to angels as to lessen his
own; he does not work by them in such a manner as to resign his power to them;
he does not desire that his glory should shine forth in them, so as to be
obscured in himself. Paul, however, designedly extols the dignity of angels in
terms thus magnificent, that no one may think that it stands in the way of
Christ alone having the pre-eminence over them. He makes use, therefore, of
these terms, as it were by way of concession, as though he had said, that all
their excellence detracts nothing from Christ, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb47</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> 
however honorable the titles with which they are adorned. As for those who
philosophize on these terms with excessive subtlety, that they may draw from
them the different orders of angels, let them regale themselves with their
dainties, but they are assuredly very remote from Paul&#8217;s
design.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All things were created by
him, and for him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He places angels in
subjection to Christ, that they may not obscure his glory, for <i>four</i>
reasons: In the <i>first</i> place, because they were <i>created</i> <i>by</i>
<i>him</i>; <i>secondly</i>, because their creation ought to be viewed as having
a relation <i>to</i> him, as their legitimate end; <i>thirdly</i>, because he
himself existed always, prior to their creation; <i>fourthly</i>, because he
sustains them by his power, and upholds them in their condition. At the same
time, he does not affirm this merely as to angels, but also as to the whole
world. Thus he places the Son of God in the Highest seat of honor, that he may
have the <i>pre-eminence</i> over angels as well as men, and may bring under
control all creatures in heaven and in earth.</font><br></div>

And, unquestionably, he makes use afterwards, as we shall find, of the same
metaphor in this sense &#8212; that as in the human body it serves as a root,
from which vital energy is diffused through all the members, so the life of the
Church flows out from Christ, etc.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians

it is he to whom alone believers ought to have an eye, and on whom alone the
unity of the body depends.</font><br></div>

honor even to angels, and yet he does not maim the Church, by depriving her of
her head; for as Christ claims for himself this title, so he truly exercises the
office. I am also well aware of the cavil by which they attempt to escape
&#8212; that the Pope is a ministerial head. The name, however, of <i>head</i>

restoration of all things, and in this manner the commencement of the second and

As, then, Christ in rising again had made a commencement of the kingdom of God,
he is on good grounds called the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
for <i>then</i> do we truly begin to have a being in the sight of God, when we
are renewed, so as to be new creatures. He is called the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>first-begotten from the
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino">, not merely because he was the first that
rose again, but because he has also restored life to others, as he is elsewhere
called the <i>first-fruits</i> <i>of</i> <i>those</i> <i>that</i> <i>rise</i>
<i>again</i>. (1 Corinthians. 15:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he may in all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">. From this he concludes, that supremacy
belongs to him in all things. For if he is the Author and Restorer of all
things, it is manifest that this honor is justly due to him. At the same time
the phrase <i>in</i> <i>omnibus</i>
(</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">) may be taken in two ways &#8212; either
<i>over</i> <i>all</i> <i>creatures</i>, or, <i>in</i> <i>everything</i>. This,
however, is of no great importance, for the simple meaning is, that all things
are subjected to his sway.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because it hath pleased the
Father that in him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> With the view of confirming
what he has declared respecting Christ, he now adds, that it was so arranged in
the providence of God. And, unquestionably, in order that we may with reverence
adore this mystery, it is necessary that we should be led back to that fountain.
&#8220;This,&#8221; says he, &#8220;has been in accordance with the counsel of
God, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all fullness may dwell
in him</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221; Now, he means a fullness of
righteousness, wisdom, power, and every blessing. For whatever God has he has
conferred upon his Son, that he may be glorified in him, as is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
5:20. He shews us, however, at the same time, that we must draw from the
fullness of Christ everything good that we desire for our salvation, because
such is the determination of God &#8212; not to communicate himself, or his
gifts to men, otherwise than by his Son. &#8220;Christ is all things to us:
apart from him we have nothing.&#8221; Hence it follows, that all that detract
from Christ, or that impair his excellence, or rob him of his offices, or, in
fine, take away a drop from his fullness, overturn, so far as is in their power,
God&#8217;s eternal counsel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And by him to reconcile all
things to himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This, also, is a magnificent
commendation of Christ, that we cannot be joined to God otherwise than through
him. In the first place, let us consider that our happiness consists in our
cleaving to God, and that, on the other hand, there is nothing more miserable
than to be alienated from him. He declares, accordingly, that we are blessed
through Christ alone, inasmuch as he is the bond of our connection with God,
and, on the other hand, that, apart from him, we are most miserable, because we
are shut out from God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us,
however, bear in mind, that what he ascribes to Christ belongs peculiarly to
him, that no portion of this praise may be transferred to any other. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb51</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  Hence
we must consider the contrasts to these things to be understood &#8212; that if
this is Christ&#8217;s prerogative, it does not belong to others. For of set
purpose he disputes against those who imagined that the angels were
pacificators, through whom access to God might be opened up.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Making peace through the blood of
his cross.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He speaks of the Father, &#8212;
that he has been made propitious to his creatures by the blood of Christ. Now he
calls it the <i>blood</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>cross</i>, inasmuch as it was
the pledge and price of the making up of our peace with God, because it was
poured out upon the cross. For it was necessary that the Son of God should be an
expiatory victim, and endure the punishment of sin, that we might be <i>the</i>
<i>righteousness</i> <i>of</i> <i>God</i> <i>in</i> <i>him</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470521&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:21.) The </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blood of
the cross,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> therefore, means the blood of the
sacrifice which was offered upon the cross for appeasing the anger of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In adding
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by
him,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he did not mean to express anything new,
but to express more distinctly what he had previously stated, and to impress it
still more deeply on their minds &#8212; that Christ alone is the author of
reconciliation, as to exclude all other means. For there is no other that has
been crucified for us. Hence it is he alone, by whom and for whose sake we have
God propitious to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Both upon earth and in
heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> If you are inclined to understand this
as referring merely to rational creatures, it will mean, men and angels. There
were, it is true, no absurdity in extending it to all without exception; but
that I may not be under the necessity of philosophizing with too much subtlety,
I prefer to understand it as referring to angels and men; and as to the latter,
there is no difficulty as to their having need of a peace maker in the sight of
God. As to angels, however, there is a question not easy of solution. For what
occasion is there for reconciliation, where there is no discord or hatred? Many,
influenced by this consideration, have explained the passage before us in this
manner &#8212; that angels have been brought into agreement with men, and that
by this means heavenly creatures have been restored to favor with earthly
creatures. Another meaning, however, is conveyed by Paul&#8217;s words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that</i> <i>God</i> <i>hath</i>
<i>reconciled</i> <i>to</i> <i>himself</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That
explanation, therefore, is forced.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It remains, that we see what is the reconciliation of
angels and men. I say that men have been reconciled to God, because they were
previously alienated from him by sin, and because they would have had him as a
Judge to their ruin, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb52</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  had
not the grace of the Mediator interposed for appeasing his anger. Hence the
nature of the peace making between God and men was this, that enmities have been
abolished through Christ, and thus God becomes a Father instead of a
Judge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Between God and angels the state of matters is very
different, for there was <i>there</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb53</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  no
revolt, no sin, and consequently no separation. It was, however, necessary that
angels, also, should be made to be at peace with God, for, being creatures, they
were not beyond the risk of falling, had they not been confirmed by the grace of
Christ. This, however, is of no small importance for the perpetuity of peace
with God, to have a fixed standing in righteousness, so as to have no longer any
fear of fall or revolt. Farther, in that very obedience which they render to
God, there is not such absolute perfection as to give satisfaction to God in
every respect, and without the need of pardon. And this beyond all doubt is what
is meant by that statement in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;180418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
4:18, He <i>will</i> <i>find</i> <i>iniquity</i> <i>in</i> <i>his</i>
<i>angels</i>. For if it is explained as referring to the devil, what mighty
thing were it? But the Spirit declares there, that the greatest purity is vile, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb54</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  if it
is brought into comparison with the righteousness of God. We must, therefore,
conclude, that there is not on the part of angels so much of righteousness as
would suffice for their being fully joined with God. They have, therefore, need
of a peace maker, through whose grace they may wholly cleave to God. Hence it is
with propriety that Paul declares, that the grace of Christ does not reside
among mankind alone, and on the other hand makes it common also to angels. Nor
is there any injustice done to angels, in sending them to a Mediator, that they
may, through his kindness, have a well grounded peace with God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Should any one, on the pretext of the universality of
the expression, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb55</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  move a
question in reference to devils, whether Christ be their peace maker also? I
answer, No, not even of wicked men: though I confess that there is a difference,
inasmuch as the benefit of redemption is offered to the latter, but not to the
former. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb56</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  This,
however, has nothing to do with Paul&#8217;s words, which include nothing else
than this, that it is through Christ alone, that, all creatures, who have any
connection at all with God, cleave to him.</font><br></div>

it (<i>sensum</i>) <i>sense</i>. Erasmus renders it <i>mentem</i>,

anticipates, so as to prevent them from breaking forth into open fruits, while
others, after having wandered during a great part of their life, are brought

31:33.) What he has already spoken of was a great matter, that righteousness has
been procured for us through the death of Christ, so that, our sins being
remitted, we are acceptable to God. Now, however, he teaches us, that there is
in addition to this another benefit equally distinguished &#8212; the gift of
the Holy Spirit, by which we are renewed in the image of God. This, also, is a
passage worthy of observation, as shewing that a gratuitous righteousness is not
conferred upon us in Christ, without our being at the same time regenerated by
the Spirit to the obedience of righteousness, as he teaches us elsewhere,
that</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>former</i> we obtain by a gratuitous
acceptance; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb58</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  and
the <i>latter</i> <i>by</i> the gift of the Holy Spirit, when we are made new
creatures. There is however an inseparable connection between these two
blessings of grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us, however, take notice, that this holiness is
nothing more than begun in us, and is indeed every day making progress, but will
not be perfected until Christ shall appear for the restoration of all things.
For the C&#339;lestinians 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb59</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  and
the Pelagians in ancient times mistakingly perverted this passage, so as to shut
out the gracious benefit of the remission of sins. For they conceived of a
perfection in this world which could satisfy the judgment of God, so that mercy
was not needed. Paul, however, does not by any means shew us here what is
accomplished in this world, but what is the end of our calling, and what
blessings are brought to us by Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye
continue.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here we have an exhortation to
perseverance, by which he admonishes them that all the grace that had been
conferred upon them hitherto would be vain, unless they persevered in the purity
of the gospel. And thus he intimates, that they are still only making progress,
and have not yet reached the goal. For the stability of their faith was at that
time exposed to danger through the stratagems of the false apostles. Now he
paints in lively colors assurance of faith when he bids the Colossians be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grounded and
settled</i></font><font face="Palatino"> in it. For faith is not like mere
opinion, which is shaken by various movements, but has a firm steadfastness,
which can withstand all the machinations of hell. Hence the whole system of
Popish theology will never afford even the slightest taste of true faith, which
holds it as a settled point, that we must always be in doubt respecting the
present state of grace, as well as respecting final perseverance. He afterwards
takes notice also of a relationship 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb60</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  which
subsists between faith and the gospel, when he says that the Colossians will be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>settled
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in the faith only in the event of their not
falling back from the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hope of the
gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, the hope which shines forth
upon us through means of the gospel, for where the gospel is, <i>there</i> is
the hope of everlasting salvation. Let us, however, bear in mind, that the sum
of all is contained in Christ. Hence he enjoins it upon them here to shun all
doctrines which lead away from Christ, so that the minds of men are otherwise
occupied.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which ye have
heard.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As the false apostles themselves, who
tear and rend Christ in pieces, are accustomed proudly to glory in the name of
the gospel, and as it is a common artifice of Satan to trouble men&#8217;s
consciences under a false pretext of the gospel, that the truth of the gospel
may be brought into confusion, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb61</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  Paul,
on this account, expressly declares, that <i>that</i> was the genuine, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb62</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> 
<i>that</i> the undoubted gospel, which the Colossians had heard, namely, from
Epaphras, that they might not lend an ear to doctrines at variance with it. He
adds, besides, a confirmation of it, that it is the very same as was preached
over the whole world. It is, I say, no ordinary confirmation when they hear that
they have the whole Church agreeing with them, and that they follow no other
doctrine than what the Apostles had alike taught and was everywhere
received.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, however, a ridiculous boasting of Papists, in
respect of their impugning our doctrine by this argument, that it is not
preached everywhere with approbation and applause, inasmuch as we have few that
assent to it. For though they should burst, they will never deprive us of this
&#8212; that we at this day teach nothing but what was preached of old by
Prophets and Apostles, and is obediently received by the whole band of saints.
For Paul did not mean that the gospel should be approved of by the consent of
all ages 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb63</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  in
such a way that, if it were rejected, its authority would be shaken. He had, on
the contrary, an eye to that commandment of Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Go, preach the gospel to
every creature;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;411615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Mark
16:15;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">which commandment depends on so many predictions of
the Prophets, foretelling that the kingdom of Christ would be spread over the
whole world. What else then does Paul mean by these words than that the
Colossians had also been watered by those <i>living</i> <i>streams</i>, which,
<i>springing</i> <i>forth</i> <i>from</i> <i>Jerusalem</i>, were to flow out
through the whole world?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;381408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
14:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We also do not glory in vain, or without remarkable
fruit and consolation, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb64</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  that
we have the same gospel, which is preached among all nations by the commandment
of the Lord, which is received by all the Churches, and in the profession of
which all pious persons have lived and died. It is also no common help for
fortifying us against so many assaults, that we have the consent of the whole
Church &#8212; such, I mean, as is worthy of so distinguished a title. We also
cordially subscribe to the views of Augustine, who refutes the Donatists 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb65</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  by
this argument particularly, that they bring forward a gospel that is in all the
Churches unheard of and unknown. This truly is said on good grounds, for if it
is a true gospel that is brought forward, while not ratified by any approbation
on the part of the Church, it follows, that vain and false are the many promises
in which it is predicted that the preaching of the gospel will be carried
through the whole world, and which declare that the <i>sons</i> <i>of</i>
<i>God</i> <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> <i>gathered</i> from all nations and
countries, etc.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;280110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
1:10-11.) But what do Papists do? Having bid farewell to Prophets and Apostles,
and passing by the ancient Church, they would have their revolt from the gospel
be looked upon as the consent of the universal Church. Where is the resemblance?
Hence, when there is a dispute as to the consent of the Church, let us return to
the Apostles and their preaching, as Paul does here. Farther, lest any one
should explain too rigidly the term denoting universality, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb66</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  Paul
means simply, that it had been preached everywhere far and
wide.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of which I am
made.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He speaks also of himself personally, and
this was very necessary, for we must always take care, that we do not rashly
intrude ourselves into the office of teaching. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb67</font></sup><font face="Palatino">He
accordingly declares, that this office was appointed him, that he may secure for
himself right and authority. And, indeed, he so connects his apostleship with
their faith, that they may not have it in their power to reject his doctrine
otherwise than by abandoning the gospel which they had
embraced.</font><br></div>

authority on the ground of his calling. Now, however, he provides against the
honor of his apostleship being detracted from by the bonds and persecutions,
which he endured for the sake of the gospel. For Satan, also, perversely turns
these things into occasions of rendering the servants of God the more
contemptible. Farther, he encourages them by his example not to be intimidated
by persecutions, and he sets forth to their view his zeal, that he may have
greater weight. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb68</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Nay
more, he gives proof of his affection towards them by no common pledge, when he
declares that he willingly bears for their sake the afflictions which he
endures. &#8220;But whence,&#8221; some one will ask, &#8220;arises this
<i>joy</i>?&#8221; From his seeing the fruit that springs from it. &#8220;The
affliction that I endure on your account is pleasant to me, because I do not
suffer it in vain.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb69</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In the
same manner, in his First Epistle to the Thessalonians, he says, that he
<i>rejoiced</i> <i>in</i> <i>all</i> <i>necessities</i> <i>and</i>
<i>afflictions</i>, on the ground of what he had heard as to their faith.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 3:6, 7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And fill up what is
wanting.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The particle <i>and</i> I understand
as meaning <i>for</i>, for he assigns a reason why he is joyful in his
sufferings, because he is in this thing a partner with Christ, and nothing
happier can be desired than this partnership. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb70</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He also
brings forward a consolation common to all the pious, that in all tribulations,
especially in so far as they suffer anything for the sake of the gospel, they
are partakers of the cross of Christ, that they may enjoy fellowship with him in
a blessed resurrection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nay more, he declares that there is thus
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>filled up what is wanting in the
affliction of Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For as he speaks in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450829&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:29,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Whom God elected, he also hath
predestinated to be conformed to the image of Christ, that he may be the
first-born among the brethren.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, we know that there is so great a unity
between Christ and his members, that the name of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">
sometimes includes the whole body, as in 1 Corinthians. 12:12, for while
discoursing there respecting the Church, he comes at length to the conclusion,
that in Christ the same thing holds as in the human body. As, therefore, Christ
has suffered <i>once</i> in his own person, so he suffers <i>daily</i> in his
members, and in this way there are <i>filled</i> <i>up</i> those sufferings
which the Father hath appointed for his body by his decree. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb71</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Here we
have a <i>second</i> consideration, which ought to bear up our minds and comfort
them in afflictions, that it is thus fixed and determined by the providence of
God, that we must be conformed to Christ in the endurance of the cross, and that
the fellowship that we have with him extends to this also.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, also, a <i>third</i> reason &#8212; that his
sufferings are advantageous, and that not merely to a few, but to the whole
Church. He had previously stated that he suffered in behalf of the Colossians,
and he now declares still farther, that the advantage extends to the whole
Church. This advantage has been spoken of in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
1:12. What could be clearer, less forced, or more simple, than this exposition,
that Paul is joyful in persecution, because he considers, in accordance with
what he writes elsewhere, that we must</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">carry about with us in
our body the mortification of Christ, that his life may be manifested in us? (2
Corinthians 4 10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says also in Timothy, <i>If</i> we suffer with
him, we shall also reign with him: if we die with him, we shall also live with
him,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:11-12) and thus the issue will be blessed and glorious.
<i>Farther</i>, he considers that we must not refuse the condition which God has
appointed for his Church, that the members of Christ may have a suitable
correspondence with the head; and, <i>thirdly</i>, that afflictions must be
cheerfully endured, inasmuch as they are profitable to all the pious, and
promote the welfare of the whole Church, by adorning the doctrine of the
gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Papists, however, disregarding and setting aside all
these things, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb72</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> have
struck out a new contrivance in order that they may establish their system of
indulgences. They give the name of <i>indulgences</i> to a remission of
punishments, obtained by us through the merits of the martyrs. For, as they deny
that there is a gratuitous remission of sins, and allege that they are redeemed
by <i>satisfactory</i> deeds, when the <i>satisfactions</i> do not fill up the
right measure, they call into their help the blood of the martyrs, that it may,
along with the blood of Christ, serve as an expiation in the judgment of God.
And this mixture they call the <i>treasure</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i>
<i>Church</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb73</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, the
keys of which they afterwards intrust to whom they think fit. Nor are they
ashamed to wrest this passage, with the view of supporting so execrable a
blasphemy, as if Paul here affirmed that his sufferings are of avail for
expiating the sins of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They urge in their support the term
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJsterh&gt;mata</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>things</i> <i>wanting</i>,) as if Paul meant to say, that the sufferings
which Christ has endured for the redemption of men were insufficient. There is
no one, however, that does not see that Paul speaks in this manner, because it
is necessary, that by the afflictions of the pious, the body of the Church
should be brought to its perfection, inasmuch as the members are conformed to
their head. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb74</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I
should also be afraid of being suspected of calumny in repeating things so
monstrous, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb75</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> if
their books did not bear witness that I impute nothing to them groundlessly.
They urge, also, what Paul says, that he suffers <i>for</i> the Church. It is
surprising that this refined interpretation had not occurred to any of the
ancients, for they all interpret it as we do, to mean, that the saints suffer
<i>for</i> the Church, inasmuch as they confirm the faith of the Church.
Papists, however, gather from this that the saints are redeemers, because they
shed their blood for the expiation of sins. That my readers, however, may
perceive more clearly their impudence, allow that the martyrs, as well as
Christ, <i>suffered</i> <i>for</i> the Church, but in different ways, as I am
inclined to express in Augustine&#8217;s words rather than in my own. For he
writes thus in his 84th treatise on John: &#8220;Though we brethren die for
brethren, yet there is no blood of any martyr that is poured out for the
remission of sins. This Christ did for us. Nor has he in this conferred upon us
matter of imitation, but ground of thanksgiving.&#8221; Also, in the fourth book
to Bonifacius: &#8220;As the only Son of God became the Son of man, that he
might make us sons of God, so he has alone, without offense, endured punishment
for us, that we may through him, without merit, obtain undeserved favor.&#8221;
Similar to these is the statement of Leo Bishop of Rome; &#8220;The righteous
<i>received</i> crowns, did not give them; and for the fortitude of believers
there have come forth <i>examples</i> <i>of</i> <i>patience</i>, <i>not</i>
<i>gifts</i> <i>of</i> <i>righteousness</i>. For their deaths were for
themselves, and no one by his latter end paid the debt of another.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb76</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, that this is the meaning of Paul&#8217;s words
is abundantly manifest from the context, for he adds, that he suffers
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the dispensation
that was given to him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> And we know that the
ministry was committed to him, not of <i>redeeming</i> the Church, but of
<i>edifying</i> it; and he himself immediately afterwards expressly acknowledges
this. This is also what he writes to Timothy,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">that he endures all
things for the sake of the elect, that they may obtain the salvation which is in
Christ

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>minister</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
not to <i>give</i> the price of redemption, (as Augustine dexterously and
piously expresses himself,) but to <i>proclaim</i> it. He calls himself,
however, in this instance, a minister of the Church on a different ground from
that on which he called himself elsewhere, (1 Corinthians 4:1,) a
<i>minister</i> <i>of</i> <i>God</i>, and a little ago,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians

serve God and Christ for the advancement of the glory of both: they serve the
Church, and administer the gospel itself, with a view to promote salvation.
There is, therefore, a different reason for the ministry in these expressions,
but the one cannot subsist without the other. He says, however, <i>towards</i>
<i>you</i>, that they may know that his office has a connection also with
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To fulfill the

<div><font face="Palatino">God, therefore, gives efficacy and influence to his

hypocrites, and how haughtily it is contemned by the world. Paul, accordingly,
with the view of setting aside judgments so unfair and perverse, extols in
magnificent terms the dignity of the gospel as often as an opportunity presents
itself, and for that purpose he makes use of various arguments, according to the
connection of the passage. Here he calls it a <i>sublime</i> <i>secret</i>,
which was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hid from ages and
generations, </i></font><font face="Palatino">that is, from the beginning of the
world, through so many revolutions of ages. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb78</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now,
that it is of the gospel that he speaks, is evident from
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451625&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
16:25, Ephesians 3:9, and other similar passages.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason, however, why it is so called, is
demanded. Some, in consequence of Paul&#8217;s making express mention of the
calling of the Gentiles, are of opinion, that the sole reason why it is so
called is, that the Lord had, in a manner, contrary to all expectation, poured
out his grace upon the Gentiles, whom he had appeared to have shut out for ever
from participation in eternal life. Any one, however, that will examine the
whole passage more narrowly, will perceive that this is the <i>third</i> reason,
not the <i>only</i> one, in so far, I mean, as relates to the passage before us,
and that other in the Romans, to which I have referred. For the <i>first</i> is
&#8212; that whereas God had, previously to the advent of Christ, governed his
Church under dark coverings, both of words and of ceremonies, he has suddenly
shone forth in full brightness by means of the doctrine of the gospel. The
<i>second</i> is &#8212; that whereas nothing was previously seen but external
figures, Christ has been exhibited, bringing with him the full truth, which had
lain concealed. The <i>third</i> <i>is</i>, what I have mentioned &#8212; that
the whole world, which had up to this time been estranged from God, is called to
the hope of salvation, and the same inheritance of eternal life is offered to
all. An attentive consideration of these things constrains us to reverence and
adore this </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mystery
</i></font><font face="Palatino">which Paul proclaims, however it may be held in
contempt by the world, or even in derision.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which is now
revealed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Lest any one should turn aside to
another meaning the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mystery,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
as though he were speaking of a thing that was still secret and unknown, he
adds, that it has now at length been published, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb79</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that it
might be known by mankind. What, therefore, was in its own nature secret, has
been made manifest by the will of God. Hence, there is no reason why its
obscurity should alarm us, after the revelation that God has made of it. He
adds, however, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the
saints</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for <i>God</i>&#8217;<i>s arm</i> has
not been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>revealed</i></font><font face="Palatino">
<i>to</i> all,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
13:1,) that they might understand his counsel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To whom God was pleased to
make known.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he puts a bridle upon the
presumption of men, that they may not allow themselves to be wise, or to inquire
beyond what they ought, but may learn to rest satisfied with this one thing that
it has so pleased God. For the good pleasure of God ought to be perfectly
sufficient for us as a reason. This, however, is said principally for the
purpose of commending the grace of God; for Paul intimates, that mankind did by
no means furnish occasion for God&#8217;s making them participants of this
secret, when he teaches that was led to this of his own accord, and because he
<i>was</i> <i>pleased</i> to do so. For it is customary for Paul to place the
good pleasure of God in opposition to all human merits and external
causes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What are the
riches.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We must always take notice, in what
magnificent terms he speaks in extolling the dignity of the gospel. For he was
well aware that the ingratitude of men is so great, that notwithstanding that
this treasure is inestimable, and the grace of God in it is so distinguished,
they, nevertheless, carelessly despise it, or at least think lightly of it.
Hence, not resting satisfied with the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mystery</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glory,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and that, too, not trivial or common. For
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>riches</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
according to Paul, denote, as is well known, amplitude. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb80</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
states particularly, that those
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>riches</i></font><font face="Palatino">
have been manifested among the Gentiles; for what is more wonderful than that
the Gentiles, who had during so many ages been sunk in death, so as to appear to
be utterly ruined, are all on a sudden reckoned among the sons of God, and
receive the inheritance of salvation?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which is Christ in
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What he had said as to the Gentiles
generally he applies to the Colossians themselves, that they may more
effectually recognize in themselves the grace of God, and may embrace it with
greater reverence. He says, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which is
Christ,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> meaning by this, that all that secret
is contained in Christ, and that all the riches of heavenly wisdom are obtained
by them when they have Christ, as we shall find him stating more openly a little
afterwards. He adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because they now possess Christ, from whom
they were lately so much estranged, that nothing could exceed it. Lastly, he
calls Christ the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hope of
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that they may know that nothing is
wanting to them for complete blessedness when they have obtained Christ. This,
however, is a wonderful work of God, that in <i>earthen</i> and frail
<i>vessels</i>
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:7) the hope of heavenly glory resides.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom we
preach.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here he applies to his own preaching
everything that he has previously declared as to the wonderful and adorable
secret of God; and thus he explains what he had already touched upon as to the
<i>dispensation </i>which had been committed to him; for he has it in view to
adorn his apostleship, and to claim authority for his doctrine: for after having
extolled the gospel in the highest terms, he now adds, that it is that divine
secret which he preaches. It was not, however, without good reason that he had
taken notice a little before, that Christ is the sum of that secret, that they
might know that nothing can be taught that has more of perfection than
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The expressions that follow have also great weight.
He represents himself as the teacher of all men; meaning by this, that no one is
so eminent in respect of wisdom as to be entitled to exempt himself from
tuition. &#8220;God has placed me in a lofty position, as a public herald of his
secret, that the whole world, without exception, may learn from
me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In all
wisdom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This expression is equivalent to his
affirming that his doctrine is such as to conduct a man to a wisdom that is
perfect, and has nothing wanting; and this is what he immediately adds, that all
that shew themselves to be true disciples will become
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>perfect</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
See the second chapter of First Corinthians.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:6.) Now, what better thing can be desired than what confers upon
us the highest perfection? He again repeats,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that they may not desire to know
anything but Christ alone. From this passage, also, we may gather a definition
of true wisdom &#8212; that by which we are presented perfect in the sight of
God, and that <i>in</i> <i>Christ</i>, and nowhere else. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb81</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For which
thing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He enhances, by two circumstances, the
glory of his apostleship and of his doctrine. In the <i>first</i> place, he
makes mention of his aim, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb82</font></sup><font face="Palatino">which is
a token of the difficulty that he felt; for those things are for the most part
the most excellent that are the most difficult. The <i>second</i> has more
strength, inasmuch as he mentions that the power of God shines forth in his
ministry. He does not speak, however, merely of the success of his preaching,
(though in that too the blessing of God appears,) but also of the efficacy of
the Spirit, in which God manifestly shewed himself; for on good grounds he
ascribes his endeavors, inasmuch as they exceeded human limits, to the power of
God, which, he declares, is seen <i>working</i> <i>powerfully</i> in this
matter.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I would have you

that he may have more credit and authority; for we readily believe those whom we
know to be desirous of our welfare. It is also an evidence of no ordinary
affection, that he was concerned about them in the midst of death, that is, when
he was in danger of his life; and that he may express the more emphatically the
intensity of his affection and concern, he calls it a <i>conflict</i>. I do not
find fault with the rendering of Erasmus &#8212; <i>anxiety</i>; but, at the
same time, the force of the Greek word is to be noticed, for
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajgw&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino"><b>
</b>is made use of to denote <i>contention</i>. By the same proof he confirms
his statement, that his ministry is directed to them; for whence springs so
anxious a concern as to their welfare, but from this, that the Apostle of the
Gentiles was under obligation to embrace in his affection and concern even those
who were unknown to him? As, however, there is commonly no love between those
who are unknown to each other, he speaks slightingly of the acquaintance that is
contracted from sight, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as many as have not seen my face
in the flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for there is among the servants
of God a sight different from that of the flesh, which excites love. As it is
almost universally agreed that the First Epistle to Timothy was written from
Laodicea, some, on this account, assign to Galatia that Laodicea of which Paul
makes mention here, while the other was the metropolis of Phrygia Pacatiana. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb83</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It
seems to me, however, to be more probable that that inscription is incorrect, as
will be noticed in its proper place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That their hearts may receive
consolation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now intimates what he desires
for them, and shews that his affection is truly apostolic; for he declares that
nothing else is desired by him than that they may be united together in faith
and love. He shews, accordingly, that it was by no unreasonable affection (as
happens in the case of some) that he had been led to take upon himself so great
a concern for the Colossians and others, but because the duty of his office
required it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consolation</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is taken here to denote that true quietness in which they may repose. This he
declares they will at length come to enjoy in the event of their being
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>united in
love</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and faith. From this it appears where the
chief good is, and in what things it consists &#8212; when mutually agreed in
one faith, we are also joined together in mutual love. This, I say, is the solid
joy of a pious mind &#8212; this is the blessed life. As, however, love is here
commended from its effect, because it fills the mind of the pious with true joy;
so, on the other hand, the cause of it is pointed out by him, when he says, in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all fullness of
understanding.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb84</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
bond also of holy unity is the truth of God, when we embrace it with one
consent; for peace and agreement with men flow forth from that
fountain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Riches of the assurance of
understanding.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As many, contenting themselves
with a slight taste, have nothing but a confused and evanescent knowledge, he
makes mention expressly of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>riches of
understanding</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this phrase he means full and
clear perception; and at the same time admonishes them, that according to the
measure of understanding they must make progress also in love.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>assurance</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he distinguishes between faith and mere opinion; for <i>that</i> man truly knows
the Lord who does not vacillate or waver in doubt, but stands fast in a firm and
constant persuasion. This constancy and stability Paul frequently calls
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">plhrofori&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>full</i> <i>assurance</i>, (which term he makes use of here also,) and always
connects it with faith, as undoubtedly it can no more be separated from it than
heat or light can be from the sun. The doctrine, therefore, of the schoolmen is
devilish, inasmuch as it takes away assurance, and substitutes in its place
<i>moral</i> <i>conjecture</i>, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as they
term it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is an acknowledgment of the
mystery.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This clause must be read as added by
way of <i>apposition</i>, for he explains what that knowledge is, of which he
has made mention &#8212; that it is nothing else than the knowledge of the
gospel. For the false apostles themselves endeavor to set off their impostures
under the title of wisdom, but Paul retains the sons of God within the limits of
the gospel exclusively, that they may desire to <i>know</i> <i>nothing</i>
<i>else</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:2.) Why he uses the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mystery</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to denote the gospel, has been already explained. Let us, however, learn from
this, that the gospel can be understood by faith alone &#8212; not by reason,
nor by the perspicacity of the human understanding, because otherwise it is a
thing that is hid from us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mystery of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I understand in a passive signification, as
meaning &#8212; that in which God is revealed, for he immediately adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and of the Father, and of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; by which expression he means
that God cannot be known otherwise than <i>in</i> <i>Christ</i>, as, on the
other hand, the Father must necessarily be known where Christ is known. For John
affirms both:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">He that hath the Son,
hath the Father also: he that hath not the Son, hath also not the Father.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
John 2:23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence all that think that they know anything of God
apart from Christ, contrive to themselves an idol in the place of God; as also,
on the other hand, that man is ignorant of Christ, who is not led by him to the
Father, and who does not in him embrace God wholly. In the mean time, it is a
memorable passage for proving Christ&#8217;s divinity, and the unity of his
essence with the Father. For having spoken previously as to the knowledge of
God, he immediately applies it to the Son, as well as to the Father, whence it
follows, that the Son is God equally with the Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In whom are all the
treasures.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The expression <i>in</i> <i>quo</i>
(<i>in</i> <i>whom</i>, or <i>in</i> <i>which</i>) may either have a reference
collectively to everything he has said as to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>acknowledgment of the
mystery</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or it may relate simply to what came
immediately before, namely, <i>Christ</i>. While there is not much difference
between the one or the other, I rather prefer the <i>latter</i> view, and it is
the one that is more generally received. The meaning, therefore, is, that all
the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid in Christ &#8212; by which he
means, that we are perfect in wisdom if we truly know Christ, so that it is
madness to wish to know anything besides Him. For since the Father has
manifested himself wholly in Him, that man wishes to be wise apart from God, who
is not contented with Christ alone. Should any one choose to interpret it as
referring to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mystery,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
the meaning will be, that all the wisdom of the pious is included in the gospel,
by means of which God is revealed to us in his Son.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, however, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>treasures are
hidden</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because they are not seen glittering
with great splendor, but do rather, as it were, lie hid under the contemptible
abasement and simplicity of the cross. For the <i>preaching</i> <i>of</i>
<i>the</i> <i>cross</i> is always <i>foolishness</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i>
<i>world</i>, as we found stated in <i>Corinthians</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:18.) I do not reckon that there is any great difference between
<i>wisdom</i> and <i>understanding</i> in this passage, for the employment of
two different terms serves only to give additional strength, as though he had
said, that no knowledge, erudition, learning, wisdom, can be found
elsewhere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This I say, that no man may

(as we shall afterwards see) an appearance of wisdom, the minds of the pious
ought to be preoccupied with this persuasion &#8212; that the knowledge of
Christ is of itself amply sufficient. And, unquestionably, this is the key that
can close the door against all base errors. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb86</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
what is the reason why mankind have involved themselves in so many wicked
opinions, in so many idolatries, in so many foolish speculations, but this
&#8212; that, despising the simplicity of the gospel, they have ventured to
aspire higher? All the errors, accordingly, that are in Popery, must be reckoned
as proceeding from this ingratitude &#8212; that, not resting satisfied with
Christ alone, they have given themselves up to strange
doctrines.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With propriety, therefore, does the Apostle act in
writing to the Hebrews, inasmuch as, when wishing to exhort believers not to
allow themselves to be led astray

be fortified by means of this principle &#8212; that it is not lawful for a

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As ye have
received.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To commendation he adds exhortation,
in which he teaches them that their having once received Christ will be of no
advantage to them, unless they remain in him. Farther, as the false apostles
held forth Christ&#8217;s name with a view to deceive, he obviates this danger
twice, by exhorting them to go on as they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had been
taught</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and as they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had received
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For in these words he admonishes them,
that they must adhere to the doctrine which they had embraced, as delivered to
them by Epaphras, with so much constancy, as to be on their guard against every
other doctrine and faith, in accordance with what Isaiah said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">This is the way, walk ye
in it. (Isaiah 30 21.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And, unquestionbly, we must act in such a manner,
that the truth of the gospel, after it has been manifested to us, may be to us
as a brazen wall 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb91</font></sup><font face="Palatino">for
keeping back all impostures. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb92</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he intimates by <i>three</i> metaphors what
steadfastness of faith he requires from them. The <i>first</i> is in the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>walk</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
For he compares the pure doctrine of the gospel, as they had learned it, to a
way that is sure, so that if any one will but keep it he will be beyond all
danger of mistake. He exhorts them, accordingly, if they would not go astray,
not to turn aside from the course on which they have entered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>second</i> is taken from trees. For as a tree
that has struck its roots deep has a sufficiency of support for withstanding all
the assaults of winds and storms, so, if any one is deeply and thoroughly fixed
in Christ, as in a firm root, it will not be possible for him to be thrown down
from his proper position by any machinations of Satan. On the other hand, if any
one has not fixed his roots in Christ, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb93</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he will
easily be</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">carried about with every
wind of doctrine,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
4:14,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">just as a tree that is not supported by any root. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb94</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>third</i> metaphor is that of a foundation,
for a house that is not supported by a foundation quickly falls to ruins. The
case is the same with those who lean on any other foundation than Christ, or at
least are not securely founded on him, but have the building of their faith
suspended, as it were, in the air, in consequence of their weakness and
levity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These two things are to be observed in the
Apostle&#8217;s words &#8212; that the stability of those who rely upon Christ
is immovable, and their course is not at all wavering, or liable to error, (and
this is an admirable commendation of faith from its effect;) and,
<i>secondly</i>, that we must make progress in Christ aye and until we have
taken deep root in him. From this we may readily gather, that those who do not
know Christ only wander into bypaths, and are tossed about in
disquietude.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And confirmed in the
faith.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now repeats without a figure the same
thing that he had expressed by metaphors, &#8212; that the prosecution of the
way, the support of the root, and of the foundation, is firmness and
steadfastness of faith. And observe, that this argument is set before them in
consequence of their having been well instructed, in order that they may safely
and confidently secure their footing in the faith with which they had been made
acquainted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Abounding</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
He would not have them simply remain immovable, but would have them grow every
day more and more. When he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with
thanksgiving</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he would have them always keep in
mind from what source faith itself proceeds, that they may not be puffed up with
presumption, but may rather with fear repose themselves in the gift of God. And,
unquestionably, ingratitude is very frequently the reason why we are deprived of
the light of the gospel, as well as of other divine favors.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Beware lest any one plunder

although this, as we have stated, is a common remedy against all the impostures
of the devil, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb95</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it had,
nevertheless, at that time a peculiar advantage among the Colossians, to which
it required to be applied.

says he, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lest any one plunder

for he alludes to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>plunderers</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
who, when they cannot carry off the flock by violence, drive away some of the
cattle fraudulently. Thus he makes Christ&#8217;s Church a sheep-fold, and the
pure doctrine of the gospel the enclosures of the fold. He intimates,
accordingly, that we who are the sheep of Christ repose in safety when we hold
the unity of the faith, while, on the other hand, he likens the false apostles
to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>plunderers</i></font><font face="Palatino">
that carry us away from the folds. Would you then be reckoned as belonging to
Christ&#8217;s flock? Would you remain in his folds? Do not deviate a

of John is the exposition of the passage before us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Through
philosophy</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As many have mistakingly imagined
that <i>philosophy</i> is here condemned by Paul, we must point out what he
means by this term. Now, in my opinion, he means everything that men contrive of
themselves when wishing to be wise through means of their own understanding, and
that not without a specious pretext of reason, so as to have a plausible
appearance. For there is no difficulty in rejecting those contrivances of men
which have nothing to set them off, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb96</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but in
rejecting those that captivate men&#8217;s minds by a false conceit of wisdom.
Or should any one prefer to have it expressed in one word,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>philosophy</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is no thing else than a persuasive speech, which insinuates itself into the
minds of men by elegant and plausible arguments. Of such a nature, I
acknowledge, will all the subtleties of philosophers be, if they are inclined to
add anything of their own to the pure word of God. Hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>philosophy
</i></font><font face="Palatino">will be nothing else than a corruption of
spiritual doctrine, if it is mixed up with Christ. Let us, however, bear in
mind, that under the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>philosophy</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Paul has merely condemned all spurious doctrines which come forth from
man&#8217;s head, whatever appearance of reason they may have. What immediately
follows, as to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vain
deceit</i></font><font face="Palatino">, I explain thus; &#8220;Beware of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>philosophy</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
which is nothing else than </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vain
deceit</i></font><font face="Palatino">,&#8221; so that this is added by way of
<i>apposition</i>.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb97</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the tradition of
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He points out more precisely what kind of
<i>philosophy</i> he reproves, and at the same time convicts it of vanity on a
twofold account &#8212; because it is <i>not</i> <i>according</i> <i>to</i>
<i>Christ</i>, but according to the inclinations of men; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb98</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
because it consists in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>elements of the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Observe, however, that he places Christ
in opposition to the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>elements of
the world</i></font><font face="Palatino">, equally as to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tradition of
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">, by which he intimates, that whatever is
hatched in man&#8217;s brain is not in accordance with Christ, who has been
appointed us by the Father as our sole Teacher, that he might retain us in the
simplicity of his gospel. Now, that is corrupted by even a small portion of the
leaven of <i>human</i> <i>traditions</i>. He intimates also, that all doctrines
are foreign to Christ that make the worship of God, which we know to be
spiritual, according to Christ&#8217;s rule, to consist in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>elements of the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb99</font></sup><font face="Palatino">and also
such as fetter the minds of men by such trifles and frivolities, while Christ
calls us directly to himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what is meant by the phrase &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>elements of the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">? 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb100</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There
can be no doubt that it means ceremonies. For he immediately afterwards adduces
one instance by way of example<i> &#8212; </i> <i>circumcision</i>. The reason
why he calls them by such a name is usually explained in two ways. Some think
that it is a metaphor, so that the <i>elements</i> are the rudiments of
children, which do not lead forward to mature doctrine. Others take it in its
proper signification, as denoting things that are outward and are liable to
corruption, which avail nothing for the kingdom of God. The former exposition I
rather approve of, as also in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:3.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For in him
dwelleth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here we have the reason why those
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>elements of the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which are taught by men, do not accord
with Christ &#8212; because they are additions for supplying a deficiency, as
they speak. Now in Christ there is a perfection, to which nothing can be added.
Hence everything that mankind of themselves mix up, is at variance with
Christ&#8217;s nature, because it charges him with imperfection. This argument
of itself will suffice for setting aside all the contrivances of Papists. For to
what purpose do they tend, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb101</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but to
perfect what was commenced by Christ? 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb102</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now
this outrage upon Christ 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb103</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is not
by any means to be endured. They allege, it is true, that they add nothing to
Christ, inasmuch as the things that they have appended to the gospel are, as it
were, a part of Christianity, but they do not effect an escape by a cavil of
this kind. For Paul does not speak of an imaginary Christ, but of a Christ
preached, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb104</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who
has revealed himself by express doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Further, when he says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fullness of the
Godhead</i></font><font face="Palatino"> dwells in Christ, he means simply, that
God is wholly found in him, so that he who is not contented with Christ alone,
desires something better and more excellent than God. The sum is this, that God
has manifested himself to us fully and perfectly in Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Interpreters explain in different ways the adverb
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bodily</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
For my part, I have no doubt that it is employed &#8212; not in a strict sense
&#8212; as meaning <i>substantially</i>. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb105</font></sup><font face="Palatino">For he
places this manifestation of God, which we have in Christ, to all others that
have ever been made. For God has often manifested himself to men, but it has
been only in part. In Christ, on the other hand, he communicates himself to us
wholly. He has also manifested himself to us otherwise, but it is in figures, or
by power and grace. In Christ, on the other hand, he has appeared to us
essentially. Thus the statement of John holds good:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">He that hath the Son,
hath the Father also. (1 John 2 23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For those who possess Christ have God truly present,
and enjoy Him wholly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye are complete in
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He adds, that this perfect essence of
Deity, which is in Christ, is profitable to us in this respect, that we are also
perfect in him. &#8220;As to God&#8217;s dwelling wholly in Christ, it is in
order that we, having obtained him, may posses in him an entire
perfection.&#8221; Those, therefore, who do not rest satisfied with Christ
alone, do injury to God in two ways, for besides detracting from the glory of
God, by desiring something above his perfection, they are also ungrateful,
inasmuch as they seek elsewhere what they already have in Christ. Paul, however,
does not mean that the perfection of Christ is transfused into us, but that
there are in him resources from which we may be filled, that nothing may be
wanting to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is the
head.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He has introduced this clause again on
account of the angels, meaning that the angels, also, will be ours, if we have
Christ. But of this afterwards. In the mean time, we must observe this, that we
are hemmed in, above and below, with railings, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb106</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
our faith may not deviate even to the slightest extent from
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In whom ye also are
circumcised.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> From this it appears, that he has
a controversy with the false apostles, who mixed the law with the gospel, and by
that means made Christ have, as it were, two faces. He specifies, however, one
instance by way of example. He proves that the circumcision of Moses is not
merely unnecessary, but is opposed to Christ, because it destroys the spiritual
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>circumcision of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For circumcision was given to the
Fathers that it might be the figure of a thing that was absent: those,
therefore, who retain that figure after Christ&#8217;s advent, deny the
accomplishment of what it prefigures. Let us, therefore, bear in mind that
outward </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>circumcision
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is here compared with spiritual, just as a
figure with the reality. The figure is of a thing that is absent: hence it puts
away the presence of the reality. What Paul contends for is this &#8212; that,
inasmuch as what was shadowed forth by a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>circumcision made with
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">, has been completed in Christ, there is
now no fruit or advantage from it. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence
he says, that the circumcision which is made in the heart is the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>circumcision of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and that, on this account, that which
is outward is not now required, because, where the reality exists, that shadowy
emblem vanishes, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb108</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
inasmuch as it has no place except in the absence of the
reality.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the putting off of the
body.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He employs the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>body</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
by an elegant metaphor, to denote a mass, made up of all vices. For as we are
encompassed by our bodies, so we are surrounded on all sides by an accumulation
of vices. And as the body is composed of various members, each of which has its
own actings and offices, so from that accumulation of corruption all sins take
their rise as members of the entire body. There is a similar manner of
expression in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:13.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He takes the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
as he is wont, to denote corrupt nature. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>body of the sins of the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">, therefore, is the <i>old</i> <i>man</i>
<i>with</i> <i>his</i> <i>deeds</i>; only, there is a difference in the manner
of expression, for here he expresses more properly the mass of vices which
proceed from corrupt nature. He says that we obtain this 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb109</font></sup><font face="Palatino">through
Christ, so that unquestionably an entire regeneration is his benefit. It is he
that circumcises the foreskin of our heart, or, in other words, mortifies all
the lusts of the flesh, not with the <i>hand</i>, but by his Spirit. Hence there
is in him the reality of the figure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Buried with him, in
baptism.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He explains still more clearly the
manner of spiritual circumcision &#8212; because, being
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>buried with
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, we are partakers of his death. He
expressly declares that we obtain this by means of baptism, that it may be the
more clearly apparent that there is no advantage from circumcision under the
reign of Christ. For some one might otherwise object: &#8220;Why do you abolish
circumcision on this pretext &#8212; that its accomplishment is in Christ? Was
not Abraham, also, circumcised spiritually, and yet this did not hinder the
adding of the sign to the reality? <i>Outward</i> circumcision, therefore, is
not superfluous, although that which is <i>inward</i> is conferred by
Christ.&#8221; Paul anticipates an objection of this kind, by making mention of
baptism. Christ, says he, accomplishes in us spiritual circumcision, not through
means of that ancient sign, which was in force under Moses, but by baptism.
Baptism, therefore, is a sign of the thing that is presented to us, which while
absent was prefigured by circumcision. The argument is taken from the, economy 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb110</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which
God has appointed; for those who retain circumcision contrive a mode of
dispensation different from that which God has appointed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says that we are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>buried with
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, this means more than that we are
<i>crucified</i> with him; for burial expresses a continued process of
mortification. When he says, that this is done through means of baptism, as he
says also in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:4, he speaks in his usual manner, ascribing efficacy to the sacrament, that it
may not fruitlessly signify what does not exist. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb111</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By
baptism, therefore, we are </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>buried
with Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because Christ does at the same
time accomplish efficaciously that mortification, which he there represents,
that the reality may be conjoined with the sign.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In which also ye are
risen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He magnifies the grace which we obtain
in Christ, as being greatly superior to circumcision. &#8220;We are not
only,&#8221; says he, &#8220;ingrafted into Christ&#8217;s death, but we also
rise to newness of life:&#8221; hence the more injury is done to Christ by those
who endeavor to bring us back to circumcision. He adds, <i>by</i> <i>faith</i>,
for unquestionably it is by it that we receive what is presented to us in
baptism. But what <i>faith</i>? That of his <i>efficacy</i> or <i>operation</i>,
by which he means, that faith is founded upon the power of God. As, however,
faith does not wander in a confused and undefined contemplation, as they speak,
of divine power, he intimates what <i>efficacy</i> it ought to have in view
&#8212; that by which </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God raised
Christ from the dead</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He takes this, however,
for granted, that, inasmuch as it is impossible that believers should be severed
from their head, the same power of God, which shewed itself in Christ, is
diffused among them all in common.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And you, when ye were
dead.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He admonishes the Colossians to
recognize, what he had treated of in a general way, as applicable to themselves,
which is by far the most effectual way of teaching. Farther, as they were
Gentiles when they were converted to Christ, he takes occasion from this to shew
them how absurd it is to pass over from Christ to the ceremonies of Moses.
<i>Ye</i> <i>were</i>, says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dead
in</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Uncircumcision</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
This term, however, may be understood either in its proper signification, or
figuratively. If you understand it in its proper sense, the meaning will be,
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Uncircumcision</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is the badge of alienation from God; for where the covenant of grace is not,
<i>there</i> is pollution, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb112</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and,
consequently, curse and ruin. But God has called you to himself from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>uncircumcision</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and, therefore, from death.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb113</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
this way he would not represent
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>uncircumcision</i></font><font face="Palatino">
as the cause of death, but as a token that they were estranged from God. We
know, however, that men cannot live otherwise than by cleaving to their God, who
alone is their life. Hence it follows, that all wicked persons, however they may
seem to themselves to be in the highest degree lively and flourishing, are,
nevertheless, spiritually dead. In this manner this passage will correspond with
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:11, where it is said,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Remember that, in time past, when ye
were Gentiles, and called uncircumcision, by that circumcision which is made
with hands in the flesh, ye were at that time without Christ, alienated from the
commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the promises.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Taking it metaphorically, there would, indeed, be an
allusion to natural uncircumcision, but at the same time Paul would here be
speaking of the obstinacy of the human heart, in opposition to God, and of a
nature that is defiled by corrupt affections. I rather prefer the former
exposition, because it corresponds better with the context; for Paul declares
that uncircumcision was no hinderance in the way of their becoming partakers of
Christ&#8217;s life. Hence it follows, that circumcision derogated from the
grace of God, which they had already obtained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to his ascribing death to uncircumcision, this is
not as though it were the cause of it, but as being the badge of it, as also in
that other passage in the Epistle to the Ephesians, which we have quoted. It is
also customary in Scripture to denote deprivation of the reality by deprivation
of the sign, as in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010322&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
3:22, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Lest peradventure Adam
eat of the fruit of life, and live.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the tree did not confer life, but its being taken
away was a sign of death. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb114</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Paul
has in this place briefly expressed both. He says that these were <i>dead in</i>
<i>sins</i>: this is the cause, for our sins alienate us from God. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the uncircumcision of your
flesh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This was outward pollution, an evidence
of spiritual death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By forgiving
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> God does not quicken us by the mere
remission of sins, but he makes mention here of this particularly, because that
free reconciliation with God, which overthrows the righteousness of works, is
especially connected with the point in hand, where he treats of abrogated
ceremonies, as he discourses of more at large in the Epistle to the Galatians.
For the false apostles, by establishing ceremonies, bound them with a halter,
from which Christ has set them free.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having blotted out the
hand-writing which was against us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now
contends with the false apostles in close combat. For this was the main point in
question, &#8212; whether the observance of ceremonies was necessary under the
reign of Christ? Now Paul contends that ceremonies have been abolished, and to
prove this he compares them to a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand-writing</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
by which God holds us as it were bound, that we may not be able to deny our
guilt. He now says, that we have been freed from condemnation, in such a manner,
that even the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand-writing is
blotted out</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that no remembrance of it might
remain. For we know that as to debts the obligation is still in force, so long
as the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
hand-writing</i></font><font face="Palatino"> remains; and that, on the other
hand, by the erasing, or tearing of the handwriting, the debtor is set free.
Hence it follows, that all those who still urge the observance of ceremonies,
detract from the grace of Christ, as though absolution were not procured for us
through him; for they restore to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand-writing</i></font><font face="Palatino">
its freshness, so as to hold us still under obligation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, therefore, is a truly theological reason for
proving the abrogation of ceremonies, because, if Christ has fully redeemed us
from condemnation, he must have also effaced the remembrance of the obligation,
that consciences may be pacified and tranquil in the sight of God, for these two
things are conjoined. While interpreters explain this passage in various ways,
there is not one of them that satisfies me. Some think that Paul speaks simply
of the moral law, but there is no ground for this. For Paul is accustomed to
give the name of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ordinances
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to that department which consists in
ceremonies, as he does in the Epistle to the Ephesians,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:15,) and as we shall find he does shortly afterwards. More especially, the
passage in Ephesians shews clearly, that Paul is here speaking of
ceremonies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Others, therefore, do better, in restricting it to
ceremonies, but they, too, err in this respect, that they do not add the reason
why it is </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called
hand-writing</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or rather they assign a reason
different from the true one, and they do not in a proper manner apply this
similitude to the context. Now, the reason is, that all the ceremonies of Moses
had in them some acknowledgment of guilt, which bound those that observed them
with a firmer tie, as it were, in the view of God&#8217;s judgment. For example,
what else were washings than an evidence of pollution? Whenever any victim was
sacrificed, did not the people that stood by behold in it a representation of
his death? For when persons substituted in their place an innocent animal, they
confessed that they were themselves deserving of that death. In fine, in
proportion as there were ceremonies belonging to it, just so many exhibitions
were there of human guilt, and <i>hand-writings</i> of
obligation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Should any one object that they were sacraments of
the grace of God, as Baptism and the Eucharist are to us at this day, the answer
is easy. For there are two things to be considered in the ancient ceremonies
&#8212; that they were suited to the time, and that they led men forward to the
kingdom of Christ. Whatever was done at that time shewed in itself nothing but
obligation. Grace was in a manner suspended until the advent of Christ &#8212; 
not that the Fathers were excluded from it, but they had not a present
manifestation of it in their ceremonies. For they saw nothing in the sacrifices
but the blood of beasts, and in their washings nothing but water. Hence, as to
present view, condemnation remained; nay more, the ceremonies themselves sealed
the condemnation. The Apostle speaks, also, in this manner in the whole of his
Epistle to the Hebrews, because he places Christ in direct opposition to
ceremonies. But how is it now? The Son of God has not only by his death
delivered us from the condemnation of death, but in order that absolution might
be made more certain, he abrogated those ceremonies, that no remembrance of
obligation might remain. This is full liberty &#8212; that Christ has by his
blood not only blotted out our sins, but every
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand-writing</i></font><font face="Palatino">
which might declare us to be exposed to the judgment of God. Erasmus in his
version has involved in confusion the thread of Paul&#8217;s discourse, by
rendering it thus &#8212; &#8220;which was contrary to us by ordinances.&#8221;
Retain, therefore, the rendering which I have given, as being the true and
genuine one.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Took it out of the way, fastening
it to his cross.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews the manner in which
Christ has effaced the <i>hand-writing</i>; for as he fastened to the cross our
curse, our sins, and also the punishment that was due to us, so he has also
fastened to it that bondage of the law, and everything that tends to bind
consciences. For, on his being fastened to the cross, he took all things to
himself, and even bound them upon him, that they might have no more power over
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spoiling
principalities.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is no doubt that he means
devils, whom Scripture represents as acting the part of accusing us before God.
Paul, however, says that they are disarmed, so that they cannot bring forward
anything against us, the attestation of our guilt being itself destroyed. Now,
he expressly adds this with the view of shewing, that the victory of Christ,
which he has procured for himself and us over Satan, is disfigured by the false
apostles, and that we are deprived of the fruit of it when they restore the
ancient ceremonies. For if our liberty is the spoil which Christ has rescued
from the devil, what do others, who would bring us back into bondage, but
restore to Satan the spoils of which he had been stript bare?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Triumphing over them in
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The expression in the Greek allows, it is
true, of our reading &#8212; <i>in</i> <i>himself</i>; nay more, the greater
part of the manuscripts have </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn
auJtw|</font><font face="Palatino"> with an aspirate. The connection of the
passage, however, imperatively requires that we read it otherwise; for what
would be meagre as applied to Christ, suits admirably as applied to the cross.
For as he had previously compared the cross to a signal trophy or show of
triumph, in which Christ led about his enemies, so he now also compares it to a
triumphal car, in which he shewed himself conspicuously to view. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb115</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
although in the cross there is nothing but curse, it was, nevertheless,
swallowed up by the power of God in such a way, that it 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb116</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> has
put on, as it were, a new nature. For there is no tribunal so magnificent, no
throne so stately, no show of triumph so distinguished, no chariot so elevated, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb117</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as is
the gibbet on which Christ has subdued death and the devil, the prince of death;
nay more, has utterly trodden them under his feet.</font><br></div>

circumcision was the first introduction to the observance of the law other
things

followed afterwards. To </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judge

crime, or to impose a scruple of conscience, so that we are no longer free. He
says, therefore, that it is not in the power of men to make us subject to the
observance of rites which Christ has by his death abolished, and exempts us from
their yoke, that we may not allow ourselves to be fettered by the laws which
they have imposed. He tacitly, however, places Christ in contrast with all
mankind, lest any one should extol himself so daringly as to attempt to take
away what he has given him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In respect of a

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt;
me&gt;rov</font><font face="Palatino"> to mean <i>participation</i>. Chrysostom,
accordingly, thinks that he used the term <i>part</i>, because they did not
observe all festival days, nor did they even keep holidays strictly, in
accordance with the appointment of the law. This, however, is but a poor
interpretation. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb121</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Consider
whether it may not be taken to mean <i>separation</i>, for those that make a
distinction of days, separate, as it were, one from another. Such a mode of
partition was suitable for the Jews, that they might celebrate religiously 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb122</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the
days that were appointed, by separating them from others. Among Christians,
however, such a division has ceased.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But some one will say, &#8220;We still keep up some
observance of days.&#8221; I answer, that we do not by any means observe days,
as though there were any sacredness in holidays, or as though it were not lawful
to labor upon them, but that respect is paid to government and order &#8212; not
to days. And this is what he immediately adds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which are a shadow of things
to come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The reason why he frees Christians
from the observance of them is, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shadows
</i></font><font face="Palatino">at a time when Christ was still, in a manner,
absent. For he contrasts shadows with revelation, and absence with
manifestation. Those, therefore, who still adhere to those
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shadows</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
act like one who should judge of a man&#8217;s appearance from his shadow, while
in the mean time he had himself personally before his eyes. For Christ is now
manifested to us, and hence we enjoy him as being present.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
body</i></font><font face="Palatino">, says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, IN
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
For the substance of those things which the ceremonies anciently prefigured is
now presented before our eyes in Christ, inasmuch as he contains in himself
everything that they marked out as future. Hence, the man that calls back the
ceremonies into use, either buries the manifestation of Christ, or robs Christ
of his excellence, and makes him in a manner void. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb123</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Accordingly, should any one of mortals assume to himself in this matter the
office of judge, let us not submit to him, inasmuch as Christ, the only
competent Judge, sets us free. For when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let no man judge
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he does not address the false apostles,
but prohibits the Colossians from yielding their neck to unreasonable
requirements. To abstain, it is true, from swine&#8217;s flesh, is in itself
harmless, but the binding to do it is pernicious, because it makes void the
grace of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Should any one ask, &#8220;What view, then, is to be
taken of our sacraments? Do they not also represent Christ to us as
absent?&#8221; I answer, that they differ widely from the ancient ceremonies.
For as painters do not in the first draught bring out a likeness in vivid
colors, and
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijkonikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>expressively</i>, but in the first instance draw rude and obscure lines with
charcoal, so the representation of Christ under the law was unpolished, and was,
as it were, a first sketch, but in our sacraments it is seen drawn out to the
life. Paul, however, had something farther in view, for he contrasts the bare
aspect of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shadow</i></font><font face="Palatino">
with the solidity of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>body</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and admonishes them, that it is the part of a madman to take hold of empty
shadows, when it is in his power to handle the solid substance. Farther, while
our sacraments represent Christ as absent as to view and distance of place, it
is in such a manner as to testify that he has been once manifested, and they now
also present him to us to be enjoyed. They are not, therefore, bare shadows, but
on the contrary symbols 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb124</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of

alludes to runners, or wrestlers, to whom the <i>palm</i> was assigned, on
condition of their not giving way in the middle of the course, or after the
contest had been commenced. He admonishes them, therefore, that the false
apostles aimed at nothing else than to snatch away from them the palm, inasmuch
as they draw them aside from the rectitude of their course. Hence it follows
that they must be shunned as the most injurious pests. The passage is also
carefully to be marked as intimating, that all those who draw us aside from the
simplicity of Christ cheat us out of the <i>prize</i> <i>of</i> <i>our</i>

have, inserted in the text <i>id</i> <i>facere</i>, (<i>to</i> <i>do</i>
<i>it</i>.) For he points out the kind of danger which they required to guard
against. All are desirous to defraud you of the <i>palm</i>, who, under the
pretext of humility, recommend to you the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>worship of
angels</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For their object is, that you may
wander out of the way, leaving the one object of aim. I read <i>humility</i>
<i>and</i> <i>worship</i> <i>of</i> <i>angels</i> conjointly, for the one
follows the other, just as at this day the Papists make use of the same pretext
when philosophizing as to the worship of saints. For they reason on the ground
of man&#8217;s abasement, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb126</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
we must, therefore, seek for mediators to help us. But for this very reason has
Christ humbled himself &#8212; that we might directly betake ourselves to him,
however miserable sinners we may be.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I am aware that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>worship of
angels</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is by many interpreted otherwise, as
meaning such as has been delivered to men by angels; for the Devil has always
endeavored to set off his impostures under this title. The Pope at this day
boasts, that all the trifles with which he has adulterated the pure worship of
God are revelations. In like manner the Theurgians 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb127</font></sup><font face="Palatino">of old
alleged that all the superstitions that they contrived were delivered over to
them by angels, as if </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from hand
to hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb128</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They,
accordingly, think that Paul here condemns all fanciful kinds of worship that
are falsely set forth under the authority of angels. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb129</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But,
in my opinion, he rather condemns the contrivance as to the worshipping of
angels. It is on this account that he has so carefully applied himself to this
in the very commencement of the Epistle, to bring angels under subjection, lest
they should obscure the splendor of Christ. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb130</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
fine, as he had in the first chapter prepared the way for abolishing the
ceremonies, so he had also for the removal of all other hinderances which draw
us away from Christ alone. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb131</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
this class is the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>worship of
angels</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Superstitious persons have from the beginning
worshipped angels, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb132</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
through means of them there might be free access to God. The Platonists infected
the Christian Church also with this error. For although Augustine sharply
inveighs against them in his tenth book &#8220;On the City of God,&#8221; and
condemns at great length all their disputations as to the worship of angels, we
see nevertheless what has happened. Should any one compare the writings of Plato
with Popish theology, he will find that they have drawn wholly from Plato their
prattling as to the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>worship of
angels</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The sum is this, that we must honor
angels, whom Plato calls demons,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ca&gt;rin th~v eujfh&gt;mou
diaporei&gt;av</font><font face="Palatino"> (<i>for</i> <i>the</i> <i>sake</i>
<i>of</i> <i>their</i> <i>auspicious</i> <i>intercession</i>.) 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb133</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
brings forward this sentiment in Epinomis, and he confirms it in Cratylus, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb134</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
many other passages. In what respect do the Papists differ at all from this?
&#8220;<i>But</i>,&#8221; it will be said, &#8220;they do not deny that the Son
of God is Mediator.&#8221; Neither did those with whom Paul contends; but as
they imagined that God must be approached by the assistance of the angels, and
that, consequently, some worship must be rendered to them, so they placed angels
in the seat of Christ, and honored them with Christ&#8217;s office. Let us know,
then, that Paul here condemns all kinds of worship of human contrivance, which
are rendered either to angels or to the dead, as though they were mediators,
rendering assistance after Christ, or along with Christ. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb135</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
just so far do we recede from Christ, when we transfer the smallest part of what
belongs to him to any others, whether they be angels or men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Intruding into those things which
he hath not seen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejmbateu&gt;ein</font><font face="Palatino">,
the participle of which Paul here makes use of, has various significations. The
rendering which Erasmus, after Jerome, has given to it, <i>walking</i>
<i>proudly</i>, would not suit ill, were there an example of such a
signification in any author of sufficient note. For we see every day with how
much confidence and pride rash persons pronounce an opinion as to things
unknown. Nay, even in the very subject of which Paul treats, there is a
remarkable illustration. For when the Sorbonnic divines put forth their trifles 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb136</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
respecting the intercession of saints or angels, they declare, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb137</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
though it were from an oracle, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb138</font></sup><font face="Palatino">that
the dead 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb139</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> know
and behold our necessities, inasmuch as they see all things in the reflex light
of God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb140</font></sup><font face="Palatino">And
yet, what is less certain? Nay more, what is more obscure and doubtful? But
such, truly, is their magisterial freedom, that they fearlessly and daringly
assert what is not only not known by them, but cannot be known by
men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This meaning, therefore, would be suitable, if that
signification of the term were usual. It is, however, among the Greeks taken
simply as meaning to <i>walk</i>. It also sometimes means to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inquire</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Should any one choose to understand it thus in this passage, Paul will, in that
case, reprove a foolish curiosity in the investigation of things that are
obscure, and such as are even hid from our view and transcend it. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb141</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  It
appears to me, however, that I have caught Paul&#8217;s meaning, and have
rendered it faithfully in this manner &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>intruding into those things which
he hath not seen</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For that is the common
signification of the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejmbateu&gt;ein</font><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; to enter upon an inheritance, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb142</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or to
take possession, or to set foot anywhere. Accordingly, Budaeus renders this
passage thus: &#8212; &#8220;<i>Setting</i> foot upon, or entering on the
possession of those things which he has not seen.&#8221; I have followed his
authority, but have selected a more suitable term. For such persons in reality
break through and intrude into secret things, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb143</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of
which God would have no discovery as yet made to us. The passage ought to be
carefully observed, for the purpose of reproving the rashness 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb144</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of
those who inquire farther than is allowable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Puffed up in vain by a fleshly
mind.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He employs the expression <i>fleshly</i>
<i>mind</i> to denote the perspicuity of the human intellect, however great it
may be. For he places it in contrast with that spiritual wisdom which is
revealed to us from heaven in accordance with that statement
&#8212;</font><br></div>

from themselves is mere wind: hence there is nothing solid except in the word of
God and the illumination of the Spirit. And observe, that those are said to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>puffed
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"> who insinuate themselves 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb146</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> under
a show of humility. For it happens, as Augustine elegantly writes to Paulinus,
by wonderful means, as to the soul of man, that it is more puffed up from a
false humility than if it were openly proud.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not holding the
head</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He condemns in the use of one word
whatever does not bear a relation to Christ. He also confirms his statement on
the ground that all things flow from him, and depend upon him. Hence, should any
one call us anywhere else than to Christ, though in other respects he were big
with heaven and earth, he is empty and full of wind: let us, therefore, without
concern, bid him farewell. Observe, however, of whom he is speaking, namely, of
those who did not openly reject or deny Christ, but, not accurately
understanding his office and power, by seeking out other helps and means of
salvation, (as they commonly speak,) were not firmly rooted in
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From whom the whole body by
joints.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He simply means this, that the Church
does not stand otherwise than in the event of all things being furnished to her
by Christ, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Head</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and, accordingly, that her entire safety 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb147</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
consists in him. The body, it is true, has its nerves, its <i>joints</i>,
<i>and</i> <i>ligaments</i>, but all these things derive their vigor solely from
the Head, so that the whole binding of them together is from that source. What,
then, must be done? The constitution of the body will be in a right state, if
simply the Head, which furnishes the several members with everything that they
have, is allowed, without any hinderance, to have the pre-eminence. This Paul
speaks of as the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>increase of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, by which he means that it is not every
increase that is approved by God, but only that which has a relation to the
Head. For we see that the kingdom of the Pope is not merely tall and large, but
swells out into a monstrous size. As, however, we do not there see what Paul
here requires in the Church, what shall we say, but that it is a humpbacked
body, and a confused mass that will fall to pieces of itself.</font><br></div>

ordinances were fastened to the cross of Christ.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:14.) He now employs another figure of speech &#8212; that we
are</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to them, as he teaches us elsewhere, that
we are <i>dead</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>law</i>, and the law, on the other
hand, to us. (Galatians 2:19.) The term death means abrogation, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb152</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but it
is more expressive <i>and</i> <i>more</i> <i>emphatic</i>,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kai&lt;
ejmfatikw&gt;teron</font><font face="Palatino">.) He says, therefore, that the
Colossians, have nothing to do with ordinances. Why? Because they have died with
Christ to ordinances; that is, after they died with Christ by regeneration, they
were, through his kindness, set free from ordinances, that they may not belong
to them any more. Hence he concludes that they are by no means bound by the
ordinances, which the false apostles endeavored to impose upon
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Handle
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but as another word immediately follows,
which signifies the same thing, every one sees how cold and absurd were such a
repetition. Farther, the verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">a[ptesqai</font><font face="Palatino">
is employed by the Greeks, among its other significations, in the sense of
<i>eating</i>, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb153</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in
accordance with the rendering that I have given. Plutarch makes use of it in the
life of Caesar, when he relates that his soldiers, in destitution of all things,
<i>ate</i> animals which they had not been accustomed previously to use as food.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb154</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
this arrangement is both in other respects natural and is also most in
accordance with the connection of the passage; for Paul points out,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mimhtikw~v</font><font face="Palatino">,)
<i>by</i> <i>way</i> <i>of</i> <i>imitation</i>, to what length the waywardness
of those who bind consciences by their laws is wont to proceed. From the very
commencement they are unduly rigorous: hence he sets out with their prohibition
&#8212; not simply against eating, but even against slightly partaking. After
they have obtained what they wish they go beyond that command, so that they
afterwards declare it to be unlawful to taste of what they do not wish should be
eaten. At length they make it criminal even to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>touch</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
In short, when persons have once taken upon them to tyrannize over men&#8217;s
souls, there is no end of new laws being daily added to old ones, and new
enactments starting up from time to time. How bright a mirror there is as to
this in Popery! Hence Paul acts admirably well in admonishing us that human
traditions are a labyrinth, in which consciences are more and more entangled;
nay more, are snares, which from the beginning bind in such a way that in course
of time they strangle in the end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.

argument, the enactments of which he has made mention &#8212; because they make
religion consist in things outward and frail, which have no connection with the
spiritual kingdom of God; and secondly, because they are from men, not from God.
He combats the first argument, also, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:17, when he says,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The sum is this &#8212; that the worship of God, true
piety, and the holiness of Christians, do not consist in drink, and food, and
clothing, which are things that are transient and liable to corruption, and
perish by abuse. For abuse is properly applicable to those things which are
corrupted by the use of them. Hence enactments are of no value in reference to
those things which tend to excite scruples of conscience. But in Popery you
would scarcely find any other holiness, than what consists in little observances
of corruptible things.</font><br></div>

&#8212; that they originated with men, and have not God as their Author; and by
this thunderbolt he prostrates and swallows up all traditions of men. For why?
This is Paul&#8217;s reasoning: &#8220;Those who bring consciences into bondage
do injury to Christ, and make void his death. For whatever is of human invention
does not bind conscience.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.

show.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here we have the anticipation of an
objection, in which, while he concedes to his adversaries what they allege, he
at the same time reckons it wholly worthless. For it is as though he had said,
that he does not regard their having

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>show</i></font><font face="Palatino">

<div><font face="Palatino">Observe, however, of what colors this

worship, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb157</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
humility, and neglect of the body. Superstition among the Greeks receives the
name of
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejqelobrhskei&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; the term which Paul here makes use of. He has, however, an eye to the
etymology of the term, for
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejqelobrhskei&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">
literally denotes a voluntary service, which men choose for themselves at their
own option, without authority from God. Human traditions, therefore, are
agreeable to us on this account, that they are in accordance with our
understanding, for any one will find in his own brain the first outlines of
them. This is the <i>first</i> pretext.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>second</i> is humility, inasmuch as obedience
both to God and men is pretended, so that men do not refuse even unreasonable
burdens. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb158</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
for the most part traditions of this kind are of such a nature as to appear to
be admirable exercises of humility.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They allure, also, by means of a <i>third</i>
pretext, inasmuch as they seem to be of the greatest avail for the mortification
of the flesh, while there is no sparing of the body. Paul, however, bids
farewell to those disguises, for</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">what is in high esteem
among men is often an abomination in the sight of God. (Luke 16
15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, <i>that</i> is a treacherous obedience, and
a perverse and sacrilegious humility, which transfers to men the authority of
God; and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>neglect of the
body</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is not of so great importance, as to be
worthy to be set forth to admiration as the service of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some one, however, will feel astonished, that Paul
does not take more pains in pulling off those masks. I answer, that he on good
grounds rests contented with the simple term <i>show</i>. For the principles
which he had taken as opposed to this are incontrovertible &#8212; that the body
is in Christ, and that, consequently, those do nothing but impose upon miserable
men, who set before them shadows. <i>Secondly</i>, the spiritual kingdom of
Christ is by no means taken up with frail and corruptible elements.
<i>Thirdly</i>, by the death of Christ such observances were put an end to, that
we might have no connection with them; and, <i>fourthly</i>, God is our only
<i>Lawgiver</i>.

much splendor, is fleeting <i>show</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Secondly</i>, he reckoned it enough to admonish
the Colossians, not to be deceived by the putting forth of empty things. There
was no necessity for dwelling at greater length in reproving them. For it should
be a settled point among all the pious, that the worship of God ought not to be
measured according to our views; and that, consequently, any kind of service is
not lawful, simply on the ground that it is agreeable to us. This, also, ought
to be a commonly received point &#8212; that we owe to God such humility as to
yield obedience simply to his commands, so as not to <i>lean</i> <i>to</i>
<i>our</i> <i>own</i> <i>understanding</i>, etc.,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;200305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
3:5,) &#8212; and that the limit of humility towards men is this &#8212; that
each one submit himself to others in love. Now, when they contend that the
wantonness of the flesh is repressed by abstinence from meats, the answer is
easy &#8212; that we must not therefore abstain from any particular food as
being unclean, but must eat sparingly of what we do eat of, both in order that
we may soberly and temperately make use of the gifts of God, and that we may
not, impeded by too much food and drink, forget those things that are
God&#8217;s. Hence it was enough to say that these 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb159</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> were
masks, that the Colossians, being warned, might be on their guard against false
pretexts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus, at the present day, Papists are not in want of
specious pretexts, by which to set forth their own laws, however they may be
&#8212; some of them impious and tyrannical, and others of them silly and
trifling. When, however, we have granted them everything, there remains,
nevertheless, this refutation by Paul, which is of itself more than sufficient
for dispelling all their smoky vapours; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb160</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> not to
say how far removed they 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb161</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are
from so honorable an appearance as that which Paul describes. The principal
holiness of the Papacy, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb162</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> at the
present day, consists in monkhood, and of what nature that is, I am ashamed and
grieved to make mention, lest I should stir up so abominable an odour. Farther,
it is of importance to consider here, how prone, nay, how forward the mind of
man is to artificial modes of worship. For the Apostle here graphically
describes 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb163</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the
state of the old system of monkhood, which came into use a hundred years after
his death, as though he had never spoken a word. The zeal of men, therefore, for
superstition is surpassingly mad, which could not be restrained by so plain a
declaration of God from breaking forth, as historical records
testify.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not in any honor.
Honour</i></font><font face="Palatino"> means <i>care</i>, according to the
usage of the Hebrew tongue. <i>Honour</i> <i>widows</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 5:3,) that is, take care of them. Now Paul finds fault with this, that
they  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb164</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
teach to leave off care for the body. For as God forbids us to indulge the body
unduly, so he commands that these be given it as much as is necessary for it.
Hence Paul, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:14, does not expressly condemn care for the flesh, but such as indulges
lusts. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have no
care</i></font><font face="Palatino">, says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the flesh, to the gratifying
of its lusts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What, then, does Paul point out
as faulty in those traditions of which he treats? It is that they gave no honor
to the body for the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>satisfying
the flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, according to the measure of
necessity. For
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>satisfying</i></font><font face="Palatino">
here means a mediocrity, which restricts itself to the simple use of nature, and
thus stands in opposition to pleasure and all superfluous delicacies; for nature
is content with little. Hence, to refuse what it requires for sustaining the
necessity of life, is not less at variance with piety, than it is
inhuman.</font><br></div>

urged, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb165</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
though perfection consisted in them, he opposes those true exercises in which it
becomes Christians to employ themselves; and this has no, slight bearing upon
the point in hand; for when we see what God would have us do, we afterwards
easily despise the inventions of men. When we perceive, too, that what God
recommends to us is much more lofty and excellent than what men inculcate, our
alacrity of mind increases for following God, so as to disregard men. Paul here
exhorts the Colossians to meditation upon the heavenly life. And what as to his
opponents? They were desirous to retain their childish rudiments. This doctrine,
therefore, makes the ceremonies be the more lightly esteemed. Hence it is
manifest that Paul, in this passage, exhorts in such a manner as to confirm the
foregoing doctrine; for, in describing solid piety and holiness of life, his aim
is, that those vain <i>shows</i> of human traditions may vanish. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb166</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> At the

themselves to such exercises, of whatever sort they may be?&#8221; When,
therefore, he bids Christians apply themselves to exercises of a greatly
superior kind, he cuts off the handle for this calumny; nay more, he loads them
with no small odium, on the ground that they impede the right course of the
pious by worthless amusements.

exposition of what he had lately touched upon as to the abolition of ceremonies
through the death of Christ. &#8220;The ceremonies are dead to you through the

Christ, you may think only of those things that are above. Leave off therefore
earthly things.&#8221; I shall not contend against others who are of a different
mind; but certainly the Apostle appears to me to go on step by step, so that, in
the first instance, he places traditions as to trivial matters in contrast with
meditation on the heavenly life, and afterwards, as we shall see, goes a step
farther.</font><br></div>

<i>again</i> to <i>dying</i>, as from a consequent to an antecedent, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb170</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
meaning that we must be dead to the world that we may live to Christ. Why has he
taught, that we must </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seek those

of the pious is <i>above</i>. Why does he now teach, that the things which are

goes before that resurrection, of which I have spoken. Hence both of them must
be seen in you.&#8221;</font><br></div>

<i>secondly</i>, the fellowship of Christ brings still greater security. For
what is to be more desired by us than this &#8212; that our life remain with the
very fountain of life. Hence there is no reason why we should be alarmed if, on
looking around on every side, we nowhere see life. For we are</font><br></div>

contempt of the world. He now proceeds further, and enters upon a higher
philosophy, as to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mortification of the

let us take notice that there is a twofold <i>mortification</i>. The former
relates to those things that are around us. Of this he has hitherto treated. The
other is inward &#8212; that of the understanding and will, and of the whole of
our corrupt nature. He makes mention of certain vices which he calls, not with
strict accuracy, but at the same time elegantly, <i>members</i>. For he
conceives of our nature as being, as it were, a mass made up of different vices.
They are, therefore, our <i>members</i>, inasmuch as they in a manner stick
close to us. He calls them also <i>earthly</i>, alluding to what he had said
&#8212; <i>not</i> <i>the</i> <i>things</i> <i>that</i> <i>are</i> <i>on</i>
<i>earth</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians

things are to be disregarded: you must, however, make it your aim to mortify
those vices which detain you on the earth.&#8221; He intimates, however, that we
are earthly, so long as the vices of our flesh are vigorous in us, and that we
are made heavenly by the renewing of the Spirit.</font><br></div>

with the rendering of Erasmus<i> &#8212; solet</i> <i>venire</i> &#8212;
(<i>is</i> <i>wont</i> <i>to</i> <i>come</i>,) but as the present tense is often
taken in Scripture instead of the future, according to the idiom of the Hebrew
language, I have preferred to leave the rendering undecided, so that it might be
accommodated to either meaning. He warns the Colossians, then, either of the
ordinary judgments of God, which are seen daily, or of the vengeance which he
has once denounced upon the wicked, and which impends over them, but will not be
manifested until the last day. I willingly, however, admit the former meaning
&#8212; that God, who is the perpetual Judge of the world, is accustomed to
punish the crimes in question.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, however, expressly, that the wrath of God
will come, or is wont to come, upon the unbelieving or disobedient, instead of
threatening them with anything of this nature. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb173</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
God would rather that we should see his wrath upon the reprobate, than feel it
in ourselves. It is true, that when the promises of grace are set before us,
every one of the pious ought to embrace them equally as though they were
designed for himself particularly; but, on the other hand, let us dread the
threatenings of wrath and destruction in such a manner, that those things which
are suitable for the reprobate, may serve as a lesson to us. God, it is true, is
often said to be angry even with his children, and sometimes chastens their sins
with severity. Paul speaks here, however, of eternal destruction, of which a
mirror is to be seen only in the reprobate. In short, whenever God threatens, he
shews, as it were, indirectly the punishment, that, beholding it in the
reprobate, we may be deterred from sinning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.

in which he, says that the Colossians had walked, during the time that they

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>living</i></font><font face="Palatino">

thing that they should addict themselves any more to the vices, to which they
had died through Christ. See the sixth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. It

tends towards ruin, so what we obtain through Christ remains for ever, and is
not frail; but, on the contrary, tends towards immortality. This passage is
worthy of notice, inasmuch as a definition of regeneration may be gathered from
it. For it contains two parts &#8212; the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>putting

and of these Paul here makes mention. It is also to be noticed, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>old

by its fruits. Hence it follows, that the depravity that is innate in us is
denoted by the term </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>old

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.

that newness of life consists in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
&#8212; </i>not as though a simple and bare knowledge were sufficient, but he
speaks of the illumination of the Holy Spirit, which is lively and effectual, so
as not merely to enlighten the mind by kindling it up with the light of truth,
but transforming the whole man. And this is what he immediately adds, that we
are </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>renewed after the image of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Now, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>image of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> resides in the whole of the soul, inasmuch
as it is not the reason merely that is rectified, but also the will. Hence, too,
we learn, on the one hand, what is the end of our regeneration, that is, that we
may be made like God, and that his glory may shine forth in us; and, on the
other hand, what is the image of God, of which mention is made by Moses in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
9:6,  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb176</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the rectitude and integrity of the whole soul, so that man reflects, like a
mirror, the wisdom, righteousness, and goodness of God. He speaks somewhat
differently in the Epistle to the Ephesians, but the meaning is the same. See
the passage &#8212;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:24. Paul, at the same time, teaches, that there is nothing more excellent at
which the Colossians can aspire, inasmuch as this is our highest perfection and

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.

may again draw away the Colossians from ceremonies. For the meaning of the
statement is this, that Christian perfection does not stand in need of those
outward observances, nay, that they are things that are altogether at variance
with it. For under the distinction of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>circumcision</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>uncircumcision</i></font><font face="Palatino">,

he includes, by <i>synecdoche</i>, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb177</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> all
outward things. The terms that follow,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>barbarian,

amplification.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ is all, and in
all</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, Christ alone holds, as they say,
the <i>prow</i> and the <i>stern &#8212; </i>the beginning and the end. Farther,
by <i>Christ</i>, he means the spiritual righteousness of Christ, which puts an
end to ceremonies, as we have formerly seen. They are, therefore, superfluous in
a state of true perfection, nay more, they ought to have no place, inasmuch as
injustice would otherwise be done to Christ, as though it were necessary to call
in those helps for making up his deficiencies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Put on
therefore</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As he has enumerated some parts of
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>old

the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>new.

and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kind</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
For these are the effects and evidences of renovation.&#8221; Hence the
exhortation depends on the second clause, and, accordingly, he keeps up the
metaphor in the word rendered </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>put
on</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He mentions, <i>first</i>,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowels of

affection, with yearnings, as it were, of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowels</i></font><font face="Palatino">:
<i>Secondly</i>, he makes mention of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kindness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
(for in this manner I have chosen to render
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">crhsto&gt;thta</font><font face="Palatino">,)
by which we make ourselves amiable. To this he adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>humility</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
because no one will be kind and gentle but the man who, laying aside
haughtiness, and high mindedness, brings himself down to the exercise of
modesty, claiming nothing for himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gentleness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
&#8212; </i>the term which follows &#8212; has a wider acceptation than
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kindness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
for <i>that</i> is chiefly in look and speech, while <i>this</i> is also in
inward disposition. As, however, it frequently happens, that we come in contact
with wicked and ungrateful men, there is need of patience, that it may cherish
mildness in us. He at length explains what he meant by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>long-suffering</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
&#8212; </i>that we embrace each other indulgently, and forgive also where any
offense has been given. As, however, it is a thing that is hard and difficult,
he confirms this doctrine by the example of Christ, and teaches, that the same
thing is required from us, that as we, who have so frequently and so grievously
offended, have nevertheless been received into favor, we should manifest the
same kindness towards our neighbors, by forgiving whatever offenses they have
committed against us. Hence he
says,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> if any one have a quarrel
against another.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this he means, that even
just occasions of <i>quarrel</i>, according to the views of men, ought not to be
followed out.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the chosen of God.

you to himself, has sanctified you, and received you into his love on this
condition, that ye be <i>merciful</i>, etc. To no purpose does the man that has
not these excellences boast that he is <i>holy</i>, and <i>beloved</i> of God;
to no purpose does he reckon himself among the number of
believers.&#8221;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of all these
things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The rendering that has been given by
others, &#8220;<i>super</i> omnia haec,&#8221; (<i>above</i> all these things,)
instead of <i>insuper</i>, (<i>over</i> <i>and</i> <i>above</i>,) is, in my
opinion, meagre. It would be more suitable to render it, <i>Before</i> all these
things. I have chosen, however, the more ordinary signification of the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpi&gt;</font><font face="Palatino">.
For as all the things that he has hitherto enumerated flow from <i>love</i>, he
now on good grounds exhorts the Colossians to cherish <i>love</i> among
themselves, for the sake of these things &#8212; that they may be merciful,
gentle, ready to forgive, as though he had said, that they would be such only in
the event of their having <i>love</i>. For where <i>love</i> is wanting, all
these things are sought for in vain. That he may commend it the more, he calls
it the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bond of
perfection</i></font><font face="Palatino">, meaning by this, that the troop of
all the virtues 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb180</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is
comprehended under it. For this truly is the rule of our whole life, and of all
our actions, so that everything that is not regulated according to it is faulty,
whatever attractiveness it may otherwise possess. This is the reason why it is
called here the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bond of
perfection</i></font><font face="Palatino">; because there is nothing in our
life that is well regulated if it be not directed towards it, but everything
that we attempt is mere waste.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Papists, however, act a ridiculous part in
abusing this declaration, with the view of maintaining justification by works.
&#8220;<i>Love</i>,&#8221; say they, &#8220;is the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bond of
perfection</i></font><font face="Palatino">: now perfection is righteousness;
therefore we are justified by <i>love</i>.&#8221; The answer is twofold; for
Paul here is not reasoning as to the manner in which men are made perfect in the
sight of God, but as to the manner in which they may live perfectly among
themselves. For the genuine exposition of the passage is this &#8212; that other
things will be in a desirable state as to our life, if <i>love</i> be exercised
among us. When, however, we grant that <i>love</i> is righteousness, they
groundlessly and childishly take occasion from this to maintain, that we are
justified by <i>love</i>, for where will perfect love be found? We, however, do
not say that men are justified by faith alone, on the ground that the observance
of the law is not righteousness, but rather on this ground, that as we are all
transgressors of the law, we are, in consequence of our being destitute of any
righteousness of our own, constrained to borrow righteousness from Christ. There
remains nothing, therefore, but the righteousness of faith, because perfect love
is nowhere to be found.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the peace of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He gives the name of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to that which God has established among us,
as will appear from what follows. He would have it <i>reign </i>in our hearts. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb181</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
employs, however, a very appropriate metaphor; for as among wrestlers, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb182</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he who
has vanquished all the others carries off the palm, so he would have the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> be superior to all carnal affections, which
often hurry us on to contentions, disagreements, quarrels, secret grudges. He
accordingly prohibits us from giving loose reins to corrupt affections of this
kind. As, however it is difficult to restrain them, he points out also the
remedy, that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace
of</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God</i></font><font face="Palatino">
may carry the victory, because it must be a bridle, by which carnal affections
may be restrained. Hence he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in our hearts;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">because we constantly feel <i>there</i> great
conflicts, while the <i>flesh</i> <i>lusteth</i> <i>against</i> <i>the</i>
<i>Spirit</i>.

<div><font face="Palatino">The clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to which ye are

this is &#8212; that unity which Christ has consecrated among us under his own
direction. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb183</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
God has <i>reconciled</i> <i>us</i> <i>to</i> <i>himself</i> in Christ, ( 2
Corinthians. 5:18,) with this view, that we may live in entire harmony among
ourselves. He adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in one
body</i></font><font face="Palatino">, meaning by this, that we cannot be in a
state of agreement with God otherwise than by being united among ourselves as
members of one body. When he bids us be <i>thankful</i>, I do not take this as
referring so much to the remembrance of favors, as to sweetness of manners.
Hence, with the view of removing ambiguity, I prefer to render it, &#8220;Be
amiable.&#8221; At the same time I acknowledge that, if gratitude takes
possession of our minds, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb184</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> we
shall without fail be inclined to cherish mutual affection among
ourselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let the word of Christ

be familiarly known by them. Hence we may infer by what spirit those are
actuated in the present day, who cruelly 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb185</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
interdict the Christian people from making use of it, and furiously vociferate,
that no pestilence is more to be dreaded, than that the reading of the
Scriptures should be thrown open to the common people. For, unquestionably, Paul
here addresses men and women of all ranks; nor would he simply have them take a
slight taste merely of the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word
of Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but exhorts that it should
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dwell in
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is, that it should have a settled
abode, and that <i>largely</i>, that they may make it their aim to advance and
increase more and more every day. As, however, the desire of learning is
extravagant on the part of many, while they pervert the word of the Lord for
their own ambition, or for vain curiosity, or in some way corrupt it, he on this
account adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in all
wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; </i>that, being instructed by
it, we may be wise as we ought to be.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, he gives a short definition of this wisdom
&#8212; that the Colossians </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>teach
one another</i></font><font face="Palatino">. <i>Teaching</i> is taken here to
mean profitable instruction, which tends to edification, as in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:7 &#8212; <i>He</i> <i>that</i> <i>teacheth</i>, <i>on</i> <i>teaching</i>;
also in Timothy &#8212; &#8220;All Scripture is profitable for
<i>teaching</i>.&#8221; (2 Timothy 3:16.) This is the true use of Christ&#8217;s
word. As, however, doctrine is sometimes in itself cold, and, as one says, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb186</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> when
it is simply shewn what is right, virtue is praised 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb187</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
left to starve, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb188</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
adds at the same time admonition, which is, as it were, a confirmation of
doctrine and incitement to it. Nor does he mean that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"> ought to be of benefit merely to
individuals, that they may teach themselves, but he requires mutual teaching and
admonition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Psalms,
hymns</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He does not restrict the <i>word</i>
<i>of</i> <i>Christ</i> to these particular departments, but rather intimates
that all our communications should be adapted to edification, that even those
which tend to hilarity may have no empty savor. &#8220;<i>Leave</i> to
unbelievers that foolish delight which they take from ludicrous and frivolous
jests and witticisms;

obscene, or at least barely modest and <i>decent</i>, songs, it <i>becomes</i>
you to make use of hymns and songs that sound forth God&#8217;s praise.&#8221;
Farther, under these three terms he includes all kinds of songs. They are
commonly distinguished in this way &#8212; that a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>psalm</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is that, in the singing of which some musical instrument besides the tongue is
made use of: a <i>hymn</i> is properly a song of praise, whether it be sung
simply with the voice or otherwise; while an <i>ode</i> contains not merely
praises, but exhortations and other matters. He would have the songs of
Christians, however, to be <i>spiritual</i>, not made up of frivolities and
worthless trifles. For this has a connection with his argument.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino">, Chrysostom explains in different ways.
I, however, take it simply, as also afterwards, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
4:6, where he says, &#8220;Let your speech be seasoned with salt, <i>in
grace</i>,&#8221; that is, by way of a dexterity that may be agreeable, and may
please the hearers by its profitableness, so that it may be opposed to
buffoonery and similar trifles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Singing in your
hearts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This relates to disposition; for as we
ought to stir up others, so we ought also to sing from the heart, that there may
not be merely an external sound with the mouth. At the same time, we must not
understand it as though he would have every one sing inwardly to himself, but he
would have both conjoined, provided the heart goes before the
tongue.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.
And whatsoever ye do.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We have already explained
these things, and what goes before, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, where the
same things are said almost word for word. As he had already begun to discourse
in reference to different parts of the Christian life, and had simply touched
upon a few precepts, it would have been too tedious a thing to follow out the
rest one by one, he therefore concludes in a summary way, that life must be
regulated in such a manner, that whatever we say or do may be wholly governed by
the authority of Christ, and may have an eye to his glory as the mark. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb190</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For we
shall fitly comprehend under this term the two following things &#8212; that all
our aims 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb191</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> may
set out with invocation of Christ, and may be subservient to his glory. From
invocation follows the act of blessing God, which supplies us with matter of
thanksgiving. It is also to be observed, that he teaches that we must give
thanks to the Father <i>through</i> <i>Christ</i>, as we obtain through him
every good thing that God confers upon us.</font><br></div>

such things as are more particularly suited to an exposition of the passage
before us. </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He commands

&#8220;Be subject in the Lord, as it is fit.&#8221; I, however, view it rather
differently, &#8212; <i>As</i> </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Children, obey your

to obey their parents,

without any exception. But what if parents 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb194</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> should
feel disposed to constrain them to anything that is unlawful; will they in that
case, too, obey without any reservation? Now it were worse than unreasonable,
that the, authority of men should prevail at the expense of neglecting God. I
answer, that here, too, we must understand as implied what he expresses
elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:1) &#8212; <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>Lord</i>. But for what purpose does he
employ a term of universality? I answer again, that it is to shew, that
obedience must be rendered not merely to just commands, but also to such as are
unreasonable. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb195</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
many make themselves compliant with the wishes of their parents only where the
command is not grievous or inconvenient. But, on the other hand, this one thing
ought to be considered by children &#8212; that whoever may be their parents,
they have been allotted to them by the providence of God, who by his appointment
makes children subject to their parents.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In all
things,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> therefore, that they may not refuse
anything, however difficult or disagreeable &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in all

give deference to the station which their parents occupy &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that they may not put themselves on a
footing of equality with their parents, in the way of questioning and debating,
or disputing, it being always understood that conscience is not to be infringed
upon.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb196</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He prohibits parents from exercising an immoderate harshness, lest their
children should be so disheartened as to be incapable of receiving any honorable
training; for we see, from daily experience, the advantage of a liberal
education.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Servants, be

respecting </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>servants</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">requires no exposition, as it has been already
expounded in commenting on Ephesians 6:l, with the exception of these two
expressions, &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we serve
the Lord Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">; and,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that will act unjustly will
receive the reward of his iniquity.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the <i>former</i> statement he means, that service
is done to men in such a way that Christ at the same time holds supremacy of
dominion, and is the supreme master. Here, truly, is choice consolation for all
that are under subjection, inasmuch as they are informed that, while they
willingly serve their masters, their services are acceptable to Christ, as
though they had been rendered to him. From this, also, Paul gathers, that they
will
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>receive</i></font><font face="Palatino">
from him </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
reward</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but it is the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reward of
inheritance</i></font><font face="Palatino">, by which he means that the very
thing that is bestowed in reward of works is freely given to us by God, for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inheritance</i></font><font face="Palatino">
comes from adoption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>second</i> clause he again comforts
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>servants,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
by saying that, if they are oppressed by the unjust cruelty of their masters,
God himself will take vengeance, and will not, on the ground that they are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>servants,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
overlook the injuries inflicted upon them, inasmuch as there is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no respect of persons with
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For this consideration might diminish
their courage, if they imagined that God had no regard for them, or no great
regard, and that their miseries gave him no concern. Besides, it often happens
that servants themselves endeavor to avenge injurious and cruel treatment. He
obviates, accordingly, this evil, by admonishing them to wait patiently the
judgment of God.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what is

as to which he has given injunction in the Epistle to the Ephesians.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:8.) But as masters, looking down as it were from aloft, despise the condition
of servants, so that they think that they are bound by no law, Paul brings them
under control, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb197</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because both are equally under subjection to the authority of God. Hence that
<i>equity</i> of which he makes mention.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And mutual

have no doubt that Paul here employed
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ijso&gt;thta</font><font face="Palatino">
to mean analogical 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb198</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb200</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.

which we must not expect an exact order, for in that case he would have begun
with prayer, but Paul had not an eye to that. Farther, as to prayer, he commends
here two things; <i>first</i>, assiduity; <i>secondly</i>, alacrity, or earnest
intentness. For, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>continue</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he exhorts to perseverance, while he makes mention of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>watching</i></font><font face="Palatino">
in opposition to coldness, and listlessness. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb202</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thanksgiving</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
because God must be solicited for present necessity in such a way that, in the
mean time, we do not forget favors already received. Farther, we ought not to be
so importunate as to murmur, and feel offended if God does not immediately
gratify our wishes, but must receive contentedly whatever he gives. Thus a
twofold </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>giving of
thanks</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is necessary. As to this point something
has also been said in the Epistle to the Philippians.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pray also for
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He does not say this by way of pretense,
but because, being conscious to himself of his own necessity, he was earnestly
desirous to be aided by their prayers, and was fully persuaded that they would
be of advantage to them. Who then, in the present day, would dare to despise the
intercessions of brethren, which Paul openly declares himself to stand in need
of? And, unquestionably, it is not in vain that the Lord has appointed this
exercise of love between us &#8212; that we pray for each other. Not only,
therefore, ought each of us to pray for his brethren, but we ought also, on our
part, diligently to seek help from the prayers of others, as often as occasion
requires. It is, however, a childish 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb203</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
argument on the part of Papists, who infer from this, that the dead must be
implored 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb204</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to
pray for us. For what is there here that bears any resemblance to this? Paul
commends himself to the prayers of the brethren, with whom he knows that he has
mutual fellowship according to the commandment of God: who will deny that this
reason does not hold in the case of the dead? Leaving, therefore, such trifles,
let us return to Paul.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As we have a signal example of modesty, in the
circumstance that Paul calls others to his assistance, so we are also
admonished, that it is a thing that is replete with the greatest difficulty, to
persevere steadfastly in the defense of the gospel, and especially when danger
presses. For it is not without cause that he desires that the Churches may
assist him in this matter. Consider, too, at the same time, his amazing ardor of
zeal. He is not solicitous as to his own safety; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb205</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
does not ask that prayers may be poured forth by the Churches on his behalf,
that he may be delivered from danger of death. He is contented with this one
thing, that he may, unconquered and undaunted, persevere in a confession of the
gospel; nay more, he fearlessly makes his own life a secondary matter, as
compared with the glory of Christ and the spread of the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>door of
utterance</i></font><font face="Palatino">, however, he simply means what, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490619&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:19, he terms the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>opening of the
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and what Christ calls a <i>mouth</i>
<i>and</i> <i>wisdom</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
21:15.) For the expression differs nothing from the other in meaning, but merely
in form, for he here intimates, by all elegant metaphor, that it is in no degree
easier for us to speak confidently respecting the gospel, than to break through
a door that is barred and bolted. For this is truly a divine work, as Christ
himself said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">It is not ye that speak,
but the Spirit</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">of your Father that
speaketh in you. (Matt 10:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having, therefore, set forward the difficulty, he
stirs up the Colossians the more to prayer, by declaring that he cannot speak
right, except in so far as his tongue is directed by the Lord. <i>Secondly</i>,
he argues from the dignity 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb206</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of the
matter, when he calls the gospel the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mystery of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For we must labor in a more perfunctory
manner in a matter of such importance. <i>Thirdly</i>, he makes mention also of
his danger.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As I
ought</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This clause sets forth more strongly the
difficulty, for he intimates that it is no ordinary matter. In the Epistle to
the Ephesians,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490620&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:20,) he adds, </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">i[na
parjrJhsia&gt;swmai</font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>that</i> <i>I</i>
<i>may</i> <i>speak</i> <i>boldly</i>,) from which it appears that he desired
for himself an undaunted confidence, such as befits the majesty of the gospel.
Farther, as Paul here does nothing else than desire that grace may be given him
for the discharge of his office, let us bear in mind that a rule is in like
manner prescribed to us, not to give way to the fury of our adversaries, but to
strive even to death in the publication of the gospel. As this, however, is
beyond our power, it is necessary that we should

<div><font face="Palatino">for nothing is more ready to occur, than that
unbelievers are driven from bad to worse through our imprudence, and their minds
are wounded, so that they hold religion more and more in abhorrence.
<i>Secondly</i>, it is lest any occasion may be given for detracting from the
honor of the gospel, and thus the name of Christ be exposed to derision, persons
be rendered more hostile, and disturbances and persecutions be stirred up.
<i>Lastly</i>, it is, lest, while we are mingled together, in partaking of food,
and on other occasions, we be defiled by their pollutions, and by little and
little become profane.</font><br></div>

in this they pay the just punishment of their silly talkativeness. Nor does he

although he was in prison, and was in danger of his life, making care for
himself a secondary matter, he consults for their interests by sending Tychicus
to them. In this the singular zeal, no less than prudence of the holy Apostle,
shines forth; for it is no small matter that, while he is held prisoner, and is
in the most imminent danger on account of the gospel, he, nevertheless, does not
cease to employ himself in advancing the gospel, and takes care of all the
Churches. Thus, the body, indeed, is under confinement, but the mind, anxious to
employ itself in everything good, roams far and wide. His prudence shews itself
in his sending a fit and prudent person to confirm them, as far as was
necessary, and withstand the craftiness of the false apostles; and, farther, in
his retaining Epaphras beside himself, until they should come to learn what and
how great an agreement there was in doctrine among all true teachers, and might
hear from Tychicus the same thing that they had previously learned from
Epaphras. Let us carefully meditate on these examples, that they may stir us up

From this it appears that there were others that were associated with Paul, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb212</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> after
he was brought to Rome. It is also probable that his enemies exerted themselves,
in the outset, to deter all pious persons from giving him help, by threatening
them with the like danger, and that this for a time had the desired effect; but
that afterwards some, gathering up courage, despised everything that was held
out to them in the way of terror.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye receive

which the Colossians had received &#8212; that it was a commendation of either
Barnabas, or of Marcus. The latter is the more probable. In the Greek it is the
infinitive mood, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb213</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but it
may be rendered in the way I have done. Let us, however, observe, that they were
careful in furnishing attestations, that they might distinguish good men from
false brethren &#8212; from pretenders, from impostors, and multitudes of
vagrants. The same care is more than simply necessary at the present day, both
because good teachers are coldly received, and because credulous and foolish men
lay themselves too open to be deceived by impostors.</font><br></div>

fellow-workers,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; that is, of the
circumcision; for he afterwards names others, but they were of the
uncircumcision. He means, therefore, that there were few Jews at Rome who shewed
themselves to be helpers to the gospel, nay more, that the whole nation was
opposed to Christ. At the same time, by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>workers</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">he means those only who were endowed with gifts
that were necessary for promoting the gospel. But where was Peter at that time?
Unquestionably, he has either been shamefully passed over here, and not without
injustice, or else those speak falsely who maintain that he was then at Rome.
Farther, he calls the gospel the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kingdom of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for it is the scepter by which God reigns
over us, and by means of it we are singled out to life eternal.

prevent him from taking the care of it with him beyond the sea. We must notice,
also, the strength of entreaty that is expressed in the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>striving</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
For although the Apostle had it in view here to express intensity of affection,
he at the same time admonishes the Colossians not to look upon the prayers of
their pastor as useless, but, on the contrary, to reckon that they would afford
them no small assistance. Lastly, let us infer from Paul&#8217;s words, that the

Hence, though it was addressed to the Colossians, it was, nevertheless,
necessary that it should be profitable to others. The same view must also be
taken of all the Epistles. They were indeed, in the first instance, addressed to
particular Churches, but, as they contain doctrine that is always in force, and
is common to all ages, it is of no importance what title they bear, for the
subject matter belongs to us. It has been groundlessly supposed that the other
Epistle of which he makes mention was written by Paul, and those labor under a
double mistake who think that it was written by Paul to the Laodiceans. I have
no doubt that it was an Epistle that had been sent to Paul, the perusal of which
might be profitable to the Colossians, as neighboring towns have usually many
things in common. There was, however, an exceedingly gross imposture in the
circumstance that some worthless person, I know not who, had the audacity to
forge, under this pretext, an Epistle, that is so insipid, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb216</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
nothing can be conceived to be more foreign to Paul&#8217;s
spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.

Archippus.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> So far as I can conjecture, this
Archippus was, in the mean time, discharging the office of pastor, during the
absence of Epaphras; but perhaps he was not of such a disposition as to be
sufficiently diligent of himself without being stirred up. Paul, accordingly,
would have him be more fully encouraged by the exhortation of the whole Church.
He might have admonished him in his own name individually; but he gives this
charge to the Colossians that they may know that they must themselves employ
incitements, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb217</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> if
they see their pastor cold, and the pastor himself does not refuse to be
admonished by the Church. For the ministers of the word are endowed with signal
authority, but such at the same time as is not exempt from laws. Hence, it is
necessary that they should shew themselves teachable if they would duly teach
others. As to Paul&#8217;s calling attention again 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb218</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bonds</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he intimates by this that he was in no slight degree afflicted. For he was
mindful of human infirmity, and without doubt he felt some twinges of it in
himself, inasmuch as he was so very urgent that all pious persons, should be
mindful of his distresses. It is, however, no evidence of distrust, that he
calls in from all quarters the helps that were appointed him by the Lord. The
subscription, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with his own

study, I made proficiency at least so far as to be prepared to profit in some
degree the Church of God. When my father sent me, while yet a boy, to Paris,
after I had simply tasted the first elements of the Latin tongue; Providence so
ordered it that I had, for a short time, the privilege of having you as my
instructor, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that I
might be taught by you the true method of learning, in such a way that I might
be prepared afterwards to make somewhat better proficiency. For, after presiding
over the first class with the highest renown, on observing that pupils who had
been ambitiously trained up by the other masters, produced nothing but mere
show, nothing of solidity, so that they required to be formed by you anew, tired
of this annoyance, you that year descended to the fourth class. This, indeed,
was what you had in view, but to me it was a singular kindness on the part of
God that I happened to have an auspicious commencement of such a course of
training. And although I was permitted to have the use of it only for a short
time, from the circumstance that we were soon afterwards advanced higher by an
injudicious man, who regulated our studies according to his own pleasure, or
rather his caprice, yet I derived so much assistance afterwards from your
training, that it is with good reason that I acknowledge myself indebted to you
for such progress as has since been made. And this I was desirous to testify to
posterity, that, if any advantage shall accrue to them from my writings, they
shall know that it has in some degree originated with you.</font><br></div>

EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE greater part of this Epistle consists of
exhortations. PAUL had instructed the THESSALONIANS in the right faith. On
hearing, however, that persecutions were raging there, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he had
sent Timothy with the view of animating them for the conflict, that they might
not give way through fear, as human infirmity is apt to do. Having been
afterwards informed by TIMOTHY respecting their entire condition, he employs
various arguments to confirm them in steadfastness of faith, as well as in
patience, should they be called to endure anything for the testimony of the
gospel. These things he treats of in the <i>first three</i>
Chapters.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the beginning of the <i>Fourth</i> Chapter, he
exhorts them, in general terms, to holiness of life, afterwards he recommends
mutual benevolence, and all offices that flow from it. Towards the end, however,
he touches upon the question of the resurrection, and explains in what way we
shall all be raised up from death. From this it is manifest, that there were
some wicked or light&#8212;minded persons, who endeavored to unsettle their
faith by unseasonably bringing forward many frivolous things. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence
with the view of cutting off all pretext for foolish and needless disputations,
he instructs them in few words as to the views which they should
entertain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>Fifth</i> Chapter he prohibits them, even
more strictly, from inquiring as to <i>times</i>; but admonishes them to be ever
on the watch, lest they should be taken unawares by Christ&#8217;s sudden and
unexpected approach. From this he proceeds to employ various exhortations, and
then concludes the Epistle.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THE brevity of the inscription clearly shews that
PAUL&#8217;S doctrine had been received with reverence among the THESSALONIANS,
and that without controversy they all rendered to him the honor that he
deserved. For when in other Epistles he designates himself an Apostle, he does
this for the purpose of claiming for himself authority. Hence the circumstance,
that he simply makes use of his own name without any title of honor, is an
evidence that those to whom he writes voluntarily acknowledged him to be such as
he was. The ministers of Satan, it is true, had endeavored to trouble this
Church also, but it is evident that their machinations were fruitless. He
associates, however, two others along with himself, as being, in common with
himself, the authors of the Epistle. Nothing farther is stated here that has not
been explained elsewhere, excepting that he says, &#8220;the Church
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in God the Father, and in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">;&#8221; by which terms (if I mistake
not) he intimates, that there is truly among the Thessalonians a Church of God.
This mark, therefore, is as it were an approval of a true and lawful Church. We
may, however, at the same time infer from it, that a Church is to be sought for
only where God presides, and where Christ reigns, and that, in short, there is
no Church but what is founded upon God, is gathered under the auspices of
Christ, and is united in his name.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We give thanks to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He praises, as he is wont, their faith and
other virtues, not so much, however, for the purpose of praising them, as to
exhort them to perseverance. For it is no small excitement to eagerness of
pursuit, when we reflect that God has adorned us with signal endowments, that he
may finish what he has begun, and that we have, under his guidance and
direction, advanced in the right course, in order that we may reach the goal.
For as a vain confidence in those virtues, which mankind foolishly arrogate to
themselves, puffs them up with pride, and makes them careless and indolent for
the time to come, so a recognition of the gifts of God humbles pious minds, and
stirs them up to anxious concern. Hence, instead of congratulations, he makes
use of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thanksgivings</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
that he may put them in mind, that everything in them that he declares to be
worthy of praise, is a kindness from God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He also
turns immediately to the future, in making mention of his <i>prayers</i>. We
thus see for what purpose he commends their previous life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unceasingly remembering
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. While the adverb <i>unceasingly</i> might
be taken in connection with what goes before, it suits better to connect it in
this manner. What follows might also be rendered in this way:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remembering your work of faith
and labor of love</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. Nor is it any objection
to this that there is an article interposed between the pronoun
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJmw~n</font><font face="Palatino">
and the noun
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e]rgou</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for this
manner of expression is frequently made use of by Paul. I state this, lest any
one should charge the old translator with ignorance, from his rendering it in
this manner. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As,
however, it matters little as to the main point 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which
you may choose, I have retained the rendering of Erasmus. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc11</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He assigns a reason, however, why he cherishes so
strong an affection towards them, and prays diligently in their
behalf&#8212;because he perceived in them those gifts of God which should stir
him up to cherish towards them love and respect. And, unquestionably, the more
that any one excels in piety and other excellences, so much the more ought we to
hold him in regard and esteem. For what is more worthy of love than God? Hence
there is nothing that should tend more to excite our love to individuals, than
when the Lord manifests himself in them by the gifts of his Spirit. This is the
highest commendation of all among the pious&#8212;this the most sacred bond of
connection, by which they are more especially bound to each other. I have said,
accordingly, that it is of little importance, whether you render it <i>mindful
of your faith</i>, or <i>mindful of you on account of your
faith</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Work of faith
</i></font><font face="Palatino">I understand as meaning the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>effect</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of it. This effect, however, may be explained in two ways&#8212;<i>passively</i>
or <i>actively</i>, either as meaning that faith was in itself a signal token of
the power and efficacy of the Holy Spirit, inasmuch as he has wrought powerfully
in the exciting of it, or as meaning that it afterwards produced outwardly its
fruits. I reckon the effect to be in the root of faith rather than in its
fruits&#8212;&#8221;A rare energy of faith has strewn itself powerfully in
you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>labor of
love</i></font><font face="Palatino">, by which he means that in the cultivation
of love they had grudged no trouble or labor. And, assuredly, it is known by
experience, how laborious love is. That age, however, more especially afforded
to believers a manifold sphere of labor, if they were desirous to discharge the
offices of love. The Church was marvelously pressed down by a great multitude of
afflictions: 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> many
were striped of their wealth, many were fugitives from their country, many were
thrown destitute of counsel, many were tender and weak. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
condition of almost all was involved. So many cases of distress did not allow
<i>love</i> to be inactive.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hope</i></font><font face="Palatino">
he assigns
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>patience</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
as it is always conjoined with it, for <i>what we hope for, we in patience wait
for</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450824&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:24) and the statement should be explained to mean, that Paul remembers their
patience in hoping for the coming of Christ. From this we may gather a brief
definition of true Christianity&#8212;that it is a faith that is lively and full
of vigor, so that it spares no labor, when assistance is to be given to
one&#8217;s neighbors, but, on the contrary, all the pious employ themselves
diligently in offices of love, and lay out their efforts in them, so that,
intent upon the hope of the manifestation of Christ, they despise everything
else, and, armed with patience, they rise superior to the wearisomeness of
length of time, as well as to all the temptations of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before our God and
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino">, may be viewed as referring to
Paul&#8217;s remembrance, or to the three things spoken immediately before. I
explain it in this way. As he had spoken of his <i>prayers</i>, he declares that
as often as he raises his thoughts to the kingdom of God, he, at the same time,
recalls to his remembrance the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith,
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>patience</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
of the Thessalonians, but as all mere presence must vanish when persons come
into the presence of God, this is added, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in
order that the affirmation may have more weight. Farther, by this declaration of
his good&#8212;will towards them he designed to make them more teachable and
prepared to listen. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc15</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Knowing, brethren
beloved</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The participle <i>knowing</i> may
apply to Paul as well as to the Thessalonians. Erasmus refers it to the
Thessalonians. I prefer to follow Chrysostom, who understands it of Paul and his
colleagues, for it is (as it appears to me) a more ample confirmation of the
foregoing statement. For it tended in no small degree to recommend
them&#8212;that God himself had testified by many tokens, that they were
acceptable and dear to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Election of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I am not altogether dissatisfied with the
interpretation given by Chrysostom&#8212;that God had made the Thessalonians
illustrious, and had established their excellence. Paul, however, had it in view
to express something farther; for he touches upon their calling, and as there
had appeared in it no common marks of God&#8217;s power, he infers from this
that they had been specially called with evidences of a sure <i>election</i>.
For the reason is immediately added&#8212;that it was not a bare preaching that
had been brought to them, but such as was conjoined with the efficacy of the
Holy Spirit, that it might obtain entire credit among them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in power, and in the Holy
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">, it is, in my opinion, as if he had
said&#8212;in the power <i>of</i> the Holy Spirit, so that the latter term is
added as explanatory of the former. <i>Assurance</i>, to which he assigned the
third place, was either in the thing itself, or in the disposition of the
Thessalonians. I am rather inclined to think that the meaning is, that
Paul&#8217;s gospel had been confirmed by solid proofs, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
though God had strewn from heaven that he had ratified their calling. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When,
however, Paul brings forward the proofs by which he had felt assured that the
calling of the Thessalonians was altogether from God, he takes occasion at the
same time to recommend his ministry, that they may themselves, also, recognize
him and his colleagues as having been raised up by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the term <i>power</i> some understand miracles. I
extend it farther, as referring to spiritual energy of doctrine. For, as we had
occasion to see in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul places it in
contrast with <i>speech</i>  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc18</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8212;the
voice of God, as it were, living and conjoined with effect, as opposed to an
empty and dead eloquence of men. It is to be observed, however, that the
election of God, which is in itself hid, is manifested by its marks&#8212;when
he gathers to himself the lost sheep and joins them to his flock, and holds out
his hand to those that were wandering and estranged from him. Hence a knowledge
of our election must be sought from this source. As, however, the secret counsel
of God is a labyrinth to those who disregard his calling, so those act
perversely who, under pretext of <i>faith</i> and <i>calling</i>, darken this
first grace, from which faith itself flows. &#8220;By faith,&#8221; say they,
&#8220;we obtain salvation: there is, therefore, no eternal predestination of
God that distinguishes between us and reprobates.&#8221; It is as though they
said&#8212;&#8221;Salvation is of faith: there is, therefore, no grace of God
that illuminates us in faith.&#8221; Nay rather, as gratuitous election must be
conjoined with calling, as with its effect, so it must necessarily, in the mean
time, hold the first place. It matters little as to the sense, whether you
connect
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpo&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">
with the participle <i>beloved</i> or with the term <i>election</i>. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc19</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As ye
know</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Paul, as I have said before, has it as
his aim, that the Thessalonians, influenced by the same considerations, may
entertain no doubt that they were elected by God. For it had been the design of
God, in honoring Paul&#8217;s ministry, that he might manifest to them their
adoption. Accordingly, having said that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know what manner of persons they
had been</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc20</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
immediately adds that he was such</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
for their sake</i></font><font face="Palatino">, by which he means that all this
had been given them, in order that they might be fully persuaded that they were
loved by God, and that their election was beyond all
controversy.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye became

alacrity, he declares that there is a mutual agreement, and harmony, as it were,
between his preaching and their faith. For unless men, on their part, answer to
God, no proficiency will follow from the grace that is offered to them&#8212;not
as though they could do this of themselves, but inasmuch as God, as he begins
our salvation by calling us, perfects it also by fashioning our hearts to
obedience. The sum, therefore, is this&#8212;that an evidence of Divine election
shewed itself not only in Paul&#8217;s ministry, in so far as it was furnished
with the power of the Holy Spirit, but also in the faith of the Thessalonians,
so that this conformity is a powerful attestation of it. He says, however,

gospel, serves by way of amplification. For we see very many, not otherwise
disinclined to the gospel, who, nevertheless, avoid it, from being intimidated
through fear of the cross. Those, accordingly, who do not hesitate with
intrepidity to embrace along with the gospel the afflictions that threaten them,
furnish in this an admirable example of magnanimity. And from this it is so much
the more clearly apparent, how necessary it is that the Spirit should aid us in
this. For the gospel cannot be properly, or sincerely received, unless it be
with a joyful heart. Nothing, however, is more at variance with our natural
disposition, than to rejoice in afflictions.</font><br></div>

other believers had borrowed from them a rule of constancy. I preferred,
however, to render it <i>patterns</i>, that I might not needlessly make any
change upon the Greek phrase made use of by Paul; and farther, because the
plural number expresses, in my opinion, something more than if he had said that
that Church as a body had been set forward for imitation, for the meaning is,
that there were as many <i>patterns</i> as there were

<div><font face="Palatino">He says that the report of their conversion had
obtained great renown everywhere. What he mentions as to his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>entering in among
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">, refers to that power of the Spirit, by
which God had signalized his gospel. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
says, however, that both things are freely reported among other nations, as
things worthy of being made mention of. In the detail which follows, he shews,
first, what the condition of mankind is, before the Lord enlightens them by the
doctrine of his gospel; and farther, for what end he would have us instructed,
and what is the fruit of the gospel. For although all do not worship idols, all
are nevertheless addicted to idolatry, and are immersed in blindness and
madness. Hence, it is owing to the kindness of God, that we are exempted from
the impostures of the devil, and every kind of superstition. Some, indeed, he
converts earlier, others later, but as alienation is common to all, it is
necessary that we be converted to God, before we can serve God. From this, also,
we gather the essence and nature of true faith, inasmuch as no one gives due
credit to God but the man, who renouncing the vanity of his own understanding,
embraces and receives the pure worship of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the living
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is the end of genuine conversion. We
see, indeed, that many leave off superstitions, who, nevertheless, after taking
this step, are so far from making progress in piety, that they fall into what is
worse. For having thrown off all regard to God, they give themselves up to a
profane and brutal contempt. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc26</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Thus,
in ancient times, the superstitions of the vulgar were derided by Epicurus,
Diogenes the Cynic, and the like, but in such a way that they mixed up the
worship of God so as to make no difference between it and absurd trifles. Hence
we must take care, lest the pulling down of errors be followed by the overthrow
of the building of faith. Farther, the Apostle, in ascribing to God the epithets
<i>true and living</i>, indirectly censures idols as being dead and worthless
inventions, and as being falsely called gods. He makes the end of conversion to
be what I have noticed&#8212;that they might <i>serve God</i>. Hence the
doctrine of the gospel tends to this, that it may induce us to serve and obey
God. For so long as we are the <i>servants of sin</i>, we are <i>free from
righteousness</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450620&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:20) inasmuch as we sport ourselves, and wander up and down, exempt from any
yoke. No one, therefore, is properly converted to God, but the man who has
learned to place himself wholly under subjection to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, it is a thing that is more than simply
difficult, in so great a corruption of our nature, he shews at the same time,
what it is that retains and confirms us in the fear of God and obedience to
him&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>waiting for
Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For unless we are stirred up to the
hope of eternal life, the world will quickly draw us to itself. For as it is
only confidence in the Divine goodness that induces us to serve God, so it is
only the expectation of final redemption that keeps us from giving way. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let
every one, therefore, that would persevere in a course of holy life, apply his
whole mind to a expectation of Christ&#8217;s coming. It is also worthy of
notice, that he uses the expression
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>waiting for
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, instead of the hope of everlasting
salvation. For, unquestionably, without Christ we are ruined and thrown into
despair, but when Christ shews himself, life and prosperity do at the same time
shine forth upon us. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc28</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us
bear in mind, however, that this is said to believers exclusively, for as for
the wicked, as he will come to be their Judge, so they can do nothing but
tremble in looking for him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is what he afterwards subjoins&#8212;that Christ
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>delivereth us from the wrath to
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For this is felt by none but those who,
being reconciled to God by faith, have conscience already pacified; otherwise, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc29</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> his
name is dreadful. Christ, it is true, delivered us by his death from the anger
of God, but the import of that deliverance will become apparent on the last day.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
statement, however, consists of two departments. The <i>first</i> is, that the
wrath of God and everlasting destruction are impending over the human race,
inasmuch as <i>all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:23) The <i>second</i> is, that there is no way of escape but through the grace
of Christ; for it is not without good grounds that Paul assigns to him this
office. It is, however, an inestimable gift, that the pious, whenever mention is
made of judgment, know that Christ will come as a Redeemer to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In addition to this, he says emphatically,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wrath to
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that he may rouse up pious minds, lest
they should fail from looking at the present life. For as faith is a <i>looking
at things that do not appear</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:1) nothing is less befitting than that we should estimate the wrath of God,
according as any one is afflicted in the world; as nothing is more absurd than
to take hold of the transient blessings which we enjoy, that we may from them
form an estimate of God&#8217;s favor. While, therefore, on the one hand, the
wicked sport themselves at their ease, and we, on the other hand, languish in
misery, let us learn to fear the vengeance of God, which is hid from the eyes of
flesh, and take our satisfaction in the secret delights of the spiritual life. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc31</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom he raised
up</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He makes mention here of Christ&#8217;s
resurrection, on which the hope of our resurrection is founded, for death
everywhere besets us. Hence, unless we learn to look to Christ, our minds will
give way at every turn. By the same consideration, he admonishes them that
Christ is to be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>waited for from
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because we will find nothing in the
world to bear us up, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> while
there are innumerable trials to overwhelm us. Another circumstance must be
noticed; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for as
Christ rose for this end&#8212;that he might make us all at length, as being his
members, partakers of the same glory with himself, Paul intimates that his
resurrection would be vain, unless he again appeared as their Redeemer, and
extended to the whole body of the Church the fruit and effect of that power
which he manifested in himself.

<div><font face="Palatino">He now, leaving out of view the testimony of other
Churches, reminds the Thessalonians of what they had themselves experienced, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
explains at large in what way he, and in like manner the two others, his
associates, had conducted themselves among them, inasmuch as this was of the
greatest importance for confirming their faith. For it is with this view that he
declares his integrity&#8212;that the Thessalonians may perceive that they had
been called to the faith, not so much by a mortal man, as by God himself. He
says, therefore, that his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>entering in unto them had not
been vain</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as ambitious persons manifest much
show, while they have nothing of solidity; for he employs the word <i>vain</i>
here as contrasted with <i>efficacious</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He proves this by <i>two</i> arguments. The
<i>first</i> is, that he had suffered persecution and ignominy at Philippi; the
<i>second</i> is, that there was a great conflict prepared at Thessalonica. We
know that the minds of men are weakened, nay, are altogether broken down by
means of ignominy and persecutions. It was therefore an evidence of a Divine
work that Paul, after having been subjected to evils of various kinds and to
ignominy, did, as if in a perfectly sound state, shew no hesitation in making an
attempt upon a large and opulent city, with the view of subjecting the
inhabitants of it to Christ. In this <i>entering in</i>, nothing is seen that
savors of vain ostentation. In the <i>second</i> department the same Divine
power is beheld, for he does not discharge his duty with applause and favor, but
required to maintain a keen conflict. In the mean time he stood firm and
undaunted, from which it appears that he was held up 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by the
hand of God; for this is what he means when he says that he was
<i>emboldened</i>. And, unquestionably, if all these circumstances are carefully
considered, it cannot be denied that God there magnificently displayed his
power. As to the history, it is to be found in the sixteenth and seventeenth
chapters of the Acts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For our
exhortation</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He confirms, by another argument,
the Thessalonians in the faith which they had embraced&#8212;inasmuch as they
had been faithfully and purely instructed in the word of the Lord, for he
maintains that his doctrine was free from all deception and uncleanness. And
with the view of placing this matter beyond all doubt, he calls their conscience
to witness. The three terms which he makes use of may, it would seem, be
distinguished in this manner: <i>imposture</i> may refer to the substance of
doctrine, <i>uncleanness</i> to the affections of the heart, <i>guile</i> to the
manner of acting. In the <i>first</i> place, therefore, he says that they had
not been deluded or imposed upon by fallacies, when they embraced the kind of
doctrine that had been delivered to them by him. <i>Secondly</i>, he declares
his integrity, inasmuch as he had not come to them under the influence of any
impure desire, but actuated solely by upright disposition. <i>Thirdly</i>, he
says that he had done nothing fraudulently or maliciously, but had, on the
contrary, manifested a simplicity befitting a minister of Christ. As these
things were well known to the Thessalonians, they had a sufficiently firm
foundation for their faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As we have been
approved</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He goes even a step higher, for he
appeals to God as the Author of his apostleship, and he reasons in this manner:
&#8220;God, when he assigned me this office, bore witness to me as a faithful
servant; there is no reason, therefore, why men should have doubts as to my
fidelity, which they know to have been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>approved of by
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Paul, however, does not glory in having
been </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>approved
of</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as though he were such of himself; for he
does not dispute here as to what he had by nature, nor does he place his own
power in collision with the grace of God, but simply says that the Gospel had
been committed to him as a faithful and <i>approved</i> servant. Now, God
approves of those whom he has formed for himself according to his own
pleasure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not as pleasing
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What is meant by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pleasing men
</i></font><font face="Palatino">has been explained in the Epistle to the
Galatians,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
1:10) and this passage, also, shews it admirably. For Paul contrasts
<i>pleasing</i> MEN, and <i>pleasing</i> GOD, as things that are opposed to each
other. Farther, when he
says&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God, who trieth our
hearts</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he intimates, that those who endeavor
to obtain the favor of men, are not influenced by an upright conscience, and do
nothing from the heart. Let us know, therefore, that true ministers of the
gospel ought to make it their aim to devote to God their endeavors, and to do it
from the heart, not from any outward regard to the world, but because conscience
tells them that it is right and proper. Thus it will be secured that they will
not make it their aim to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>please
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, that they will not act under the
influence of ambition, with a view to the favor of men.</font><br></div>

repeats it so frequently, that the Thessalonians knew that what he states is
true. For there is not a surer attestation, than the experience of those with

relates with what integrity he had conducted himself, with no other intention,
than that his doctrine may have the greater respect, for the building up of
their faith. It is, however, a confirmation of the foregoing. statement, for he

avarice and ambition frequently lie concealed, he on this account calls God to
witness. Now, he makes mention here of two vices, from which he declares himself
to be exempt, and, in doing so, teaches that the servants of Christ should stand
aloof from them. Thus, if we would distinguish the genuine servants of Christ
from those that are pretended and spurious, they must be tried according to this
rule, and every one that would serve Christ aright must also conform his aims
and his actions to the same rule. For where avarice and ambition reign,

should be taken to mean <i>authority</i>. For Paul says that he was so far
removed from vain pomp, from boasting, from arrogance, that he even waived his
just claim, so far as the maintenance of authority was concerned. For inasmuch
as he was an Apostle of Christ, he deserved to be received with a higher degree
of respect, but he had refrained from all show of dignity, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc38</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
though he had been some minister of the common rank. From this it appears how
far removed he was from haughtiness.

reading which I have followed is more generally received among the Greeks; but

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As if a

points that he had touched upon&#8212;that he had sought neither glory nor gain
among the Thessalonians. For a mother in nursing her infant shews nothing of
power or dignity. Paul says that he was such, inasmuch as he voluntarily
refrained from claiming the honor that was due to him, and with calmness and
modesty stooped to every kind of office. <i>Secondly</i>, a mother in nursing
her children manifests a certain rare and wonderful affection, inasmuch as she
spares no labor and trouble, shuns no anxiety, is wearied out by no assiduity,
and even with cheerfulness of spirit gives her own blood to be sucked. In the
same way, Paul declares that he was so disposed towards the Thessalonians, that
he was prepared to lay out his life for their benefit. This, assuredly, was not
the conduct of a man that was sordid or avaricious, but of one that exercised a
disinterested affection, and he expresses this in the
close&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because ye were dear
unto us</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> In the mean time, we must bear in
mind, that all that would be ranked among true pastors must exercise this
disposition of Paul&#8212;to have more regard to the welfare of the Church than
to their own life, and not be impelled to duty by a regard to their own
advantage, but by a sincere love to those to whom they know that they are
conjoined, and laid under obligation.

had stated previously&#8212;that to spare them he did not spare himself. He must
assuredly have burned with a wonderful and more than human zeal, inasmuch as,
along with the labor of teaching, he labors with his hand as an operative, with
the view of earning a livelihood, and in this respect, also, refrained from
exercising his right. For it is the law of Christ, as he also teaches elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460914&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 9:14) that every church furnish its ministers with food and other
necessaries. Paul, therefore, in laying no burden upon the Thessalonians, does
something more than could, from the requirements of his office, have been
required from him. In addition to this, he does not merely refrain from
incurring public expense, but avoids burdening any one individually. Farther,
there can be no doubt, that he was influenced by some good and special
consideration in thus refraining from exercising his right, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for in
other churches he exercised, equally with others, the liberty allowed him. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
received nothing from the Corinthians, lest he should give the false apostles a
handle for glorying as to this matter. In the mean time, he did not hesitate to
ask  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc45</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from other churches, what was needed by him, for he writes that, while he
bestowed labor upon the Corinthians, free of charge, he <i>robbed</i> the
Churches that he did not serve.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 11:8) 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc46</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence,
although the reason is not expressed here, we may, nevertheless, conjecture that
the ground on which Paul was unwilling that his necessities should be ministered
to, was&#8212;lest such a thing should put any hindrance in the way of the
gospel. For this, also, ought to be matter of concern to good pastors&#8212;that
they may not merely run with alacrity in their ministry, but may, so far as is
in their power, remove all hindrances in the way of their
course.</font><br></div>

witness, with the view of affirming his integrity, and cites, on the one hand,
God as a witness of his conscience, and them, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc47</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> on the
other hand, as witnesses of what they had known by experience.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
justly</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, with how sincere a fear of
God, and with what fidelity and blamelessness towards men; and thirdly,
<i>unreproachably</i>, by which he means that he had given no occasion of
complaint or obloquy. For the servants of Christ cannot avoid calumnies, and
unfavorable reports; for being hated by the world, they must of necessity be
evil&#8212;spoken of among the wicked. Hence he restricts this to
<i>believers</i>, who judge uprightly and sincerely, and do not revile
malignantly and groundlessly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one as a

things which belong to his office. He has compared himself to a <i>nurse :</i>
he now compares himself to a <i>father</i>. What he means is this&#8212;that he
was concerned in regard to them, just as a <i>father</i> is wont to be as to his
sons, and that he had exercised a truly paternal care in instructing and
admonishing them. And, unquestionably, no one will ever be a good pastor, unless
he shews himself to be a <i>father</i> to the Church that is committed to him.
Nor does he merely declare himself to be such to the entire body, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc48</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
even to the individual members. For it is not enough that a pastor in the pulpit
teach all in common, if he does not add also particular instruction, according
as necessity requires, or occasion offers. Hence Paul himself, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442026&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
20:26, declares himself to be <i>free from the blood of all men</i>, because he
did not cease to admonish all publicly, and also individually in private in
their own houses. For instruction given in common is sometimes of little
service, and some cannot be corrected or cured without particular
medicine.</font><br></div>

He shews with what earnestness he devoted himself to their welfare, for he
relates that in preaching to them respecting piety towards God and the duties of
the Christian life, it had not been merely in a perfunctory way, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc49</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but he
says that he had made use of exhortations and <i>adjurations</i>. It is a lively
preaching of the gospel, when persons are not merely told what is right, but are
<i>pricked</i>
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440237&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:37) by exhortations, and are called to the judgment&#8212;seat of God, that
they may not fall asleep in their vices, for this is what is properly meant by
<i>adjuring</i>. But if pious men, whose promptitude Paul so highly commends,
stood in absolute need of being stimulated by stirring exhortations, nay,
<i>adjurations</i>, what must be done with us, in whom sluggishness 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of the
flesh does more reign? In the mean time, as to the wicked, whose obstinacy is
incurable, it is necessary to denounce upon them the horrible vengeance of God,
not so much from hope of success, as in order that they may be rendered
inexcusable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some render the participle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">paramuqoume&gt;noi</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>comforted</i>. If we adopt this rendering, he means that he made use of
consolations in dealing with the afflicted, who need to be sustained by the
grace of God, and refreshed by tasting of heavenly blessings, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc51</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
they may not lose heart or become impatient. The other meaning, however, is more
suitable to the context, that he <i>admonished</i>; for the three verbs, it is
manifest, refer to the same thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye might
walk</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He presents in a few words the sum and
substance of his exhortations, that, in magnifying the mercy of God, he
admonished them not to fail as to their calling. His commendation of the grace
of God is contained in the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who hath called us into his
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For as our salvation is founded upon
God&#8217;s gracious adoption, every blessing that Christ has brought us is
comprehended in this one term. It now remains that we answer God&#8217;s call,
that is, that we shew ourselves to be such children to him as he is a Father to
us. For he who lives otherwise than as becomes a child of God, deserves to be
cut off from God&#8217;s household.</font><br></div>

says, therefore, that he gives thanks to God, because they had

was.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Now, by these expressions he means, that
it has been received by them reverently, and with the obedience with which it
ought. For so soon as this persuasion has gained a footing, it is impossible but
that a feeling of obligation to obey takes possession of our minds. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For who

that they do not consider that they have to do with God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we learn from this passage what credit ought to
be given to the gospel&#8212;such as does not depend on the authority of men,
but, resting on the sure and ascertained truth of God, raises itself above the

their turn, admonished to beware of bringing forward anything but the pure word
of God, for if this was not allowable for Paul, it will not be so for any one in

word of God that he had delivered, inasmuch as it had produced that fruit of
heavenly doctrine which the Prophets celebrate,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
55:11,13;

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc56</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for the
doctrine of men could accomplish no such thing. The relative pronoun may be
taken as referring either to <i>God</i> or to his <i>word</i>, but whichever way
you choose, the meaning will come all to one, for as the Thessalonians felt in
themselves a Divine energy, which proceeded from faith, they might rest assured
that what they had heard was not a mere sound of the human voice vanishing into
air, but the living and efficacious doctrine of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word of the preaching of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, it means simply, as I have rendered it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word of God preached by
man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For Paul meant to state expressly that
they had not looked upon the doctrine as contemptible, although it had proceeded
from the mouth of a mortal man, inasmuch as they recognized God as the author of
it. He accordingly praises the Thessalonians, because they did not rest in mere
regard for the minister. but lifted up their eyes to God, that they might
receive his word. Accordingly, I have not hesitated to insert the particle
<i>ut</i>, (<i>that</i>,) which served to make the meaning more clear. There is
a mistake on the part of Erasmus in rendering it, &#8220;the word of the hearing
of God,&#8221; as if Paul meant that God had been manifested. He afterwards
changed it thus, &#8220;the word by which you learned God,&#8221; for he did not
advert to the Hebrew idiom.

to the clause in immediate connection with it, the meaning will be, that the
power of God, or of his word, shews itself in their patient endurance, while
they sustain persecutions with magnanimity and undaunted courage. I prefer,
however, to view it as extending to the whole of the foregoing statement, for he
confirms what he has stated, that the Thessalonians had in good earnest embraced
the gospel, as being presented to them by God, inasmuch as they courageously
endured the assaults which Satan made upon them, and did not refuse to suffer
anything rather than leave off obedience to it. And, unquestionably, this is no
slight test of faith when Satan, by all his machinations, has no success in
moving us away from the fear of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the mean time, he prudently provides against a
dangerous temptation which might prostrate or harass them; for they endured
grievous troubles from that nation which was the only one in the world that
gloried in the name of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, I say, might occur to their minds: &#8220;If
this is the true religion, why do the Jews, who are the sacred people of God,
oppose it with such inveterate hostility?&#8221; With the view of removing this
occasion of offense, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc58</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he, in
the <i>first</i> place, shews them that they have this in common with the first
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Churches that were in
Judea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> :</i> afterwards, he says that the
Jews are determined enemies of God and of all sound doctrine. For although, when
he says that they suffered from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their own
countrymen</i></font><font face="Palatino">, this may be explained as referring
to others rather than to the Jews, or at least ought not to be restricted to the
Jews exclusively, yet as he insists farther in describing their obstinacy and
impiety, it is manifest that these same persons are adverted to by him from the
beginning. It is probable, that at Thessalonica some from that nation were
converted to Christ. It appears, however, from the narrative furnished in the
Acts, that <i>there</i>, no less than in Judea, the Jews were persecutors of the
gospel. I accordingly take this as being said indiscriminately of Jews as well
as of Gentiles, inasmuch as both endured great conflicts and fierce attacks from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their own

Paul means that there is nothing new or unusual in their resisting God, but
that, on the contrary, they are, in this manner, <i>filling up the measure of

they furiously opposed the Gospel everywhere, there arose from this a great
stumblingblock, more especially as they exclaimed that the gospel was profaned
by Paul, when he published it among the Gentiles. By this calumny they made
divisions in the Churches, they took away from the Gentiles the hope of
salvation, and they obstructed the progress of the gospel. Paul, accordingly,
charges them with this crime&#8212;that they regard the salvation of the
Gentiles with envy, but adds, that matters are so, in order that their <i>sins
may be filled up</i>, that he may take away from them all reputation for piety;

not leave them until they perish&#8212;as is the case with all the reprobate,
who rush on headlong to death, to which they are destined.&#8221; The Apostle,
however, makes this declaration as to the entire body of the people, in such a
manner as not to deprive the elect of hope. For as the greater proportion
resisted Christ, he speaks, it is true, of the whole nation generally, but we
must keep in view the exception which he himself makes in

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But we, brethren, bereaved of
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This excuse has been appropriately added,
lest the Thessalonians should think that Paul had deserted them while so great
an emergency demanded his presence. He has spoken of the persecutions which they
endured from their own people: he, in the mean time, whose duty it was above all
others to assist them, was absent. He has formerly called himself a
<i>father;</i> now, it is not the part of a <i>father</i> to desert his children
in the midst of such distresses. He, accordingly, obviates all suspicion of
contempt and negligence, by saying, that it was from no want of inclination, but
because he had not opportunity. Nor does he say simply, &#8220;I was desirous to
come to you, but my way was obstructed;&#8221; but by the peculiar terms that he
employs he expresses the intensity of his affection: &#8220;When,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;I was <i>bereaved</i> of you.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc65</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> By the
word <i>bereaved</i>, he declares how sad and distressing a thing it was to him
to be absent from them. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is
followed by a fuller expression of his feeling of desire&#8212;that it was with
difficulty that he could endure their absence for a short time. It is not to be
wondered, if length of time should occasion weariness or sadness; but we must
have a strong feeling of attachment when we find it difficult to wait even a
single hour. Now, by the <i>space of an hour</i>, he means&#8212;a small space
of time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is followed by a correction&#8212;that he had
been separated from them in <i>appearance,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not in
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that they may know that distance of
place does not by any means lessen his attachment. At the same time, this might
not less appropriately be applied to the Thessalonians, as meaning that they, on
their part, had felt united in <i>mind</i> while absent in <i>body ;</i> for it
was of no small importance for the point in hand that he should state how fully
assured he was of their affection towards him in return. He shews, however, more
fully his affection, when he says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>endeavored the more abundantly
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for he means that his affection was so
far from being diminished by his leaving them, that it had been the more
inflamed. When he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we would
once and again</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he declares that it was not a
sudden heat, that quickly cooled, (as we see sometimes happen,) but that he had
been steadfast in this purpose, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc67</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
inasmuch as he sought various opportunities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Satan hindered us</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Luke relates that Paul was
in one instance hindered,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
20:3) inasmuch as the Jews laid an ambush for him in the way. The same thing, or
something similar, may have occurred frequently. It is not without good reason,
however, that Paul ascribes the whole of this to Satan, for, as he teaches
elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:12) we have to</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">wrestle not with flesh
and blood, but with principalities of the air, and spiritual wickednesses,
etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For, whenever the wicked molest us, they fight under
Satan&#8217;s banner, and are his instruments for harassing us. More especially,
when our endeavors are directed to the work of the Lord, it is certain that
everything that hinders proceeds from Satan; and would to God that this
sentiment were deeply impressed upon the minds of all pious persons&#8212;that
Satan is continually contriving, by every means, in what way he may hinder or
obstruct the edification of the Church! We would assuredly be more careful to
resist him; we would take more care to maintain sound doctrine, of which that
enemy strives so keenly to deprive us. We would also, whenever the course of the
gospel is retarded, know whence the hindrance proceeds. He says elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:13) that God had not permitted him, but both are true: for although Satan does
his part, yet God retains supreme authority, so as to open up a way for us, as
often as he sees good, against Satan&#8217;s will, and in spite of his
opposition. Paul accordingly says truly that God does not permit, although the
hindrance comes from Satan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For what is our
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He confirms that ardor of desire, of
which he had made mention, inasmuch as he has his happiness in a manner
treasured up in them. &#8220;Unless I forget myself, I must necessarily desire
your presence, for </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye are our
glory and joy</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221; Farther, when he calls
them his <i>hope and the crown of his glory</i>, we must not understand this as
meaning that he gloried in any one but God alone, but because we are allowed to
glory in all God&#8217;s favors, in their own place, in such a manner that he is
always our object of aim, as I have explained more at large in the <i>first</i>
Epistle to the Corinthians. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc68</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We
must, however, infer from this, that Christ&#8217;s ministers will, on the last
day, according as they have individually promoted his kingdom, be partakers of
glory and triumph. Let them therefore now learn to rejoice and glory in nothing
but the prosperous issue of their labors, when they see that the glory of Christ
is promoted by their instrumentality. The consequence will be, that they will be
actuated by that spirit of affection to the Church with which they ought. The
particle <i>also</i> denotes that the Thessalonians were not the only persons in
whom Paul triumphed, but that they held a place among many. The causal particle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ga&gt;r</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>for</i>,) which occurs almost immediately afterwards, is employed here not
in its strict sense, by way of affirmation&#8212;&#8221;<i>assuredly</i> you
are.&#8221;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore, when we could no
longer endure</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the detail which follows, he
assures them of the desire of which he had spoken. For if, on being detained
elsewhere, he had sent no other to Thessalonica in his place, it might have
seemed as though he were not so much concerned in regard to them; but when he
substitutes Timothy in his place, he removes that suspicion, more especially
when he prefers them before himself. Now that he esteemed them above himself, he
shews from this, that he chose rather to be left alone than that they should be
deserted: for these words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we
judged it good to be left alone</i></font><font face="Palatino">, are emphatic.
Timothy was a most faithful companion to him: he had at that time no others with
him; hence it was inconvenient and distressing for him to be without him. It is
therefore a token of rare affection and anxious desire that he does not refuse
to deprive himself of all comfort, with the view of relieving the Thessalonians.
To the same effect is the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujdokh&gt;samen</font><font face="Palatino">,
which expresses a prompt inclination of the mind. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc69</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Our
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He assigns to him these marks of
commendation, that he may shew the more clearly how much inclined he was to
consult their welfare: for if he had sent them some common person, it could not
have afforded them much assistance; and inasmuch as Paul would have done this
without inconvenience to himself, he would have given no remarkable proof of his
fatherly concern in regard to them. It is, on the other hand, a great thing that
he deprives himself of a <i>brother</i> and <i>fellow&#8212;laborer</i>, and one
to whom, as he declares in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;505920&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:20, he found no equal, inasmuch as all aimed at the promotion of their own
interests. In the mean time, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc70</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
procures authority for the doctrine which they had received from Timothy, that
it may remain the more deeply impressed upon their memory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, however, with good reason that he says that he
had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sent
Timothy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>with this view&#8212;that they
might receive a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>confirmation of
their faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>from his example. They might
be intimidated by unpleasant reports as to persecutions; but Paul&#8217;s
undaunted constancy was fitted so much the more to animate them, so as to keep
them from giving way. And, assuredly, the fellowship which ought to subsist
between the saints and members of Christ extends even thus far&#8212;that the
faith of one is the consolation of others. Thus, when the Thessalonians heard
that Paul was going on with indefatigable zeal, and was by strength of faith
surmounting all dangers and all difficulties, and that his faith continued
everywhere victorious against Satan and the world, this brought them no small
consolation. More especially we are, or at least ought to be, stimulated by the
examples of those by whom we were instructed in the faith, as is stated in the
end of the Epistle to the Hebrews.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
13:7) Paul, accordingly, means that they ought to be fortified by his example,
so as not to give way under their afflictions. As, however, they might have been
offended if Paul had entertained a fear lest they should all give way under
persecutions, (inasmuch as this would have been an evidence of excessive
distrust,) he mitigates this harshness by saying&#8212;<i>lest any one</i>, or,
<i>that no one</i>. There was, however, good reason to fear this, as there are
always some weak persons in every society.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For ye yourselves
know</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As all would gladly exempt themselves
from the necessity of bearing the cross, Paul teaches that there is no reason
why believers should feel dismayed on occasion of persecutions, as though it
were a thing that was new and unusual, inasmuch as this is our condition, which
the Lord has assigned to us. For this manner of
expression&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we are appointed
to it</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8212;is as though he had said, that we
are Christians on this condition. He says, however, that they <i>know</i> it,
because it became them to fight the more bravely, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc71</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
inasmuch as they had been forewarned in time. In addition to this, incessant
afflictions made Paul contemptible among rude and ignorant persons. On this
account he states that nothing had befallen him but what he had long before, in
the manner of a prophet, foretold.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest perhaps the tempter has
tempted you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this term he teaches us that
temptations are always to be dreaded, because it is the proper office of Satan
to <i>tempt</i>. As, however, he never ceases to place ambushes for us on all
sides, and to lay snares for us all around, so we must be on our watch, eagerly
taking heed. And now he says openly what in the outset he had avoided saying, as
being too harsh&#8212;that he had felt concerned lest his <i>labors</i> should
be <i>vain</i>, if, peradventure, Satan should prevail. And this he does that
they may be carefully upon their watch, and may stir themselves up the more
vigorously to resistance.</font><br></div>

made use of by Paul, for in these two words he comprehends briefly the entire
sum of true piety. Hence all that aim at this twofold mark during their whole
life are beyond all risk of erring: all others, however much they may torture
themselves, wander miserably. The third thing that he adds as to their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good remembrance
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of him, refers to respect entertained for the
Gospel. For it was on no other account that they held Paul in such affection and
esteem.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For now we
live</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here it appears still more clearly that
Paul almost forgot himself for the sake of the Thessalonians, or, at least,
making regard for himself a mere secondary consideration, devoted his first and
chief thoughts to them. At the same time he did not do that so much from
affection to men as from a desire for the Lord&#8217;s glory. For zeal for God
and Christ glowed in his holy breast to such a degree that it in a manner
swallowed up all other anxieties.
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We
live</i></font><font face="Palatino">,&#8221; says he, that is, &#8220;we are in
good health, if you <i>persevere in the Lord</i>.&#8221; And under the adverb
<i>now</i>, he repeats what he had formerly stated, that he had been greatly
pressed down by <i>affliction</i> and <i>necessity ;</i> yet he declares that
whatever evil he endures in his own person does not hinder his joy.
&#8220;Though in myself I am dead, yet in your welfare I <i>live</i>.&#8221; By
this all pastors are admonished what sort of connection ought to subsist between
them and the Church&#8212;that they reckon themselves happy when it goes well
with the Church, although they should be in other respects encompassed with many
miseries, and, on the other hand, that they pine away with grief and sorrow if
they see the building which they have constructed in a state of decay, although
matters otherwise should be joyful and prosperous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For what
thanksgiving</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Not satisfied with a simple
affirmation, he intimates how extraordinary is the greatness of his joy, by
asking himself </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what thanks he can
render to God </i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for by speaking thus he
declares that he cannot find an expression of gratitude that can come up to the
measure of his joy. He says that he rejoices
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, truly and without any
presence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praying beyond
measure</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He returns to an expression of his
<i>desire</i>. For it is never allowable for us to congratulate men, while they
live in this world, in such unqualified terms as not always to desire something
better for them. For they are as yet in the way: they may fall back, or go
astray, or even go back. Hence Paul is desirous to have opportunity given him of
<i>supplying what is wanting in the faith </i>of the Thessalonians, or, which is
the same thing, completing in all its parts their faith, which was as yet
imperfect. Yet this is the faith which he had previously extolled marvelously.
But from this we infer, that those who far surpass others are still far distant
from the goal. Hence, whatever progress we may have made, let us always keep in
view our <i>deficiencies</i>,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJsterh&gt;mata</font><font face="Palatino">,)
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc74</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that we
may not be reluctant to aim at something farther.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From this also it appears how necessary it is for us
to give careful attention to doctrine, for teachers 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc75</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> were
not appointed merely with the view of leading men, in the course of a single day
or month, to the faith of Christ, but for the purpose of perfecting the faith
which has been begun. But as to Paul&#8217;s claiming for himself what he
elsewhere declares belongs peculiarly to the Holy Spirit,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:14) this must be restricted to the ministry. Now, as the ministry
of a man is inferior to the efficacy of the Spirit, and to use the common
expression, is subordinate to it, nothing is detracted from it. When he says
that he prayed </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>night and day
beyond all ordinary measure</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc76</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> we may
gather from these words how assiduous he was in praying to God, and with what
ardor and earnestness he discharged that duty.</font><br></div>

removed Satan&#8217;s obstructions, may open a door for himself, and be, as it
were, the leader and director of his way to the Thessalonians. By this he
intimates, that we cannot move a step with success, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc77</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
otherwise than under God&#8217;s guidance, but that when he holds out his hand,
it is to no purpose that Satan employs every effort to change the direction of
our course. We must take notice that he assigns the same office to God and to
Christ, as, unquestionably, the Father confers no blessing upon us except
through Christ&#8217;s hand. When, however, he thus speaks of both in the same
terms, he teaches that Christ has divinity and power in common with the
Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord fill
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here we have another prayer&#8212;that in
the mean time, while his way is obstructed, the Lord, during his absence, may
confirm the Thessalonians in holiness, and fill them with love. And from this
again we learn in what the perfection of the Christian life consists&#8212;in
love and pure holiness of heart, flowing from faith. He recommends love mutually
cherished <i>towards each other</i>, and afterwards
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>towards
all</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for as it is befitting that a commencement
should be made with those that are of the <i>household of faith</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:10) so our love ought to go forth to the whole human race. Farther, as the
nearer connection must be cherished, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc78</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so we
must not overlook those who are farther removed from us, so as to prevent them
from holding their proper place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He would have the Thessalonians abound in love and be
filled with it, because in so far as we make progress in acquaintance with God,
the love of the brethren must at the same time increase in us, until it take
possession of our whole heart, the corrupt love of self being extirpated. He
prays that the love of the Thessalonians may be perfected by God, intimating
that its increase, no less than its commencement, was from God alone. Hence it
is evident how preposterous a part those act who measure our strength by the
precepts of the Divine law. <i>The end of the law is love</i>, says Paul,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 1:5) yet he himself declares that it is a work of God. When, therefore,
God marks out our life, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc79</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he does
not look to what we can do, but requires from us what is above our strength,
that we may learn to ask from him power to accomplish it. When he
says&#8212;<i>as </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we also
towards you</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he stimulates them by his own
example.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he may confirm your
hearts</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He employs the term <i>hearts</i> here
to mean <i>conscience</i>, or the innermost part of the soul; for he means that
a man is acceptable to God only when he brings holiness of heart; that is, not
merely external, but also internal. But it is asked, whether by means of
holiness we stand at God&#8217;s judgment&#8212;seat, for if so, to what purpose
is remission of sins? Yet Paul&#8217;s words seem to imply this&#8212;that their
consciences might be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>irreproveable in
holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I answer, that Paul does not exclude
remission of sins, through which it comes that our holiness, which is otherwise
mixed up with many pollutions, bears God&#8217;s eye, for faith, by which God is
pacified towards us, so as to pardon our faults, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc80</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
precedes everything else, as the foundation comes before the building. Paul,
however, does not teach us what or how great the holiness of believers may be,
but desires that it may be increased, until it attain its perfection. On this
account he says&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at the
coming of our Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">, meaning that the completion
of those things, which the Lord now begins in us, is delayed till that
time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With all his
saints</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This clause may be explained in two
ways, either as meaning that the Thessalonians,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with all
saints</i></font><font face="Palatino">, may have pure hearts at Christ&#8217;s
coming, or that Christ will come with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all his
saints</i></font><font face="Palatino">. While I adopt this second meaning, in
so far as concerns the construction of the words, I have at the same time no
doubt that Paul employed the term <i>saints</i> for the purpose of admonishing
us that we are called by Christ for this end&#8212;that we may be gathered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with all his
saints</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For this consideration ought to whet
our desire for holiness.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Furthermore</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
This chapter contains various injunctions, by which he trains up the
Thessalonians to a holy life, or confirms them in the exercise of it. They had
previously learned what was the rule and method of a pious life: he calls this
to their remembrance. <i>As</i>, says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye have been
taught</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Lest, however, he should seem to take
away from them what he had previously assigned them, he does not simply exhort
them to <i>walk</i> in such a manner, but to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abound more and
more</i></font><font face="Palatino">. When, therefore, he urges them to make
progress, he intimates that they are already in the way. The sum is this, that
they should be more especially careful to make progress in the doctrine which
they had received, and this Paul places in contrast with frivolous and vain
pursuits, in which we see that a good part of the world very generally busy
themselves, so that profitable and holy meditation as to the due regulation of
life scarcely obtains a place, even the most inferior. Paul, accordingly,
reminds them in what manner they had been instructed, and bids them aim at this
with their whole might. Now, there is a law that is here enjoined upon
us&#8212;that, <i>forgetting the things that are behind</i>, we always aim at
farther progress,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
3:13) and pastors ought also to make this their endeavor. Now, as to his
<i>beseeching</i>, when he might rightfully enjoin&#8212;it is a token of
humanity and modesty which pastors ought to imitate, that they may, if possible,
allure people to kindness, rather than violently compel them.

which, as from a fountain, he immediately deduces special admonitions. When he
says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this is the will of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means that we have been called by God
with this design. &#8220;For this end ye are Christians&#8212;this the gospel
aims at&#8212;that ye may <i>sanctify</i> yourselves to <i>God</i>.&#8221; The
meaning of the term <i>sanctification</i> we have already explained elsewhere in
repeated instances&#8212;that renouncing the world, and clearing ourselves from
the pollutions of the flesh, we offer ourselves to God as if in sacrifice, for
nothing can with propriety be offered to Him, but what is pure and
holy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye
abstain</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is one injunction, which he
derives from the fountain of which he had immediately before made mention; for
nothing is more opposed to holiness than the defilement of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fornication</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
which pollutes the whole man. On this account he assigns the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lust of concupiscence
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gentiles, who know not
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. &#8220;Where the knowledge of God reigns,
lusts must be subdued.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lust of
concupiscence</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means all base lusts of the

dishonor all desires that allure us to pleasure and carnal delights, as in

13:14, he bids us <i>have no care for the flesh in respect of the lust

having adduced one instance of unchastity in respect of lasciviousness and lust,
teaches that this also is a department of holiness&#8212;that we conduct
ourselves righteously and harmlessly towards our neighbors. The <i>former</i>
verb refers to violent oppressions&#8212;where the man that has more power
emboldens himself to inflict injury. The <i>latter</i> includes in it all
immoderate and unrighteous desires. As, however, mankind, for the most part,

however, a little difference between them. For after having discoursed as to the
correcting of the vices of the flesh, he proves, from the end of our calling,
that God desires this. For he sets us apart to himself as his peculiar
possession. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Again,
that God calls us to holiness, he proves by contraries, because he rescues us,
and calls us back, from unchastity. From this he concludes, that all that reject
this doctrine </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reject not men, but
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the Author of this calling, which
altogether falls to the ground so soon as this principle as to newness of life
is overthrown. Now, the reason why he rouses himself so vehemently is, because
there are always wanton persons who, while they fearlessly despise God, treat
with ridicule all threatenings of his judgment, and at the same time hold in
derision all injunctions as to a holy and pious life. Such persons must not be
taught, but must be beaten with severe reproofs as with the stroke of a
hammer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath also
given</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That he may the more effectually turn
away the Thessalonians from such contempt and obstinacy, he reminds them that
they had been endowed with the Spirit of God, <i>first</i>, in order that they
may distinguish what proceeds from God; <i>secondly</i>, that they make such a
difference as is befitting between holiness and impurity; and <i>thirdly</i>,
that, with heavenly authority, they may pronounce judgment against all manner of
unchastity&#8212;such as will fall upon their own heads, unless they keep aloof
from contagion. Hence, however wicked men may treat with ridicule all
instructions that are given as to a holy life and the fear of God, those that
are endowed with the Spirit of God have a very different testimony sealed upon
their hearts. We must therefore take heed, lest we should extinguish or
obliterate it. At the same time, this may refer to Paul and the other teachers,
as though he had said, that it is not from human perception that they condemn
unchastity, but they pronounce from the authority of God what has been suggested
to them by his Spirit. I am inclined, however, to include both. Some manuscripts
have the second person&#8212;<i>you</i>, which restricts the gift of the Spirit
to the Thessalonians.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As to brotherly
love</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Having previously, in lofty terms,
commended their love, he now speaks by way of <i>anticipation</i>, saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye need not that I write to
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He assigns a
reason&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they had
been divinely taught</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8212;by which he means
that love was engraven upon their hearts, so that there was no need of letters
written on paper. For he does not mean simply what John says in his first
Canonical 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc86</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> 
Epistle, <i>the anointing will teach you</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620227&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 2:27) but that their hearts were framed for love; so that it appears that
the Holy Spirit inwardly dictates efficaciously what is to be done, so that
there is no need to give injunctions in writing. He subjoins an argument from
the greater to the less; for as their love diffuses itself through the whole of
Macedonia, he infers that it is not to be doubted that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love one
another</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Hence the particle <i>for</i> means
<i>likewise</i>, or <i>nay more</i>, for, as I have already stated, he adds it
for the sake of greater intensity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And we exhort you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though he declares that they
were sufficiently prepared of themselves for all offices of love, he
nevertheless does not cease to exhort them to make progress, there being no
perfection in men. And, unquestionably, whatever appears in us in a high state
of excellence, we must still desire that it may become better. Some connect the
verb </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">filotimei~szai
</font><font face="Palatino">with what follows, as if he exhorted them to strive
at the maintaining of peace; but it corresponds better with the expression that
goes before. For after having admonished them to increase in love, he recommends
to them a sacred emulation, that they may strive among themselves in mutual
affection, or at least he enjoins that each one strive to conquer himself; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc87</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and I
rather adopt this latter interpretation. That, therefore, their love may be
perfect, he requires that there be a striving among them, such as is wont to be
on the part of those who eagerly 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> aspire
at victory. This is the best emulation, when each one strives to overcome
himself in doing good. As to my not subscribing to the opinion of those who
render the words, <i>strive to maintain peace</i>, this single reason appears to
me to be sufficiently valid&#8212;that Paul would not in a thing of less
difficulty have enjoined so arduous a conflict&#8212;which suits admirably well
with advancement in love, where so many hindrances present themselves. Nor would
I have any objection to the other meaning of the verb&#8212;that they should
exercise liberality generally towards others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Maintain Peace.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">I have already stated that this clause must be
separated from what goes before, for this is a now sentence. Now, to <i>be at
peace</i>, means in this passage&#8212;to act peacefully and without
disturbance, as we also say in French&#8212;<i>sans bruit</i>, (<i>without
noise</i>.) In short, he exhorts them to be peaceable and tranquil. This is the
purport of what he adds immediately afterwards&#8212;to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do your own business
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> for we commonly see, that those who
intrude themselves with forwardness into the affairs of others, make great
disturbance, and give trouble to themselves and others. This, therefore, is the
best means of a tranquil life, when every one, intent upon the duties of his own
calling, discharges those duties which are enjoined upon him by the Lord, and
devotes himself to these things: while the husbandman employs himself in rural
labors, the workman carries on his occupation, and in this way every one keeps
within his own limits. So soon as men turn aside from this, everything is thrown
into confusion and disorder. He does not mean, however, that every one shall
<i>mind his own business </i>in such a way as that each one should live apart,
having no care for others, but has merely in view to correct an idle levity,
which makes men noisy bustlers in public, who ought to lead a quiet life in
their own houses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Labor with your
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He recommends manual labor on two
accounts&#8212;that they may have a sufficiency for maintaining life, and that
they may conduct themselves honorably even before unbelievers. For nothing is
more unseemly than a man that is idle and good for nothing, who profits neither
himself nor others, and seems born only to eat and drink. Farther, this labor or
system of working extends far, for what he says as to <i>hands</i> is by way of
<i>synecdoche ;</i> but there can be no doubt that he includes every useful
employment of human life.</font><br></div>

But I would not have you ignorant</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is not
likely that the hope of a resurrection had been torn up among the Thessalonians
by profane men, as had taken place at Corinth. For we see how he chastises the
Corinthians with severity, but here he speaks of it as a thing that was not
doubtful. It is possible, however, that this persuasion was not sufficiently
fixed in their minds, and that they accordingly, in bewailing the dead, retained
something of the old superstition. For the sum of the whole is this&#8212;that
we must not bewail the dead beyond due bounds, inasmuch as we are all to be
raised up again. For whence comes it, that the mourning of unbelievers has no
end or measure, but because they have no hope of a resurrection? It becomes not
us, therefore, who have been instructed as to a resurrection, to mourn otherwise
than in moderation. He is to discourse afterwards as to the manner of the
resurrection; and he is also on this account to say something as to <i>times
;</i> but in this passage he meant simply to restrain excessive grief, which
would never have had such an influence among them, if they had seriously
considered the resurrection, and kept it in remembrance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He does not, however, forbid us altogether to mourn,
but requires moderation in our mourning, for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that ye may not sorrow, as others
who have no hope</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He forbids them to grieve in
the manner of unbelievers, who give loose reins to their grief, because they
look upon death as final destruction, and imagine that everything that is taken
out of the world perishes. As, on the other hand, believers know that they quit
the world, that they may be at last gathered into the kingdom of God, they have
not the like occasion of grief. Hence the knowledge of a resurrection is the
means of moderating grief. He speaks of the dead as <i>asleep</i>, agreeably to
the common practice of Scripture&#8212;a term by which the bitterness of death
is mitigated, for there is a great difference between <i>sleep</i> and
<i>destruction</i>. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It
refers, however, not to the soul, but to the body, for the dead body lies in the
tomb, as in a couch, until God raise up the man. Those, therefore, act a foolish
part, who infer from this that souls sleep. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc90</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are now in possession of Paul&#8217;s
meaning&#8212;that he lifts up the minds of believers to a consideration of the
resurrection, lest they should indulge excessive grief on occasion of the death
of their relatives, for it were unseemly that there should be no difference
between them and unbelievers, who put no end or measure to their grief for this
reason, that in death they recognize nothing but destruction. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Those
that abuse this testimony, so as to establish among Christians Stoical
indifference, that is, an iron hardness, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc92</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> will
find nothing of this nature in Paul&#8217;s words. As to their objecting that we
must not indulge grief on occasion of the death of our relatives, lest we should
resist God, this would apply in all adversities; but it is one thing to bridle
our grief, that it may be made subject to God, and quite another thing to harden
one&#8217;s self so as to be like stones, by casting away human feelings. Let,
therefore, the grief of the pious be mixed with consolation, which may train
them to patience. The hope of a blessed resurrection, which is the mother of
patience, will effect this.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For if we
believe</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He assumes this axiom of our faith,
that Christ was raised up from the dead, that we might be partakers of the same
resurrection: from this he infers, that we shall live with him eternally. This
doctrine, however, as has been stated in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:13, depends on another principle&#8212;that it was not for
himself, but for us that Christ died and rose again. Hence those who have doubts
as to the resurrection, do great injury to Christ: nay more, they do in a manner
draw him down from heaven, as is said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:6</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sleep in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is to retain in death the connection
that we have with Christ, for those that are by faith ingrafted into Christ,
have death in common with him, that they may be partakers with him of life. It
is asked, however, whether unbelievers will not also rise again, for Paul does
not affirm that there will be a resurrection, except in the case of
Christ&#8217;s members. I answer, that Paul does not here touch upon anything
but what suited his present design. For he did not design to terrify the wicked,
but to correct 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc93</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the
immoderate grief of the pious, and to cure it, as he does, by the medicine of
consolation.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this we say unto
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now briefly explains the manner in
which believers will be raised up from death. Now, as he speaks of a thing that
is very great, and is incredible to the human mind, and also promises what is
above the power and choice of men, he premises that he does not bring forward
anything that is his own, or that proceeds from men, but that the Lord is the
Author of it. It is probable, however, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word of the Lord
</i></font><font face="Palatino">means what was taken from his discourses. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc94</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
though Paul had learned by revelation all the secrets of the heavenly kingdom,
it was, nevertheless, more fitted to establish in the minds of believers the
belief of a resurrection, when he related those things that had been uttered by
Christ&#8217;s own mouth. &#8220;We are not the first witnesses of the
resurrection, but instead of this the Master himself declared it.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc95</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We who
live.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This has been said by him with this
view&#8212;that they might not think that those only would be partakers of the
resurrection who would be alive at the time of Christ&#8217;s coming, and that
those would have no part in it who had been previously taken away by death.
&#8220;The order of the resurrection,&#8221; says he, &#8220;will begin with
them:  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc96</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
we shall accordingly not rise without them.&#8221; From this it appears that the
belief of a final resurrection had been, in the minds of some, slight and
obscure, and involved in various errors, inasmuch as they imagined that the dead
would be deprived of it; for they imagined that eternal life belonged to those
alone whom Christ, at his last coming, would find still alive upon the earth.
Paul, with the view of remedying these errors, assigns the first place to the
dead, and afterwards teaches that those will follow who will be at that time
remaining in this life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the circumstance, however, that by speaking in
the first person he makes himself, as it were, one of the number of those who
will live until the last day, he means by this to arouse the Thessalonians to
wait for it, nay more, to hold all believers in suspense, that they may not
promise themselves some particular time: for, granting that it was by a special
revelation that he knew that Christ would come at a somewhat later time, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc97</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it was
nevertheless necessary that this doctrine should be delivered to the Church in
common, that believers might be prepared at all times. In the mean time, it was
necessary thus to cut off all pretext for the curiosity of many&#8212;as we
shall find him doing afterwards at greater length. When, however, he says, <i>we
that are alive</i>, he makes use of the present tense instead of the future, in
accordance with the Hebrew idiom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Lord
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He employs the term
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">keleu&gt;smatov</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>shout</i>,) and afterwards adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the voice of the
archangel</i></font><font face="Palatino">, by way of exposition, intimating
what is to be the nature of that arousing shout&#8212;that the archangel will
discharge the office of a herald to summon the living and the dead to the
tribunal of Christ. For though this will be common to all the angels, yet, as is
customary among different ranks, he appoints one in the foremost place to take
the lead of the others. As to the <i>trumpet</i>, however, I leave to others to
dispute with greater subtlety, for I have nothing to say in addition to what I
briefly noticed in the First Epistle to the Corinthians. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc98</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Apostle unquestionably had nothing farther in view here than to give some taste
of the magnificence and venerable appearance of the Judge, until we shall behold
it fully. With this taste it becomes us in the mean time to rest
satisfied.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The dead who are in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dead who are in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, who are included in
Christ&#8217;s body, will </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rise
first</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that we may know that the hope of life
is laid up in heaven for them no less than for the living. He says nothing as to
the reprobate, because this did not tend to the consolation of the pious, of
which he is now treating.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that those that survive will be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>carried up together with
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As to these, he makes no mention of
death: hence it appears as if he meant to say that they would be exempted from
death. Here Augustine gives himself much distress, both in the twentieth book on
the City of God and in his Answer to Dulcitius, because Paul seems to contradict
himself, inasmuch as he says elsewhere, that <i>seed cannot spring up again
unless it die</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461536&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:36) The solution, however, is easy, inasmuch as a sudden change
will be like death. Ordinary death, it is true, is the separation of the soul
from the body; but this does not hinder that the Lord may in a moment destroy
this corruptible nature, so as to create it anew by his power, for thus is
accomplished what Paul himself teaches must take place&#8212;that <i>mortality
shall be swallowed up of life</i>.

But, as I have said, that is a kind of death, when this flesh is reduced to
nothing, as it is now liable to corruption. The only difference is
this&#8212;that those who <i>sleep</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc102</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> put

Origen and of the Chiliasts

abundantly refuted. For the life of believers, when they have once been gathered
into one kingdom, will have no end any more than Christ&#8217;s. Now, to assign
to Christ a thousand years, so that he would afterwards cease to reign, were too
horrible to be made mention of. Those, however, fall into this absurdity who
limit the life of believers to a thousand years, for they must live with Christ
as long as Christ himself will exist. We must observe also what he
says&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we shall
be</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for he means that we profitably entertain a
hope of eternal life, only when we hope that it has been expressly appointed for

He now shews more openly what I have previously stated&#8212;that in the faith
of the resurrection we have good ground of consolation, provided we are members
of Christ, and are truly united to him as our Head. At the same time, the
Apostle would not have each one to seek for himself assuagement of grief, but
also to administer it to others.</font><br></div>

back from a curious and unprofitable inquiry as to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>times</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
but in the mean time admonishes them to be constantly in a state of preparation
for receiving Christ. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc104</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
speaks, however, by way of <i>anticipation</i>, saying, that they have no need
that he should write as to those things which the curious desire to know. For it
is an evidence of excessive incredulity not to believe what the Lord foretells,
unless he marks out the day by certain circumstances, and as it were points it
out with the finger. As, therefore, those waver between doubtful opinions who
require that moments of time should be marked out for them, as if they would
draw a conjecture 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc105</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> from
some plausible demonstration, he accordingly says that discussions of this
nature are not necessary for the pious. There is also another reason&#8212;that
believers do not desire to know more than they are permitted to learn in
God&#8217;s school. Now Christ designed that the day of his coming should be hid
from us, that, being in suspense, we might be as it were upon
watch.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye know
perfectly</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He places exact knowledge in
contrast with an anxious desire of investigation. But what is it that he says
the Thessalonians know accurately? 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc106</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is,
that the day of Christ will come suddenly and unexpectedly, so as to take
unbelievers by surprise, as a thief does those that are asleep. This, however,
is opposed to evident tokens, which might portend afar off his coming to the
world. Hence it were foolish to wish to determine the time precisely from
presages or prodigies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For when they shall

similitude, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the day of the Lord
will be like a thief in the night</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Why so?
because it will come suddenly to unbelievers, when not looked for, so that it
will take them by surprise, as though they were asleep. But whence comes that
sleep? Assuredly from deep contempt of God. The prophets frequently reprove the
wicked on account of this supine negligence, and assuredly they await in a
spirit of carelessness not merely that last judgment, but also such as are of
daily occurrence. Though the Lord threatens destruction, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they
do not hesitate to promise themselves peace and every kind of prosperity. And
the reason why they fall into this destructive indolence 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc108</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is,
because they do not see those things immediately accomplished, which the Lord
declares will take place, for they reckon that to be fabulous that does not
immediately present itself before their eyes. For this reason the Lord, in order
that he may avenge this carelessness, which is full of obstinacy, comes all on a
sudden, and contrary to the expectation of all, precipitates the wicked from the
summit of felicity. He sometimes furnishes tokens of this nature of a sudden
advent, but that will be the principal one, when Christ will come down to judge
the world, as he himself testifies,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402437&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
24:37) comparing that time to the age of Noe, inasmuch as all will give way to
excess, as if in the profoundest repose.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the pains of
child-bearing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here we have a most apt
similitude, inasmuch as there is no evil that seizes more suddenly, and that
presses more keenly and more violently on the very first attack; besides this, a
woman that is with child carries in her womb occasion of grief without feeling
it, until she is seized amidst feasting and laughter, or in the midst of
sleep.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But ye,
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now admonishes them as to what is
the duty of believers, that they look forward in hope to that day, though it be
remote. And this is what is intended in the metaphor of <i>day</i> and
<i>light</i>. The coming of Christ will take by surprise those that are
carelessly giving way to indulgence, because, being enveloped in darkness, they
see nothing, for no darkness is more dense than ignorance of God. We, on the
other hand, on whom Christ has shone by the faith of his gospel, differ much
from them, for that saying of Isaiah is truly accomplished in us,
that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">while darkness covers the
earth, the Lord arises upon us, and his glory is seen in us.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
60:2)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He admonishes us, therefore, that it were an unseemly
thing that we should be caught by Christ asleep, as it were, or seeing nothing,
while the full blaze of light is shining forth upon us. He calls them
<i>children of light</i>, in accordance with the Hebrew idiom, as
meaning&#8212;furnished with light; as also <i>children of the day</i>,
meaning&#8212;those who enjoy the light of day. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc109</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
this he again confirms, when he says that we are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not of the night nor of
darkness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because the Lord has rescued us from
it. For it is as though he had said, that we have not been enlightened by the
Lord with a view to our walking in darkness.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore let us not
sleep</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He adds other metaphors closely allied
to the preceding one. For as he lately shewed that it were by no means seemly
that they should be blind in the midst of light, so he now admonishes that it
were dishonorable and disgraceful to sleep or be drunk in the middle of the day.
Now, as he gives the name of <i>day</i> to the doctrine of the gospel, by which
the Christ, the <i>Sun of righteousness
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
4:2) is manifested to us, so when he speaks of sleep and drunkenness, he does
not mean natural sleep, or drunkenness from wine, but stupor of mind, when,
forgetting God and ourselves, we regardlessly indulge our vices.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let us not
sleep</i></font><font face="Palatino">, says he; that is, let us not, sunk in
indolence, become senseless in the world. <i>As others</i>, that is,
unbelievers, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc110</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> from
whom ignorance of God, like a dark night, takes away understanding and reason.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But let us
watch</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, let us look to the Lord with an
attentive mind. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And be
sober</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, casting away the cares of the
world, which weigh us down by their pressure, and throwing off base lusts, mount
to heaven with freedom and alacrity. For this is spiritual sobriety, when we use
this world so sparingly and temperately that we are not entangled with its
allurements.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having put on the
breastplate</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He adds this, that he may the more
effectually shake us out of our stupidity, for he calls us as it were to arms,
that he may shew that it is not a time to sleep. It is true that he does not
make use of the term <i>war ;</i> but when he arms us with a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>breastplate
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and a <i>helmet</i>, he admonishes us that we
must maintain a warfare. Whoever, therefore, is afraid of being surprised by the
enemy, must keep awake, that he may be constantly on watch. As, therefore, he
has exhorted to vigilance, on the ground that the doctrine of the gospel is like
the light of day, so he now stirs us up by another argument&#8212;that we must
wage war with our enemy. From this it follows, that idleness is too hazardous a
thing. For we see that soldiers, though in other situations they may be
intemperate, do nevertheless, when the enemy is near, from fear of destruction,
refrain from gluttony 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc111</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
all bodily delights, and are diligently on watch so as to be upon their guard.
As, therefore, Satan is on the alert against us, and tries a thousand schemes,
we ought at least to be not less diligent and watchful. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc112</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, however, in vain, that some seek a more
refined exposition of the names of the kinds of armor, for Paul speaks here in a
different way from what he does in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490614&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:14 for there he makes <i>righteousness</i> the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>breastplate</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
This, therefore, will suffice for understanding his meaning, that he designs to
teach, that the life of Christians is like a perpetual warfare, inasmuch as
Satan does not cease to trouble and molest them. He would have us, therefore, be
diligently prepared and on the alert for resistance: farther, he admonishes us
that we have need of arms, because unless we be well armed we cannot withstand
so powerful 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc113</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> an
enemy. He does not, however, enumerate <i>all the parts of armor</i>,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">panopli&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">,)
but simply makes mention of two, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>breastplate
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>helmet</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
In the mean time, he omits nothing of what belongs to spiritual armor, for the
man that is provided with <i>faith</i>, <i>love</i>, and <i>hope</i>, will be
found in no department unarmed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For God hath not appointed
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As he has spoken of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hope of
salvation,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he follows out that department, and
says that God has appointed us to this&#8212;that we
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>may obtain salvation through
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The passage, however, might be
explained in a simple way in this manner&#8212;that we must <i>put on the helmet
of salvation</i>, because God wills not that we should perish, but rather that
we should be saved. And this, indeed, Paul means, but, in my opinion, he has in
view something farther. For as the day of Christ is for the most part regarded
with alarm, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc114</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> having
it in view to close with the mention of it, he says that we are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>appointed to
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Greek term
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">peripoi&gt;hsiv</font><font face="Palatino">
means <i>enjoyment</i>, (as they speak,) as well as <i>acquisition</i>. Paul,
undoubtedly, does not mean that God has called us, that we may procure salvation
for ourselves, but that we may obtain it, as it has been acquired for us by
Christ. Paul, however, encourages believers to fight strenuously, setting before
them the certainty of victory; for the man who fights timidly and hesitatingly
is half&#8212;conquered. In these words, therefore, he had it in view to take
away the dread which arises from distrust. There cannot, however, be a better
assurance of salvation gathered, than from the decree 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc115</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of
God. The term <i>wrath</i>, in this passage, as in other instances, is taken to
mean the judgment or vengeance of God against the reprobate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who
died</i></font><font face="Palatino">. From the design of Christ&#8217;s death
he confirms what he has said, for if he died with this view&#8212;that he might
make us partakers of his life, there is no reason why we should be in doubt as
to our salvation. It is doubtful, however, what he means now by <i>sleeping</i>
and <i>waking</i>, for it might seem as if he meant <i>life</i> and
<i>death</i>, and this meaning would be more complete. At the same time, we
might not unsuitably interpret it as meaning ordinary sleep. The sum is
this&#8212;that Christ died with this view, that he might bestow upon us his
life, which is perpetual and has no end. It is not to be wondered, however, that
he affirms that we now <i>live with Christ</i>, inasmuch as we have, by entering
through faith into the kingdom of Christ, <i>passed from death into life</i>.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Exhort</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
It is the same word that we had in the close of the preceding chapter, and which
we rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>comfort</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
because the context required it, and the same would not suit ill with this
passage also. For what he has treated of previously furnishes matter of
both&#8212;of <i>consolation</i> as well as of <i>exhortation</i>. He bids them,
therefore, communicate to one another what has been given them by the Lord. He
adds, that they may </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>edify one
another</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8212;that is, may confirm each other
in that doctrine. Lest, however, it might seem as if he reproved them for
carelessness, he says at the same time that they of their own accord did what he
enjoins. But, as we are slow to what is good, those that are the most favourably
inclined of all, have always, nevertheless, need to be
stimulated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we beseech
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here we have an admonition that is very
necessary. For as the kingdom of God is lightly esteemed, or at least is not
esteemed suitably to its dignity, there follows also from this, contempt of
pious teachers. Now, the most of them, offended with this ingratitude, not so
much because they see themselves despised, as because they infer from this, that
honor is not rendered to their Lord, are rendered thereby more indifferent, and
God also, on just grounds, inflicts vengeance upon the world, inasmuch as he
deprives it of good ministers, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc117</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to
whom it is ungrateful. Hence, it is not so much for the advantage of ministers
as of the whole Church, that those who faithfully preside over it should be held
in esteem. And it is for this reason that Paul is so careful to recommend them.
To <i>acknowledge</i> means here to <i>have regard </i>or respect; but Paul
intimates that the reason why less honor is shewn to teachers themselves than is
befitting, is because their labor is not ordinarily taken into
consideration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must observe, however, with what titles of
distinction he honors pastors. In the <i>first</i> place, he says that they
<i>labor</i>. From this it follows, that all idle bellies are excluded from the
number of pastors. Farther, he expresses the kind of labor when he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those that
admonish</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or instruct, <i>you</i>. It is to no
purpose, therefore, that any, that do not discharge the office of an instructor,
glory in the name of pastors. The Pope, it is true, readily admits such persons
into his catalogue, but the Spirit of God expunges them from <i>his</i>. As,
however, they are held in contempt in the world, as has been said, he honors
them at the same time, with the distinction of presidency.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul would have such as devote themselves to
teaching, and preside with no other end in view than that of serving the Church,
be held in no ordinary esteem. For he says literally&#8212;<i>let
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>them be more than abundantly
honored,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and not without good ground, for we
must observe the reason that he adds immediately
afterwards&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on account of
their work</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Now, this <i>work</i> is the
edification of the Church, the everlasting salvation of souls, the restoration
of the world, and, in fine, the kingdom of God and Christ. The excellence and
dignity of this work are inestimable: hence those whom God makes ministers in
connection with so great a matter, ought to be held by us in great esteem. We
may, however, infer from Paul&#8217;s words, that judgment is committed to the
Church, that it may distinguish true pastors. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc118</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For to
no purpose were these marks pointed out, if he did not mean that they should be
taken notice of by believers. And while he commands that honor be given to those
that <i>labor</i>, and to those that by teaching 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc119</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> govern
properly and faithfully, he assuredly does not bestow any honor upon those that
are idle and wicked, nor does he mark them out as deserving of
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Preside in the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This seems to be added to denote
spiritual government. For although kings and magistrates also preside by the
appointment of God, yet as the Lord would have the government of the Church to
be specially recognized as <i>his</i>, those that govern the Church in the name
and by the commandment of Christ, are for this reason spoken of particularly as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>presiding in the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We may, however, infer from this, how
very remote those are from the rank of pastors and prelates who exercise a
tyranny altogether opposed to Christ. Unquestionably, in order that any one may
be ranked among lawful pastors, it is necessary that he should shew that he
<i>presides</i> IN THE LORD, and has nothing apart from him. And what else is
this, but that by pure doctrine he puts Christ in his own seat, that he may be
the only Lord and Master?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With
love.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Others render it BY <i>love;</i> for Paul
says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
love</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which, according to the Hebrew idiom, is
equivalent to <i>by</i> or <i>with</i>. I prefer, however, to explain it
thus&#8212;as meaning that he exhorts them not merely to respect them, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc120</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
also love them. For as the doctrine of the gospel is lovely, so it is befitting
that the ministers of it should be loved. It were, however, rather stiff to
speak of <i>having in esteem </i>BY <i>love</i>, while the connecting together
of love with honor suits well.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be at
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">. While this passage has various readings,
even among the Greeks, I approve rather of the rendering which has been given by
the old translator, and is followed by Erasmus&#8212;<i>Pacem habete cum eis,
vel colite</i>&#8212;(<i>Have or cultivate peace with them</i>.) 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc121</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
Paul, in my opinion, had in view to oppose the artifices of Satan, who ceases
not to use every endeavor to stir up either quarrels, or disagreements, or
enmities, between people and pastor. Hence we see daily how pastors are hated by
their Churches for some trivial reason, or for no reason whatever, because this
desire for the cultivation of peace, which Paul recommends so strongly, is not
exercised as it ought.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Admonish the
unruly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is a common doctrine&#8212;that the
welfare of our brethren should be the object of our concern. This is done by
<i>teaching</i>, admonishing, correcting, and arousing; but, as the dispositions
of men are various, it is not without good reason that the Apostle commands that
believers accommodate themselves to this variety. He commands, therefore, that
the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unruly</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc122</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> be
admonished, that is, those who <i>live dissolutely</i>. The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>admonition</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
also, is employed to mean sharp reproof, such as may bring them back into the
right way, for they are deserving of greater severity, and they cannot be
brought to repentance by any other remedy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Towards the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faint-hearted</i></font><font face="Palatino">
another system of conduct must be pursued, for they have need of consolation.
The <i>weak</i> must also be assisted. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faint-hearted,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">however, he means those that are of a broken
and afflicted spirit. He accordingly favors them, and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>weak</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
in such a way as to desire that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unruly
</i></font><font face="Palatino">should be restrained with some degree of
sternness. On the other hand, he commands that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unruly
</i></font><font face="Palatino">should be admonished sharply, in order that the
weak may be treated with kindness and humanity, and that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faint-hearted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>may receive consolation. It is therefore to no purpose that those that are
obstinate and intractable demand that they be soothingly caressed, inasmuch as
remedies must be adapted to diseases.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He recommends, however,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>patience towards
all</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for severity must be tempered with some
degree of lenity, even in dealing with the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unruly</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
This
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>patience</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
however, is, properly speaking, contrasted with a feeling of irksomeness, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc123</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for
nothing are we more prone to than to feel wearied out when we set ourselves to
cure the diseases of our brethren. The man who has once and again comforted a
person who is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faint-hearted</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
if he is called to do the same thing a third time, will feel I know not what
vexation, nay, even indignation, that will not permit him to persevere in
discharging his duty. Thus, if by admonishing or reproving, we do not
immediately do the good that is to be desired, we lose all hope of future
success. Paul had in view to bridle impatience of this nature, by recommending
to us moderation towards all.</font><br></div>

See that no one render evil for evil</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As it is
difficult to observe this precept, in consequence of the strong bent of our
nature to revenge, he on this account bids us take care to be on our guard. For
the word <i>see</i> denotes anxious care. Now, although he simply forbids us to
strive with each other in the way of inflicting injuries, there can,
nevertheless, be no doubt that he meant to condemn, at the same time, every
disposition to do injury. For if it is unlawful to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>render evil for
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino">, every disposition to injure is culpable.
This doctrine is peculiar to Christians&#8212;not to retaliate injuries, but to
endure them patiently. And lest the Thessalonians should think that revenge was
prohibited only towards their brethren, he expressly declares that they are to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do evil to no
one</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For particular excuses are wont to be
brought forward in some cases. &#8220;What! why should it be unlawful for me to
avenge myself on one that is so worthless, so wicked, and so cruel?&#8221; But
as vengeance is forbidden us in every case, without exception, however wicked
the man that has injured us may be, we must refrain from inflicting
injury.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But always follow
benignity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this last clause he teaches that
we must not merely refrain from inflicting vengeance, when any one has injured
us, but must cultivate beneficence towards all. For although he means that it
should in the first instance be exercised among believers mutually, he
afterwards extends it to all, however undeserving of it, that we may make it our
aim to <i>overcome evil with good</i>, as he himself teaches elsewhere.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:21) The first step, therefore, in the exercise of patience, is, not to
revenge injuries; the second is, to bestow favors even upon
enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rejoice
always</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I refer this to moderation of spirit,
when the mind keeps itself in calmness under adversity, and does not give
indulgence to grief. I accordingly connect together these three things&#8212;to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rejoice always, to pray without
ceasing, and to give thanks to God in</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>all things. For when he recommends constant praying, he points out the way
of rejoicing perpetually, for by this means we ask from God alleviation in
connection with all our distresses. In like manner, in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:4, having said, </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say,
Rejoice. Let your moderation be known to all. Be not anxious as to anything. The
Lord is at hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards points out the means of
this&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">but in every prayer let
your requests be made known to God, with giving of thanks. </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In that passage, as we see, he presents as a source
of joy a calm and composed mind, that is not unduly disturbed by injuries or
adversities. But lest we should be borne down by grief, sorrow, anxiety, and
fear, he bids us repose in the providence of God. And as doubts frequently
obtrude themselves as to whether God cares for us, he also prescribes the
remedy&#8212;that by prayer we disburden our anxieties, as it were, into his
bosom, as David commands us to do in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
37:5 and
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
55:22; and Peter also, after his example.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:7.) As, however, we are unduly precipitate in our desires, he imposes a
check upon them&#8212;that, while we desire what we are in need of, we at the
same time do not cease to give thanks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He observes, here, almost the same order, though in
fewer words. For, in the first place, he would have us hold God&#8217;s benefits
in such esteem, that the recognition of them and meditation upon them shall
overcome all sorrow. And, unquestionably, if we consider what Christ has
conferred upon us, there will be no bitterness of grief so intense as may not be
alleviated, and give way to spiritual joy. For if this joy does not reign in us,
the kingdom of God is at the same time banished from us, or we from it. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc124</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
very ungrateful is that man to God, who does not set so high a value on the
righteousness of Christ and the hope of eternal life, as to rejoice in the midst
of sorrow. As, however, our minds are easily dispirited, until they give way to
impatience, we must observe the remedy that he subjoins immediately afterwards.
For on being cast down and laid low we are raised up again by prayers, because
we lay upon God what burdened us. As, however, there are every day, nay, every
moment, many things that may disturb our peace, and mar our joy, he for this
reason bids us <i>pray without ceasing</i>. Now, as to this constancy in prayer,
we have spoken of elsewhere. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc125</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>Thanksgiving</i>, as I have said, is added as a limitation. For many pray in
such a manner, as at the same time to murmur against God, and fret themselves if
he does not immediately gratify their wishes. But, on the contrary, it is
befitting that our desires should be restrained in such a manner that, contented
with what is given us, we always mingle thanksgiving with our desires. We may
lawfully, it is true, ask, nay, sigh and lament, but it must be in such a way
that the will of God is more acceptable to us than our own.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this is the will of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8212;that is, according to
Chrysostom&#8217;s opinion&#8212;that we <i>give thanks</i>. As for myself, I am
of opinion that a more ample meaning is included under these terms&#8212;that
God has such a disposition towards us in Christ, that even in our afflictions we
have large occasion of thanksgiving. For what is fitter or more suitable for
pacifying us, than when we learn that God embraces us in Christ so tenderly,
that he turns to our advantage and welfare everything that befalls us? Let us,
therefore, bear in mind, that this is a special remedy for correcting our
impatience&#8212;to turn away our eyes from beholding present evils that torment
us, and to direct our views to a consideration of a different nature&#8212;how
God stands affected towards us in Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Quench not the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This metaphor is derived from the power
and nature of the Spirit; for as it is the proper office of the Spirit to
illuminate the understandings of men, and as he is on this account called our
light, it is with propriety that we are said to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quench
</i></font><font face="Palatino">him, when we make void his grace. There are
some that think that it is the same thing that is said in this clause and the
succeeding one. Hence, according to them, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quench the Spirit
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is precisely the same as to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>despise
prophesyings</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As, however, the Spirit is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quenched</i></font><font face="Palatino">
in various ways, I make a distinction between these two things&#8212;that of a
<i>general</i> statement, and a <i>particular</i>. For although
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>contempt of
prophesying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quenching of the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">, yet those also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quench the Spirit
</i></font><font face="Palatino">who, instead of stirring up, as they ought,
more and more, by daily progress, the sparks that God has kindled in them, do,
by their negligence, make void the gifts of God. This admonition, therefore, as
to not </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quenching the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">, has a wider extent of meaning than the
one that follows as to not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>despising
prophesyings</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The meaning of the <i>former</i>
is: &#8220;Be enlightened by the Spirit of God. See that you do not lose that
light through your ingratitude.&#8221; This is an exceedingly useful admonition,
for we see that those who have been <i>once enlightened</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
6:4) when they reject so precious a gift of God, or, shutting their eves, allow
themselves to be hurried away after the vanity of the world, are struck with a
dreadful blindness, so as to be an example to others. We must, therefore, be on
our guard against indolence, by which the light of God is choked in
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Those, however, who infer from this that it is in
man&#8217;s option either to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quench</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or to <i>cherish</i> the light that is presented to him, so that they detract
from the efficacy of grace, and extol the powers of free will, reason on false
grounds. For although God works efficaciously in his elect, and does not merely
present the light to them, but causes them to see, opens the eyes of their
heart, and keeps them open, yet as the flesh is always inclined to indolence, it
has need of being stirred up by exhortations. But what God commands by
Paul&#8217;s mouth, He himself accomplishes inwardly. In the mean time, it is
our part to ask from the Lord, that he would furnish oil to the lamps which he
has lighted up, that he may keep the wick pure, and may even increase
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Despise not
prophesyings</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This sentence is appropriately
added to the preceding one, for as the Spirit of God illuminates us chiefly by
doctrine, those who give not teaching its proper place, do, so far as in them
lies, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quench the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for we must always consider in what
manner or by what means God designs to communicate himself to us. Let every one,
therefore, who is desirous to make progress under the direction of the Holy
Spirit, allow himself to be taught by the ministry of prophets.</font><br></div>

Corinthians 14:3, the science of interpreting Scripture, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc126</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so
that a <i>prophet</i> is an interpreter of the will of God. For Paul, in the
passage which I have quoted, assigns to <i>prophets teaching for edification,
exhortation</i>, and <i>consolation</i>, and enumerates, as it were, these
departments. Let, therefore, prophecy in this passage be understood as
meaning&#8212;interpretation made suitable to present use.

prohibits us from <i>despising</i> it, if we would not choose of our own accord
to wander in darkness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The statement, however, is a remarkable one, for the
commendation of external preaching. It is the dream of fanatics, that those are
children who continue to employ themselves in the reading of the Scripture, or
the hearing of the word, as if no one were spiritual, unless he is a despiser of
doctrine. They proudly, therefore, despise the ministry of man, nay, even
Scripture itself, that they may attain the Spirit. Farther, whatever delusions
Satan suggests to them, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc128</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they
presumptuously set forth as secret revelations of the Spirit. Such are the
Libertines, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc129</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
other furies of that stamp. And the more ignorant that any one is, he is puffed
up and swollen out with so much the greater arrogance. Let us, however, learn
from the example of Paul, to conjoin the Spirit with the voice of men, which is
nothing else than his organ.

frequently pass off their trifles under the name of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophecy,
prophecy</i></font><font face="Palatino"> might by this means be rendered
suspicious or even odious, just as many in the present day feel almost disgusted
with the very name of <i>preaching</i>, as there are so many foolish and

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc131</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> while

therefore, through the fault of such persons it might be, that <i>prophecy</i>
was regarded with disdain, nay more, was scarcely allowed to hold a place, Paul
exhorts the Thessalonians to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prove all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">, meaning, that although all do not speak
precisely according to set rule, we must, nevertheless, form a judgment, before
any doctrine is condemned or rejected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to this, there is a twofold error that is wont to
be fallen into, for there are some who, from having either been deceived by a
false pretext of the name of God, or from their knowing that many are commonly
deceived in this way, reject every kind of doctrine indiscriminately, while
there are others that by a foolish credulity embrace, without distinction,
everything that is presented to them in the name of God. Both of these ways are
faulty, for the former class, saturated with a presumptuous prejudice of that
nature, close up the way against their making progress, while the other class
rashly expose themselves to all <i>winds</i> of errors.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:14) Paul admonishes the Thessalonians to keep the middle path between these
two extremes, while he prohibits them from condemning anything without first
examining it; and, on the other hand, he admonishes them to exercise judgment,
before receiving, what may be brought forward, as undoubted truth. And
unquestionably, this respect, at least, ought to be shewn to the name of
God&#8212;that we do not </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>despise
prophecy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which is declared to have proceeded
from him. As, however, examination or discrimination ought to precede rejection,
so it must, also, precede the reception of true and sound doctrine. For it does
not become the pious to shew such lightness, as indiscriminately to lay hold of
what is false equally with what is true. From this we infer, that they have the
spirit of judgment conferred upon them by God, that they may discriminate, so as
not to be imposed upon by the impostures of men. For if they were not endowed
with discrimination, it were in vain that Paul
said&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prove: hold fast that
which is good</i></font><font face="Palatino">. If, however, we feel that we are
left destitute of the power of <i>proving</i> aright; it must be sought by us
from the same Spirit, who speaks by his prophets. But the Lord declares in this
place by the mouth of Paul, that the course of doctrine ought not, by any faults
of mankind, or by any rashness, or ignorance, or, in fine, by any abuse, to be
hindered from being always in a vigorous state in the Church. For as the
abolition of prophecy is the ruin of the Church, let us allow heaven and earth
to be commingled, rather than that prophecy should cease.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul, however, may seem here to give too great
liberty in teaching, when he would have
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all things
proved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> ;</i> for things must be heard by us,
that they may be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>proved</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and by this means a door would be opened to impostors for disseminating their
falsehoods. I answer, that in this instance he does not by any means require
that an audience should be given to false teachers, whose <i>mouth</i> he
elsewhere teaches
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;560111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:11) <i>must be stopped</i>, and whom he so rigidly shuts out, and does not by
any means set aside the arrangement, which he elsewhere recommends so highly
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:2) in the election of teachers. As, however, so great diligence can
never be exercised as that there should not sometimes be persons prophesying,
who are not so well instructed as they ought to be, and that sometimes good and
pious teachers fail to hit the mark, he requires such moderation on the part of
believers, as, nevertheless, not to refuse to hear. For nothing is more
dangerous, than that moroseness, by which every kind of doctrine is rendered
disgusting to us, while we do not allow ourselves to <i>prove</i> what is right.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From every evil
appearance</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some think that this is a universal
statement, as though he commanded to abstain from all things that bear upon
their front an </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>appearance of
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In that case the meaning would be, that
it is not enough to have an internal testimony of conscience, unless regard be
at the same time had to brethren, so as to provide against occasions of offense,
by avoiding every thing that can have the appearance of evil.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Those who explain the word <i>speciem</i> after the
manner of dialecticians as meaning the subdivision of a general term, fall into
an exceedingly gross blunder. For he 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc134</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> has
employed the term <i>speciem</i> as meaning what we commonly term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>appearance</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
It may also be rendered either&#8212;<i>evil appearance</i>, or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>appearance of
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The meaning, however, is the same. I
rather prefer Chrysostom and Ambrose, who connect this sentence with the
foregoing one. At the same time, neither of them explains Paul&#8217;s meaning,
and perhaps have not altogether hit upon what he intends. I shall state briefly
my view of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the first place, the phrase
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>appearance of
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>evil
appearance</i></font><font face="Palatino">, I understand to mean&#8212;when
falsity of doctrine has not yet been discovered in such a manner, that it can on
good grounds be rejected; but at the same time an unhappy suspicion is left upon
the mind, and fears are entertained, lest there should be some poison lurking.
He, accordingly, commands us to abstain from that kind of doctrine, which has an
appearance of being evil, though it is not really so&#8212;not that he allows
that it should be altogether rejected, but inasmuch as it ought not to be
received, or to obtain belief. For why has he previously commanded that <i>what
is good </i>should be <i>held fast</i>, while he now desires that we should
<i>abstain</i> not simply from evil, but from <i>all
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>appearance of
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>It is for this reason, that, when
truth has been brought to light by careful examination, it is assuredly becoming
in that case to give credit to it. When, on the other hand, there is any fear of
false doctrine, or when the mind is involved in doubt, it is proper in that case
to retreat, or to suspend our step, as they say, lest we should receive anything
with a doubtful and perplexed conscience. In short, he shews us in what way
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophecy</i></font><font face="Palatino">
will be useful to us without any danger&#8212;in the event of our being
attentive in </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>proving all

haste.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now the God of peace
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Having given various injunctions, he
now proceeds to prayer. And unquestionably doctrine is disseminated in vain, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc135</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> unless
God implant it in our minds. From this we see how preposterously those act who
measure the strength of men by the precepts of God. Paul, accordingly, knowing
that all doctrine is useless until God engraves it, as it were, with his own
finger upon our hearts, beseeches God that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctify
</i></font><font face="Palatino">the Thessalonians. Why he calls him here the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God of
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">, I do not altogether apprehend, unless
you choose to refer it to what goes before, where he makes mention of brotherly
agreement, and patience, and equanimity. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc136</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We know, however, that under the term
<i>sanctification</i> is included the entire renovation of the man. The
Thessalonians, it is true, had been in part renewed, but Paul desires that God
would perfect what is remaining. From this we infer, that we must, during our
whole life, make progress in the pursuit of holiness. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc137</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But if
it is the part of God to renew the whole man, there is nothing left for free
will. For if it had been our part to co&#8212;operate with God, Paul would have
spoken thus&#8212;&#8221;May God aid or promote your sanctification.&#8221; But
when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctify you
wholly</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he makes him the sole Author of the
entire work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And your entire
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is added by way of exposition,
that we may know what the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctification of the whole
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is, when he is kept <i>entire</i>, or pure,
and unpolluted, in spirit, soul, and body, until the day of Christ. As, however,
so complete an entireness is never to be met with in this life, it is befitting
that some progress be daily made in purity, and something be cleansed away from
our pollutions, so long as we live in the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must notice, however, this division of the
constituent parts of a man; for in some instances a man is said to consist
simply of <i>body</i> and <i>soul</i>, and in that case the term <i>soul</i>
denotes the immortal spirit, which resides in the body as in a dwelling. As the
<i>soul</i>, however, has two principal faculties&#8212;the understanding and
the will&#8212;the Scripture is accustomed in some cases to mention these two
things separately, when designing to express the power and nature of the <i>soul
;</i> but in that case the term <i>soul</i> is employed to mean the seat of the
affections, so that it is the part that is opposed to the <i>spirit</i>. Hence,
when we find mention made here of the term <i>spirit</i>, let us understand it
as denoting reason or intelligence, as on the other hand by the term soul, is
meant the will and all the affections.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I am aware that many explain Paul&#8217;s words
otherwise, for they are of opinion that by the term <i>soul</i> is meant vital
motion, and by the <i>spirit</i> is meant that part of man which has been
renewed; but in that case Paul&#8217;s prayer were absurd. Besides, it is in
another way, as I have said, that the term is wont to be made use of in
Scripture. When Isaiah says, </font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;My SOUL hath
desired thee in the night, my SPIRIT hath thought of thee,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
26:9)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">no one doubts that he speaks of his understanding and
affection, and thus enumerates two departments of the <i>soul</i>. These two
terms are conjoined in the Psalms in the same sense. This, also, corresponds
better with Paul&#8217;s statement. For how is the whole man <i>entire</i>,
except when his thoughts are pure and holy, when all his affections are right
and properly regulated, when, in fine, the body itself lays out its endeavors
and services only in good works? For the faculty of understanding is held by
philosophers to be, as it were, a mistress: the affections occupy a middle place
for commanding; the body renders obedience. We see now how well everything
corresponds. For then is the man pure and entire, when he thinks nothing in his
mind, desires nothing in his heart, does nothing with his body, except what is
approved by God. As, however, Paul in this manner commits to God the keeping of
the whole man, and all its parts, we must infer from this that we are exposed to
innumerable dangers, unless we are protected by his
guardianship.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Faithful is he that hath called
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As he has shewn by his prayer what care he
exercised as to the welfare of the Thessalonians, so he now confirms them in an
assurance of Divine grace. Observe, however, by what argument he promises them
the never&#8212;failing aid of God&#8212;because he has <i>called</i> them; by
which words he means, that when the Lord has once adopted us as his sons, we may
expect that his grace will continue to be exercised towards us. For he does not
promise to be a Father to us merely for one day, but adopts us with this
understanding, that he is to cherish us ever afterwards. Hence our
<i>calling</i> ought to be held by us as an evidence of everlasting grace, for
he <i>will not leave the work of his hands incomplete</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
138:8) Paul, however, addresses believers, who had not been merely called by
outward preaching, but had been effectually brought by Christ to the Father,
that they might be of the number of his sons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Salute all the brethren with an
holy kiss</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As to the <i>kiss</i>, it was a
customary token of salutation, as has been stated elsewhere. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc138</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
these words, however, he declares his affection towards all the

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I adjure you by the

as often happened, spiteful and envious persons would suppress the Epistle, or
whether he wished to provide against another danger&#8212;lest by a mistaken
prudence and caution on the part of some, it should be kept among a few. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fc139</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
there will always be found some who say that it is of no advantage to publish
generally things that otherwise they recognize as very excellent. At least,
whatever artifice or pretext Satan may have at that time contrived, in order
that the Epistle might not come to the knowledge of all, we may gather from
Paul&#8217;s words with what earnestness and keenness he sets himself in
opposition to it. For it is no light or frivolous thing to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>adjure by the name of
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We find, therefore, that the Spirit of God
would have those things which he had set forth in this Epistle, through the
ministry of Paul, to be published throughout the whole Church. Hence it appears,
that those are more refractory than even devils themselves, who in the present
day prohibit the people of God from reading the writings of Paul, inasmuch as
they are no way moved by so strict an adjuration.</font><br></div>

and in giving advice. But more especially in either restoring or establishing my
own health, I have observed you to be so carefully intent, that it was easy to
perceive that you were influenced not so much by regard to a particular
individual, as by anxiety and concern for the common welfare of the Church.
Another, perhaps, might think, that the kindness was smaller from its not having
been shewn simply to himself as an individual; but as for me, I think myself on
the contrary to be under a double obligation to you, on the ground, that while
you omitted nothing whatever in discharging the office of a friend, you were at
the same time equally concerned as to my ministry, too, which ought to be dearer
to me than my life. The remembrance, besides, of my departed wife reminds me
daily how much I owe you, not only because she was frequently through your
assistance raised up, and was in one instance restored from a serious and
dangerous distemper, but that even in that last disease, which took her away
from us, you left nothing undone in the way of industry, labor, and effort, with
a view to her assistance. Farther, as you do not allow me to give you any other
remuneration, I have thought of inscribing your name upon this Commentary, in

EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">IT does not appear to me probable that this Epistle
was sent from ROME, as the Greek manuscripts commonly bear; for he would have
made some mention of his bonds, as he is accustomed to do in other Epistles.
Besides, about the end of the third Chapter, he intimates that he is in danger
from unreasonable<b>

From this it may be gathered, that when he was going to Jerusalem, he wrote this
Epistle in the course of the journey. It was also from an ancient date a very
generally received opinion among the Latins, that it was written at ATHENS. The
occasion, however, of his writing was this&#8212;that the THESSALONIANS might
not reckon themselves overlooked, because Paul had not visited them, when
hastening to another quarter. In the <i>first Chapter</i>, he exhorts them to
patience. In the <i>second</i>, a vain and groundless fancy, which had got into
circulation as to the coming of Christ being at hand, is set aside by him by
means of this argument&#8212;that there must previously to that be a revolt in
the Church, and a great part of the world must treacherously draw back from God,
nay more, that Antichrist must reign in the temple of God. In the <i>third
Chapter</i>, after having commended himself to their prayers, and having in a
few words encouraged them to perseverance, he commands that those be severely
chastised who live in idleness at the expense of others. If they do not obey
admonitions, he teaches that they should be excommunicated.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the Church of the
Thessalonians which is in God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As to the form
of salutation, it were superfluous to speak. This only it is necessary to
notice&#8212;that by a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Church in
God and Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is meant one that has not
merely been gathered together under the banner of faith, for the purpose of
worshipping one God the Father, and confiding in Christ, but is the work and
building as well of the Father as of Christ, because while God adopts us to
himself, and regenerates us, we from him begin to be in Christ.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460130&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:30)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To give
thanks</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He begins with commendation, that he
may have occasion to pass on to exhortation, for in this way we have more
success among those who have already entered upon the course, when without
passing over in silence their former progress, we remind them how far distant
they are as yet from the goal, and stir them up to make progress. As, however,
he had in the former Epistle commended their faith and love, he now declares the
increase of both. And, unquestionably, this course ought to be pursued by all
the pious&#8212;to examine themselves daily, and see how far they have advanced.
This, therefore, is the true commendation of believers&#8212;their
<i>growing</i> daily in <i>faith</i> and <i>love</i>. When he says
<i>always</i>, he means that he is constantly supplied with new occasion. He had
previously given thanks to God on their account. He says that he has now
occasion to do so again, on the ground of daily progress. When, however, he
gives thanks to God on this account, he declares that the enlargements, no less
than the beginnings, of faith and love are from him, for if they proceeded from
the power of men, thanksgiving would be pretended, or at least worthless.
Farther, he shews that their proficiency was not trivial, or even ordinary, but
most abundant. So much the more disgraceful is our slowness, inasmuch as we
scarcely advance one foot during a long space of time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As is
meet</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In these words Paul shews that we are
bound to give thanks to God, not only when he does us good, but also when we
take into view the favors bestowed by him upon our brethren. For wherever the
goodness of God shines forth, it becomes us to extol it. Farther, the welfare of
our brethren ought to be so dear to us, that we ought to reckon among our own
benefits everything that has been conferred upon them. Nay more, if we consider
the nature and sacredness of the unity of Christ&#8217;s body, such a mutual
fellowship will have place among us, that we shall reckon the benefits conferred
upon an individual member as gain to the whole Church Hence, in extolling
God&#8217;s benefits, we must always have an eye to the whole body of the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So that we ourselves glory in
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He could not have bestowed higher
commendation upon them, than by saying that he sets them forward before other
Churches as a pattern, for such is the meaning of those
words:&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We glory in you in
the presence of other Churches</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For Paul did
not boast of the faith of the Thessalonians from a spirit of ambition, but
inasmuch as his commendation of them might be an incitement to make it their
endeavor to imitate them. He does not say, however, that he glories in their
faith and love, but in their <i>patience</i> and <i>faith</i>. Hence it follows,
that <i>patience</i> is the fruit and evidence of <i>faith</i>. These words
ought, therefore, to be explained in this manner:&#8212;&#8220;We glory in the
patience which springs from faith, and we bear witness that it eminently shines
forth in you;&#8221; otherwise the context would not correspond. And,
undoubtedly, there is nothing that sustains us in tribulations as faith does;
which is sufficiently manifest from this, that we altogether sink down so soon
as the promises of God leave us. Hence, the more proficiency any one makes in
faith, he will be so much the more endued with patience for enduring all things
with fortitude, as on the other hand, softness and impatience under adversity
betoken unbelief on our part; but more especially when persecutions are to be
endured for the gospel, the influence of faith in that case discovers
itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
A demonstration of the righteous judgment of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Without mentioning the exposition given by
others, I am of opinion that the true meaning is this&#8212;that the injuries
and persecutions which innocent and pious persons endure from the wicked and
abandoned, shew clearly, as in a mirror, that God will one day be the judge of
the world. And this statement is quite at antipodes with that profane notion,
which we are accustomed to entertain, whenever it goes well with the good and
ill with the wicked. For we think that the world is under the regulation of mere
chance, and we leave God no control. Hence it is that impiety and contempt take
possession of men&#8217;s hearts, as Solomon speaks,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;210903&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ecclesiastes
9:3) for those that suffer anything undeservedly either throw the blame upon
God, or do not think that he concerns himself as to the affairs of men. We hear
what Ovid says,&#8212;&#8220;I am tempted to think that there are no
gods.&#8221;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Nay
more, David confesses
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;197301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
73:1-12) that, because he saw things in so confused a state in the world, he had
well&#8212;nigh lost his footing, as in a slippery place. On the other hand, the
wicked become more insolent through occasion of prosperity, as if no punishment
of their crimes awaited them; just as Dionysius, when making a prosperous
voyage,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
boasted that the gods favored the sacrilegious.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
fine, when we see that the cruelty of the wicked against the innocent walks
abroad with impunity, carnal sense concludes that there is no judgment of God,
that there are no punishments of the wicked, that there is no reward of
righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul, however, declares on the other hand, that as
God thus spares the wicked for a time, and winks at the injuries inflicted upon
his people, His judgment to come is shewn us as in a mirror. For he takes for
granted that it cannot but be that God, inasmuch as he is a just Judge, will one
day restore peace to the miserable, who are now unjustly harassed, and will pay
to the oppressors of the pious the reward that they have merited. Hence, if we
hold this principle of faith, that God is the just Judge of the world, and that
it is his office to render to every one a recompense according to his works,
this second principle will follow incontrovertibly &#8212; that the present
<i>disorderly state of matters
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajtaxi&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">)
is a <i>demonstration</i> of the judgment, which does not yet appear. For if God
is the righteous Judge of the world, those things that are now confused must, of
necessity, be restored to order. Now, nothing is more disorderly than that the
wicked, with impunity, give molestation to the good, and walk abroad with
unbridled violence, while the good are cruelly harassed without any fault on
their part. From this it may be readily inferred, that God will one day ascend
the judgment&#8212;seat, that he may remedy the state of matters in the world,
so as to bring them into a better condition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence the statement which he subjoins&#8212;that it
is </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteous with God to appoint
affliction</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc., is the groundwork of this
doctrine&#8212;that God furnishes tokens of a judgment to come when he refrains,
for the present, from exercising the office of judge. And unquestionably, if
matters were now arranged in a tolerable way, so that the judgment of God might
be recognized as having been fully exercised, an adjustment of this nature would
detain us upon earth. Hence God, in order that he may stir us up to the hope of
a judgment to come, does, for the present, only to some extent judge the world.
He furnishes, it is true, many tokens of his judgment, but it is in such a
manner as to constrain us to extend our hope farther. A remarkable passage
truly, as teaching us in what manner our minds ought to be raised up above all
the impediments of the world, whenever we suffer any adversity&#8212;that the
righteous judgment of God may present itself to our mind, which will raise us
above this world. Thus death will be an image of life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>May be accounted
worthy</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There are no persecutions that are to
be reckoned of such value as to make us
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>worthy of the kingdom of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, nor does Paul dispute here as to the
ground of worthiness, but simply takes the common doctrine of
Scripture&#8212;that God destroys in us those things that are of the world, that
he may restore in us a better life; and farther, that by means of afflictions he
shews us the value of eternal life. In short, he simply points out the manner in
which believers are prepared and, as it were, polished under God&#8217;s anvil,
inasmuch as, by afflictions, they are taught to renounce the world and to aim at
God&#8217;s heavenly kingdom. Farther, they are confirmed in the hope of eternal
life while they fight for it. For this is the entrance of which Christ
discoursed to his disciples.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
7:13;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
13:24)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To appoint
affliction</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We have already stated why it is
that he makes mention of the vengeance of God against the wicked&#8212;that we
may learn to rest in the expectation of a judgment to come, because God does not
as yet avenge the wicked, while it is, nevertheless, necessary that they should
suffer the punishment of their crimes. Believers, however, at the same time,
understand by this that there is no reason why they should envy the momentary
and evanescent felicity of the wicked, which will ere long be exchanged for a
dreadful destruction. What he adds as to the <i>rest</i> of the pious, accords
with the statement of Paul,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440320&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
3:20,) where he calls the day of the last judgment the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>day of
refreshing</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this declaration, however, as to the good and the
bad, he designed to shew more clearly how unjust and confused the government of
the world would be, if God did not defer punishments and rewards till another
judgment, for in this way the name of God were a thing that was dead.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd5</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence he is deprived of his office and power by all that are not intent on that
righteousness of which Paul speaks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that he may gain credit to his doctrine
from his experience of belief in his own mind; for he shews that he does not
philosophize as to things unknown, by putting himself into the same condition,
and into the same rank with them. We know, however, how much more authority is
due to those who have, by long practice, been exercised in those things which
they teach, and do not require from others anything but what they are themselves
prepared to do. Paul, therefore, does not, while himself in the shade, give
instructions to the Thessalonians as to how they should fight in the heat of the
sun, but, fighting vigorously, exhorts them to the same warfare.<b>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the Lord shall be
manifested</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here we have a confirmation of the
foregoing statement. For as it is one of the articles of our faith, that Christ
will come from heaven, and will not come in vain, faith ought to seek the end of
his coming. Now this is&#8212;that he may come as a Redeemer to his own people;
nay more, that he may judge the whole world. The description which follows has a
view to this&#8212;that the pious may understand that God is so much the more
concerned as to their afflictions in proportion to the dreadfulness of the
judgment that awaits his enemies. For the chief occasion of grief and distress
is this&#8212;that we think that God is but lightly affected with our
calamities. We see into what complaints David from time to time breaks forth,
while he is consumed by the pride and insolence of his enemies. Hence he has
brought forward all this for the consolation of believers, while he represents
the tribunal of Christ as full of horror,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
they may not be disheartened by their present oppressed condition, while they
see themselves proudly and disdainfully trampled upon by the
wicked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What is to be the nature of that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fire</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and of what materials, I leave to the disputations of persons of foolish
curiosity. I am contented with holding what Paul had it in view to
teach&#8212;that Christ will be a most strict avenger of the injuries which the
wicked inflict upon us. The metaphor, however, of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flame
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fire</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
is abundantly common in Scripture, when the anger of God is treated
of.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>angels of his
power</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means those in whom he will exercise
his power; for he will bring the angels with him for the purpose of displaying
the glory of his kingdom. Hence, too, they are elsewhere called the <i>angels of
his majesty</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who will inflict
vengeance</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That he may the better persuade
believers that the persecutions which they endure will not go unpunished, he
teaches that this also involves the interests of God himself, inasmuch as the
same persons that persecute the pious are guilty of rebellion against God. Hence
it is necessary that God should inflict vengeance upon them not merely with a
view to our salvation, but also for the sake of his own glory. Farther, this
expression, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who will inflict
vengeance</i></font><font face="Palatino">, relates to Christ, for Paul
intimates that this office is assigned to him by God the Father. It may be
asked, however, whether it is lawful for us to desire vengeance, for Paul
promises it, as though it could be lawfully desired. I answer, that it is not
lawful to desire vengeance upon any one, inasmuch as we are commanded to wish
well to all. Besides, although we may in a general way desire vengeance upon the
wicked, yet, as we do not as yet discriminate them, we ought to desire the
welfare of all. In the mean time, the ruin of the wicked may be lawfully looked
forward to with desire, provided there reigns in our hearts a pure and duly
regulated zeal for God, and there is no feeling of inordinate
desire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who know
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He distinguishes unbelievers by these two
marks&#8212;that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know not
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>obey not the gospel of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For if obedience is not rendered to the
gospel through faith, as he teaches in the <i>first</i> and in the <i>last</i>
chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, unbelief is the occasion of resistance to
it. He charges them at the same time with ignorance of God, for a lively
acquaintance with God produces of itself reverence towards him. Hence unbelief
is always blind, not as though unbelievers were altogether devoid of light and
intelligence, but because they have the understanding darkened in such a manner,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seeing they do not
see.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:13.) It is not without good grounds that Christ declares that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this is life eternal, to know the
true God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431703&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
17:3.) Accordingly, from the want of this salutary knowledge, there follows
contempt of God, and in fine, death. On this point I have treated more fully in
commenting on the first chapter of First Corinthians.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd8</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.
Everlasting destruction from the face</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He
shews, by apposition, what is the nature of the punishment of which he had made
mention&#8212;destruction without end, and an undying death. The perpetuity of
the death is proved from the circumstance, that it has the glory of Christ as
its opposite. Now, this is eternal, and has no end. Accordingly, the influence
of that death will never cease. From this also the dreadful severity of the
punishment may be inferred, inasmuch as it will be great in proportion to the
glory and majesty of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
When he shall come to be sanctified</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As he has
hitherto discoursed as to the punishment of the wicked, he now returns to the
pious, and says that Christ will come, that he may be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glorified
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in them; that is, that he may irradiate them
with his glory, and that they may be partakers of it. &#8220;Christ will not
have this glory for himself individually; but it will be common to all the
saints.&#8221; This is the crowning and choice consolation of the pious, that
when the Son of God will be manifested in the glory of his kingdom, he will
gather them into the same fellowship with himself.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd9</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
There is, however, an implied contrast between the present condition in which
believers labor and groan, and that final restoration. For they are <i>now</i>
exposed to the reproaches of the world, and are looked upon as vile and
worthless; but <i>then</i> they will be precious, and full of dignity, when
Christ will pour forth his glory upon them. The end of this is, that the pious
may as it were, with closed eyes, pursue the brief journey of this earthly life,
having their minds always intent upon the future manifestation of Christ&#8217;s
kingdom. For to what purpose does he make mention of His coming in power, but in
order that they may in hope leap forward to that blessed resurrection which is
as yet hid?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is also to be observed, that after having made use

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On which account we pray
always</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That they may know that they need
continual help from God, he declares that he prays in their behalf. When he says
<i>on this account</i>, he means, in order that they may reach that final goal
of their course, as appears from the succeeding context,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he would fulfill all the
good pleasure</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc. It may seem, however, as if
what he has mentioned first were unnecessary, for God had already
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>accounted them worthy of his
calling</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He speaks, however, as to the end or
completion, which depends on perseverance. For as we are liable to give way, our
<i>calling</i> would not fail, so far as we are concerned, to prove sooner or
later vain, if God did not confirm it. Hence he is said to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>account us
worthy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, when he conducts us to the point at
which we aimed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
fulfill</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Paul goes to an amazing height in
extolling the grace of God, for not contenting himself with the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good
pleasure</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says that it flows from his
goodness, unless perhaps any one should prefer to consider the beneficence<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
arising from this </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good
pleasure</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which amounts to the same thing.
When, however, we are instructed that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gracious
purpose</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of God is the cause of our
salvation, and that <i>that</i> has its foundation in the <i>goodness</i> of the
same God, are we not worse than mad, if we venture to ascribe anything, however
small, to our own merits? For the words are in no small degree emphatic. He
might have said in one word, <i>that your faith may be fulfilled</i>, but he
terms it </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good
pleasure</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Farther, he expresses the idea still
more distinctly by saying, that God was prompted by nothing else than his own
goodness, for he finds nothing in us but misery.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor does Paul ascribe to the grace of God merely the
beginning of our salvation, but all departments of it. Thus that contrivance of
the Sophists is set aside, that we are, indeed, anticipated by the grace of God,
but that it is helped by subsequent merits. Paul, on the other hand, recognizes
in the whole progress of our salvation nothing but the pure grace of God. As,
however, the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good pleasure
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of God has been already accomplished in him,
referring in the term subsequently employed by him to the effect which appears
in us, he explains his meaning. when he
says&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and work of
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And he calls it a <i>work</i>, with
regard to God, who works or produces faith in us, as though he had
said&#8212;&#8221;that he may complete the building of faith which he has
begun.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, also, not without good reason, that he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with
power</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for he intimates that the perfecting of
faith is an arduous matter, and one of the greatest difficulty. This, also, we
know but too well from experience; and the reason, too, is not far to seek, if
we consider how great our weakness is, how various are the hindrances that
obstruct us on every side, and how severe are the assaults of Satan. Hence,
unless the power of God afford us help in no ordinary degree, faith will never
rise to its full height. For it is no easier task to bring faith to perfection
in an individual, than to rear upon water a tower that may by its firmness
withstand all storms and fury of tempests, and may surmount the clouds in
height, for we are not less fluid than water, and it is necessary that the
height of faith reach as high as heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ may be glorified</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He calls us back
to the chief end of our whole life&#8212;that we may promote the Lord&#8217;s
glory. What he adds, however, is more especially worthy of notice, that those
who have advanced the glory of Christ will also in their turn be glorified in
him. For in this, first of all, the wonderful goodness of God shines
forth&#8212;that he will have his glory be conspicuous in us who are covered
over with ignominy. This, however, is a twofold miracle, that he afterwards
irradiates us with his glory, as though he would do the same to us in return. On
this account he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according
to the grace of God and Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For there is
nothing here that is ours either in the action itself, or in the effect or
fruit, for it is solely by the guidance of the Holy Spirit that our life is made
to contribute to the glory of God. And the circumstance that so much fruit
arises from this ought to be ascribed to the great mercy of God. In the mean
time, if we are not worse than stupid, we must aim with all our might at the
advancement of the glory of Christ, which is connected with ours. I deem it
unnecessary to explain at present in what sense he represents the glory as
belonging to God and Christ in common, as I have explained this
elsewhere.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461531&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:31, when discoursing as to the hope of a resurrection, he makes
use of an oath by that <i>glory</i> which is to be hoped for by believers. And
this has much more efficacy when he adjures believers by the coming of Christ,
not to imagine rashly that his day is at hand, for he at the same time
admonishes us not to think of it but with reverence and sobriety. For it is
customary to adjure by those things which are regarded by us with reverence. The
meaning therefore is, &#8220;As you set a high value on the coming of Christ,
when he will gather us to himself, and will truly perfect that unity of the body
which we cherish as yet only in part through means of faith, so I earnestly
beseech you by his coming not to be too credulous, should any one affirm, on
whatever pretext, that his day is at hand.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As he had in his former Epistle adverted to some
extent to the resurrection, it is possible that some fickle and fanatical
persons took occasion from this to mark out a near and fixed day. For it is not
likely that this error had taken its rise earlier among the Thessalonians. For
Timothy, on returning thence, had informed Paul as to their entire condition,
and as a prudent and experienced man had omitted nothing that was of importance.
Now if Paul had received notice of it, he could not have been silent as to a
matter of so great consequence. Thus I am of opinion, that when Paul&#8217;s
Epistle had been read, which contained a lively view of the resurrection, some
that were disposed to indulge curiosity philosophized unseasonably as to the
time of it. This, however, was an utterly ruinous fancy,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
were also other things of the same nature, which were afterwards disseminated,
not without artifice on the part of Satan. For when any day is said to be
<i>near</i>, if it does not quickly arrive, mankind being naturally impatient of
longer delay, their spirits begin to languish, and that languishing is followed
up shortly afterwards by despair.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, therefore, was Satan&#8217;s subtlety: as he
could not openly overturn the hope of a resurrection with the view of secretly
undermining it, as if by pits underground,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
promised that the day of it would be near, and would soon arrive. Afterwards,
too, he did not cease to contrive various things, with the view of effacing, by
little and little, the belief of a resurrection from the minds of men, as he
could not openly eradicate it. It is, indeed, a plausible thing to say that the
day of our redemption is definitely fixed, and on this account it meets with
applause on the part of the multitude, as we see that the dreams of Lactantius
and the Chiliasts of old gave much delight, and yet they had no other tendency
than that of overthrowing the hope of a resurrection. This was not the design of
Lactantius, but Satan, in accordance with his subtlety, perverted his curiosity,
and that of those like him, so as to leave nothing in religion definite or
fixed, and even at the present day he does not cease to employ the same means.
We now see how necessary Paul&#8217;s admonition was, as but for this all
religion would have been overturned among the Thessalonians under a specious
pretext.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
That ye be not soon shaken in judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He
employs the term <i>judgment</i> to denote that settled faith which rests on
sound doctrine. Now, by means of that fancy which he rejects, they would have
been carried away as it were into ecstasy. He notices, also, three kinds of
imposture, as to which they must be on their guard&#8212;<i>spirit, word</i>,
and <i>spurious epistle</i>. By the term <i>spirit</i> he means pretended
prophecies, and it appears that this mode of speaking was common among the
pious, so that they applied the term <i>spirit</i> to prophesyings, with the
view of putting honor upon them. For, in order that prophecies may have due
authority, we must look to the Spirit of God rather than to men. But as the
devil is wont to <i>transform himself into an angel of light</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 11:14,) impostors stole this title, in order that they might impose
upon the simple. But although Paul could have striped them of this mask, he,
nevertheless, preferred to speak in this manner, by way of concession, as though
he had said, &#8220;However they may pretend to have the spirit of revelation,
believe them not.&#8221; John, in like manner, says: </font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Try the spirits,
whether they are of God.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
John 4:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speech</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
in my opinion, includes every kind of doctrine, while false teachers insist in
the way of reasons or conjectures, or other pretexts. What he adds as to
<i>epistle</i>, is an evidence that this impudence is ancient&#8212;that of
feigning the names of others.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> So
much the more wonderful is the mercy of God towards us, in that while
Paul&#8217;s name was on false grounds made use of in spurious writings, his
writings have, nevertheless, been preserved entire even to our times. This,
unquestionably, could not have taken place accidentally, or as the effect of
mere human industry, if God himself had not by his power restrained Satan and
all his ministers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As if the day of Christ were at
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This may seem to be at variance with many
passages of Scripture, in which the Spirit declares that that day is at hand.
But the solution is easy, for it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at hand
</i></font><font face="Palatino">with regard to God, with whom <i>one day is as
a thousand years</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;610308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

<div><font face="Palatino">On the other hand, those false prophets whom Paul
exposes, while they ought to have kept men&#8217;s minds in suspense, bid them
feel assured of his speedy advent, that they might not be wearied out with the
irksomeness of delay.</font><br></div>

Let no man deceive you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That they may not
groundlessly promise themselves the arrival in so short a time of the joyful day
of redemption, he presents to them a melancholy prediction as to the future
scattering of the Church. This discourse entirely corresponds with that which
Christ held in the presence of his disciples, when they had asked him respecting
the end of the world. For he exhorts them to prepare themselves for enduring
hard conflicts,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd15</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
24:6,) and after he has discoursed of the most grievous and previously unheard
of calamities, by which the earth was to be reduced almost to a desert, he adds,
that the <i>end is not yet</i>, but that <i>these things are the beginnings of
sorrows</i>. In the same way, Paul declares that believers must exercise warfare
for a long period, before gaining a triumph.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have here, however, a remarkable passage, and one
that is in the highest degree worthy of observation. This was a grievous and
dangerous temptation, which might shake even the most confirmed, and make them
loose their footing&#8212;to see the Church, which had by means of such labors
been raised up gradually and with difficulty to some considerable standing, fall
down suddenly, as if torn down by a tempest. Paul, accordingly, fortifies
beforehand the minds, not merely of the Thessalonians, but of all the pious,
that when the Church should come to be in a scattered condition, they might not
be alarmed, as though it were a thing that was new and unlooked
for.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, interpreters have twisted this passage
in various ways, we must first of all endeavor to ascertain Paul&#8217;s true
meaning. He says that the day of Christ will not come, until the world has
fallen into apostasy, and the reign of Antichrist has obtained a footing in the
Church; for as to the exposition that some have given of this passage, as
referring to the downfall of the Roman empire, it is too silly to require a
lengthened refutation. I am also surprised, that so many writers, in other
respects learned and acute, have fallen into a blunder in a matter that is so
easy, were it not that when one has committed a mistake, others follow in troops
without consideration. Paul, therefore, employs the term <i>apostasy</i> to
mean&#8212;a treacherous departure from God, and that not on the part of one or
a few individuals, but such as would spread itself far and wide among a large
multitude of persons. For when <i>apostasy</i> is made mention of without
anything being added, it cannot be restricted to a few. Now, none can be termed
<i>apostates</i>, but such as have previously made a profession of Christ and
the gospel. Paul, therefore, predicts a certain general revolt of the visible
Church. &#8220;The Church must be reduced to an unsightly and dreadful state of
ruin, before its full restoration be effected.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From this we may readily gather, how useful this
prediction of Paul is, for it might have seemed as though that could not be a
building of God, that was suddenly overthrown, and lay so long in ruins, had not
Paul long before intimated that it would be so. Nay more, many in the present
day, when they consider with themselves the long&#8212;continued dispersion of
the Church, begin to waver, as if this had not been regulated by the purpose of
God. The Romanists, also, with the view of justifying the tyranny of their idol,
make use of this pretext&#8212;that it was not possible that Christ would
forsake his spouse. The weak, however, have something here on which to rest,
when they learn that the unseemly state of matters which they behold in the
Church was long since foretold; while, on the other hand, the impudence of the
Romanists is openly exposed, inasmuch as Paul declares that a revolt will come,
when the world has been brought under Christ&#8217;s authority. Now, we shall
see presently, why it is that the Lord has permitted the Church, or at least
what appeared to be such, to fall off in so shameful a manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Has been
revealed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was no better than an old
wife&#8217;s fable that was contrived respecting Nero, that he was carried up
from the world, destined to return again to harass the Church<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by
his tyranny; and yet the minds of the ancients were so bewitched, that they
imagined that Nero would be Antichrist.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd17</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Paul, however, does not speak of one individual, but of a kingdom, that was to
be taken possession of by Satan, that he might set up a seat of abomination in
the midst of God&#8217;s temple&#8212;which we see accomplished in Popery. The
revolt, it is true, has spread more widely, for Mahomet, as he was an apostate,
turned away the Turks, his followers, from Christ. All heretics have broken the
unity of the Church by their sects, and thus there have been a corresponding
number of revolts from Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul, however, when he has given warning that there
would be such a scattering, that the greater part would revolt from Christ, adds
something more serious&#8212;that there would be such a confusion, that the
vicar of Satan would hold supreme power in the Church, and would preside there
in the place of God. Now he describes that reign of abomination under the name
of a single person, because it is only one reign, though one succeeds another.
My readers now understand, that all the sects by which the Church has been
lessened from the beginning, have been so many streams of revolt which began to
draw away the water from the right course, but that the sect of Mahomet was like
a violent bursting forth of water, that took away about the half of the Church
by its violence. It remained, also, that Antichrist should infect the remaining
part with his poison. Thus, we see with our own eyes, that this memorable
prediction of Paul has been confirmed by the event.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the exposition which I bring forward, there is
nothing forced. Believers in that age dreamed that they would be transported to
heaven, after having endured troubles during a short period. Paul, however, on
the other hand, foretells that, after they have had foreign enemies for some
time molesting them, they will have more evils to endure from enemies at home,
inasmuch as many of those that have made a profession of attachment to Christ
would be hurried away into base treachery, and inasmuch as the temple of God
itself would be polluted by sacrilegious tyranny, so that Christ&#8217;s
greatest enemy would exercise dominion there. The term <i>revelation</i> is
taken here to denote manifest possession of tyranny, as if Paul had said that
the day of Christ would not come until this tyrant had openly manifested
himself, and had, as it were, designedly overturned the whole order of the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>An adversary, and that exalteth
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The two
epithets&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>man of
sin</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>son of
perdition</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8212;intimate, in the first place,
how dreadful the confusion would be, that the unseemliness of it might not
discourage weak minds; and farther, they tend to stir up the pious to a feeling
of detestation, lest they should degenerate along with others. Paul, however,
now draws, as if in a picture, a striking likeness of Antichrist; for it may be
easily gathered from these words what is the nature of his kingdom, and in what
things it consists. For, when he calls him an <i>adversary</i>, when he says
that he will claim for himself those things which belong to God, so that he is
worshipped in the temple as God, he places his kingdom in direct opposition to
the kingdom of Christ. Hence, as the kingdom of Christ is spiritual, so this
tyranny must be upon souls, that it may rival the kingdom of Christ. We shall
also find him afterwards assigning to him the power of deceiving, by means of
wicked doctrines and pretended miracles. If, accordingly, you would know
Antichrist, you must view him as diametrically opposed to Christ.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd18</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Where I have rendered&#8212;<i>everything that is
called God</i>, the reading more generally received among the Greeks is,
<i>every one that is called</i>. It may, however, be conjectured, both from the
old translation<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
from some Greek commentaries, that Paul&#8217;s words have been corrupted. The
mistake, too, of a single letter was readily fallen into, especially when the
shape of the letter was much similar; for, where there was written
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pa~n
to&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>everything</i>,) some transcriber, or
too daring reader, turned it into
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pa&gt;nta</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>every one</i>.) This difference, however, is not of so much importance as to
the sense, for Paul undoubtedly means that Antichrist would take to himself
those things that belonged to God alone, so that he would <i>exalt himself</i>
above every divine claim, that all religion and all worship of God might lie
under his feet. This expression then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>everything that is reckoned to be
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is equivalent to <i>everything that is
reckoned as Divinity</i>, and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">se&gt;basma</font><font face="Palatino">,
that is, in which the veneration due to God consists.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, however, the subject treated of is not the name
of God himself, but his majesty and worship, and, in general, everything that he
claims for himself. &#8220;True religion is that by which the true God alone is
worshipped; <i>that</i>, the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>son
of perdition </i></font><font face="Palatino">will transfer to himself.&#8221;
Now, every one that has learned from Scripture what are the things that more
especially belong to God, and will, on the other hand, observe what the Pope
claims for himself&#8212;though he were but a boy of ten years of age&#8212;will
have no great difficulty in recognizing Antichrist. Scripture declares that God
is the <i>alone Lawgiver
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;590412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
4:12) <i>who is able to save and to destroy ;</i> the alone King, whose office
it is to govern souls by his word. It represents him as the author of all sacred
rites;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd20</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it
teaches that righteousness and salvation are to be sought from Christ alone; and
it assigns, at the same time, the manner and means. There is not one of these
things that the Pope does not affirm to be under his authority. He boasts that
it is his to bind consciences with such laws as seem good to him, and subject
them to everlasting punishment. As to sacraments, he either institutes new ones,
according to his own inclination,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or
he corrupts and deforms those which had been instituted by Christ&#8212;nay,
sets them aside altogether, that he may substitute in their place the
sacrileges<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd22</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which he has invented. He contrives means of attaining salvation that are
altogether at variance with the doctrine of the Gospel; and, in fine, he does
not hesitate to change the whole of religion at his own pleasure. What is it, I
pray you, for one to lift up himself above everything that is reckoned God, if
the Pope does not do so? When he thus robs God of his honor, he leaves him
nothing remaining but an empty title of Deity,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd23</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
while he transfers to himself the whole of his power. And this is what Paul adds
shortly afterwards, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the son
of perdition would shew himself as God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For, as
has been said, he does not insist upon the simple term <i>God</i>, but
intimates, that the pride<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of
Antichrist would be such, that, raising himself above the number and rank of
servants, and mounting the judgment&#8212;seat of God,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd25</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
would reign, not with a human, but with a divine authority. For we know that
whatever is raised up into the place of God is an idol, though it should not
bear the name of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the temple of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this one term there is a sufficient
refutation of the error, nay more, the stupidity of those who reckon the Pope to
be Vicar of Christ, on the ground that he has his seat in the Church, in
whatever manner he may conduct himself; for Paul places Antichrist nowhere else
than in the very sanctuary of God. For this is not a foreign, but a domestic
enemy, who opposes Christ under the very name of Christ. But it is asked, how
the Church is represented as the den of so many superstitions, while it was
destined to be the <i>pillar of the truth?</i>
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:15.) I answer, that it is thus represented, not on the ground of its
retaining all the qualities of the Church, but because it has something of it
remaining. I accordingly acknowledge, that that is the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>temple of God
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in which the Pope bears rule, but at the same
time profaned by innumerable sacrileges.</font><br></div>

the doctrine, that they had previously heard it from the mouth of Paul, that
they might not think that it had been contrived by him at the instant. And as he
had given them early warning as to the reign of Antichrist, and the devastation
that was coming upon the Church, when no question had as yet been raised as to
such things, he saw beyond all doubt that the doctrine was specially useful to
be known. And, unquestionably, it is really so. Those whom he addressed were
destined to see many things that would trouble them; and when posterity would
see a large proportion of those who had made profession of the faith of Christ
revolt from piety, maddened, as it were, by a gad-fly, or rather by a fury,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd26</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
what could they do but waver? This, however, was as a <i>brazen</i><b>

matters were so appointed by God, because the ingratitude of men<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd29</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was
worthy of such vengeance. Here we may see how forgetful men are in matters
affecting their everlasting salvation. We must also observe Paul&#8217;s
mildness; for while he might have been vehemently incensed,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
does but mildly reprove them; for it is a fatherly way of reproving them to say
to them, that they had allowed forgetfulness of a matter so important and so
useful to steal in upon their minds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.
And now what withholdeth</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">To&lt;
kate&gt;con</font><font face="Palatino"> means here properly an impediment or
occasion of delay. Chrysostom, who thinks that this can only be understood as
referring to the Spirit, or to the Roman Empire, prefers to lean to the latter
opinion. He assigns a plausible reason&#8212;because Paul would not have spoken
of the Spirit in enigmatical terms,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
in speaking of the Roman Empire wished to avoid exciting unpleasant feeling. He
states also the reason why the state of the Roman Empire retards the revelation
of Antichrist&#8212;that, as the monarchy of Babylon was overthrown by the
Persians and Medes, and the Macedonians, having conquered the Persians, again
took possession of the monarchy, and the Macedonians were at last subdued by the
Romans, so Antichrist seized hold for himself of the vacant supremacy of the
Roman Empire. There is not one of these things that was not afterwards confirmed
by actual occurrence. Chrysostom, therefore, speaks truly in so far as concerns
history. I am of opinion, however, that Paul&#8217;s intention was different
from this&#8212;that the doctrine of the gospel would require to be spread
hither and thither, until nearly the whole world were convicted of obstinacy and
deliberate malice. For there can be no doubt that the Thessalonians had heard
from Paul&#8217;s mouth as to this impediment, of whatever sort it was, for he
recalls to their remembrance what he had previously taught in their
presence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let my readers now consider which of the two is the
more probable&#8212;either that Paul declared that the light of the gospel must
be diffused through all parts of the earth before God would thus give loose
reins to Satan, or that the power of the Roman Empire stood in the way of the
rise of Antichrist, inasmuch as he could only break through into a vacant
possession. I seem at least to hear Paul discoursing as to the universal call of
the Gentiles&#8212;that the grace of God must be offered to all&#8212;that
Christ must enlighten the whole world by his gospel, in order that the impiety
of men might be the more fully attested and demonstrated. This, therefore, was
the delay, until the career of the gospel should be completed, because a
gracious invitation to salvation was first in order.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd32</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in his
time</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because vengeance was ripe after grace
had been rejected.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd33</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.
The mystery of iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is opposed to
<i>revelation ;</i> for as Satan had not yet gathered so much strength, as that
Antichrist could openly oppress the Church, he says that he is carrying on
secretly and clandestinely<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd34</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
what he would do openly in his own time. He was therefore at that time secretly
laying the foundations on which he would afterwards rear the edifice, as
actually took place. And this tends to confirm more fully what I have already
stated, that it is not one individual that is represented under the term
Antichrist, but one kingdom, which extends itself through many ages. In the same
sense, John says that Antichrist will come, but that there were already many in
his time.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 2:18.) For he admonishes those who were then living to be on their guard
against that deadly pestilence, which was at that time shooting up in various
forms. For sects were rising up which were the seeds, as it were, of that
unhappy weed which has well&#8212;nigh choked and destroyed God&#8217;s entire
tillage.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
although Paul conveys the idea of a secret manner of working, yet he has made
use of the term <i>mystery</i> rather than any other, alluding to the mystery of
salvation, of which he speaks elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:26,) for he carefully insists on the struggle of repugnancy between the Son of
God and this </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>son of
perdition</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Only now
withholding</i></font><font face="Palatino">. While he makes both statements in
reference to one person&#8212;that he will hold supremacy for a time, and that
he will shortly be taken out of the way, I have no doubt that he refers to
Antichrist; and the participle <i>withholding</i> must be explained in the
future tense.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
he has, in my opinion, added this for the consolation of believers&#8212;that
the reign of Antichrist will be temporary, the limits of it having been assigned
to it by God; for believers might object&#8212;&#8220;Of what avail is it that
the gospel is preached, if Satan is now hatching a tyranny that he is to
exercise for ever?&#8221; He accordingly exhorts to patience, because God
afflicts his Church only for a time, that he may one day afford it deliverance;
and, on the other hand, the perpetuity of Christ&#8217;s reign must be
considered, in order that believers may repose in it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

that <i>impediment</i> (</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt;
kate&gt;con</font><font face="Palatino">) shall be removed; for he does not
point out the time of revelation as being when he, who now holds the supremacy,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will be taken out of the
way</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but he has an eye to what he had said
before. For he had said that there was some hindrance in the way of
Antichrist&#8217;s entering upon an open possession of the kingdom. He
afterwards added, that he was already hatching a secret work of impiety. In the
<i>third</i> place, he has interspersed consolation, on the ground that this
tyranny would come to an end.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
now again repeats, that he<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd38</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who
was as yet hidden, would be <i>revealed in his time ;</i> and the repetition is
with this view&#8212;that believers, being furnished with spiritual armor, may,
nevertheless, fight vigorously under Christ,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
not allow themselves to be overwhelmed, although the deluge of impiety should
thus overspread.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd40</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He had foretold the destruction of
Antichrist&#8217;s reign; he now points out the manner of his
destruction&#8212;that he will be reduced to nothing by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is uncertain, however, whether he
speaks of the last appearance of Christ, when he will be manifested from heaven
as the Judge. The words, indeed, seem to have this meaning, but Paul does not
mean that Christ would accomplish this<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in
one moment. Hence we must understand it in this sense&#8212;that Antichrist
would be wholly and in every respect destroyed,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd42</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when that final day of the restoration of all things shall arrive. Paul,
however, intimates that Christ will in the mean time, by the rays which he will
emit previously to his advent, put to flight the darkness in which Antichrist
will reign, just as the sun, before he is seen by us, chases away the darkness
of the night by the pouring forth of his rays.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd43</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This victory of the word, therefore, will shew itself
in this world, for the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit of
his mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>simply means the word, as it
also does in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:4, to which passage Paul seems to allude. For the Prophet there takes in the
same sense the <i>scepter of his mouth</i>, and the <i>breath of his lips</i>,
and he also furnishes Christ with these very arms, that he may rout his enemies.
This is a signal commendation of true and sound doctrine&#8212;that it is
represented as sufficient for putting an end to all impiety, and as destined to
be invariably victorious, in opposition to all the machinations of Satan; as
also when, a little afterwards, the proclamation of it is spoken of as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ&#8217;s
coming</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When Paul adds, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brightness of his
coming</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he intimates that the light of
Christ&#8217;s presence will be such as will swallow up the darkness of
Antichrist. In the mean time, he indirectly intimates, that Antichrist will be
permitted to reign for a time, when Christ has, in a manner, withdrawn, as
usually happens, whenever on his presenting himself we turn our back upon him.
And, undoubtedly, that is a sad departure<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of
Christ, when he has taken away his light from men, which has been improperly and
unworthily received,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in
accordance with what follows. In the mean time Paul teaches, that by his
presence alone all the elect of God will be abundantly safe, in opposition to
all the subtleties of Satan.</font><br></div>

argument from contraries. For as Antichrist cannot stand otherwise than through
the impostures of Satan, he must necessarily vanish as soon as Christ shines
forth. In fine, as it is only in darkness that he reigns, the dawn of the day
puts to flight and extinguishes the thick darkness of his reign. We are now in
possession of Paul&#8217;s design, for he meant to say, that Christ would have
no difficulty in destroying the tyranny of Antichrist, which was supported by no
resources but those of Satan. In the mean time, however, he points out the marks
by which that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wicked
one</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>may be distinguished. For after
having spoken of the

of Satan, he marks it out particularly when he says,

in all deceivableness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And assuredly, in order
that this may be opposed to the kingdom of Christ, it must consist partly in
false doctrine and errors, and partly in pretended miracles. For the kingdom of
Christ consists of the doctrine of truth, and the power of the Spirit. Satan,
accordingly, with the view of opposing Christ in the person of his Vicar, puts
on Christ&#8217;s mask,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd46</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
while he, nevertheless, at the same time chooses armor, with which he may

wicked doctrine, involves the wicked in ruin;<b>

truly works of God, and abuses miracles so as to obscure God&#8217;s glory.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
the mean time, however, there can be no doubt, that he deceives by means of
enchantments&#8212;an example of which we have in Pharaoh&#8217;s magicians.

perish</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He limits the power of Satan, as not
being able to injure the elect of God, just as Christ, also, exempts them from
this danger.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
24:24.) From this it appears, that Antichrist has not so great power otherwise
than by his permission. Now, this consolation was necessary. For all the pious,
but for this, would of necessity be overpowered with fear, if they saw a yawning
gulf pervading the whole path, along which they must pass. Hence Paul, however
he may wish them to be in a state of anxiety, that they may be on their guard,
lest by excessive carelessness they should fall back, nay, even throw themselves
into ruin, does, nevertheless, bid them cherish good hope, inasmuch as
Satan&#8217;s power is bridled, that he may not be able to involve any but the
wicked in ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because they received not the
love</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Lest the wicked should complain that they
perish innocently,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd51</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
that they have been appointed to death rather from cruelty on the part of God,
than from any fault on their part, Paul shews on what good grounds it is that so
severe vengeance from God is to come upon them&#8212;because they have not
received in the temper of mind with which they ought the truth which was
presented to them, nay more, of their own accord refused salvation. And from
this appears more clearly what I have already stated&#8212;that the gospel
required to be preached to the world before God would give Satan so much
permission, for he would never have allowed his temple to be so basely
profaned,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd52</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> had
he not been provoked by extreme ingratitude on the part of men. In short, Paul
declares that Antichrist will be the minister of God&#8217;s righteous vengeance
against those who, being called to salvation, have rejected the gospel, and have
preferred to apply their mind to impiety and errors. Hence there is no reason
why Papists should now object, that it is at variance with the clemency of
Christ to cast off his Church in this manner. For though the domination of
Antichrist has been cruel, none have perished but those who were deserving of
it, nay more, did of their own accord <i>choose death</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;200836&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
8:36.) And unquestionably, while the voice of the Son of God has sounded forth
everywhere, it finds the ears of men deaf, nay obstinate,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
while a profession of Christianity is common, there are, nevertheless, few that
have truly and heartily given themselves to Christ. Hence it is not to be

does not stand in the way of his striking down with stupidity,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd56</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
often as seems good to him, those that have never heard a single word respecting
Christ, for Paul does not discourse in a general way as to the reasons why God

previously unwonted grace.<b>

will not merely have a place, but the wicked will be blinded, so that they will
rush forward to ruin without consideration. For as God enlightens us inwardly by
his Spirit, that his doctrine may be efficacious in us, and opens our eyes and
hearts, that it may make its way thither, so by a righteous judgment he delivers
over to a <i>reprobate mind
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28) those whom he has appointed to destruction, that with closed eyes and a
senseless mind, they may, as if bewitched, deliver themselves over to Satan and
his ministers to be deceived. And assuredly we have a notable specimen of this
in the Papacy. No words can express how monstrous a sink of errors<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd58</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
there is <i>there</i>, how gross and shameful an absurdity of superstitions
there is, and what delusions at variance with common sense. None that have even
a moderate taste of sound doctrine, can think of such monstrous things without
the greatest horror. How, then, could the whole world be lost in astonishment at
them, were it not that men have been struck with blindness by the Lord, and
converted, as it were, into stumps?</font><br></div>

may receive the punishment due to their impiety. Thus, those that perish have no
just ground to expostulate with God, inasmuch as they have obtained what they
sought. For we must keep in view what is stated in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
13:3, that the hearts of men are subjected to trial, when false doctrines come

with a sincere heart. Let those, then, who

unrighteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, reap the fruit of it. When he
says <i>all</i>, he means that contempt of God finds no excuse in the great
crowd and multitude of those who refuse to obey the gospel, for God is the Judge
of the whole world, so that he will inflict punishment upon a hundred thousand,
no less than upon one individual.</font><br></div>

Thessalonians from the reprobate, that their faith may not waver from fear of
the revolt that was to take place. At the same time, he had it in view to
consult, not <i>their</i> welfare only, but also that of posterity.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
he does not merely confirm them that they may not fall over the same precipice
with the world, but by this comparison he extols the more the grace of God
towards them, in that, while they see almost the whole world hurried forward to
death at the same time, as if by a violent tempest, they are, by the hand of
God, maintained in a quiet and secure condition of life.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd61</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus we must contemplate the Judgments of God upon the reprobate in such a way
that they may be, as it were, mirrors to us for considering his mercy towards
us. For we must draw this conclusion, that it is owing solely to the singular
grace of God that we do not miserably perish with them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beloved of the

consider that the sole reason why they are exempted from the almost universal
overthrow of the world, was because God exercised towards them unmerited love.
Thus Moses admonished the Jews&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;God did not elevate you so

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620419&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 4:19.) In short, Paul here does two things; for he confirms faith, lest the
pious should give way from being overcome with fear, and he exhorts them to
gratitude, that they may value so much the higher the mercy of God towards
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hath chosen
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He states the reason why all are not
involved and swallowed up in the same ruin&#8212;because Satan has no power over
any that God has chosen, so as to prevent them from being saved, though heaven
and earth were to be confounded. This passage is read in various
ways.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The old interpreter has rendered it
<i>first&#8212;fruits</i>,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd62</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
being in the Greek
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajparch&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino">;
but as almost all the Greek manuscripts have
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">apj
ajrch~v</font><font face="Palatino">, I have in preference followed this
reading. Should any one prefer <i>first&#8212;fruits</i>, the meaning will be,
that believers have been, as it were, set aside for a sacred offering, by a
metaphor taken from the ancient custom of the law. Let us, however, hold by what
is more generally received, that he says that the Thessalonians were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>chosen from the
beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some understand the meaning to be, that they had been
called among the first; but this is foreign to Paul&#8217;s meaning, and does
not accord with the connection of the passage. For he does not merely exempt
from fear a few individuals, who had been led to Christ immediately on the
commencement of the gospel, but this consolation belongs to all the elect of
God, without exception. When, therefore, he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the
beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means that there is no danger
lest their salvation, which is founded on God&#8217;s eternal election, should
be overthrown, whatever tumultuous changes may occur. &#8220;However Satan may
mix and confound all things in the world, your salvation, notwithstanding, has
been placed on a footing of safety, prior to the creation of the world.&#8221;
Here, therefore, is the true port of safety, that God, who elected us of old,<b>
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd63</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
will deliver us from all the evils that threaten us. For we are elected to
salvation; we shall, therefore, be safe from destruction. But as it is not for
us to penetrate into God&#8217;s secret counsel, to seek <i>there</i> assurance
of our salvation, he specifies signs or tokens of election, which should suffice
us for the assurance of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In sanctification of the
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">, says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and belief of the
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This may be explained in two ways, WITH
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctification</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or BY sanctification. It is not of much importance which of the two you select,
as it is certain<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd64</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that Paul meant simply to introduce, in connection with election, those nearer
tokens which manifest to us what is in its own nature incomprehensible, and are
conjoined with it by an indissoluble tie. Hence, in order that we may know that
we are elected by God, there is no occasion to inquire as to what he decreed
before the creation of the world, but we find in ourselves a satisfactory proof
if he has sanctified us by his Spirit,&#8212;if he has enlightened us in the
faith of his gospel. For the gospel is an evidence to us of our adoption, and
the Spirit seals it, and those that are <i>led by the Spirit are the sons of
God</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450814&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:14,) and he who by faith possesses Christ has everlasting life.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620512&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 5:12.) These things must be carefully observed, lest, overlooking the
revelation of God&#8217;s will, with which he bids us rest satisfied, we should
plunge into a profound labyrinth from a desire to take it from his secret
counsel, from the investigation of which he draws us aside. Hence it becomes us
to rest satisfied with the faith of the gospel, and that grace of the Spirit by
which we have been regenerated. And by this means is refuted the wickedness<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd65</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of
those who make the election of God a pretext for every kind of iniquity, while
Paul connects it with faith and regeneration in such a manner, that he would not
have it judged of by us on any other grounds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
To which he called us</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He repeats the same
thing, though in somewhat different terms. For the sons of God are not called
otherwise than to the belief of the truth. Paul, however, meant to shew here how
competent a witness he is for confirming that thing of which he was a minister.
He accordingly puts himself forward as a surety, that the Thessalonians may not
doubt that the gospel, in which they had been instructed by him, is the
safety&#8212;bringing voice of God, by which they are aroused from death, and
are delivered from the tyranny of Satan. He calls it <i>his</i> gospel, not as
though it had originated with him,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
inasmuch as the preaching of it had been committed to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the acquisition or possession
of the glory of Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, may be taken either in
an active or in a passive signification&#8212;either as meaning, that they are
called in order that they may one day <i>possess</i> a glory in common with
Christ, or that Christ <i>acquired</i> them with a view to his glory. And thus
it will be a second means of confirmation that he will defend them, as being
nothing less than his own inheritance, and, in maintaining their salvation, will
stand forward in defense of his own glory; which latter meaning, in my opinion,
suits better.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He deduces this exhortation on good grounds from what
goes before, inasmuch as our steadfastness and power of perseverance rest on
nothing else than assurance of divine grace. When, however, God calls us to
salvation, stretching forth, as it were, his hand to us; when Christ, by the
doctrine of the gospel, presents himself to us to be enjoyed; when the Spirit is
given us as a seal and earnest of eternal life, though the heaven should fall,
we must, nevertheless, not become disheartened. Paul, accordingly, would have
the Thessalonians stand, not merely when others continue to stand, but with a
more settled stability; so that, on seeing almost all turning aside from the
faith, and all things full of confusion, they will, nevertheless, retain their
footing. And assuredly the calling of God ought to fortify us against all
occasions of offense in such a manner, that not even the entire ruin of the
world shall shake, much less overthrow, our stability.</font><br></div>

external polity; but this does not please me, for he points out the manner of
standing firm. Now, to be furnished with invincible strength is a much higher
thing than external discipline. Hence, in my opinion, he includes all doctrine
under this term, as though he had said that they have ground on which they may
stand firm, provided they persevere in sound doctrine, according as they had
been instructed by him. I do not deny that the term
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">parado&gt;seiv
</font><font face="Palatino">is fitly applied to the ordinances which are
appointed by the Churches, with a view to the promoting of peace and the
maintaining of order, and I admit that it is taken in this sense when human
traditions are treated of,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
15:6.) Paul, however, will be found in the next chapter making use of the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tradition</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
as meaning the rule that he had laid down, and the very signification of the
term is general. The context, however, as I have said, requires that it be taken
here to mean the whole of that doctrine in which they had been instructed. For
the matter treated of is the most important of all&#8212;that their faith may
remain secure in the midst of a dreadful agitation of the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Papists, however, act a foolish part in gathering
from this that their traditions ought to be observed. They reason, indeed, in
this manner&#8212;that if it was allowable for Paul to enjoin traditions, it was
allowable also for other teachers; and that, if it was a pious thing<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd67</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to
observe the former, the latter also ought not less to be observed. Granting
them, however, that Paul speaks of precepts belonging to the external government
of the Church, I say that they were, nevertheless, not contrived by him, but
divinely communicated. For he declares elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460735&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:35,) that it was not his intention to ensnare consciences, as it
was not lawful, either for himself, or for all the Apostles together. They act a
still more ridiculous part in making it their aim to pass off, under this, the
abominable sink of their own superstitions, as though they were the traditions
of Paul. But farewell to these trifles, when we are in possession of
Paul&#8217;s true meaning. And we may judge in part from this Epistle what
traditions he here recommends, for he says&#8212;whether <i>by word</i>, that
is, discourse, or <i>by epistle</i>. Now, what do these Epistles contain but
pure doctrine, which overturns to the very foundation the whole of the Papacy,
and every invention that is at variance with the simplicity of the
Gospel?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Now the Lord himself</i></font><font face="Palatino">. When he ascribes to
Christ a work altogether Divine, and represents him, in common with the Father,
as the Author of the choicest blessings, as we have in this a clear proof of the
divinity of Christ, so we are admonished, that we cannot obtain anything from
God unless we seek it in Christ himself: and when he asks that God may give him
those things which he had enjoined, he shews clearly enough how little influence
exhortations have, unless God inwardly move and affect our hearts.
Unquestionably there will be but an empty sound striking upon the ear, if
doctrine does not receive efficacy from the Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he afterwards
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> who hath loved you, and
hath given consolation</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc., relates to
confidence in asking; for he would have the Thessalonians feel persuaded that
God will do what he prays for. And from what does he prove this? Because he once
shewed that they were dear to him, while he has already conferred upon them
distinguished favors, and in this manner has bound himself to them for the time
to come. This is what he means by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>everlasting
consolation</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hope</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
also, has the same object in view&#8212;that they may confidently expect a
never&#8212;failing continuance of gifts. But what does he ask? That God may
sustain their hearts by his consolation; for this is his office, to keep them
from giving way through anxiety or distrust; and farther, that he may give them
perseverance, both in a pious and holy course of life, and in sound doctrine;
for I am of opinion, that it is rather of this than of common discourse that he
speaks, so that this agrees with what goes before.</font><br></div>

Pray for us</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though the Lord powerfully aided
him, and though he surpassed all others in earnestness of prayer, he
nevertheless does not despise the prayers of believers, by which the Lord would
have us aided. It becomes us, after his example, eagerly to desire this aid, and
to stir up our brethren to pray for us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, however, he
adds&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the word of God
may have its course</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he shows that he has not
so much concern and regard for himself personally, as for the entire Church. For
why does he desire to be recommended to the prayers of the Thessalonians? That
the doctrine of the gospel may
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have its
course</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He does not desire, therefore, so much
that regard should be had to himself individually, as to the glory of God and
the common welfare of the Church. <i>Course</i> means here dissemination;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd68</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>glory</i> means something farther,&#8212;that his preaching may have its
power and efficacy for renewing men after the image of God. Hence, holiness of
life and uprightness on the part of Christians is the glory of the gospel; as,
on the other hand, those defame the gospel who make profession of it with the
mouth, while in the meantime they live in wickedness and baseness. He
says&#8212;<i>as among you ;</i> for this should be a stimulus to the pious, to
see all others like them. Hence those that have already entered into the kingdom
of God are exhorted to pray daily that it may <i>come</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
6:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That we may be
delivered</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The old interpreter has rendered it,
not unhappily, in my opinion&#8212;<i>unreasonable</i>.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd69</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> 
Now, by this term, as also by that which immediately follows,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tw~n
ponhrw~n</font><font face="Palatino">,) <i>evil</i>, Paul means wicked and
treacherous men, who lurked in the Church, under the name of Christians, or at
least Jews, who with a mad zeal for the law furiously persecuted the gospel. He
knew, however, how much danger impended over them from both these classes.
Chrysostom, however, thinks that those only are meant who maliciously oppose the
gospel by base doctrines,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd70</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8212;not
by weapons of violence, as for example, Alexander, Hymeneus, and the like; but
for my part, I extend it generally to all kinds of dangers and enemies. He was
at that time proceeding towards Jerusalem, and wrote in the midst of his
journeyings. Now, he had already been divinely forewarned that <i>imprisonments
and persecutions awaited him there</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442023&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
20:23.) He means, however, <i>deliverance</i>, so that he may come off
victorious, whether by life or by death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All have not
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This might be explained to mean,
&#8220;Faith is not in all.&#8221; This expression, however, were both ambiguous
and more obscure. Let us therefore retain Paul&#8217;s words, by which he
intimates that faith is a gift of God that is too rare to be found in all. God,
therefore, calls many who do not come to him by faith. Many pretend to come to
him, who have their heart at the farthest distance from him. Farther, he does
not speak of all indiscriminately, but merely animadverts upon those that belong
to the Church: for the Thessalonians saw that very many held faith in
abhorrence;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd71</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
nay, they saw how small was the number of believers. Hence it would have been
unnecessary to say this as to strangers; but Paul simply says that all that make
a profession of faith are not such in reality. Should you take in all Jews, they
appeared to have nearness to Christ, for they ought to have recognized him by
means of the law and the prophets. Paul, there can be no question specially
marks out those with whom he would have to do. Now, it is probable that they
were those who, while they had the appearance and honorary title of piety, were
nevertheless very far from the reality. From this came the
conflict.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With the view of shewing, therefore, that it was not
groundlessly, or without good reason, that he dreaded contests with wicked and
perverse men, he says that faith is not common to all, because the wicked and
reprobate are always mixed with the good, as <i>tares</i> are with the <i>good
wheat</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401325&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:25.) And this ought to be remembered by us whenever we have annoyance given
us by wicked persons, who nevertheless desire to be reckoned as belonging to the
society of Christians&#8212;that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all men have not
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Nay more, when we hear in some instances
that the Church is disturbed by base factions, let this be a shield to us
against offenses of this nature; for we shall not merely inflict injury upon
pious teachers, if we have doubts as to their fidelity, whenever domestic
enemies do them harm, but our faith will from time to time waver, unless we keep
in mind that among those who boast of the name of Christians there are many that
are treacherous.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd72</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
But God is faithful</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As it was possible that
their minds, influenced by unfavorable reports, might come to entertain some
doubts as to Paul&#8217;s ministry, having taught them that faith is not always
found in men, he now calls them back to God, and says that he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faithful</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
so as to confirm them against all contrivances of men, by which they will
endeavor to shake them. &#8220;They, indeed, are treacherous, but there is in
God a support that is abundantly secure, so as to keep you from giving
way.&#8221; He calls the Lord
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faithful</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
inasmuch as he adheres to his purpose to the end in maintaining the salvation of
his people, seasonably aids them, and never forsakes them in dangers, as in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461013&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:13,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">God is faithful, who will
not suffer</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">you to be tried above
that ye are able to bear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These words, however, themselves shew that Paul was
more anxious as to others than as to himself. Malicious men directed against him
the stings of their malignity; the whole violence<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd73</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of
it fell upon him. In the mean time, he directs all his anxieties towards the
Thessalonians, lest this temptation should do them any injury.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The term <i>evil</i> may refer as well to the thing,
that is, malice, as to the persons of the wicked. I prefer, however, to
interpret it of Satan, the head of all the wicked. For it were a small thing to
be delivered from the cunning or violence of men, if the Lord did not protect us
from all spiritual injury.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
We have confidence</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this preface he prepares
the way for proceeding to give the instruction, which we shall find him
immediately afterwards subjoining. For the confidence which he says he has
respecting them, made them much more ready to obey than if he had required
obedience from them in a way of doubt or distrust. He says, however, that this
hope, which he cherished in reference to them, was founded upon the Lord,
inasmuch as it is his to bind their hearts to obedience, and to keep them in it;
or by this expression, (as appears to me more probable,) he meant to testify,
that it is not his intention to enjoin anything but by the commandment of the
Lord. Here, accordingly, he marks out limits for himself as to enjoining, and
for them as to obeying&#8212;that it should be only in the Lord.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd74</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
All, therefore, that do not observe this limitation, do to no purpose resort to
Paul&#8217;s example, with the view of binding the Church and subjecting it to
their laws. Perhaps he had this also in view, that the respect which was due to
his Apostleship might remain unimpaired among the Thessalonians, however the
wicked might attempt to deprive him of the honor that belonged to him; for the
prayer which he immediately subjoins tends towards this object. For provided
men&#8217;s hearts continue to be directed towards
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love to God, and patient waiting
for Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, other things will be in a desirable
state, and Paul declares that he desires nothing else. From this it is manifest,
how very far he is from seeking dominion for himself peculiarly. For he is
satisfied provided they persevere in love to God, and in the hope of
Christ&#8217;s coming. In following up with prayer his expression of
confidence,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd75</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
admonishes us that we must not relax in eagerness of prayer on the ground that
we cherish good hope.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, he states here in a summary manner the
things that he knew to be most necessary for Christians, let every one make it
his endeavor to make proficiency in these two things, in so far as he desires to
make progress towards perfection. And, unquestionably, the love of God cannot
reign in us unless brotherly love is also exercised.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Waiting for
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, on the other hand, teaches us to
exercise contempt of the world, mortification of the flesh, and endurance of the
cross. At the same time the expression might be explained as meaning, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>patience of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8212;that which Christ&#8217;s doctrine
begets in us; but I prefer to understand it as referring to the hope of ultimate
redemption. For this is the only thing that sustains us in the warfare of the
present life, that we wait for the Redeemer; and farther, this waiting requires
patient endurance amidst the continual exercises of the cross.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He now proceeds to the correcting of a particular
fault. As there were some indolent, and at the same time curious and prattling
persons, who, in order that they might scrape together a living at the expense
of others, wandered about from house to house, he forbids that their indolence
should be encouraged by indulgence,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd76</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
teaches that those live holily who procure for themselves the necessaries of

appellation of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>disorderly

life, or to those whose characters are stained by flagrant crimes, but to

(<i>disorder</i>,<b>

considering for what purpose we were made, and regulating our life with a view
to that end, while it is only when we live according to the rule prescribed to
us by God that this life is duly regulated. Let this order be set aside, and
there is nothing but confusion in human life. This, also, is worthy to be
noticed, lest any one should take pleasure in exercising himself apart from a
legitimate call from God: for God has distinguished in such a manner the life of
men, in order that every one may lay himself out for the advantage of others.
He, therefore, who lives to himself alone, so as to be profitable in no way to
the human race, nay more, is a burden to others, giving help to no one, is on
good grounds reckoned to be
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">a]taktov</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>disorderly</i>.) Hence Paul declares that such persons must be put away from
the society of believers, that they may not bring dishonor upon the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now we command you in the
name</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Erasmus renders it&#8212;&#8221;<i>by</i>
the name,&#8221; as if it were an adjuration. While I do not altogether reject
this rendering, I, at the same time, am rather of opinion that the particle
<i>in</i> is redundant, as in very many other passages, and that in accordance
with the Hebrew idiom. Thus the meaning will be, that this commandment ought to
be received with reverence, not as from a mortal man, but as from Christ
himself; and Chrysostom explains it in this manner. This <i>withdrawment</i>,<b>
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd78</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
however of which he speaks, relates&#8212;not to public excommunication but to
private intercourse. For he simply forbids believers to have any familiar
intercourse with drones of this sort, who have no honorable means of life, in
which they may exercise themselves. He says, however,
expressly&#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from every
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because if they profess themselves to
be Christians they are above all others intolerable, inasmuch as they are, in a
manner, the pests and stains of religion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not according to the
injunction</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8212;namely, that which we shall
find him shortly afterwards adding&#8212;that food should not be given to the
man that refuses to labor. Before coming to this, however, he states what
example he has given them in his own person. For doctrine obtains much more of
credit and authority, when we impose upon others no other burden than we take
upon ourselves. Now he mentions that he himself was engaged in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>working with his hands night and
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that he might not burden any one with
expense. He had, also, touched somewhat on this point in the preceding
Epistle&#8212;to which my readers must have recourse for a fuller explanation of
this point.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to his saying, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had not eaten any one&#8217;s
bread for naught</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he assuredly would not have
done this, though he had not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>labored with his
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For that which is due in the way of
right, is not a thing that is gratuitous, and the price of the labor which
teachers<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd79</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> lay
out in behalf of the Church, is much greater than the food which they receive
from it. But Paul had here in his eye inconsiderate persons, for all have not so
much equity and judgment as to consider what remuneration is due to the
ministers of the word. Nay more, such is the niggardliness of some, that, though
they contribute nothing of their own, they, envy them their living, as if they
were idle men.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd80</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He,
also, immediately afterwards declares that he waived his right, when he
refrained from taking any remuneration, by which he intimates, that it is much
less to be endured, that those, who do nothing, shall live on what belongs to
others.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd81</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
When he says, that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know how
they ought to imitate</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he does not simply mean
that his example should be regarded by them as a law, but the meaning is, that
they knew what they had seen in him that was worthy of imitation, nay more, that
the very thing of which he is at present speaking, has been set before them for
imitation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not because we have
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As Paul wished by his laboring to set an
example, that idle persons might not like drones<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd82</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> eat
the bread of others, so he was not willing that this very thing<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd83</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
should do injury to the ministers of the word, so that the Churches should
defraud them of their proper livelihood. In this we may see his singular
moderation and humanity, and how far removed he was from the ambition of those
who abuse their powers, so as to infringe upon the rights of their brethren.
There was a danger, lest the Thessalonians, having had from the beginning the
preaching of the gospel from Paul&#8217;s mouth gratuitously,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd84</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
should lay it down as a law for the future as to other ministers; the
disposition of mankind being so niggardly. Paul, accordingly, anticipates this
danger, and teaches that he had a right to more than he had made use of, that
others may retain their liberty unimpaired. He designed by this means to inflict
the greater disgrace, as I have already noticed above, on those that do nothing,
for it is an argument from, the greater to the less.</font><br></div>

exempt themselves from the common law,<b>

lazy drones who lived by the sweat of others, while they contribute no service

are largely pampered by doing nothing, excepting that they chant in the temples,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We hear that there are some among
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is probable that this kind of drones
were, as it were, the seed of idle monkhood. For, from the very beginning, there
were some who, under pretext of religion, either made free with the tables of
others, or craftily drew to themselves the substance of the simple. They had
also, even in the time of Augustine, come to prevail so much, that he was
constrained to write a book expressly against idle monks, where he complains
with good reason of their pride, because, despising the admonition of the
Apostle, they not only excuse themselves on the ground of infirmity, but they
wish to appear holier than all others, on the ground that they are exempt from
labors. He inveighs, with good reason, against this unseemliness, that, while
the senators are laborious, the workman, or person in humble life, does not
merely live in idleness,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
would fain have his indolence pass for sanctity. Such are his views.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd92</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
the mean time, however, the evil has increased to such an extent, that idle
bellies occupy nearly the tenth part of the world, whose only religion is to be
well stuffed, and to have exemption from all annoyance<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd93</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of
labor. And this manner of life they dignify, sometimes with the name of the
Order, sometimes with that of the Rule, of this or that personage.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd94</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what does the Spirit say, on the other hand, by
the mouth of Paul? He pronounces them all to be irregular and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>disorderly</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
by whatever name of distinction they may be dignified. It is not necessary to
relate here how much the idle life of monks has invariably displeased persons of
sounder judgment. That is a memorable saying of an old monk, which is recorded
by Socrates in the Eighth Book of the Tripartite History&#8212;that he who does
not labor with his hands is like a plunderer.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd95</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I
do not mention other instances, nor is it necessary. Let this statement of the
Apostle suffice us, in which he declares that they are dissolute, and in a
manner lawless.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Doing
nothing</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the Greek participles there is, an
elegant
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">proswnomasi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>play upon words</i>, which I have attempted in some manner to imitate, by
rendering it as meaning that they <i>do</i> nothing, but have <i>enough to do
</i>in the way of curiosity.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd96</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
censures, however, a fault with which idle persons are, for the most part,
chargeable, that, by unseasonably bustling about, they give trouble to
themselves and to others. For we see, that those who have nothing to do are much
more fatigued by doing nothing, than if they were employing themselves in some
very important work; they run hither and thither; wherever they go, they have
the appearance of great fatigue; they gather all sorts of reports, and they put
them in a confused way into circulation. You would say that they bore the weight
of a kingdom upon their shoulders. Could there be a more remarkable
exemplification of this than there is in the monks? For what class of men have
less repose? Where does curiosity reign more extensively? Now, as this disease
has a ruinous effect upon the public, Paul admonishes that it ought not to be
encouraged by idleness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now we command
such</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He corrects both of the faults of which
he had made mention&#8212;a blustering restlessness, and retirement from useful
employment. He accordingly exhorts them, in the first place, to cultivate
repose&#8212;that is, to keep themselves
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quietly
</i></font><font face="Palatino">within the limits of their calling, or, as we
commonly say, &#8220;<i>sans faire bruit</i>,&#8221; (<i>without making a
noise</i>.) For the truth is this: those are the most peaceable of all, that
exercise themselves in lawful employments;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd97</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
while those that have nothing to do give trouble both to themselves and to
others. Further, he subjoins another precept&#8212;that they should
<i>labor</i>, that is, that they should be intent upon their calling, and devote
themselves to lawful and honorable employments, without which the life of man is
of a wandering nature. Hence, also, there follows this third
injunction&#8212;that they should
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eat their own bread
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> by which he means, that they should be
satisfied with what belongs to them, that they may not be oppressive or
unreasonable to others. </font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Drink water, <i>says
Solomon</i>, from thine own fountains, and let the streams flow down to
neighbors.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;200515&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Proverbs
5:15.) </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the <i>first</i> law of equity, that no one
make use of what belongs to another, but only use what he can properly call his
own. The <i>second</i> is, that no one swallow up, like some abyss, what belongs
to him, but that he be beneficent to neighbors, and that he may relieve their
indigence by his abundance.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd98</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
the same manner, the Apostle exhorts those who had been formerly idle to
<i>labor</i>, not merely that they may gain for themselves a livelihood, but
that they may also be helpful to the necessities of their brethren, as he also
teaches elsewhere.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490428&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:28.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And you, brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Ambrose is of opinion that
this is added lest the rich should, in a niggardly spirit, refuse to lend their
aid to the poor, because he had exhorted them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eat every one his own
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And, unquestionably, we see how many are
unbefittingly ingenious in catching at a pretext for inhumanity.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd99</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Chrysostom explains it thus&#8212;that indolent persons, however justly they may
be condemned, must nevertheless be assisted when in want. I am simply of
opinion, that Paul had it in view to provide against an occasion of offense,
which might arise from the indolence of a few. For it usually happens, that
those that are otherwise particularly ready and on the alert for beneficence,
become cool on seeing that they have thrown away their favors by misdirecting
them. Hence Paul admonishes us, that, although there are many that are
undeserving,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd100</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
while others abuse our liberality, we must not on this account leave off helping
those that need our aid. Here we have a statement worthy of being
observed&#8212;that however ingratitude, moroseness, pride, arrogance, and other
unseemly dispositions on the part of the poor, may have a tendency to annoy us,
or to dispirit us, from a feeling of weariness, we must strive, nevertheless,
never to leave off aiming at doing good.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any one obeys
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He has already declared previously, that
he commands nothing but <i>from the Lord</i>. Hence the man, that would not
obey, would not be contumacious against a mere man, but would be rebellious
against God himself;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd102</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and accordingly he teaches that such persons ought to be severely chastised.
And, in the <i>first</i> place, he desires that they be reported to him, that he
may repress them by his authority; and, <i>secondly</i>, he orders them to be
excommunicated, that, being touched with shame, they may repent. From this we
infer, that we must not spare the reputation of those who cannot be arrested
otherwise than by their faults being exposed; but we must take care to make
known their distempers to the physician, that he may make it his endeavor to
cure them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep no
company</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I have no doubt that he refers to
excommunication; for, besides that the
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajtaxi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>disorder</i> to which he had adverted deserved a severe chastisement,
contumacy is an intolerable vice. He had said before, <i>Withdraw yourselves
from them</i>, for they live in a <i>disorderly</i> manner,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;530306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 3:6.) And now he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep no
company</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for they reject my admonition. He
expresses, therefore, something more by this second manner of expression than by
the former; for it is one thing to withdraw from intimate acquaintance with an
individual, and quite another to keep altogether aloof from his society. In
short, those that do not obey after being admonished, he excludes from the
common society of believers. By this we are taught that we must employ the
discipline of excommunication against all the obstinate<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd103</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
persons who will not otherwise allow themselves to be brought under subjection,
and must be branded with disgrace, until, having been brought under and subdued,
they learn to obey.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he may be
ashamed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There are, it is true, other ends to
be served by excommunication&#8212;that contagion may spread no farther, that
the personal wickedness of one individual may not tend to the common disgrace of
the Church, and that the example of severity may induce others to <i>fear</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 5:20;) but Paul touches upon this one merely&#8212;that those who have
sinned may by shame be constrained to repentance. For those that please
themselves in their vices become more and more obstinate: thus sin is nourished
by indulgence and dissimulation. This, therefore, is the best remedy&#8212;when
a feeling of shame is awakened in the mind of the offender, so that he begins to
be displeased with himself. It would, indeed, be a small point gained to have
individuals made ashamed; but Paul had an eye to farther progress&#8212;when the
offender, confounded by a discovery of his own baseness, is led in this way to a
full amendment: for shame, like sorrow, is a useful preparation for hatred of
sin. Hence all that become wanton<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd104</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
must, as I have said, be restrained by this bridle, lest their audacity should
be increased in consequence of impunity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Regard him not as an enemy</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He immediately adds
a softening of his rigor; for, as he elsewhere commands, we must take care that
the offender be not <i>swallowed up with sorrow</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:7,) which would take place if severity were excessive. Hence we
see that the use of discipline ought to be in such a way as to consult the
welfare of those on whom the Church inflicts punishment. Now, it cannot but be
that severity will fret,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd105</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when it goes beyond due bounds. Hence, if we wish to do good, gentleness and
mildness are necessary, that those that are reproved may know that they are
nevertheless loved. In short, excommunication does not tend to drive men from
the Lord&#8217;s flock, but rather to bring them back when wandering and going
astray.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must observe, however, by what sign he would have
brotherly love shewn&#8212;not by allurements or flattery, but by
<i>admonitions</i>; for in this way it will be, that all that will not be
incurable will feel that concern is felt for their welfare. In the mean time,
excommunication is distinguished from anathema: for as to those that the Church
marks out by the severity of its censure, Paul admonishes that they should not
be utterly cast away, as if they were cut off from all hope of salvation; but
endeavors must be used, that they may be brought back to a sound
mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now the Lord of
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This prayer seems to be connected with
the preceding sentence, with the view of recommending endeavors after concord
and mildness. He had forbidden them to treat even the contumacious<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd106</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
but rather with a view to their being brought back to a sound mind<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by
brotherly admonitions. He could appropriately, after this, subjoin an injunction
as to the cultivation of peace; but as this is a work that is truly Divine, he
betakes himself to prayer, which, nevertheless, has also the force of a precept.
At the same time, he may also have another thing in view&#8212;that God may
restrain unruly persons,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd108</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they may not disturb the peace of the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The salutation, with my own
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here again he provides against the
danger, of which he had previously made mention&#8212;lest epistles falsely
ascribed to him should find their way into the Churches. For this was an old
artifice of Satan&#8212;to put forward spurious writings, that he might detract
from the credit of those that are genuine; and farther, under pretended
designations of the Apostles, to disseminate wicked errors with the view of
corrupting sound doctrine. By a singular kindness on the part of God, it has
been brought about that, his frauds being defeated, the doctrine of Christ has
come down to us sound and entire through the ministry of Paul and others. The
concluding prayer explains in what manner God aids his believing people&#8212;by
the presence of Christ&#8217;s
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">FOOTNOTES</font><br></div>

Caesar&#8217;s celebrated victory over Pompey took place on the plains of
Pharsalia, in Thessaly, with which Philippi in Macedonia is sometimes confounded
by the poets. (See Virg. G. I. 490, Juvenal, 8:242.) Their being sometimes
confounded with each other appears to have arisen from the circumstance that
there was near Pharsalos, in Thessaly, a town named Philippi, the original name
of which was Thebae, distinguished from Thebae in B&#339;otia by its being
called Thebae <i>Thessaliae</i>, or <i>Phthioticae</i>, but having fallen under
the power of Philip, King of Macedon, was in honor of the conqueror called
<i>Philippi</i>, or <i>Philippopolis</i>. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">Fta15</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  The
decisive engagement referred to was, as Dio Cassius observes, the most important
of all that were fought during the civil wars, as it determined the fate of
Roman liberty, so that the contest thenceforward was not for freedom, but
&#8212; what master the Romans should serve. From its having been fought on the

<i>praetorium</i> was, in the provinces, given to the palace of the governors,
both because they administered justice, and had their guards stationed in their
residence. Hence it is inferred that, although the Apostle was at Rome when he
wrote this, and although the circumstances to which he refers occurred in that
city, yet, writing to persons residing in the provinces, he uses the word

&#8220;We are not to suppose that our Lord left any sufferings to be endured by
Paul, or any one else, as the expiation of the sins or the ransom of the souls
of his people. . . . The filling up spoken of by the Apostle is not the
supplementing Christ&#8217;s personal sufferings, but it is the completing that
share allotted to himself as one of the members of Christ, as sufferings which,
from the intimacy of union between the head and the members, may be called his
sufferings. Christ lived in Paul, spoke in Paul, wrought in Paul, suffered in
Paul; and in a similar sense, the sufferings of every Christian for Christ are

Paley, in his Horae Paulinae, finds the statement here made respecting Onesimus,
&#8220;who is one of you,&#8221; one of the many undesigned coincidences which
he adduces in that admirable treatise, in evidence of the credibility of the New
Testament. The train of his reasoning in this instance may be briefly stated
thus &#8212; that while it appears from the Epistle to Philemon, that Onesimus
was the servant or slave of Philemon, it is not stated in that Epistle to what
city Philemon belonged; but that it appears from the Epistle, (Philem. 1, 2,)
that he was of the same place, whatever that place was, with an eminent
Christian, named Archippus, whom we find saluted by name amongst the Colossian
Christians; while the expression made use of by Paul here respecting Onesimus,
&#8220;who is one of you,&#8221; clearly marks him out as being of the same
city, viz., Colosse. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
