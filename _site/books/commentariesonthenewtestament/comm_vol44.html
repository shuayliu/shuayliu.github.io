<div><font size="7" color="Blue">TRANSLATOR&#8217;S PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div>No doubt the Epistle next in importance to that to the Romans is this to
the Hebrews. The truths explained in it might, indeed, have been deduced from
other portions of Scripture; but it is a vast advantage and a great satisfaction
to find them expressly set forth, and distinctly stated by an inspired
Apostle.<br></div>
<div>In condescension to our ignorance, it has pleased God, not only to give us
what might have been deemed sufficient for our information, but also to add
&#8220;line upon line,&#8221; so that there might be every help given to those
who have a desire to know the truth, and every reasonable accuse taken away from
such as resolve to oppose it, and to follow the guidance of self-will, and the
delusions of their own proud minds and depraved hearts. It might then, seem
strange to us that defect, insufficiency, and obscurity have been ascribed to
the Scriptures, did we not know that these have been made by such as wish
Revelation to be otherwise than it is; they having imbibed errors and adopted
superstitions to which it yields no countenance, but which it condemns in terms
so plain, that they must be represented as defective or obscure in order to be
evaded.<br></div>
<div>There are especially two parties who find this Epistle in no way favorable
to them &#8212; the Papists and the Socinians. The Sole Priesthood of Christ,
and his Sole Sufficient Sacrifice, are here so distinctly stated, that the
former cannot resist the evidence except by the subtle arts of the most
consummate sophistry; and the latter find it a very difficult task to neutralize
the strong and clear testimony here given as to the Divinity of our Savior and
his Atonement. Though these parties are wholly opposed to one another, yet, like
Herod and Pilate, they unite in degrading the Savior &#8212; the one indirectly,
by substituting others in his place; and the other in open manner, by denying
his dignity and the character and efficacy of his death. But by both the Savior
is equally dishonored.<br></div>
<div>There have been more disputes about this Epistle than any other portion of
Scripture; but many of the questions which have been raised have been of a very
trifling character, as though learned men were idle and had nothing else to do;
and this has been the case, especially with the divines of the German school,
not only with regard to this Epistle, but with respect to many other
subjects.<br></div>
<div>Disquisitions called learned, have been written as to the character of this
Epistle, whether it be properly an Epistle, or something that ought to be called
by some other name!<sup><font color="Maroon">F1</font></sup> Then it has been a
subject learnedly discussed, to whom in particular the Epistle was sent, whether
to the dispersed Jews, or to those in Palestine &#8212; whether to a particular
Congregation, or to the Hebrews in
general?<sup><font color="Maroon">F2</font></sup> Such questions are
comparatively of very little importance; and to spend time and talent in
discussing them, is a work frivolous and useless; and not only so, but also
mischievous, calculated to serve the purposes of Popery and Infidelity; for to
render thus apparently important what is not so, and on which no degree of
certainty can be obtained, is to involve men in a mist which may lead them
astray.<br></div>
<div>Another subject has been much discussed, which is of no great consequence,
as the inspiration of the Epistle is not thereby endangered, and that is the
language in which the Epistle was originally written. An opinion prevailed among
some of the Early Fathers that it was written in Hebrew, or rather in
Syro-Chaldee language, and that it was translated into Greek by Luke, Clement,
or Barnabas. It was stated as an <font color="Maroon"><i>opinion</i></font>,
confirmed by no authority, and founded mainly on two circumstances &#8212; that
it was written to Hebrews, and that its style is different from that of Paul in
his other Epistles. Almost all modern divines regard this opinion as not well
founded. The Greek language was in Paul&#8217;s time well known throughout
Palestine; the &#8220;General Epistles,&#8221; intended for the Jews as well as
the Gentiles, were written in Greek; and <font color="Maroon"><i>there is no
record of any copy of this Epistle in Hebrew</i></font>. As to the style, it
differs not more from that of the other Epistles than what may be observed in
writers in all ages, or what might be expected in Paul when advanced in years,
compared with what he wrote in his younger days. It may be further added, that
the Epistle itself contains things which seem to show that it was written in
Greek: Hebrew words are interpreted,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580702&gt;</font></sup>Hebrews 7:2; the passages
quoted are mostly from the <font color="Maroon"><i>Septuagint</i></font>, and
not from the Hebrew; and there is the use of a word, rendered
&#8220;Testament,&#8221; in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580917&gt;</font></sup>Hebrews 9:17, in the sense
of a Will, which the Hebrew word never means.<br></div>
<div>There are only two questions of real importance &#8212; the canonicity of
the Epistle, and its Author.<br></div>
<div>As to the first, it has never been doubted except by some of the strange
heretics in the first ages. There is quite as much external testimony in its
favor as most portions of the New Testament. It was from the first received by
the Churches, Eastern and Western, as a portion of the Inspired Volume. It is
found in the very first versions of the New Testament, the
<font color="Maroon"><i>Syriac</i></font> and the
<font color="Maroon"><i>Italic</i></font>. These versions were made as early as
the end of the second century, about 140 years after the date of this
Epistle.<sup><font color="Maroon">F3</font></sup> The testimony of the Fathers
from the earliest time is uniformly the same in this respect. The Epistle is
acknowledged by them all as a portion of Holy Writ.<br></div>
<div>But with regard to the Author there has been a diversity of opinion,
though, when all things are duly weighed, without reason. From the
<font color="Maroon"><i>earliest times</i></font>, the Eastern Church
acknowledge Paul as the Author. Some in the Western Church, in the third and the
fourth century, did not regard Paul as the Author, but Luke, or Clement, or
Barnabas. Jerome and Augustine in the fifth century, a more enlightened age than
the two preceding centuries, ascribed to Paul the authorship; and since their
time the same opinion has prevailed in the Western, as it did from the beginning
in the Eastern Church. How to account for a different opinion in the Western
Church during the third and the fourth century, is difficult. Some think it was
owing to the Novalien Heresy, which some parts of this Epistle were supposed to
favor, though without any good reason.<br></div>
<div>As far then as the testimony of history goes, almost the whole weight of
evidence is in favor of Paul being the Author.<br></div>
<div>With regard to modern times, the prevailing opinion has been that it is the
Epistle of Paul. Luther, indeed, ascribed it to Apollos &#8212; a mere
conjecture. Calvin, as we find, supposed that either Luke or Clement was the
author; for which there are no satisfactory reasons. Beza differed from his
illustrious predecessor, and regarded Paul as the writer; and such has been the
opinion entertained by most of the successors of the Reformers, both in this
country and on the Continent, as proved by their confessions of Faith.<br></div>
<div>About the middle of the seventeenth century there seems to have been a
revival of the controversy; for in the year 1658 the younger Spanheim wrote an
elaborate treatise on the subject, in which he canvasses the whole evidence,
both historical and internal, and affords the strongest ground for the
conclusion that Paul was the writer of this Epistle. Since that time, till late
years, his arguments were regarded by most as conclusive. But some of the German
divines, who seem to have a taste for exploded opinions, have again revived the
question, produced afresh the old arguments, and added some new ones to them.
But a second Spanheim has appeared in the person of Professor Stuart, of
America, who has published a learned Commentary on this Epistle, and prefixed to
it a long Introduction, in which he has fully entered into the subject, and more
fully than his predecessor. The labor and toil which this Introduction must have
cost its author, were no doubt very great; for every argument, however
frivolous, (and some of the arguments are
<font color="Maroon"><i>very</i></font> frivolous indeed,) is noticed, and
everything plausible is most clearly exposed.<br></div>
<div>The evidence both external and internal is so satisfactory, that an
impression is left on the mind, that Paul was the author of this Epistle, nearly
equal to what his very name prefixed to it would have produced. Indeed the
writer can truly say, that he now entertains no more doubt on the subject than
if it had the Apostle&#8217;s own
superscription.<sup><font color="Maroon">F4</font></sup><br></div>
<div>As to the date of this Epistle, it is commonly supposed to have been
written late in 62 or early in 63, about the time that Paul was released from
his first imprisonment at Rome.<br></div>
<div>There seem to be especially two reasons why Paul did not commence this
Epistle in his usual manner: first, because he was not specifically an Apostle
to the Jews, but to the Gentiles; and secondly, because the contents of the
Epistle are such that it was not necessary for him to assume his Apostolic
character; for the arguments are founded on testimonies found in the Old
Testament, and not on his authority as a commissioned Apostle. His main object
appears to have been to show and prove that the Gospel is but a fulfillment of
the ancient Scriptures, which the Jews themselves received as divine. His
arguments and his examples are throughout borrowed from the Old Testament. This
is a fact that is too often overlooked, to which Macknight, in an especial
manner, very justly refers.<br></div>
<div>The Epistle begins by indicating a connection between the Old and the New
Testament: both are revelations from the same God; He who spoke by the Prophets
in the Old, speaks by His Son in the New. Then the obvious and inevitable
conclusion is, that the New is but the Old completed. It is on this ground that
the whole argument of the Epistle proceeds.<br></div>
<div>Having thus clearly intimated the connection between the two Testaments,
the Apostle immediately enters on his great subject &#8212; the superiority of
Him who introduced the perfected dispensation over all connected with the
previous incomplete, elementary, and, in a great measure, symbolical
dispensation, even over angels and Moses and the Levitical high-priest. And this
subject occupies the largest portion of the Epistle, extending from the
<font color="Maroon"><i>first</i></font> chapter to the 19th verse of the
<font color="Maroon"><i>tenth</i></font> chapter. From that verse to the end of
the Epistle, we have exhortations, warnings, examples of faith and patience,
admonitions, directions, and salutations.<br></div>
<div>Then the Epistle divides itself into two main parts: &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>1.</b></font> The didactic, including the
<font color="Maroon"><i>ten</i></font> first chapters, with the exception of the
latter part of the tenth.<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>2. </b></font>The parainetic or hortative, from the
19th verse of the tenth chapter to the end of the Epistle.<br></div>
<div>The first part may be thus divided, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>1. </b></font>Christ&#8217;s superiority over angels
&#8212; warnings -objections answered, ch. 1 and 2.<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>2. </b></font>Christ&#8217;s superiority over Moses
&#8212; warnings as to faith and the promised rest, ch. 3 and 4:13.<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>3. </b></font>Christ&#8217;s superiority over the
Levitical high-priest, as to his appointment, the perpetuity of his office, his
covenant, and the efficacy of his atonement, ch. 4:14, to 10:19.<br></div>
<div>The second part admits of these divisions, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>1. </b></font>Exhortation to
<font color="Maroon"><i>persevere</i></font>, derived from the free access in a
new way to God; from the awful fate of apostates; and from their own past
example, ch. 10:19-37.<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>2. </b></font>Exhortation to
<font color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font> and
<font color="Maroon"><i>patience</i></font>, derived from the example of the
ancient saints, ch. 10:38, to the end of ch. 11.<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>3. </b></font>Exhortation to encounter
<font color="Maroon"><i>trials</i></font> and
<font color="Maroon"><i>afflictions</i></font>, derived from the example of
Christ; and from the love of God, as manifested by afflictions, ch.
12:1-13.<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>4.</b></font> Exhortation to
<font color="Maroon"><i>peace</i></font> and
<font color="Maroon"><i>holiness</i></font>, derived from our superior
privileges, and the aggravated guilt of no electing Him who speaks to us from
heaven, ch. 12:14-29.<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>5.</b></font> Various directions and cautions,
requests and salutations, ch. 13.<br></div>
<div>The former part, the didactic, has many digressions, and hence the
difficulty sometimes of tracing the course of the Apostle&#8217;s reasoning. But
it was his practice as appears from his other epistles, to apply, as it were,
the subject, as he proceeds. Having in the
<font color="Maroon"><i>first</i></font> chapter proved the superiority of
Christ over angels, he points out at the beginning of the
<font color="Maroon"><i>second</i></font> the great danger of disregarding his
doctrine, and of neglecting his salvation, an inference drawn from what had been
previously proved. He then proceeds with the same subject, Christ&#8217;s
superiority over angels, answers an objection derived from his human nature, and
shows the necessity there was that he should become man; as he could not
otherwise have sympathized with lost creatures, nor have atoned for their Sins.
Here he first refers to him in express terms as a priest.<br></div>
<div>Then in ch. 3 he proceeds to show Christ&#8217;s superiority over Moses;
and having done so, he goes on in verse 7 to warn the Hebrews against following
the example of their forefathers, who, through unbelief, lost the land of
promise; and he pursues this subject to the end of the 13th verse of ch.
4.<br></div>
<div>The last section of the didactic part commences at ch. 4 and extends to
verse 19 of the tenth chapter; it occupies nearly
<font color="Maroon"><i>six</i></font> chapters, and contains several episodes,
so that it is sometimes no easy matter to trace the connection.<br></div>
<div>He begins this portion by calling attention to Christ as a high-priest,
whom he had before represented as such at the end of ch. 2; where he mentions
<font color="Maroon"><i>two</i></font> things respecting him &#8212; that he
became man, in order that he might atone for sin, and in order that he might be
capable of sympathizing with his people. But here he refers mainly to the
<font color="Maroon"><i>last</i></font>, to his sufferings; and in order to
anticipate an objection from the fact that he was a suffering Savior, he
mentions his appointment, which, according to the testimony of David in the Book
of Psalms, was to be according to the order of Melchisedec. Without going on
with this subject, he makes a digression, and evidently for the purpose of
making them more attentive to the explanation he was going to give of
Melchisedec as a type of Christ in his priesthood.<br></div>
<div>This digression contains several particulars. To arouse their attention and
stimulate them, he blames them for their ignorance, mentions the danger of
continuing satisfied with the knowledge of first principles, and the
impossibility of restoration in case of apostasy; he gives an illustration of
this from unproductive land after culture and rain; reminds them of their past
commendable conduct, and encourages them to activity and zeal by an assurance
respecting the certainty of Gods promises, ch. 5:12, to the end of ch.
6.<br></div>
<div>In chap. 7 he proceeds with Melchisedec as the type of Christ in his
priestly office. Christ is a priest according to his order, not according to
that of Aaron; then Aaron <font color="Maroon"><i>must</i></font> have been
superseded. According to the testimony of David, Christ&#8217;s priesthood
excelled that of Aaron in two things &#8212; it was established by an
<font color="Maroon"><i>oath</i></font>, and it was to he perpetuated
&#8220;forever,&#8221; ch. 7 to the end of the 25th verse.<br></div>
<div>He now goes on to the other part of this subject, to speak of Christ as
making an atonement for sin, ch. 7:26, having before spoken of him as a
sympathizing priest from the circumstance of having been a sufferer. While
speaking of his expiation, he refers to the covenant of which he was the
Mediator, for expiations depended on the covenant. Respecting the new covenant,
he quotes the express words of Jeremiah; and it included the remission of sins,
and remission of sins necessarily implies an expiation. Then in the
<font color="Maroon"><i>ninth</i></font> chapter he refers to the old covenant,
the tabernacle, and its services, and proves the insufficiency of these
services, they being only typical of what was to come. From the
<font color="Maroon"><i>tenth</i></font> chapter to the 19th verse he pursues
the same subject, and shows that the sacrifices under the Law were insufficient
for the remission of sins, and that this could only be obtained through the
Mediator of the new covenant promised by God through his prophet Jeremiah,
chapter. 7:26, to
chapter.10:19.<sup><font color="Maroon">F5</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Here the Apostle completes the <font color="Maroon"><i>first</i></font>
part, having stated at large in the last portion of it the claims of Christ as a
high-priest, and these claims are fully confirmed by the testimonies of the
ancient Scriptures. His arguments are such that it is impossible really to
understand and believe the Old Testament and to deny the New; the latter being
most evidently the fulfillment of the former. The Old Testament distinctly
speaks of another priesthood different from that of Aaron, and of another
covenant different from that made with the children of Israel, and of one which
would confer the remission of sins, which the other could not do. Now these are
the testimonies not of the New but of the Old Testament; and the New exhibits a
priest and a covenant exactly answerable to the priest and the covenant which
the Old Testament refers to and describes. Nothing can be more plain and more
conclusive than the Apostle&#8217;s arguments on this subject.<br></div>
<div>The parainetic or hortative portion of the Epistle, extending from chap.
10:19 to the end, requires no further explanation.<br></div>
<div>We especially learn from this Epistle that the distinctive character of the
old dispensation was symbolical, and of the new spiritual. The old abounded in
forms, rituals, and ceremonies; the new exhibits what these things signified and
typified. To have recourse again to symbols and rituals, is to prefer darkness
to light, to reverse the order of things, and to disregard a favor which kings
and prophets in ancient times desired to enjoy. This is not only an evidence of
fatuity, but it is also ingratitude and sin, and it ought never to be deemed as
innocent or harmless. Having the glorious light of the Gospel, let us walk in
the light, and never regard &#8220;beggarly elements&#8221; as things to be
perpetuated and admired.<br></div>
<div>This Commentary was translated into English by Clement Cotton, from the
French Version, and was published in 1605 under the following title: &#8212;

the Commentary on the Hebrews, &#8220;though not altogether suitable to modern
taste, is faithful, vigorous, idiomatic, and not inelegant.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>The &#8220;Epistle Dedicatorie&#8221; to Cotton&#8217;s patron, Robert
Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, and his Address &#8220;to the Reader,&#8221; have been

<div>Right Honorable, such has been the singular care and fatherly providence of
God over his church in these last times: that according to his own most gratious
promise (through the means of preaching and writing) knowledge has overflowed in
all places, as the waters that cover the sea. Hence it is come to pass, that
even this nation also, albeit utterly unworthy to receive so much as the least
sprincklings of this knowledge, has not withstanding been replenished and filled
therewith, almost from corner to corner. Many chosen and worthy instruments has
the Lord raised up here and there for this purpose. But amongst the rest, none
for whom there is greater cause of thankfulness, than for that rare and
excellent light of this age, <font color="Maroon"><i>Mr. Calvin</i></font>:
whether in respect of the large and many volumes, which with unwearable pains he
has written, or the exceeding fruits which the Churches have thereby gained. So
that all of sound judgment will acknowledge, that God had poured out upon him a
principal portion and measure of his spirit to profit with all,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461207&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 12:7.
Whereof, as his whole works give sufficient proofs, so his Commentaries
especially. For besides his sincerity and faithfulness in delivering the true
and natural sense of the holy Scriptures; he has this as peculiar to himself,
that with his faithfulness and sincerity he always matches an exceeding
plainness and gravity: whereby his Reader may obtain that he seeks, both with
great ease, and with very little loss of time.<br></div>
<div>Divers of these his Commentaries, Right Honorable, have been already
translated to the great benefit of this nation: others yet remain untranslated,
which doubtless would be no less beneficial. The which, as I have earnestly
desired; so, had gifts and means been in any measure answerable, it had been
performed ere this. For the present, I have been bold to give your Honor a small
taste thereof in these my poor first fruits: wherein although my pains are no
way sufficient to commend the same unto your Honor, yet I doubt not but the
matter itself will be found worthy of your H. patronage. For where are the
natures and offices of Christ so largely described; the doctrine of the free
remission of sins in Christ&#8217;s blood better established, or faith with her
effects more highly commended, than in this Epistle to the Hebrews?<br></div>
<div>Now as touching the reasons, Right Honorable, that have moved me hereunto,
they are briefly these; First, I was not ignorant what singular love and
affection your Honor bare to the author of this Commentary for his work&#8217;s
sake, whereof many also are witnesses. Unto which, if your Honor should be
pleased to add a second favor in Patronizing these his labors, I thought it
would be a special means to revive his memory again, now almost decayed amongst
us.<br></div>
<div>Secondly, I was persuaded that if your Lordship, whom it has pleased the
Almighty so highly to advance, being also a favorer and defender of the truth,
and of all good causes; would permit this works to pass under your Honors
protection: that it would be both better esteemed, and the more acceptably
received of all.<br></div>
<div>Lastly, my good Lord. As I cannot conceal that deep and inward affection of
love and duties which I owe unto your Honor, in regard of the near employments
which sometimes a dear friend of mine had about your Lordship in your young
years: so by this dedication it was my desire to testify part of a thankful
mind, in respect that you have not suffered neither length of time, nor your H.
weighty affairs in matters of state, to wear the same out of your Honorable
remembrance: as by the great favors your H. has lately showed in that behalf,
does plainly appear.<br></div>
<div>Thus in most humble manner craving pardon for my great boldness, I humbly
end; beseeching the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth, to pour out
the abundance of all blessings both upon you and yours in this life, and to
crown your H. and them with immortal blessedness in his kingdom of Gloria,
through Christ.<br></div>

<div><font size="7" color="Blue">TO THE READER</font><br></div>
<div>Dear Christian Reader, among the many helps wherewith God has furnished
thee for the furtherance of thy godly Meditations and spiritual growth in
Christ, I pray thee accept of this amongst the rest; of which (if I may so
speak) thou has been too long unfurnished. Diverse good and godly men have
labored, some by their own writings, and some again by translating the works of
others, to store thee with Sermons and Expositions in English, upon all the
books of the New Testament, this Epistle to the Hebrews lonely excepted: which
lack, rather than it should be unsupplied, has caused me (the unfittest I
confess at many thousands) to undertake the translation of the Commentary
ensuing: which being finished, I have been bold (for thy benefit Christian

<div>There are at this day many foolish men, who everywhere, through a vain
desire for writing, engage the minds of ignorant and thoughtless readers with
their trifles. And to this evil, most illustrious King, is added another
indignity &#8212; that while they inscribe to kings and princes their silly
things, to disguise, or at least to cover them by borrowed splendor, they not
only profane sacred names, but also impart to them some measure of their own
disgrace. Since the unreasonable temerity of such men makes it necessary for
serious and sober writers to frame an excuse, when they publicly dedicate their
labors to great men, while yet there is nothing in them but what corresponds
with the greatness of those to whom they are offered, it was necessary to make
this remark, lest I should seem to be of the number of those who allow
themselves, through the example of others, to render public anything they
please, however foolish it may be. But it has not escaped me how much it has the
appearance of foolish confidence, that I, (not to speak of other things,) who am
an unknown and obscure man, should not hesitate to address your royal Majesty.
Let my reasons be heard, and if you, O King, approve of what I do, what others
may judge will cause me no great anxiety.<br></div>
<div>First, then, though I am not forgetful of mine insignificance, nor ignorant
of the reverence due to your Majesty, yet the fame of your piety, which has
extended almost to all who are zealous for the sincere doctrine of Christ, is
alone sufficient to remorse any fear; for I bring with me a present which that
piety will not allow you to reject. Since the Epistle inscribed to the Hebrews
contains a full discussion respecting the eternal divinity of Christ, his
government, and only priesthood, (which are the main points of celestial
wisdom,) and as these things are so explained in it, that the whole power and
work of Christ are set forth in the most graphic manner, it deservedly ought to
obtain in the Church the place and the honor of an invaluable treasure. By you
also, who desire that the Son of God should reign alone and be glorified, I
doubt not but that it will be valued.<br></div>
<div>In the interpretation which I have undertaken, I say not that I have
succeeded; but I feel confident that when you have read it you will approve at
least of my fidelity and diligence. And as I claim not the praise of great
knowledge or of erudition, so what has been given me by the Lord for the purpose
of understanding the Scripture, (since this is to glory in him,) I am not
ashamed to profess; and if in this respect I have any capacity to assist the
Church of God, I have endeavored to give an evident proof of it in these my
labors. I therefore hope that the present (as I have said) which I offer will
not only avail, O King, as an excuse to your Majesty, but also procure for me no
small favor.<br></div>
<div>This may possibly be also a new encouragement to your Majesty, who is
already engaged in the work of restoring the kingdom of Christ, and to many who
live under your government to further the same work. Your kingdom is extensive
and renowned, and abounds in many excellences; but its happiness will then only
be solid, when it adopts Christ as its chief ruler and governor, so that it may
be defended by his safeguard and protection; for to submit your scepter to him,
is not inconsistent with that elevation in which you are placed; but it would be
far more glorious than all the triumphs of the world. For since among men
gratitude is deemed the proper virtue of a great and exalted mind, what in kings
can be more unbecoming than to be ungrateful to the Son, by whom they have been
raised to the highest degree of honor? It is, therefore, not only an honorable,
but more than a royal service, which raises us to the rank of angels, when the
throne of Christ is erected among us, so that his celestial voice becomes the
only rule for living and dying both to the highest and to the lowest. For though
at this day to obey the authority of Christ is the common profession, made
almost by all, yet there are very few who render this obedience of which they
boast.<br></div>
<div>Now this obedience cannot be rendered, except the whole of religion be
formed according to the infallible rule of his holy truth. But on this point
strange conflicts arise, while men, not only inflated with pride, but also
bewitched by monstrous madness, pay less regard to the unchangeable oracles of
our heavenly Master than to their own vain fictions; for whatever pretenses they
may set up, who oppose us and strive to assist the Roman Antichrist, the very
fountain of all the contentions, by which the Church for these thirty years has
been so sorely disturbed, will be found to be, that they who seek to be deemed
first among Christ&#8217;s disciples, cannot bear to submit to his truth.
Ambition as well as audacity has so far prevailed, that the truth of God lies
buried under innumerable lies, that all his institutions are polluted by the
basest corruptions; his worship is in every part vitiated, the doctrine of faith
is wholly subverted, the sacraments are adulterated, the government of the
Church is turned into barbarous tyranny, the abominable sale of sacred things
has been set up, the power of Christ has been abused for the purpose of
sustaining the tyranny of the ungodly, and in the place of Christianity is
substituted a dreadful profanation, full of the grossest mummeries of every
kind. When for these so many and so atrocious evils we bring this one remedy
&#8212; to hear the Son of God speaking from heaven, we are instantly opposed by
these Atlases, not those who support the Church on their shoulders, but who
elevate on high by vain boastings of empty titles an idol devised and formed by
themselves. They also adduce this as a pretext for their fierce recriminations,
that we by our appeals disturb the peace of the Church. When we come to know
things aright, we see that these subtle artifices devise for themselves a Church
wholly different from that of Christ! And what else is this but a wicked and
sacrilegious attempt to separate the body from its head? It hence appears how
frivolous is the boasting of many as to Christianity; for the greatest part
suffer themselves to be governed by nothing less than by the pure teaching of
the Gospel.<br></div>
<div>But what you acknowledge, O King, that in order that Christ may take an
entire possession of his own kingdom, it is necessary to clear away all
superstitions, is a proof of singular wisdom; and to undertake and attempt what
you judge to be thus necessary, is an evidence of rare virtue. That you are
indeed like another Hezekiah or Josiah, destined by God to restore shortly to
the kingdom of Poland a purer teaching of that gospel, which has been throughout
the world vitiated by the craft of Satan and perfidy of men, there are many
things which give almost a certain hope to all good men. For, to omit other
superior qualities, which even foreigners proclaim and men of your own kingdom
observe with great advantage, there has ever appeared in you a wonderful concern
for religion, and religion itself appears eminent in you in the present day. But
the chief thing is, that Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, has so irradiated
your mind with the light of his Gospel, that you understand that the true way of
governing the Church is no other than what is to be derived from him, and that
you at the same time know the difference between that genuine form of religion
which he has instituted, and that fictions and degenerate form which was
afterwards introduced; for you wholly understand that God&#8217;s worship has
been corrupted and deformed, as innumerable superstitions have crept in, that
the grace of Christ has been unworthily involved in great darkness, that the
virtue of his death has been annihilated, that he himself has been almost
lacerated and torn in pieces, that assurance of salvation has been plucked up by
the roots, that consciences have been miserably and even horribly vexed and
tormented, that wretched men have been led away from the sincere and right
worship of God into various and perplexed labyrinths, that the Church has been
cruelly and tyrannically oppressed; and, in short, that no real Christianity has
been left.<br></div>
<div>It is not to be believed, O most noble King, that you have been in vain
endowed by God with this knowledge; doubtless he has chosen you as his minister
for some great purposes. And it has hitherto happened through God&#8217;s
wonderful Providence that no innocent blood has been shed in the renowned
kingdom of Poland &#8212; no, not a drop, which by calling for vengeance might
retard so great a benefit. It was through the clemency and gentleness of King
Sigismund, of happy memory, the father of your Majesty, that this did not take
place; for, while the contagion of cruelty was spreading through the whole of
the Christian world, he kept his hands pure. But now your Majesty and some of
the most eminent of your princes not only receive Christ willingly when offered
to them, but anxiously desire him. I also see John a Lasco, born of a noble
family, carrying the torch to other nations.<br></div>
<div>The presumption of Eckius is by no means to be endured, who dedicated to
King Sigismund, the father of your Majesty, his book on The Sacrifice of the
Mass; for he thus, as far as he could, affixed a base blot to your illustrious
kingdom! At the same time, it was nothing strange in that
<font color="Maroon"><i>Silenus</i></font>, who, being the prince of drunkards,
was wont to vomit at the altar as well as at the dunghill. Now, by dedicating
this my labor to your Majesty, I shall at least effect this, that I shall wash
away from the name of Poland the base filth of
<font color="Maroon"><i>Eckius</i></font>, so that it may not stick where it has
been so unworthily fixed. And by doing so I shall not, as it seems to me, attain
a small object; and no book of Scripture could hardly be chosen so suitable for
such a purpose. For here our Apostle shows in an especial manner, that the
sacrifice which <font color="Maroon"><i>Eckius</i></font> advocates is
manifestly inconsistent with the priesthood of Christ. There is here, indeed, no
mention of the mass, which Satan had not then vomited out of hell. But by
bidding the Church to be satisfied with the one only true sacrifice which Christ
offered on the cross, that all rites of sacrificing might cease forever, he
doubtless closes the door against all their new glosses. The Apostle cries aloud
that Christ was sacrificed on the cross once for all, while
<font color="Maroon"><i>Eckius</i></font> feigns that this sacrifice is daily
renewed! The Apostle declares that the only Son of God was the fit priest to
offer himself to the Father, and hence he was constituted by an oath; but
<font color="Maroon"><i>Eckius</i></font> denies that he alone is the priest,
and transfers that function to hired sacrificers! At the same time, I am not
ignorant of the evasions by which they elude these and similar arguments; but
there is no fear that he will deceive any but those who are blind or who shun
the light. He was at the same time so inebriated with Thrasonic haughtiness that
he labored more in insolent boasting than in subtle demonstration. That I may
not, however, seem to triumph over a dead dog, I will add nothing more at
present than that my Commentary may serve to wipe off the filthy stain which
that unprincipled and Scottish man attempted to fix on the name of Poland; and
there is no fear that they who will read will be taken by his baits.<br></div>
<div>Moreover, as I wish not in offering this my labor to your Majesty, only to
show privately a regard for you, O King, but especially to make it known to the
whole world, it remains now for me humbly to implore your Majesty not to
repudiate what I do. If indeed a stimulus be thereby given to encourage your
pious endeavors, I shall think it an ample remuneration. Undertake, then, I
pray, O magnanimous King, under the auspicious banner of Christ, a work so
worthy of your royal elevation, as well as of your heroic virtue, so that the
eternal truth of God, by which his own glory and the salvation of men are
promoted, may, wherever thy kingdom spreads, recover its own authority, which
has been taken away by the fraudulent dealings of Antichrist. It is truly an
arduous work, and of such magnitude as is sufficient to fill even the wisest
with solicitude and fear.<br></div>
<div>But first, there is no danger which we ought not cheerfully to undergo, no
difficulty which we ought not resolutely to undertake, no conflicts in which we
ought not boldly to engage, in a cause so necessary. Secondly, as it is the
peculiar work of God, we ought not in this case to regard so much the extent of
human powers as the glory due to his power; so that, relying on that not only to
help us, but also to guide us, we may venture on things far beyond our own
strength; for the work of restoring and establishing the church is not without
reason everywhere assigned in Scripture to God. Besides, the work itself is
altogether divine; and as soon as any beginning is made, whatever arts of injury
Satan possesses, he employs them all either to stop or to delay a further
progress. And we know that the prince of this world has innumerable agents who
are ever ready to oppose the kingdom of Christ. Some are instigated by ambition,
others by gain. These contests try us in some degree in our humble condition;
but your majesty will have, no doubt, to experience far greater difficulties.
Therefore, all those who undertake to promote the doctrine of salvation and the
well-being of the Church must be armed with invincible firmness. But as this
business is above our strength, aid from heaven will be granted to us.<br></div>
<div>It is in the meantime our duty to have all these promises which everywhere
occur in Scripture inscribed on our hearts. The Lord who has himself as it were
by his own hand laid the foundations of the Church, will not suffer it to remain
in a decayed state, for he is represented as solicitous to restore it and to
repair its ruins; for, by speaking thus, he in effect promises that he will
never fail us when engaged in this work. As he would not have us to sit down as
idle spectators of his power, so the presence of his aid in sustaining the hands
which labor, clearly proves that he himself is the chief architect. What,
therefore, he so often repeats and inculcates, and not without reason, is, that
we are not to grow weary, however often we may have to contend with enemies, who
continually break forth into hostility; for they are, as we have said, almost
infinite in number, and in kinds various. But this one thing is abundantly
sufficient, that we have such an invincible Leader, that the more he is assailed
the greater will be the victories and triumphs gained by his power.<br></div>
<div>Farewell, invincible King. May the Lord Jesus rule you by the spirit of
wisdom, sustain you by the spirit of valor, bestow on you all kinds of
blessings, long preserve your Majesty in health and prosperity, and protect your
kingdom. Amen.<br></div>

<div><font size="7" color="Blue">THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font size="5" color="Green">THE ARGUMENT</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><b>ON THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS</b><br></div>
<div>NOT only various opinions were formerly entertained as to the author of
this Epistle, but it was only at a late period that it was received by the Latin
Churches. They suspected that it favored Novatus in denying pardon to the
fallen;<sup><font color="Maroon">F6</font></sup> but that this was a groundless
opinion will be shown by various passages. I, indeed, without hesitation, class
it among apostolical writings; nor do I doubt but that it has been through the
craft of Satan that any have been led to dispute its authority. There is,
indeed, no book in the Holy Scriptures which speaks so clearly of the priesthood
of Christ, so highly exalts the virtue and dignity of that only true sacrifice
which he offered by his death, so abundantly treats of the use of ceremonies as
well as of their abrogation, and, in a word, so fully explains that Christ is
the end of the Law. Let us not therefore suffer the Church of God nor ourselves
to be deprived of so great a benefit, but firmly defend the possession of
it.<br></div>
<div>Moreover, as to its author, we need not be very solicitous. Some think the
author to have been Paul, others Luke, others Barnabas, and others Clement, as
Jerome relates; yet Eusebius, in his sixth book of his Church History, mentions
only Luke and Clement. I well know that in the time of Chrysostom it was
everywhere classed by the Greeks among the Pauline Epistles; but the Latins
thought otherwise, even those who were nearest to the times of the
Apostles.<br></div>
<div>I indeed, can adduce no reason to show that Paul was its author; for they
who say that he designedly suppressed his name because it was hateful to the
Jews, bring nothing to the purpose; for why, then, did he mention the name of
Timothy as by this he betrayed himself. But the manner it of teaching, and the
style, sufficiently show that Paul was not the author; and the writer himself
confesses in the second chapter that he was one of the disciples of the
Apostles, which is wholly different from the way in which Paul spoke of himself.
Besides, what is said of the practice of catechizing in the sixth chapter, does
not well suit the time or age of Paul. There are other things which we shall
notice in their proper places.<br></div>
<div>What excuse is usually made as to the style I well know that is, that no
opinion can be hence formed, because the Greek is a translation made from the
Hebrew by Luke or someone else. But this conjecture can be easily refuted: to
pass by other places quoted from Scripture, on the supposition that the Epistle
was written in Hebrew, there would have been no allusion to the word Testament,
on which the writer so much dwells; what he says of a Testament, in the ninth
chapter, could not have been drawn from any other fountain than from the Greek
word; for <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diaqh&gt;kh</font> has two
meanings in Greek, while |berit| in Hebrew means only a covenant. This reason
alone is enough to convince men of sound judgment that the epistle was written
in the Greek languages. Now, what is objected on the other hand, that it is more
probable that the Apostle wrote to the Jews in their own language, has no weight
in it; for how few then understood their ancient language? Each had learned the
language of the country where he dwelt. Besides, the Greek was then more widely
known than all other languages. We shall proceed now to the Argument.<br></div>
<div>The object at the beginning is not to show to the Jews that Jesus, the son
of Mary, was the Christ, the Redeemer promised to them, for he wrote to those
who had already made a profession of Christ; that point, then, is taken as
granted. But the design of the writer was to prove what the office of Christ is.
And it hence appears evident, that by his coming an end was put to ceremonies.
It is necessary to draw this distinction; for as it would have been a
superfluous labor for the Apostle to prove to those who were already convinced
that he was the Christ who had appeared, so it was necessary for him to show
what he was, for they did not as yet clearly understand the end, the effect, and
the advantages of his coming; but being taken up with a false view of the Law,
they laid hold on the shadow instead of the substance. Our business with the
Papists is similar in the present day; for they confess with us that Christ is
the Son of God, the redeemer who had been promised to the world: but when we
come to the reality, we find that they rob him of more than one-half of his
power.<br></div>
<div>Now, the beginning is respecting the dignity of Christ; for it seemed
strange to the Jews that the Gospel should be preferred to the Law. And first
indeed he settles that point which was in dispute, that the doctrine brought by
Christ had the preeminence, for it was the fulfillment of all the prophecies.
But as the reverence in which they held Moses might have been a hindrance to
them, he shows that Christ was far superior to all others. And after having
briefly referred to those things in which he excelled others, he mentions by
name the angels, that with them he might reduce all to their proper rank. Thus
he advanced prudently in his course; for if he had begun with Moses, his
comparison would have been more disliked. But when it appears from Scripture
that celestial powers are subordinated to Christ, there is no reason why Moses
or any mortal being should refuse to be classed with them, so that the Son of
God may appear eminent above angels as well as men.<br></div>
<div>After having thus brought the angels under the power and dominion of
Christ, the Apostle having, as it were, gained confidence, declares that Moses
was so much inferior to him as a servant is to his master.<br></div>
<div>By thus setting Christ in the <font color="Maroon"><i>three first
chapters</i></font> in a supreme state of power, he intimates, that when he
speaks all ought to be silent, and that nothing should prevent us from seriously
attending to his doctrine. At the same time he sets him forth in the second
chapter as our brother in our flesh; and thus he allures us to devote ourselves
more willingly to him; and he also blends exhortations and threatening in order
to lead those to obedience who are tardy or perversely resist; and he continues
in this strain nearly to the end of the fourth chapter.<br></div>
<div>At the end of the <font color="Maroon"><i>fourth chapter</i></font> he
begins to explain the priesthood of Christ, which abolishes all the ceremonies
of the Law. But after having briefly showed how welcome that priesthood ought to
be to us, and how gladly we ought to acquiesce in it, he shortly turns aside to
reprove the Jews, because they stopped at the first elements of religion like
children; and he also terrifies them with a grievous and severe denunciation,
that there was danger lest they, if slothful to make progress, should at length
be rejected by the Lord. But he presently softens this asperity by saying, that
he hoped better things of them, in order that he might encourage them, whom he
had depressed, to make progress.<br></div>
<div>Then [in the <font color="Maroon"><i>seventh</i></font> chapter] he returns
to the priesthood; and first shows that it differed from the ancient priesthood
under the Law; secondly, that it was more excellent, because it succeeded it,
and was sanctioned by an oath, &#8212; because it is eternal, and remains for
ever efficacious, &#8212; because he who performs its duties is superior in
honor and dignity to Aaron and all the rest of the Levitical tribe; and he shows
that the type which shadowed forth all things was found in the person of
Melchisedec.<br></div>
<div>And in order to prove more fully that the ceremonies of the Law were
abrogated he mentions that the ceremonies were appointed, and also the
tabernacle, for a particular end, even that they might get forth the heavenly
prototype. Hence it follows, that they were not to be rested in unless we wish
to stop in the middle of our course, having no regard to the goal. On this
subject he quotes a passage from Jeremiah, in which a new covenant is promised,
which was nothing else than an improvement on the old. It hence follows, that
the old was weak and fading.<br></div>
<div>Having spoken of the likeness and similitude between the shadows and the
reality exhibited in Christ, he then concludes that all the rituals appointed by
Moses have been abrogated by the one only true sacrifice of Christ, because the
efficacy of this sacrifice is perpetual, and that not only the sanction of the
New Testament is made by it complete, but that it is also a true and a spiritual
accomplishment of that external priesthood which was in force under the
Law.<br></div>
<div>To this doctrine he again connects exhortation like a goad, that putting
aside all impediments they might receive Christ with due reverence.<br></div>
<div>As to the many examples he mentions in the
<font color="Maroon"><i>eleventh</i></font> chapter concerning the fathers, they
seem to me to have been brought forward for this purpose, &#8212; that the Jews
might understand, that if they were led from Moses to Christ, they would be so
far from departing from the fathers, that they would thus be especially
connected with them. For if the chief thing in them was faith, and the root of
all other virtues, it follows that this is especially that by which they should
be counted the children of Abraham and the Prophets; and that on the other hand
all are bastards who follow not the faith of the fathers. And this is no small
commendation of the Gospel, that by it we have union and fellowship with the
universal Church, which has been from the beginning of the world.<br></div>
<div>The <font color="Maroon"><i>two last</i></font> chapters contain various
precepts as to the way in which we ought to live: they speak of hope, of bearing
the cross, of perseverance, of gratitude towards God, of obedience, of mercy, of
the duties of love, of chastity, and of such like things. And lastly, he
concludes with prayer, and at the same time gives them a hope of his coming to
see them.<br></div>

the purpose of commending the doctrine taught by Christ; for it shows that we
ought not only reverently to receive it, but also to be satisfied with it alone.

then we to the fathers; and, thirdly, the various and manifold modes of speaking

established; for God, who is ever like himself, and whose word is the same, and
whose truth is unchangeable, has spoken as to both in common.<br></div>
<div>But we must notice the difference between us and the fathers; for God
formerly addressed them in a way different from that which he adopts towards us
now. And first indeed as to them he employed the prophets, but he has appointed
his Son to be an ambassador to us.<sup><font color="Maroon">F7</font></sup> Our
condition, then, in this respect, is superior to that of the fathers. Even Moses
is to be also classed among the prophets, as he is one of the number of those
who are inferior to the Son. In the manner also in which revelation was made, we
have an advantage over them. For the diversity as to visions and other means
adopted under the Old Testament, was an indication that it was not yet a fixed
state of things, as when matters are put completely in order. Hence he says,
<font color="Maroon"><i>multifariously and in many ways</i></font>&#8221;. God
would have indeed followed the same mode perpetually to the end, had the mode
been perfect and complete. It hence follows, that this variety was an evidence
of imperfection.<br></div>
<div>The two words I thus understand: I refer
<font color="Maroon"><i>multifariously</i></font> to a diversity as to times;
for the Greek word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">polumerw~v</font>
which we may render, &#8220;in many parts,&#8221; as the case usually is, when
we intend to speak more fully hereafter; but
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">polutropw~v</font> points out a
diversity, as I think, in the very manner
itself.<sup><font color="Maroon">F8</font></sup> And when he speaks of
<font color="Maroon"><i>the last times</i></font>, he intimates that there is no
longer any reason to expect any new revelation; for it was not a word in part
that Christ brought, but the final conclusion. It is in this sense that the
Apostles take <font color="Maroon"><i>the last times</i></font> and
<font color="Maroon"><i>the last days.</i></font> And Paul means the same when
he says, &#8220;Upon whom the ends of the world are come.&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461011&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 10:11.) If
God then has spoken now for the last time, it is right to advance thus far; so
also when you come to Christ, you ought not to go farther: and these two things
it is very needful for us to know. For it was a great hindrance to the Jews that
they did not consider that God had deferred a fuller revelation to another time;
hence, being satisfied with their own Law, they did not hasten forward to the
goal. But since Christ has appeared, an opposite evil began to prevail in the
world; for men wished to advance beyond Christ. What else indeed is the whole
system of Popery but the overleaping of the boundary which the Apostle has
fixed? As, then, the Spirit of God in this passage invites all to come as far as
Christ, so he forbids them to go beyond the last time which he mentions. In
short, the limit of our wisdom is made here to be the
Gospel.<sup><font color="Maroon">F9</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>2.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Whom he has appointed, heir,</i></font>
etc. He honors Christ with high commendations, in order to lead us to show him
reverence; for since the Father has subjected all things to him, we are all
under his authority. He also intimates that no good can be found apart from him,
as he is the heir of all things. It hence follows that we must be very miserable
and destitute of all good things except he supplies us with his treasures. He
further adds that this honor of possessing all things belongs by right to the
Son, because by him have all things been created. At the same time, these two
things<sup><font color="Maroon">F10</font></sup> are ascribed to Christ for
different reasons.<br></div>
<div>The world was created by him, as he is the eternal wisdom of God, which is
said to have been the director of all his works from the beginning; and hence is
proved the eternity of Christ, for he must have existed before the world was
created by him. If, then, the duration of his time be inquired of, it will be
found that it has no beginning. Nor is it any derogation to his power that he is
said to have created the world, as though he did not by himself create it.
According to the most usual mode of speaking in Scripture, the Father is called
the Creator; and it is added in some places that the world was created by
wisdom, by the word, by the Son, as though wisdom itself had been the creator,
[or the word, or the Son.] But still we must observe that there is a difference
of persons between the Father and the Son, not only with regard to men, but with
regard to God himself. But the unity of essence requires that whatever is
peculiar to Deity should belong to the Son as well as to the Father, and also
that whatever is applied to God only should belong to both; and yet there is
nothing in this to prevent each from his own peculiar properties.<br></div>
<div>But the word <font color="Maroon"><i>heir</i></font> is ascribed to Christ
as manifested in the flesh; for being made man, he put on our nature, and as
such received this heirship, and that for this purpose, that he might restore to
us what we had lost in Adam. For God had at the beginning constituted man, as
his Son, the heir of all good things; but through sin the first man became
alienated from God, and deprived himself and his posterity of all good things,
as well as of the favor of God. We hence only then begin to enjoy by right the
good things of God, when Christ, the universal heir, admits to a union with
himself; for he is an heir that he may endow us with his riches. But the Apostle
now adorns him with this title, that we may know that without him we are
destitute of all good things.<br></div>
<div>If you take <font color="Maroon"><i>all</i></font> in the masculine gender,
the meaning is, that we ought all to be subject to Christ, because we have been
given to him by the Father. But I prefer reading it in the neuter gender; then
it means that we are driven from the legitimate possession of all things, both
in heaven and on earth, except we be united to Christ.<br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><b>3.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Who being the brightness of his
glory,</i></font> etc. These things are said of Christ partly as to his divine
essence, and partly as a partaker of our flesh. When he is
called<font color="Maroon"><i> the brightness of his glory and the impress of
his substance,</i></font> his divinity is referred to; the other things
appertain in a measure to his human nature. The whole, however, is stated in
order to set forth the dignity of Christ.<br></div>
<div>But it is for the same reason that the Son is said to be &#8220;the
brightness of his glory&#8221;, and &#8220;the impress of his substance:&#8221;
they are words borrowed from nature. For nothing can be said of things so great
and so profound, but by similitudes taken from created things. There is
therefore no need refinedly to discuss the question how the Son, who has the
same essence with the Father, is a brightness emanating from his light. We must
allow that there is a degree of impropriety in the language when what is
borrowed from created things is transferred to the hidden majesty of God. But
still the things which are indent to our senses are fitly applied to God, and
for this end, that we may know what is to be found in Christ, and what benefits
he brings to us.<br></div>
<div>It ought also to be observed that frivolous speculations are not here
taught, but an important doctrine of faith. We ought therefore to apply these
high titles given to Christ for our own benefit, for they bear a relation to us.
When, therefore, thou hear that the Son is the brightness of the Father&#8217;s
glory, think thus with thyself, that the glory of the Father is invisible until
it shines forth in Christ, and that he is called the impress of his substance,
because the majesty of the Father is hidden until it shows itself impressed as
it were on his image. They who overlook this connection and carry their
philosophy higher, weary themselves to no purpose, for they do not understand
the design of the Apostle; for it was not his object to show what likeness the
Father bears to the Son; but, as I have said, his purpose was really to build up
our faith, so that we may learn that God is made known to us in no other way
than in Christ:<sup><font color="Maroon">F11</font></sup> for as to the essence
of God, so immense is the brightness that it dazzles our eyes, except it shines
on us in Christ. It hence follows, that we are blind as to the light of God,
until in Christ it beams on us. It is indeed a profitable philosophy to learn
Christ by the real understanding of faith and experience. The same view, as I
have said is to be taken of &#8220;the impress;&#8221; for as God is in himself
to us incomprehensible, his form appears to us only in his
Son.<sup><font color="Maroon">F12</font></sup><br></div>
<div>The word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpau&gt;gasma</font> means
here nothing else but visible light or refulgence, such as our eyes can bear;
and <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">carakth&lt;r</font> is the vivid form
of a hidden substance. By the first word we are reminded that without Christ
there is no light, but only darkness; for as God is the only true light by which
it behaves us all to be illuminated, this light sheds itself upon us, so to
speak, only by irradiation. By the second word we are reminded that God is truly
and really known in Christ; for he is not his obscure or shadowy image, but his
impress which resembles him, as money the impress of the die with which it is
stamped. But the Apostle indeed says what is more than this, even that the
substance of the Father is in a manner engraven on the
Son.<sup><font color="Maroon">F13</font></sup><br></div>
<div>The word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">u~posta&gt;siv</font>
which, by following others, I have rendered substance, denotes not, as I think,
the being or essence of the Father, but his person; for it would be strange to
say that the essence of God is impressed on Christ, as the essence of both is
simply the same. But it may truly and fitly be said that whatever peculiarly
belongs to the Father is exhibited in Christ, so that he who knows him knows
what is in the Father. And in this sense do the orthodox fathers take this term,
<font color="Maroon"><i>hypostasis</i></font>, considering it to be threefold in
God, while the essence
(<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oujsi&gt;a)</font> is simply one.
<font color="Maroon"><i>Hilary</i></font> everywhere takes the Latin word
substance for person. But though it be not the Apostle&#8217;s object in this
place to speak of what Christ is in himself, but of what he is really to us, yet
he sufficiently confutes the Asians and Sabellians; for he claims for Christ
what belongs to God alone, and also refers to two distinct persons, as to the
Father and the Son. For we hence learn that the Son is one God with the Father,
and that he is yet in a sense distinct from him, so that a subsistence or person
belongs to both.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>And upholding (or bearing) all things,</i></font>
etc. To uphold or to bear here means to preserve or to continue all that is
created in its own state; for he intimates that all things would instantly come
to nothing, were they not sustained by his power. Though the pronoun
<font color="Maroon"><i>his</i></font> may be referred to the Father as well as
to the Son, as it may be rendered &#8220;his own,&#8221; yet as the other
exposition is more commonly received, and well suits the context, I am disposed
to embrace it. Literally it is, &#8220;by the word of his power;&#8221; but the
genitive, after the Hebrew manner, is used instead of an adjective; for the
perverted explanation of some, that Christ sustains all things by the word of
the Father, that is, by himself who is the word, has nothing in its favor:
besides, there is no need of such forced explanation; for Christ is not wont to
be called <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">rJh~ma,</font> saying, but
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">lo&gt;gov,</font>
word.<sup><font color="Maroon">F14</font></sup> Hence the &#8220;word&#8221;
here means simply a nod; and the sense is, that Christ who preserves the whole
world by a nod only, did not yet refuse the office of effecting our
purgation.<br></div>
<div>Now this is the second part of the doctrine handled in this Epistle; for a
statement of the whole question is to be found in these two chapters, and that
is, that Christ, endued with supreme authority, ought to be head above all
others, and that as he has reconciled us to his Father by his own death, he has
put an end to the ancient sacrifices. <font face="Palatino">And so the first
point, though a general proposition, is yet a twofold clause.</font><br></div>
<div>When he further says, <font color="Maroon"><i>by himself,</i></font> there
is to be understood here a contrast, that he had not been aided in this by the
shadows of the Mosaic Law. He shows besides a difference between him and the
Levitical priests; for they also were said to expiate sins, but they derived
this power from another. In short, he intended to exclude all other means or
helps by stating that the price and the power of purgation were found only in
Christ.  <sup><font color="Maroon">F15</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Sat down on the right hand,</i></font> etc.; as
though he had said, that having in the world procured salvation for men, he was
received into celestial glory, in order that he might govern all things. And he
added this in order to show that it was not a temporary salvation he has
obtained for us; for we should otherwise be too apt to measure his power by what
now appears to us. He then reminds us that Christ is not to be less esteemed
because he is not seen by our eyes; but, on the contrary, that this was the
height of his glory, that he has been taken and conveyed to the highest seat of
his empire. <font color="Maroon"><i>The right hand</i></font> is by a similitude
applied to God, though he is not confined to any place, and has not a right side
nor left. The session then of Christ means nothing else but the kingdom given to
him by the Father, and that authority which Paul mentions, when he says that in
his name every knee should bow.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502910&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 2:10) Hence to
sit at the right hand of the Father is no other thing than to govern in the
place of the Father, as deputies of princes are wont to do to whom a full power
over all things is granted. And the word
<font color="Maroon"><i>majesty</i></font> is added, and also
<font color="Maroon"><i>on high,</i></font> and for this purpose, to intimate
that Christ is seated on the supreme throne whence the majesty of God shines
forth. As, then, he ought to be loved on account of his redemption, so he ought
to be adored on account of his royal
magnificence.<sup><font color="Maroon">F16</font></sup><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div>4.<font color="Maroon"><i> Being made so much better,</i></font> etc. After
having raised Christ above Moses and all others, he now amplifies His glory by a
comparison with angels. It was a common notion among the Jews, that the Law was
given by angels; they attentively considered the honorable things spoken of them
everywhere in Scripture; and as the world is strangely inclined to superstition,
they obscured the glory of God by extolling angels too much. It was therefore
necessary to reduce them to their own rank, that they might not overshadow the
brightness of Christ. And first he proves from his name, that Christ far
excelled them, for he is called the Son of God; 
<sup><font color="Maroon">F17</font></sup> and that he was distinguished by this
title he shows by two testimonies from Scripture, both of which must be examined
by us; and then we shall sum up their full import.<br></div>
<div>5. <font color="Maroon"><i>Thou art my Son,</i></font>
<font face="Palatino">etc.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> </font></sup>It
cannot be denied but that this was spoken of David, that is, as he sustained the
person of Christ. Then the things found in this Psalm must have been shadowed
forth in David, but were fully accomplished in Christ. For that he by subduing
many enemies around him, enlarged the borders of his kingdom, it was some
foreshadowing of the promise, &#8220;I will give thee the heathen for thine
inheritance.&#8221; But how little was this in comparison with the amplitude of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom, which extends from the east to the west? For the same
reason David was called the son of God, having been especially chosen to perform
great things; but his glory was hardly a spark, even the smallest, to that glory
which shone forth in Christ, on whom the Father has imprinted his own image. So
the name of Son belongs by a peculiar privilege to Christ alone, and cannot in
this sense be applied to any other without profanation, for him and no other has
the Father sealed.<br></div>
<div>But still the argument of the Apostle seems not to be well-grounded; for
how does he maintain that Christ is superior to angels except on this ground,
that he has the name of a Son? As though indeed he had not this in common with
princes and those high in power, of whom it is written, &#8220;Ye are gods and
the sons of the most&#8221;,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195006&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 50:6;) and as though
Jeremiah had not spoken as honorably of all Israel, when he called them the
firstborn of God. (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243109&gt;</font></sup>Jeremiah
31:9.) They are indeed everywhere called children or sons. Besides, David calls
angels the sons of God;<br></div>
<div align="center"><font color="Navy">&#8220;Who,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is
like to Jehovah among the sons of God?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198406&gt;</font></sup><font color="Navy">Psalm
84:6.)</font><br></div>
<div>The answer to all this is in no way difficult. Princes are called by this
name on account of a particular circumstance; as to Israel, the common grace of
election is thus denoted; angels are called the sons of God as having a certain
resemblance to him, because they are celestial spirits and possess some portion
of divinity in their blessed immortality. But when David without any addition
calls himself as the type of Christ the Son of God, he denotes something
peculiar and more excellent than the honor given to angels or to princes, or
even to all Israel. Otherwise it would have been an improper and absurd
expression, if he was by way of excellence called the son of God, and yet had
nothing more than others; for he is thus separated from all other beings. When
it is said so exclusively of Christ, &#8220;Thou art my Son,&#8221; it follows
that this honor does not belong to any of the angels. 
<sup><font color="Maroon">F18</font></sup><br></div>
<div>If any one again objects and says, that David was thus raised above the
angels; to this I answer, that it is nothing strange for him to be elevated
above angels while bearing the image of Christ; for in like manner there was no
wrong done to angels when the high-priest, who made an atonement for sins, was
called a mediator. They did not indeed obtain that title as by right their own;
but as they represented the kingdom of Christ, they derived also the name from
him. Moreover, the sacraments, though in themselves lifeless, are yet honored
with titles which angels cannot claim without being guilty of sacrilege. It is
hence evident that the argument derived from the term Son, is well grounded. 
<sup><font color="Maroon">F19</font></sup><br></div>
<div>As to his being <font color="Maroon"><i>begotten,</i></font> we must
briefly observe, that it is to be understood relatively here: for the subtle
reasoning of Augustine is frivolous, when he imagines that
<font color="Maroon"><i>today</i></font> means perpetuity or eternity. Christ
doubtless is the eternal Son of God, for he is wisdom, born before time; but
this has no connection with this passage, in which respect is had to men, by
whom Christ was acknowledged to be the Son of God after the Father had
manifested him. Hence that declaration or manifestation which Paul mentions in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450104&gt;</font></sup>Romans 1:4, was, so to
speak, a sort of an external begetting; for the hidden and internal which had
preceded, was unknown to men; nor could there have been any account taken of it,
had not the Father given proof of it by a visible manifestation. 
<sup><font color="Maroon">F20</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>I will be to him a Father,</i></font> etc. As to
this second testimony the former observation holds good. Solomon is here
referred to, and though he was inferior to the angels, yet when God promised to
be his Father, he was separated from the common rank of all others; for he was
not to be to him a Father as to one of the princes, but as to one who was more
eminent than all the rest. By the same privilege he was made a
<font color="Maroon"><i>Son</i></font>; all others were excluded from the like
honor. But that this was not said of Solomon otherwise than as a type of Christ,
is evident from the context; for the empire of the whole world is destined for
the Son mentioned there, and perpetuity is also ascribed to his empire: on the
other hand, it appears that the kingdom of Solomon has confined within narrow
bounds, and was so far from being perpetual, that immediately after his death it
was divided, and some time afterwards it fell altogether. Again, in that Psalm
the sun and moon are summoned as witnesses, and the Lord swears that as long as
they shall shine in the heavens, that kingdom shall remain safe: and on the
other hand, the kingdom of David in a short time fell into decay, and at length
utterly perished. And further, we may easily gather from many passages in the
Prophets, that that promise was never understood otherwise than of Christ; so
that no one can evade by saying that this is a new comment; for hence also has
commonly prevailed among the Jews the practice of calling Christ the Son of
David.<br></div>
<div><b>6.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And again, when he bringeth or
introduceth</i></font> 
<sup><font color="Maroon">F21</font></sup><font color="Maroon"><i>,</i></font>
etc. He now proves by another argument that Christ is above the angels, and that
is because the angels are bidden to worship him.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;199707&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 97:7.) It hence
follows that he is their head and Prince. But it may seem unreasonable to apply
that to Christ which is spoken of God only. Were we to answer that Christ is the
eternal God, and therefore what belongs to God may justly be applied to him, it
would not perhaps be satisfactory to all; for it would avail but little in
proving a doubtful point, to argue in this case from the common attributes of
God.<br></div>
<div>The subject is Christ manifested in the flesh, and the Apostle expressly
says, that the Spirit thus spoke when Christ was introduced into the world; but
this would not have been said consistently with truth except the manifestation
of Christ be really spoken of in the Psalm. And so the case indeed is; for the
Psalm commences with an exhortation to rejoice; nor did David address the Jews,
but the whole earth, including the islands, that is, countries beyond the sea.
The reason for this joy is given, because the Lord would
<font color="Maroon"><i>reign</i></font>. Further, if you read the whole Psalm,
you will find nothing else but the kingdom of Christ, which began when the
Gospel was published; nor is the whole Psalm anything else but a solemn decree,
as it were, by which Christ was sent to take possession of His kingdom. Besides,
what joy could arise from His kingdom, except it brought salvation to the whole
world, to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews? Aptly then does the Apostle say
here, that he was introduced into the world, because in that Psalm what is
described is his coming to men.<br></div>
<div>The Hebrew word, rendered angels, is Elohim &#8212; gods; but there is no
doubt but that the Prophet speaks of angels; for the meaning is, that there is
no power so high but must be in subjection to the authority of this king, whose
advent was to cause joy to the whole world. <br></div>

<div><b>7.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And to the angels,</i></font> etc. To the
angels means <font color="Maroon"><i>of</i></font> the angels. But the passage
quoted seems to have been turned to another meaning from what it appears to
have; for as David is there describing the manner in which we see the world to
be governed, nothing is more certain than the winds are mentioned, which he says
are made messengers by the Lord, for he employs them as his runners; so also,
when he purifies the air by lightnings, he shows what quick and swift ministers
he has to obey his orders. But this has nothing to do with angels. Some have had
recourse to an allegory, as though the Apostle explained the plain, and as they
say, the literal sense allegorically of angels. But it seems preferable to me to
consider this testimony is brought forward for this purpose, that it might by a
similitude be applied to angels, and in this way David compares winds to angels,
because they perform offices in this world similar to what the angels do in
heaven; for the winds are, as it were, visible spirits. And, doubtless, as
Moses, describing the creation of the world, mentioned only those things which
are subject to our senses, and yet intended that higher things should be
understood; so David in describing the world and nature, represented to us on a
tablet what ought to be understood respecting the celestial orders. Hence I
think that the argument is one of likeness or similarity, when the Apostle
transfers to angels what properly applies to the winds. 
<sup><font color="Maroon">F22</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>8.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But to the Son,</i></font> etc. It must
indeed be allowed, that this Psalm was composed as a marriage song for Solomon;
for here is celebrated his marriage with the daughter of the king of Egypt; 
<sup><font color="Maroon">F23</font></sup> but it cannot yet be denied but that
what is here related, is much too high to be applied to Solomon. The Jews, that
they may not be forced to own Christ to be called God, make an evasion by
saying, it at the throne of God is spoken of, or that the verb
&#8220;established&#8221; is to be understood. So that, according to the first
exposition, the word Elohim, God, is to be in construction with throne,
&#8220;the throne of God;&#8221; and that according to the second, it is
supposed to be a defective sentence. But these are mere evasions. Whosoever will
read the verse, who is of a sound mind and free from the spirit of contention,
cannot doubt but that the Messiah is called God. Nor is there any reason to
object, that the word Elohim is sometimes given to angels and to judges; for it
is never found to be given simply to one person, except to God alone. 
<sup><font color="Maroon">F24</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Farther, that I may not contend about a word, whose throne can be said to
be established <font color="Maroon"><i>forever</i></font>, except that of God
only? Hence the perpetuity of his kingdom is an evidence of his
divinity.<br></div>
<div>The <font color="Maroon"><i>scepter</i></font> of Christ&#8217;s kingdom is
afterwards called the scepter of righteousness; of this there were some, though
obscure, lineaments in Solomon; he exhibited them as far as he acted as a just
king and zealous for what was right. But righteousness in the kingdom of Christ
has a wider meaning; for he by his gospel, which is his spiritual scepter,
renews us after the righteousness of God. The same thing must be also understood
of his <font color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font> of righteousness; for he causes
it to reign in his own people, because he loves it.<br></div>
<div><b>9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore God has appointed
him,</i></font> etc. This was indeed truly said of Solomon, who was made a king,
because God had preferred him to his brethren, who were otherwise his equals,
being the sons of the king. But this applies more suitably to Christ, who has
adopted us as his joint heirs, though not so in our own right. But he was
anointed above us all, as it was beyond measure, while we, each of us, according
to a limited portion, as he has divided to each of us. Besides, he was anointed
for our sake, in order that we may all draw out of his fatness. Hence he is the
Christ, we are Christians proceeding from him, as rivulet from a fountain. But
as Christ received this unction when in the flesh, he is said to have been
anointed by his God; for it would be inconsistent to suppose him inferior to
God, except in his human
nature.<sup><font color="Maroon">F25</font></sup><br></div>

<div><b>10.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And, Thou, Lord, in the
beginning,</i></font> etc. This testimony at first sight may seem to be unfitly
applied to Christ, especially in a doubtful matter, such as is here handled; for
the subject in dispute is not concerning the glory of God, but what may be fitly
applied to Christ. Now, there is not in this passage any mention made of Christ,
but the majesty of God alone is set forth. I indeed allow that Christ is not
named in any part of the Psalm; but it is yet plain that he is so pointed out,
that no one can doubt but that his kingdom is there avowedly recommended to us.
Hence all the things which are found there, are to be applied to his person; for
in none have they been fulfilled but in Christ, such as the following, &#8212;
&#8220;Thou shalt arise and have mercy on Sion, that the heathens may fear the
name, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.&#8221; Again, &#8212;
&#8220;When the nations shall be gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve
the Lord.&#8221; Doubtless, in vain shall we seek to find this God through whom
the whole world have united in one faith and worship of God, except in
Christ.<br></div>
<div>All the other parts of the Psalm exactly suit the person of Christ, such as
the following, that he is the eternal God, the creator of heaven and earth, that
perpetuity belongs to him without any change, by which his majesty is raised to
the highest elevation, and he himself is removed from the rank of all created
beings.<br></div>
<div>What David says about the heavens perishing, some explain by adding,
&#8220;Were such a thing to happen,&#8221; as though nothing was affirmed. But
what need is there of such a strained explanation, since we know that all
creatures are subjected to vanity? For to what purpose is that renovation
promised, which even the heavens wait for with the strong desire as of those in
travail, except that they are now verging towards destruction?<br></div>
<div>But the perpetuity of Christ which is here mentioned, brings no common
comfort to the godly; as the Psalm at last teaches us, they shall be partakers
of it, inasmuch as Christ communicates himself and what he possesses to his own
body.<sup><font color="Maroon">F26</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>13.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But to whom of the angels,</i></font>
etc. He again by another testimony extols the excellency of Christ, that it
might hence be evident how much he is above the angels. The passage is taken
from Psalms 110:1, and it cannot be explained of any but of Christ. For as it
was not lawful for kings to touch the priesthood, as is testified by the leprosy
of Uzziah; and as it appears that neither David, nor any other of his successors
in the kingdom, was ordained a priest, it follows, that a new kingdom as well as
a new priesthood is here introduced, since the same person is made a king and a
priest. Besides, the eternity of the priesthood is suitable to Christ
alone.<br></div>
<div>Now, in the beginning of the Psalm he is set at God&#8217;s right hand.
This form of expression, as I have already said, means the same, as though it
was said, that the second place was given him by the Father; for it is a
metaphor which signifies that he is the Father&#8217;s vicegerent and his chief
minister in exercising authority, so that the Father rules through him. No one
of the angels bears so honorable an office; hence Christ far excels
all.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Until I make,</i></font> etc. As there are never
wanting enemies to oppose Christ&#8217;s kingdom, it seems not to be beyond the
reach of danger, especially as they who attempt to overthrow it possess great
power, have recourse to various artifices, and also make all their attacks with
furious violence. Doubtless, were we to regard things as they appear, the
kingdom of Christ would seem often to be on the verge of ruin. But the promise,
that Christ shall never be thrust from his seat, takes away from us every fear;
for ho will lay prostrate all his enemies. These two things, then, ought to be
borne in mind, &#8212; that the kingdom of Christ shall never in this world be
at rest, but that there will be many enemies by whom it will be disturbed; and
secondly, that whatever its enemies may do, they shall never prevail, for the
session of Christ at God&#8217;s right hand will not be for a time, but to the
end of the world, and that on this account all who will not submit to his
authority shall be laid prostrate and trodden under his feet<br></div>
<div>If any one asks, whether Christ&#8217;s kingdom shall come to an end, when
all his enemies shall be subdued; I give this answer, &#8212; that his kingdom
shall be perpetual, and yet in such a way as Paul intimates in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461525&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 15:25; for we
are to take this view, &#8212; that God who is not known to us in Christ, will
then appear to us as he is in himself. And yet Christ will never cease to be the
head of men and of angels; nor will there be any diminution of his honor. But
the solution of this question must be sought from that passage.<br></div>
<div><b>14.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Are they not all,</i></font> etc. That
the comparison might appear more clearly, he now mentions what the condition of
angels is. For calling them <font color="Maroon"><i>spirits,</i></font> he
denotes their eminence; for in this respect they are superior to corporal
creatures. But the office
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">(leitourgi&gt;a)</font> which he
immediately mentions reduces them to their own rank, as it is that which is the
reverse of dominion; and this he still more distinctly states, when he says,
that they are sent to <font color="Maroon"><i>minister.</i></font> The first
word means the same, as though ale had said, that they were officials; but to
<font color="Maroon"><i>minister</i></font> imports what is more humble and
abject.<sup><font color="Maroon">F27</font></sup> The service which God allots
to angels is indeed honorable; but the very fact that they serve, shows that
they are far inferior to Christ, who is the Lord of all.<br></div>
<div>If any one objects and says, that Christ is also called in many places both
a servant and a minister, not only to God, but also to men, the reply may be
readily given; his being a servant was not owing to his nature, but to a
voluntary humility, as Paul testifies,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 2:7;) and at
the same time his sovereignty remained to his nature; but angels, on the other
hand, were created for this end, &#8212; that they might serve, and to minister
is what belongs to their condition. The difference then is great; for what is
natural to them is, as it were, adventitious or accidental to Christ, because he
took our flesh; and what necessarily belongs to them, he of his own accord
undertook. Besides, Christ is a minister in such a way, that though he is in our
flesh nothing is diminished from the majesty of his
dominion.<sup><font color="Maroon">F28</font></sup><br></div>
<div>From this passage the faithful receive no small consolation; for they hear
that celestial hosts are assigned to them as ministers, in order to secure their
salvation. It is indeed no common pledge of God&#8217;s love towards us, that
they are continually engaged in our behalf. Hence also proceeds a singular
confirmation to our faith, that our salvation being defended by such guardians,
is beyond the reach of danger. Well then has God provided for our infirmities by
giving us such assistants to oppose Satan, and to put forth their power in every
way to defend us!<br></div>
<div>But this benefit he grants especially to his chosen people; hence that
angels may minister to us, we must be the members of Christ. Yet some
testimonies of Scripture may on the other hand be adduced, to show that angels
are sometimes sent forth for the sake of the reprobate; for mention is made by
Daniel of the angels of the Persians and the Greeks.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;271020&gt;</font></sup>Daniel 10:20.) But to this
I answer, that they were in such a way assisted by angels, that the Lord might
thus promote the salvation of his own people; for their success and their
victories had always a reference to the benefit of the Church. This is certain,
that as we have been banished by sin from God&#8217;s kingdom, we can have no
communion with angels except through the reconciliation made by Christ; and this
we may see by the ladder shown in a vision to the patriarch Jacob.<br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><b>1.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Therefore we ought,</i></font> etc. He
now declares what he had before in view, by comparing Christ with angels, even
to secure the highest authority to his doctrine. For if the Law given through
angels could not have been received with contempt, and if its transgression was
visited with severe punishment, what is to happen, he asks, to the despisers of
that gospel, which has the Son of God as its author, and was confirmed by so
many miracles? The import of the whole is this, that the higher the dignity of
Christ is than that of angels, the more reverence is due to the Gospel than to
the Law. Thus he commends the doctrine by mentioning its author.<br></div>
<div>But should it seem strange to any one, that as the doctrine both of the Law
and of the Gospel is from God, one should be preferred to the other; inasmuch as
by having the Law lowered the majesty of God would be degraded; the evident
answer would be this, &#8212; that he ought indeed always to be heard with equal
attention whenever he may speak, and yet that the fuller he reveals himself to
us, it is but right that our reverence and attention to obedience should
increase in proportion to the extent of his revelations; not that God is in
himself less at one time than at another; but his greatness is not at all times
equally made known to us.<br></div>
<div>Here also another question arises. Was not the Law also given by Christ? If
so, the argument of the Apostle seems not to be well grounded. To this I reply,
that in this comparison regard is had to a veiled revelation on one side, and to
that which is manifest on the other. Now, as Christ in bringing the Law showed
himself but obscurely or darkly, and as it were under coverings, it is nothing
strange that the Law should be said to have been brought by angels without any
mention being made of his name; for in that transaction he never appeared
openly; but in the promulgation of the Gospel his glory was so conspicuous, that
he may justly be deemed its author.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Lest at any time we should let them
slip,</i></font> or, &#8220;lest we should at any time flow abroad,&#8221; or,
if you prefer, &#8220;let dip,&#8221; though in reality there is not much
difference. The true sense is to be gathered from the contrast; for to give
heed, or to attend and to let slip, are opposites; the first means to hold a
thing, and the other to let off like a sieve, or a perforated vessel, whatever
may be poured into it. I do not indeed approve of the opinion of those who take
it in the sense of dying, according to what we find in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;101514&gt;</font></sup>2 Samuel 15:14, &#8220;We
all die and slide away like water.&#8221; On the contrary, we ought, as I have
said, to regard the contrast between attention and flowing out; an attentive
mind is like a vessel capable of holding water; but that which is roving and
indolent is like a vessel with
holes.<sup><font color="Maroon">F28a</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>2.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Steadfast,</i></font> or
&#8220;firm,&#8221; or sure, etc.; that is, it was the word of authority, for
God required it to be believed; and that it was authoritative, was made more
evident by its sanctions; for no one despised the law with impunity. Then
firmness means authority; and what is added respecting punishment ought to be
understood as explanatory; for it is evident the doctrine of which God shows
himself to be the avenger, is by no means unprofitable or unimportant.<br></div>
<div><b>3.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>If we neglect so great a
salvation,</i></font> etc. Not only the rejection of the Gospel, but also its
neglect, deserves the heaviest punishment, and that on account of the greatness
of the grace which it offers; hence he says, <font color="Maroon"><i>so great a
salvation.</i></font> God would indeed leave his gifts valued by us according to
their worth. Then the more precious they are, the baser is our ingratitude when
we do not value them. In a word, in proportion to the greatness of Christ will
be the severity of God&#8217;s vengeance on all the despisers of his
Gospel.<sup><font color="Maroon">F29</font></sup><br></div>
<div>And observe that the word salvation is transferred here metonymically to
the doctrine of salvation; for as the Lord would not have men otherwise saved
than by the Gospel, so when that is neglected the whole salvation of God is
rejected; for it is God&#8217;s power unto salvation to those who believe.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450116&gt;</font></sup>Romans 1:16.) Hence he who
seeks salvation in any other way, seeks to attain it by another power than that
of God; which is an evidence of extreme madness. But this encomium is not only a
commendation of the Gospel, but is also a wonderful support to our faith; for it
is a testimony that the word is by no means unprofitable, but that a sure
salvation is conveyed by it.<sup><font color="Maroon">F30</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Which at first began,</i></font> etc. Here he sets
the Son of God, the first herald of the Gospel, in opposition to angels, and
also anticipates what was necessary to remove a doubt which might have crept
into the minds of many; for they had not been taught by the mouth of Christ
himself, whom the greatest part had never seen. If then they regarded only the
man by whose ministry they had been led to the faith, they might have made less
of what they had learnt from him; hence the Apostle reminded them, that the
doctrine which had been delivered them by others, yet proceeded from Christ; for
he says that those who had faithfully declared what had been committed to them
by Christ, had been his disciples. He therefore uses the word,
<font color="Maroon"><i>was confirmed,</i></font> as though he had said, that it
was not a random report, without any author, or from witnesses of doubtful
credit, but a report which was confirmed by men of weight and
authority.<br></div>
<div>Moreover, this passage indicates that this epistle was not written by Paul;
for he did not usually speak so humbly of himself, as to confess that he was one
of the Apostles&#8217; disciples, nor did he thus speak from ambition, but
because wicked men under a pretense of this kind attempted to detract from the
authority of his doctrine. It then appears evident that it was not Paul who
wrote that he had the Gospel by hearing and not by
revelation.<sup><font color="Maroon">F31</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>4.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>God also bearing them witness,</i></font>
etc. In addition to the fact, that the Apostles had what they preached from the
Son of God, the Lord also proved his approbation of their preaching by miracles,
as by a solemn subscription. Then they who do not reverently receive the Gospel
recommended by such testimonies, disregard not only the word of God, but also
his works.<br></div>
<div>He designates miracles, for the sake of amplifying their importance, by
three names. They are called <font color="Maroon"><i>signs</i></font> because
they rouse men&#8217;s minds, that they may think of something higher that what
appears; and <font color="Maroon"><i>wonders</i></font>, because they present
what is rare and unusual; and <font color="Maroon"><i>miracles,</i></font>
because the Lord shows in them a singular and an extraordinary evidence of his
power.<sup><font color="Maroon">F32</font></sup><br></div>
<div>As to the word, <font color="Maroon"><i>bearing witness,</i></font> or
attesting, it points out the right use of miracles, even that they serve to
establish the Gospel. For almost all the miracles done in all ages were
performed as we find for this end, that they might be the seals of Gods word.
The more strange then is the superstition of the Papists, who employ their own
fictitious miracles for the purpose of overthrowing the truth of God.<br></div>
<div>The conjunction <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sun,
</font><i>together with</i>, has this meaning, that we are confirmed in the
faith of the Gospel by the joint testimony of God and men; for God&#8217;s
miracles were testimonies concurring with the voice of men.<br></div>
<div>He adds, <font color="Maroon"><i>by the gifts</i></font> or distributions
<font color="Maroon"><i>of the Holy Spirit,</i></font> by which also the
doctrine of the Gospel was adorned, of which they were the
appendages.<sup><font color="Maroon">F33</font></sup> For why did God distribute
the gifts of his Spirit, except in part that they might be helps in promulgating
it, and in part that their might move through admiration the minds of men to
obey it? Hence Paul says, that tongues were a sign to unbelievers. The words,
<font color="Maroon"><i>according to his will,</i></font> remind us, that the
miracles mentioned could not be ascribed to any except to God alone, and that
they were not wrought undesignedly, but, for the distinct purpose of sealing the
truth of the Gospel. <br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><b>5.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For unto the angels,</i></font> etc. He
again proves by another argument that Christ ought to be obeyed; for the Father
has conferred on him the sovereignty of the whole world, while the angels are
wholly destitute of such an honor. It hence follows that none of the angels
should stand in the way of his preeminence who alone possesses
supremacy.<br></div>
<div>But first, the Psalm which he quotes must be examined, for it seems to be
unfitly applied to Christ. David there mentions the benefits which God bestows
on mankind; for after having contemplated God&#8217;s power as manifested in
heaven and the stars, he comes to man, among whom the wonderful goodness of God
appears in a peculiar manner. He does not, then, speak of any particular person,
but of all mankind. To this I answer, that all this affords no reason why the
words should not be applied to the person of Christ. I indeed allow that man was
at first put in possession of the world, that he might rule over all the works
of God; but by his own defection he deserved the loss of his dominion, for it
was a just punishment for ingratitude as to one thus favored, that the Lord,
whom he refused to acknowledge and faithfully to worship, should have deprived
him of a right previously granted to him. As soon, then, as Adam alienated
himself from God through sin, he was justly deprived of the good things which he
had received; not that he was denied the use of them, but that he would have had
no right to them after he had forsaken God. And in the very use of them God
intended that there should be some tokens of this loss of right, such as these,
&#8212; the wild beasts ferociously attack us, those who ought to be awed by our
presence are dreaded by us, some never obey us, others can hardly be trained to
submit, and they do us harm in various ways; the earth answers not our
expectations in cultivating it; the sky, the air, the sea, and other things are
often adverse to us. But were all creatures to continue in subjection, yet
whatever the sons of Adam possessed would be deemed a robbery; for what can they
call their own when they themselves are not God&#8217;s?<br></div>
<div>This foundation being laid, it is evident that God&#8217;s bounty belongs
not to us until the right lost in Adam be restored by Christ. For this reason
Paul teaches us that food is sanctified to us by faith,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540405&gt;</font></sup>1 Timothy 4:5;) and in
another place he declares that to the unbelieving nothing is clean, for they
have a polluted conscience.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;560116&gt;</font></sup>Titus 1:16.)<br></div>
<div>We found at the beginning of this epistle that Christ has been appointed by
the Father the heir of all things. Doubtless, as he ascribes the whole
inheritance to one, he excludes all others as aliens, and justly too, for we are
all become exiles from God&#8217;s kingdom. What food, then, God has destined
for his own family, we leave no right to take. But Christ, by whom we are
admitted into this family, at the same time admits us into a participation of
this right, so that we may enjoy the whole world, together with the favor of
God. Hence Paul teaches us that Abraham was by faith made an heir of the world,
that is, because he was united to the body of Christ.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450413&gt;</font></sup>Romans 4:13) If men, then,
are precluded from all God&#8217;s bounty until they receive a right to it
through Christ, it follows that the dominion mentioned in the Psalm was lost to
us in Adam, and that on this account it must again be restored as a donation.
Now, the restoration begins with Christ as the head. There is, then, no doubt
but that we are to look to him whenever the dominion of man over all creatures
is spoken of.<br></div>
<div>To this the reference is made when the Apostle mentions
<font color="Maroon"><i>the world to come</i></font>, or the future world, for
he understands by it the renovated world. To make the thing clearer, let us
suppose two worlds, &#8212; the first the old, corrupted by Adam&#8217;s sin;
the other, later in time, as renewed by Christ. The state of the first creation
has become wholly decayed, and with man has fallen as far as man himself is
concerned. Until, then, a new restitution be made by Christ, this Psalm will not
be fulfilled. It hence now appears that here the world to come is not that which
we hope for after the resurrection, but that which began at the beginning of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom; but it will no doubt have its full accomplishment in our
final redemption.<br></div>
<div>But why he suppressed the name of David does not appear to me. Doubtless he
says <font color="Maroon"><i>one</i></font>, or some one, not in contempt, but
for honor&#8217;s sake, designating him as one of the prophets or a renowned
writer.<br></div>
<div><b>7.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Thou madest him,</i></font> etc. A new
difficulty now arises as to the explanation of the words. I have already shown
that the passage is fitly applicable to the Son of God; but the Apostle seems
now to turn the words from that meaning in which David understood them; for
<font color="Maroon"><i>a little,</i></font>
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">bracu&gt; ti</font> seems to refer to
time, as it means a little while, and designates the abasement of Christ&#8217;s
humiliation; and he confines the glory to the day of resurrection, while David
extends it generally to the whole life of man.<br></div>
<div>To this I answer, that it was not the Apostle&#8217;s design to give an
exact explanation of the words. For there is nothing improperly done, when
verbal allusions are made to embellish a subject in hand, as Paul does in
quoting a passage in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451006&gt;</font></sup>Romans
10:6, from Moses, &#8220;Who shall ascend into heaven,&#8221; etc., he does not
join the words &#8220;heaven and hell&#8221; for the purpose of explanation, but
as ornaments. The meaning of David is this, &#8212; &#8220;O Lord, thou hast
raised man to such a dignity, that it differs but little from divine or angelic
honor; for he is set a ruler over the whole world.&#8221; This meaning the
Apostle did not intend to overthrow, nor to turn to something else; but he only
bids us to consider the abasement of Christ, which appeared for a short time,
and then the glory with which he is perpetually crowned; and this he does more
by alluding to expressions than by explaining what David
understood.<sup><font color="Maroon">F34</font></sup><br></div>
<div>To be <font color="Maroon"><i>mindful</i></font> and to
<font color="Maroon"><i>visit</i></font> mean the same thing, except that the
second is somewhat fuller, for it sets forth the presence of God by the
effect.<br></div>
<div><b>8.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For in that he put all in subjection
under him;</i></font> or, doubtless in subjecting all things to him, etc. One
might think the argument to be this, &#8212; &#8220;To the man whom David speaks
all things are subjected, but to mankind all things are not made subject; then
he does not speak of any individual man.&#8221; But this reasoning cannot stand,
for the minor proposition is true also of Christ; for all things are not as yet
made subject to him, as Paul shows in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461528&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 15:28. There
is therefore another sentence; for after having laid down this truth, that
Christ has universal dominion over all creatures, he adds, as an objection,
&#8220;But all things do not as yet obey the authority of Christ.&#8221; To meet
this objection he teaches us that yet now is seen completed in Christ what he
immediately adds respecting <font color="Maroon"><i>glory</i></font> and
<font color="Maroon"><i>honor,</i></font> as if he had said, &#8220;Though
universal subjection does not as yet appear to us, let us be satisfied that he
has passed through death, and has been exalted to the highest state of honor;
for that which is as yet wanting, will in its time be
completed.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>But first, this offends some, that the Apostle concludes with too much
refinement, that there is nothing not made subject to Christ, as David includes
all things generally; for the various kinds of things which he enumerates
afterwards prove no such thing, such as beasts of the field, fishes of the sea,
and birds of the air. To this I reply, that a general declaration ought not to
be confined to these species, for David meant no other thing than to give some
instances of his power over things the most conspicuous, or indeed to extend it
to things even the lowest, that we may know that nothing is ours except through
the bounty of God and our union with Christ. We may, therefore, explain the
passage thus, &#8212; &#8220;Thou hast made subject to him all things, not only
things needful for eternal blessedness, but also such inferior things as serve
to supply the wants of the body.&#8221; However this may be, the inferior
dominion over animals depends on the higher.<br></div>
<div>It is again asked, &#8220;Why does he say that we see not all things made
subject to Christ?&#8221; The solution of this question you will find in that
passage already quoted from Paul; and in the first chapter of this Epistle we
said a few things on the subject. As Christ carries on war continually with
various enemies, it is doubtless evident that he has no quiet possession of his
kingdom. He is not, however, under the necessity of waging war; but it happens
through his will that his enemies are not to be subdued till the last day, in
order that we may be tried and proved by fresh exercises.<br></div>
<div><b>9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But we see Jesus,</i></font> etc. As the
meaning of the words, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">bracu&gt; ti</font>
&#8220;a little&#8221; is ambiguous,<sup><font color="Maroon">F35</font></sup>
he looks to the thing itself, as exhibited in the person of Christ, rather then
to the exact meaning of the words, as I have already said; and he presents to
our meditation the glory after the resurrection, which David extends to all the
gifts by which man is adorned by God&#8217;s bounty; but in this embellishment,
which leaves the literal sense entire, there is nothing unsuitable or
improper.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>For the suffering of death,</i></font> etc. It is
the same as though it was said that Christ, having passed through death, was
exalted into the glory which he has obtained, according to what Paul teaches us
in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502308&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 2:8-10; not
that Christ obtained anything for himself individually, as sophists say, who
have devised the notion that he first earned eternal life for himself and then
for us; for the way or means, so to speak, of obtaining glory, is only indicated
here. Besides, Christ is crowned with glory for this end, that every knee should
bow to him. (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502910&gt;</font></sup>Philippians
2:10.) We may therefore reason from the final cause that all things are
delivered into his hand.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>That he by the grace of
God,</i><sup>F36</sup></font> etc. He refers to the cause and the fruit of
Christ&#8217;s death, lest he should be thought to detract anything from his
dignity. For when we hear that so much good has been obtained for us, there is
no place left for contempt, for admiration of the divine goodness fills the
whole mind. By saying <font color="Maroon"><i>for every man,</i></font> he means
not only that he might be ample to others, as Chrysostom says, who brings the
example of a physician tasting first a bitter draught, that the patient might
not refuse to drink it; but he means that Christ died for us, and that by taking
upon him what was due to us, he redeemed us from the curse of death. And it is
added, that this was done through the <font color="Maroon"><i>grace of
God</i></font>, for the cause of redemption was the infinite love of God towards
us, through which it was that he spared not even his own Son. What Chrysostom
says of <font color="Maroon"><i>tasting of death</i></font>, as though he
touched it with his lips, because Christ emerged from death a conqueror, I will
not refute nor condemn, though I know not whether the Apostle meant to speak in
a manner so refined.<sup><font color="Maroon">F37</font></sup><br></div>

<div><b>10.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For it became him,</i></font> etc. His
object is, to make Christ&#8217;s humiliation to appear glorious to the godly;
for when he is said to have been clothed with our flesh, he seems to be classed
with the common order of men; and the cross brought him lower than all men. We
must therefore take heed, lest Christ should be less esteemed, because he
willingly humbled himself for us; and this is what is here spoken of. For the
Apostle shows that this very thing ought to be deemed honorable to the Son of
God, that he was by these means consecrated the Captain of our
salvation.<br></div>
<div>He first assumes it as granted, that we ought to be satisfied with
God&#8217;s decree; for as all things are sustained by his power, so all things
ought to serve to his glory. No betters cause, then, can be found out than the
good pleasure of God. Such is the purport of the circumlocution which he
employs<font color="Maroon"><i>, for whom, and by whom, are all
things.</i></font> He might by one word have named God; but his purpose was to
remind us, that what is to be deemed best is that which he appoints, whose will
and glory is the right end of all
things.<sup><font color="Maroon">F38</font></sup><br></div>
<div>It does not, however, appear as yet what he intends by saying, that it
became Christ to be thus consecrated. But this depends on the ordinary way which
God adopts in dealing with his own people; for his will is to exercise them with
various trials, so that they may spend their whole life under the cross. It was
hence necessary that Christ, as the first-begotten, should by the cross be
inaugurated into his supremacy, since that is the common lot and condition of
all. This is the conforming of the head with the members, of which Paul speaks
in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450829&gt;</font></sup>Romans 8:29.<br></div>
<div>It is indeed a singular consolation, calculated to mitigate the bitterness
of the cross, when the faithful hear, that by sorrows and tribulations they are
sanctified for glory as Christ himself was; and hence they see a sufficient
reason why they should lovingly kiss the cross rather than dread it. And when
this is the case, then doubtless the reproach of the cross of Christ immediately
disappears, and its glory shines forth; for who can despise what is sacred, nay,
what God sanctifies? Who can deem that ignominious, by which we are prepared for
glory? And yet both these things are said here of the death of Christ.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>By whom are all things,</i></font> etc. When
creation is spoken of, it is ascribed to the Son as his own world, for by him
were all things created; but here the Apostle means no other thing than that all
creatures continue or are preserved by the power of God. What we have rendered
<font color="Maroon"><i>consecrated,</i></font> others have rendered
<font color="Maroon"><i>made perfect.</i></font> But as the word,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">teleiw~sai</font> which he uses, is of a
doubtful meaning, I think it clear that the word I leave adopted is more
suitable to the context.<sup><font color="Maroon">F39</font></sup> For what is
meant is the settled and regular way or method by which the sons of God are
initiated, so that they may obtain their own honor, and be thus separated from
the rest of the world; and then immediately sanctification is
mentioned.<br></div>
<div><b>11.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For both he that sanctifieth,</i></font>
etc. He proves that it was necessary that what he had said should be fulfilled
in the person of Christ on account of his connection with his members; and he
also teaches that it was a remarkable evidence of the divine goodness that he
put on our flesh. hence he says, that they are <font color="Maroon"><i>all of
one,</i></font> that is, that the author of holiness and we are made partakers
of it, are all of one nature, as I understated the expression. It is commonly
understood of one Adam; and some refer it to God, and not without reasons; but I
rather think that one nature is meant, and
<font color="Maroon"><i>one</i></font> I consider to be in the neuter gender, as
though he had said, that they are made out of the same
mass.<sup><font color="Maroon">F40</font></sup><br></div>
<div>It avails not, indeed, a little to increase our confidence, that we are
united to the Son of God by a bond so close, that we can find in our nature that
holiness of which we are in want; for he not only as God sanctifies us, but
there is also the power of sanctifying in his human nature, not that it has it
from itself, but that God had poured upon it a perfect fullness of holiness, so
that from it we may all draw. And to this point this sentence refers, &#8220;For
their sakes I sanctify myself.&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431719&gt;</font></sup>John 17:19.) If, then we
are sinful and unclean, we have not to go far to seek a remedy; for it is
offered to us in our own flesh. If any one prefers to regard as intended here
that spiritual unity which the godly have with the Son of God, and which differs
much from that which men commonly have among themselves, I offer no objection,
though I am disposed to follow what is more commonly received, as it is not
inconsistent with reason.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>He is not ashamed to call them brethren.</i></font>
This passage is taken from
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;192222&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 22:22. That Christ is
the speaker there, or David in his name, the evangelists do especially testify,
for they quote from it many verses, such as the following, &#8212; &#8220;They
parted my garments,&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;They gave gall for my meat,&#8221;
&#8212; &#8220;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221; And further,
the other parts of the chapter prove the same; for we may see in the history of
the passion a delineation of what is there related. The end of the Psalm, which
speaks of the calling of the Gentiles, can be applied to none but to Christ
alone, &#8220;Turn to the Lord shall all the ends of the world; adore before him
shall all the families of the nations,&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;The Lord&#8217;s is
the kingdom, and he will reign over the nations.&#8221; These things are found
accomplished only in Christ, who enlarged the kingdom of God not over a small
space, as David did, but extended it over the whole world; it was before
confined as it were within narrow limits. There is, then, no doubt but that his
voice is what is referred to in this passage; and appropriately and suitably
does he say that he is <font color="Maroon"><i>not ashamed;</i></font> for how
great is the distance between us and him? Much, then, does he let down himself,
when he dignifies us with the name of brethren; for we are unworthy that he
should deem us his servants. And this so great an honor conferred on us is
amplified by this circumstance &#8212; Christ does not speak here as a mortal
man while in the form of a servant, but when elevated after the resurrection
into immortal glory. Hence this title is the same, as though he had raised us
into heaven with himself. And let us remember, whenever we hear that we are
called brethren by Christ, that he has clothed us, so to speak, with this honor,
that together with this fraternal name we may lay hold on eternal life and every
celestial blessing.<sup><font color="Maroon">F41</font></sup><br></div>
<div>We must further notice the office which Christ assumes, which is that of
<font color="Maroon"><i>proclaiming the name of God;</i></font> and this began
to be done when the gospel was first promulgated and is now done daily by the
ministry of pastors. We hence learn, that the gospel has been presented to us
for this end, that we may be brought to the knowledge of God, in order that his
goodness may be celebrated by us, and that Christ is the author of the gospel in
whatever manner it may be offered to us. And this is what Paul says, for he
declares that he and others were ambassadors for Christ; and he exhorted men as
it were in the name of Christ.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470520&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 5:20.) And
this ought to add no small reverence to the gospel, since we ought not so much
to consider men as speaking to us, as Christ by his own mouth; for at the time
when he promised to publish God&#8217;s name to men, he had ceased to be in the
world; it was not however to no purpose that he claimed this office as his own;
for he really performs it by his disciples.<br></div>
<div><b>12.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>In the midst of the
Church.</i><sup>F42</sup></font> It hence appears plainly, that the proclamation
of God&#8217;s praises is always promoted by the teaching of the gospel; for as
soon as God becomes known to us, his boundless praises sound in our hearts and
in our ears; and at the same time Christ encourages us by his own example
publicly to celebrate them, so that they may be heard by as many as possible.
For it would not be sufficient for each one of us to thank God himself for
benefits received, except we testify openly our gratitude, and thus mutually
stimulate one another. And it is a truth, which may serve as a most powerful
stimulant, and may lead us most fervently to praise God, when we hear that
Christ leads our songs, and is the chief composer of our hymns.<br></div>
<div><b>13.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>I will put my trust in him,</i></font>
or, I will confide in him. As this sentence is found in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191802&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 18:2, it was probably
taken from that place;<sup><font color="Maroon">F43</font></sup> and Paul, in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451509&gt;</font></sup>Romans 15:9, applies
another verse to Christ respecting the calling of the Gentiles. In addition to
this, it may be said that the general contents of that Psalm show clearly that
David spoke in the person of another. There indeed appeared in David but a faint
shadow of the greatness which is there set forth in terms so magnificent. He
boasts that he was made the head of the heathens, and that even aliens and
people unknown willingly surrendered themselves to him at the report of his
name. David subdued a few neighboring and well-known nations by the force of
arms, and made them tributaries. But what was this to the extensive dominions of
many other kings? And further, where was voluntary submission? Where were the
people that were so remote that he knew them not? In short, where was the solemn
proclamation of God&#8217;s glory among the nations mentioned at the end of the
Psalm? Christ then is he who is made head over many nations, to whom strangers
from the utmost borders of the earth submit, and roused by hearing of him only;
for they are not forced by arms to undertake his yoke, but being subdued by his
doctrine, they spontaneously obey him.<br></div>
<div>There is also seen in the Church that feigned and false profession of
religion, which is there referred to; for many daily profess the name of Christ,
but not from the heart.<br></div>
<div>There is then no doubt but that the Psalm is rightly applied to Christ. But
what has this to do with the present subject? For it seems not to follow that we
and Christ are of one, in order that he might especially put his trust in God.
To this I answer, that the argument is valid, because he would have no need of
such trust, had he not been a man exposed to human necessities and wants. As
then he depended on God&#8217;s aid, his lot is the same with ours. It is surely
not in vain or for nothing that we trust in God; for were we destitute of his
grace, we should be miserable and lost. The trust then which we put in God, is
an evidence of our helplessness. At the same time we differ from Christ in this
&#8212; the weakness which necessarily and naturally belongs to us he willingly
undertook. But it ought not a little to encourage us to trust in God, that we
have Christ as our leader and instructor; for who would fear to go astray while
following in his steps? Nay, there is no danger that our trust should be useless
when we have it in common with Christ; who, we know, cannot be
mistaken.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I and the children,</i></font> etc. It is
indeed certain that Isaiah was speaking of himself; for when he gave hope of
deliverance to the people, and the promise met with no credit, lest being broken
down by the perverse unbelief of the people he should despond, the Lord bade him
to seal the doctrine he had announced among a few of the faithful; as though he
had said, that though it was rejected by the multitude, there would yet be a few
who would receive it. Relying on this answer, Isaiah took courage, and declared
that he and the disciples given to him would be ever ready to follow God.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230818&gt;</font></sup>Isaiah 8:18.)<br></div>
<div>Let us now see why the Apostle applied this sentence to Christ. First, what
is found in the same place, that the Lord would become a rock of stumbling and a
stone of offense to the kingdom of Israel and of Judas, will not be denied by
any one of a sound mind, to have been fulfilled in Christ. And doubtless as the
restoration from the Babylonian exile was a sort of prelude to the great
redemption obtained by Christ for us and the fathers; so also the fact that so
few among the Jews availed themselves of that kindness of God, that a small
remnant only were saved, was a presage of their future blindness, through which
it happened that they rejected Christ, and that they in turn were rejected by
God, and perished. For we must observe that the promises extant in the Prophets
respecting the restoration of the Church from the time the Jews returned from
exile, extend to the kingdom of Christ, as the Lord had this end in view in
restoring the people, that his Church might continue to the coming of his Son,
by whom it was at length to be really established.<br></div>
<div>Since it was so, God not only addressed Isaiah, when he bade him to seal
the law and the testimony, but also in his person all his ministers, who would
have to contend with the unbelief of the people, and hence Christ above all,
whom the Jews resisted with greater contumacy than all the former Prophets. And
we see now that they who have been substituted for Israel, not only repudiate
his Gospel, but also furiously assail him. But how much soever the doctrine of
the Gospel may be a stone of stumbling to the household of the Church, it is not
yet God&#8217;s will that it should wholly fail; on the contrary, he bids it to
be sealed among his disciples: and Christ, in the name of all his teachers as
the head of them, yea, as the only true Teacher, who rules us by their ministry,
declares that amidst this deplorable ingratitude of the world, there shall still
be some always who shall be obedient to
God.<sup><font color="Maroon">F44</font></sup><br></div>
<div>See then how this passage may be fitly applied to Christ: the Apostle
concludes, that we are one with him, because he unites us to himself, when he
presents himself and us together to God the Father: for they form but one body
who obey God under the same rule of faith. What could have been said more
suitably to commend faith, than that we are by it the companions of the Son of
God, who by his example encourages us and shows us the way? If then we follow
the Word of God, we know of a certainty that we have Christ as our leader; but
they belong not at all to Christ, who turn aside from his word. What, I pray,
can be more desired than to agree with the Son of God? But this agreement or
consent is in faith. Then by unbelief we disagree with him, than which nothing
is a greater evil. The word &#8220;children&#8221;, which in many places is
taken for servants, means here disciples.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Which God hath given me.</i></font> Here is pointed
out the primary cause of obedience, even that God has adopted us. Christ brings
none to the Father, but those given him by the Father; and this donation, we
know, depends on eternal election; for those whom the Father has destined to
life, he delivers to the keeping of his Son, that he may defend them. This is
what he says by John, &#8220;All that the Father has given me, will come to
me.&#8221; (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430637&gt;</font></sup>John 6:37.)
That we then submit to God by the obedience of faith, let us learn to ascribe
this altogether to his mercy; for otherwise we shall never be led to him by the
hand of Christ. Besides, this doctrine supplies us with strong ground of
confidence; for who can tremble under the guidance and protection of Christ?
Who, while relying on such a keeper and guardian, would not boldly disregard all
dangers? And doubtless, while Christ says, &#8220;Behold, I and the
children,&#8221; he really fulfills what he elsewhere promises, that he will not
suffer any of those to perish whom he has received from the Father.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431028&gt;</font></sup>John
10:28.)<sup><font color="Maroon">F45</font></sup><br></div>
<div>We must observe lastly, that though the world with mad stubbornness reject
the Gospel, yet the sheep ever recognize the voice of their shepherd. Let not
therefore the impiety of almost all ranks, ages, and nations, disturb us,
provided Christ gathers together his own, who have been committed to his
protection. If the reprobate rush headlong to death by their impiety, in this
way the plants which God has not planted are rooted up.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401513&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 15:13.) Let us at
the same time know that his own are known to him, and that the salvation of them
all is sealed by him, so that not one of them shall be lost.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550219&gt;</font></sup>2 Timothy 2:19.) Let us be
satisfied with this seal. <br></div>

<div><b>14.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Forasmuch then as the
children,</i></font> etc., or, since then the children, etc. This is an
inference from the foregoing; and at the same time a fuller reason is given than
what has been hitherto stated, why it behooved the Son of God to put on our
flesh, even that he might partake of the same nature with us, and that by
undergoing death he might redeem us from it.<br></div>
<div>The passage deserves especial notice, for it not only confirms the reality
of the human nature of Christ, but also shows the benefit which thence flows to
us. &#8220;The Son of God,&#8221; he says, &#8220;became man, that he might
partake of the same condition and nature with us.&#8221; What could be said more
fitted to confirm our faith? Here his infinite love towards us appears; but its
overflowing appears in this &#8212; that he put on our nature that he might thus
make himself capable of dying, for as God he could not undergo death. And though
he refers but briefly to the benefits of his death, yet there is in this brevity
of words a singularly striking and powerful representation, and that is, that he
has so delivered us from the tyranny of the devil, that we are rendered safe,
and that he has so redeemed us from death, that it is no longer to be
dreaded.<br></div>
<div>But as all the words are important, they must be examined a little more
carefully. First, the destruction of the devil, of which he speaks, imports this
&#8212; that he cannot prevail against us. For though the devil still lives, and
constantly attempts our ruin, yet all his power to hurt us is destroyed or
restrained. It is a great consolation to know that we have to do with an enemy
who cannot prevail against us. That what is here said has been said with regard
to us, we may gather from the next clause, <font color="Maroon"><i>that he might
destroy him that had the power of death;</i></font> for the apostle intimates
that the devil was so far destroyed as he has power to reign to our ruin; for
&#8220;the power of death&#8221; is ascribed to him from the effect, because it
is destructive and brings death. He then teaches us not only that the tyranny of
Satan was abolished by Christ&#8217;s death, but also that he himself was so
laid prostrate, that no more account is to be made of him than as though he were
not. He speaks of the <font color="Maroon"><i>devil</i></font> according to the
usual practice of Scripture, in the singular number, not because there is but
one, but because they all form one community which cannot be supposed to be
without a head.<sup><font color="Maroon">F46</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>15.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And deliver them who,</i></font> etc.
This passage expresses in a striking manner how miserable is the life of those
who fear death, as they must feel it to be dreadful, because they look on it
apart from Christ; for then nothing but a curse appears in it: for whence is
death but from God&#8217;s wrath against sin? Hence is that bondage throughout
life, even perpetual anxiety, by which unhappy souls are tormented; for through
a consciousness of sin the judgment of God is ever presented to the view. From
this fear Christ has delivered us, who by undergoing our curse has taken away
what is dreadful in death. For though we are not now freed from death, yet in
life and in death we have peace and safety, when we have Christ going before
us.<sup><font color="Maroon">F47</font></sup><br></div>
<div>But it any one cannot pacify his mind by disregarding death, let him know
that he has made as yet but very little proficiency in the faith of Christ; for
as extreme fear is owing to ignorance as to the grace of Christ, so it is a
certain evidence of unbelief.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Death</i></font> here does not only mean the
separation of the soul from the body, but also the punishment which is inflicted
on us by an angry God, so that it includes eternal ruin; for where there is
guilt before God, there immediately hell shows itself. <br></div>

<div><b>16.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For verily,</i></font> or, For nowhere,
etc. By this comparison he enhances the benefit and the honor with which Christ
has favored us, by putting on our flesh; for he never did so much for angels. As
then it was necessary that there should be a remarkable remedy for man&#8217;s
dreadful ruin, it was the design of the Son of God that there should be some
incomparable pledge of his love towards us which angels had not in common with
us. That he preferred us to angels was not owing to our excellency, but to our
misery. There is therefore no reason for us to glory as though we were superior
to angels, except that our heavenly Father has manifested toward us that ampler
mercy which we needed, so that the angels themselves might from on high behold
so great a bounty poured on the earth. The present tense of the verb is to be
understood with reference to the testimonies of Scripture, as though he set
before us what had been before testified by the Prophets.<br></div>
<div>But this one passage is abundantly sufficient to lay prostrate such men as
Marcion and Manicheus, and fanatical men of similar character, who denied Christ
to have been a real man, begotten of human seed. For if he bore only the
appearance of man, as he had before appeared in the form of an angel, there
could have been no difference; but as it could not have been said that Christ
became really an angel, clothed with angelic nature, it is hence said that he
took upon him man&#8217;s nature and not that of angels.<br></div>
<div>And the Apostle speaks of nature, and intimates that Christ, clothed with
flesh, was real man, so that there was unity of person in two natures. For this
passage does not favor Nestorius, who imagined a twofold Christ, as though the
Son of God was not a real man but only dwelt in man&#8217;s flesh. But we see
that the Apostle&#8217;s meaning was very different, for his object was to teach
us that we find in the Son of God a brother, being a partaker of our common
nature. Being not therefore satisfied with calling him man, he says that he was
begotten of human seed; and he names expressly the <font color="Maroon"><i>seed
of Abraham,</i></font> in order that what he said might have more credit, as
being taken from Scripture.<sup><font color="Maroon">F48</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>17.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore in all things it behooved him
to be made like unto his brethren,</i></font> or, to be like his brethren, etc.
In Christ&#8217;s human nature there are two things to be considered, the real
flesh and the affections or feelings. The Apostle then teaches us, that he had
not only put on the real flesh of man, but also all those feelings which belong
to man, and he also shows the benefit that hence proceeds; and it is the true
teaching of faith when we in our case find the reason why the Son of God
undertook our infirmities; for all knowledge without feeling the need of this
benefit is cold and lifeless. But he teaches us that Christ was made subject to
human affections, <font color="Maroon"><i>that he might be a merciful and
faithful high priest;</i></font> which words I thus explain, &#8220;that he
might be a merciful, and therefore a faithful high
priest.&#8221;<sup><font color="Maroon">F49</font></sup><br></div>
<div>For in a priest, whose office it is to appease God&#8217;s wrath, to help
the miserable, to raise up the fallen, to relieve the oppressed, mercy is
especially required, and it is what experience produces in us; for it is a rare
thing, for those who are always happy to sympathize with the sorrows of others.
The following saying of Virgil was no doubt derived from daily examples found
among men: <br></div>
<div align="center"><font color="Navy"><b><i>&#8220;Not ignorant of evil, I
learn to aid the miserable.&#8221;
</i></b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">F50</font></sup><br></div>
<div>The Son of God had no need of experience that he might know the emotions of
mercy; but we could not be persuaded that he is merciful and ready to help us,
had he not become acquainted by experience with our miseries; but this, as other
things, has been as a favor given to us. Therefore whenever any evils pass over
us, let it ever occur to us, that nothing happens to us but what the Son of God
has himself experienced in order that he might sympathize with us; nor let us
doubt but that he is at present with us as though he suffered with
us.<sup><font color="Maroon">F51</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Faithful</i></font> means one true and upright, for
it is one opposite to a dissembler; and to him who fulfils not his engagements.
An acquaintance with our sorrows and miseries so inclines Christ to compassion,
that he is constant in imploring God&#8217;s aid for us. What besides? Having
purposed to make atonement for sins, he put on our nature that we might have in
our own flesh the price of our redemption; in a word, that by the right of a
common nature he might introduce us, together with himself, into the sanctuary
of God. By the words, <font color="Maroon"><i>in things pertaining to
God</i></font>, he means such things as are necessary to reconcile men to God;
and as the first access to God is by faith, there is need of a Mediator to
remove all doubting.<br></div>
<div><b>18.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For in that he himself has
suffered,</i></font> etc. Having been tried by our evils, he is ready, he says,
to bring us help. The word <font color="Maroon"><i>temptation</i></font> here
means no other thing than experience or probation; and to be
<font color="Maroon"><i>able,</i></font> is to be fit, or inclined, or suitable.

He concludes the preceding doctrine with a necessary exhortation, that the Jews
should attentively consider what sort of being and how great Christ is. As he
had before, by naming him a teacher and a priest, briefly compared him with
Moses and Aaron, so he now includes both clauses; for he adorns him with two
titles, as he sustains a twofold character in the Church of God. Moses was a
prophet and a teacher, and Aaron was a priest; but the two offices belong to
Christ. If then we seek rightly to know him, we must inquire what sort of being
he is; yea, he must be clothed with his own power, lest we lay hold on an empty
shadow and not on him.<sup><font color="Maroon">F52</font></sup><br></div>
<div>First, the word <font color="Maroon"><i>consider,</i></font> is important,
for it intimates that singular attention is required, as he cannot be
disregarded with impunity, and that at the same time the true knowledge of
Christ is sufficient to dissipate the darkness of all errors. And to encourage
them the more to pursue this study, he reminds them of their
<font color="Maroon"><i>calling</i></font>; as though he had said, &#8220;God
favored you with no common grace when He called you into his
kingdom;<sup><font color="Maroon">F53</font></sup> it now remains that you have
your eyes fixed on Christ as your leader in the
way.&#8221;<sup><font color="Maroon">F54</font></sup> For the calling of the
godly cannot be otherwise confirmed than by a thorough surrender of themselves
to Christ. We ought not therefore to regard this as said only to the Jews, but
that it is a general truth addressed to all who desire to come into the kingdom
of God; they ought sedulously to attend to Christ, for he is the sole instructor
of our faith, and has confirmed it by the sacrifice of himself; for
<font color="Maroon"><i>confession,</i></font> or profession, is to be taken
here for faith, as thought he had said, that the faith we profess is vain and of
no avail, unless Christ be its
object.<sup><font color="Maroon">F55</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>2.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Who was,</i></font> or is
<font color="Maroon"><i>faithful,</i></font> etc. This is a commendation of the
apostleship of Christ, in order that the faithful may securely acquiesce in him;
and he commends it on two grounds, because the Father has set him to be over us
as our teacher, and because Christ himself has faithfully performed the office
committed to him. These two things are always necessary to secure authority to a
doctrine; for God alone ought to be attended to, as the whole Scripture
testifies; hence Christ declares, that the doctrine which he delivered was not
his own, but the Father&#8217;s,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430716&gt;</font></sup>John 7:16;) and in another
place he says, &#8220;He who received me, receiveth him who has sent me.&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420948&gt;</font></sup>Luke 9:48.) For we say of
Christ, that as he is clothed with our flesh, he is the Father&#8217;s minister
to execute his commands. To the calling of God is added the faithful and upright
performance of duty on the part of Christ; and this is required in true
ministers, in order that they may obtain credence in the Church. Since these two
things are found in Christ, doubtless he cannot be disregarded without despising
God in him.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>As also Moses,</i></font> etc. Omitting for a while
the priesthood, he speaks here of his apostleship. For as there are two parts in
God&#8217;s covenant, the promulgation of the truth, and so to speak, its real
confirmation, the full perfection of the covenant would not appear in Christ,
were not both parts found in him. Hence the writer of the epistle, after having
mentioned both, roused attention by a brief exhortation. But he now enters on a
longer discussion, and begins with the office of a teacher: he therefore now
compares Christ only with Moses. The words, <font color="Maroon"><i>in all his
house,</i></font> may be applied to Moses; but I prefer to apply them to Christ,
as he may be said to be faithful to his Father in ruling his whole house. It
hence follows, that none belong to the Church of God except those who
acknowledge Christ.<sup><font color="Maroon">F56</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>3.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For this</i></font> man (or, he)
<font color="Maroon"><i>was counted worthy,</i></font> etc. Lest he might appear
to make Moses equal to Christ, he reminds us of his superior excellency; and
this he proves by two arguments, -Moses so ruled the Church, that he was still a
part and member of it; but Christ being the builder, is superior to the whole
building, &#8212; Moses while ruling others, was ruled also himself, as he was a
servant; but Christ being a Son possesses supreme power.<br></div>
<div>It is a frequent and well-known metaphor used in Scripture to call the
Church the house of God. (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540315&gt;</font></sup>1
Timothy 3:15.) And as it is composed of the faithful, each of them is called a
living stone. (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600205&gt;</font></sup>1 Peter
2:5.) They are also sometimes called the vessels with which the house is
furnished. (2 Timothy 2:20.) There is then no one so eminent that he is not a
member, and included in the universal body. God being the builder, alone is to
be set above his own work; but God dwells in Christ, so that whatever is said of
God is applicable to him.<br></div>
<div>If any one objects and says that Christ is also a part of the building
because he is the foundation, because he is our brother, because he has a union
with us and then that he is not the master-builder because he himself was formed
by God: in reply to these things we say that our faith is so founded on him that
he still rules over us that he is in such a way our brother that he is yet our
Lord, that he was so formed by God as man that he nevertheless by his Spirit
revives and restores all things as the eternal God. The Scripture employs us
various metaphors to set forth Christ s grace towards us; but there is no one
which derogates from his honor mentioned here by the Apostle; for what is stated
here is that all ought to be brought down to their own state because they ought
to be in subjection to the head and that Christ alone is exempt from this
submission, because he is the head.<br></div>
<div>If it be again objected and said that Moses was no less a master-builder
than Paul who gloried in this title: to this I reply that this name is applied
to prophets and teachers but not with strict correctness; for they are only the
instruments and indeed dead instruments, except the Lord from heaven gives
efficacy to what they do; and then they so labor in building the Church, that
they themselves form a part of the structure; but the case is wholly different
as to Christ, for he ever builds up the Church by the power of his own Spirit.
Besides, he stands far above the rest, for he is in such a way the true temple
of God, that he is at the same time the God who inhabits it.<br></div>
<div><b>4.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>He that built,</i></font> etc. Though
these words may be extended to the creation of the whole world, yet I confine
them to the present subject. We are then to understand that nothing is done in
the Church which ought not to he ascribed to Gods power; for he alone has
founded it by his own hand,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198705&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 87:5;) and Paul says
of Christ that he is the head, from whom the whole body, joined together and
connected by every subservient juncture, makes an increase according to what is
done proportionally by every member. (Ephesians 4:l6.) Hence he often declares
that the success of his ministry was God&#8217;s work. In a word, if we take a
right view of things, it will appear that how much soever God may use the labors
of men in building his Church, yet he himself performs everything &#8212; the
instrument derogates nothing from the
workman.<sup><font color="Maroon">F57</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>5.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And Moses verily was faithful in all his
house, as a servant,</i></font> etc. The second difference is, that to Moses was
committed a doctrine to which he, in common with others, was to submit; but
Christ, though he put on the form of a servant, is yet Master and Lord, to whom
all ought to be subject; for, as we found in chap. 1:2, he is constituted heir
of all things.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>For a testimony of those things which were to be
spoken after,</i></font> or which were afterwards to be said or declared. I
explain this simply in this way, &#8212; that Moses, while a herald of that
doctrine which was to be published for a time to the ancient people, did at the
same time render a testimony to the Gospel, the publication of which was not as
yet to be made; for it is doubtless evident, that the end and completion of the
Law is that perfection of wisdom contained in the Gospel. This exposition seems
to comport with the future tense of the participle. The meaning indeed is, that
Moses faithfully delivered to the people what the Lord had committed to him, but
that limits were prescribed to him which it was not lawful for him to pass. God
formerly spoke at different times and in various ways by the prophets, but he
deferred to the fullness of time the complete revelation of the
Gospel.<br></div>
<div><b>6.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Whose house are we,</i></font> etc. As
Paul in his Epistle to the Romans, after having prefaced that he was appointed
to be the Apostle of the Gentiles, adds, for the sake of gaining credit among
them, that they were of that number; so now the author of this epistle exhorts
the Jews who had already made a profession of Christ to persevere in the faith,
that they might be deemed as being in Gods household. He had said before that
God&#8217;s house was subject to the authority of Christ. Suitably to this
declaration is added the admonition that they would then have a place in
God&#8217;s family when they obeyed Christ. But as they had already embraced the
gospel, he mentions their condition if they persevered in the faith. For the
word <font color="Maroon"><i>hope</i></font> I take for faith; and indeed hope
is nothing else but the constancy of faith. He mentions
<font color="Maroon"><i>confidence</i></font> and
<font color="Maroon"><i>rejoicing,</i></font> or glorying, in order to express
more fully the power of faith.<sup><font color="Maroon">F58</font></sup> And we
hence conclude that those who assent to the Gospel doubtfully and like those who
vacillate, do not truly and really believe; for faith cannot be without a
settled peace of mind, from which proceeds the bold confidence of rejoicing. And
so these two things, confidence and rejoicing, are ever the effects of faith, as
we stated in explaining Romans the 5<sup>th</sup> chapter, and Ephesians the
3<sup>rd</sup> chapter.<br></div>
<div>But to these things the whole teaching of the Papists is opposed; and this
very fact, were there nothing else, sufficiently proves that they pull down the
Church of God rather than build it. For the certainty by which alone we are
made, as the Apostle teaches us, holy temples to God, they not only darken by
their glosses, but also condemn as presumption. Besides, what firmness of
confidence can there be when men know not what they ought to believe? And yet
that monstrous thing, implicit faith, which they have invented, is nothing else
than a license to entertain errors. This passage reminds us that we are always
to make progress even unto death; for our whole life is as it were a race.

<div>He proceeds in his exhortation, that they were to obey Christ speaking to
them; and that he might add more weight to it, he confirms it by the testimony
of David; for since they were to be sharply goaded, it was better, for the sake
of avoiding offense, to bring forward another person. Had he simply reproached
them for the unbelief of the fathers, they would have less favorably attended to
him; but when he brought forward David, it was less offensive. Now, the import
of the whole is, &#8212; As God from the beginning would his voice obeyed, and
could not endure perverseness without punishing it severely, so at this day he
will not lightly punish our stubbornness, unless we become teachable. But the
discourse is suspended until we come to the words, &#8220;Take heed, brethren,
lest there be at any time in any of you,&#8221; etc. That the passage, then, may
flow better, it would be proper to include the rest in a
parenthesis.<sup><font color="Maroon">F59</font></sup> Let us now consider the
words in order.<br></div>
<div><b>7.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>As the Holy Ghost saith,</i></font> etc.
This availed much more to touch their hearts than if he had quoted David by
name. And it is useful for us to familiarize ourselves with such expressions, so
that we may remember that the words adduced from the books of the prophets are
those of God and not of men.<br></div>
<div>But as this sentence<font color="Maroon"><i>, Today, if ye will hear his
voice,</i></font> is a part of a former verse, some have not unsuitably rendered
it thus, &#8220;Would to God you would this day hear his voice.&#8221; It is
indeed certain that when David called the Jews God&#8217;s people, he
immediately drew this conclusion, that the voice of God ought to have been heard
by them; for as to those whom he there invited to sing praises to God and to
celebrate his goodness, he reminded them at the same time that obedience was the
chief worship which he required, and that it was better than all sacrifices. The
chief thing, then, was to obey the word of God.<br></div>
<div><b>8. </b>Then follows<font color="Maroon"><b><i>, </i></b><i>Harden not
your hearts<b>.</b></i><b> </b></font>By which words is intimated that our
rebellion against God flows from no other<font color="Maroon"><b><i>
</i></b></font>fountain than willful wickedness, by which we obstruct the
entrance of his grace, We have indeed by nature a heart of stone, and there is
in all an innate hardness from the womb, which God alone can mollify and amend.
That we, however, reject the voice of God, it happens through a spontaneous
obstinacy, not through an external impulse, a fact of which every one is a
witness to himself. Rightly, then, does the Spirit accuse all the unbelieving
that they resist God, and that they are the teachers and authors of their own
perverseness, so that they can throw the blame on none else. It is hence,
however, absurdly concluded that we have, on the other hand, a free power to
form the heart for God&#8217;s service; nay rather, it must ever be the case
with men, that they harden their heart until another be given them from heaven;
for as we are bent towards wickedness, we shall never cease to resist God until
we shall be tamed and subdued by his hand.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>As in the provocation,</i></font> etc. It was for
two reasons necessary for them to be reminded of the disobedience of their
fathers; for as they were foolishly inflated on account of the glory of their
race, they often imitated the vices of their fathers as though they were
virtues, and defended themselves by their examples; and further, when they heard
that their fathers were so disobedient to God, they were thus more fully taught
that this admonition was not superfluous. As both these reasons existed even in
the Apostle&#8217;s time, he readily accommodated to his own purpose what had
been formerly said by David, in order that those whom he addressed might not
imitate their fathers too much.<br></div>
<div>And hence may be learnt a general truth, that we are not to defer too much
to the authority of the fathers lest it should draw us away from God; for if any
fathers have ever been worthy of honor, no doubt the Jews possessed that
preeminence; and yet David distinctly commanded their children to beware of
being like them.<br></div>
<div>And I have no doubt but that he referred to the history recorded in Exodus
17: for David uses here the two names which Moses relates were given to a
certain place, <font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hbrm</font> Meribah,
which means strife or provocation, and
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hsm</font> Massah, which means
temptation. They tempted God by denying that he was in the midst of them,
because they were distressed for want of water; and they also provoked him by
contending with Moses. Though indeed they gave many examples of unbelief, yet
David selected this in an especial manner, because it was more memorable then
any other, and also, because in order of time it followed for the most part the
rest, as it evidently appears from the fourth book of Moses, where from chap. 10
to 20 a series of many temptations is described; but this narrative is given in
the twentieth chapter. This circumstance increased not a little the atrocity of
their wickedness; for they had often experienced the power of God, and yet they
perversely contended with him, and renounced all confidence in him: how great
was their ingratitude! He then mentioned one particular instance instead of
many.<br></div>
<div><b>9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Tempted,</i></font> etc. This word is to
be taken in a bad sense; it means to provoke in a proud and insulting manner,
which we express in French by saying, <font color="Maroon"><i>defier comme en
depitant.</i></font> For though God had often brought them help, yet they forgot
all, and scornfully asked, where was his power.
<font color="Maroon"><i>Proved,</i></font> etc. This clause is to be thus
explained, &#8220;When yet they had proved me and seen my works&#8221;. For it
enhanced the guilt of their impiety, that having been taught by so many
evidences of divine power, they had made so bad a progress. For it was a
marvelous supineness and stupidity to esteem God&#8217;s power as nothing, which
had been so fully proved.<sup><font color="Maroon">F60</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Forty years.</i></font> These are connected by
David with what follows. But we know that the Apostles in quoting passages
attend more to the general meaning than to the words. And no doubt God
complained that the people had been vexatious to him for forty years, because so
many benefits had availed nothing for the purpose of teaching them; for though
God did good continually to them who were wholly unworthy, they yet never ceased
to rise up against him. Hence arose his continual indignation, as though he had
said &#8220;Not once or for a short time have they provoked me, but by their
incessant wickedness for forty years.&#8221;
<font color="Maroon"><i>Generation</i></font> means race, or men of one
age.<br></div>
<div><b>10.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And I said,</i></font> etc. This was
God&#8217;s sentence, by which he declared that they were destitute of a sound
mind, and he adds the reason, <font color="Maroon"><i>For they have not known my
ways.</i></font> In short, he regarded them as past hope, for they were without
sense and reason. And here he assumed the character of man, who at length after
long trials declares that he has discovered obstinate madness, for he says that
they always went astray, and no hope of repentance appeared.<br></div>
<div><b>11.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>So I sware,</i></font> etc. It was the
punishment of their madness, that they were deprived of the rest promised them.
Moreover, the Lord calls the land, where they might have had their
dwelling<font color="Maroon"><i>, his rest.</i></font> For they had been
sojourners in Egypt and wanderers in the wilderness; but the land of Canaan was
to be, according to the promise, their perpetual inheritance; and it was in
reference to this promise that God called it
<font color="Maroon"><i>his</i></font> rest: for nowhere can we have a settled
dwelling, except where we are fixed by his hand. But their right to a sure
possession was founded on what God said to Abraham,<br></div>
<div align="center"><font color="Navy">&#8220;To thy seed will I give this
land.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011207&gt;</font></sup><font color="Navy">Genesis
12:7.)</font><br></div>
<div>By God swearing, <font color="Maroon"><i>If they shall enter,</i></font>
etc., the atrocity of their evil conduct is made more evident and is more
forcibly set forth, for it is an evidence of wrath greatly inflamed. &#8220;If
they shall enter,&#8221; is in the form of an oath, in which something is to be
understood, as an imprecation, or some such thing, when men speak; but when God
speaks, it is the same as though he said, &#8220;Let me not be deemed
true,&#8221;, or, &#8220;Let me not be hereafter believed, if such a thing shall
not be so.&#8221; However, this defective mode of speaking recommends fear and
reverence to us, so that we may not rashly swear, as many do, who are often in
the habit of pouring forth dreadful curses.<br></div>
<div>But as to the present passage, we ought not to think that they were then
for the first time denied entrance into the land by God&#8217;s oath, when they
tempted him in Rephidim; for they had long before been excluded, even from the
time they had refused to march forward at the report of the spies. God then does
not here ascribe their expulsion from the land to this instance of tempting him
as to the first cause; but he intimates that by no chastisement could they have
been restored to a sound mind, but that they continually added new offenses: and
thus he shows that they fully deserved to be thus severely punished, for they
never ceased to increase more and more his wrath by various sins, as though he
had said, &#8220;This is the generation to which I denied the possession of the
promised land, for during whole forty years afterwards it betrayed its obstinate
madness by innumerable sins.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><b>12.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Take heed,</i></font> (or
<font color="Maroon"><i>See</i></font>,) <font color="Maroon"><i>brethren, lest
there be at any time in any of you a wicked heart of unbelief,</i></font> etc. I
have preferred to retain literally what the Apostle states, rather than to give
a paraphrase as to the wicked or depraved <font color="Maroon"><i>heart of
unbelief,</i></font> by which he intimates that unbelief would be connected with
depravity or wickedness, if after having received the knowledge of Christ they
departed from his faith. For he addressed them who had been imbued with the
elements of Christianity; hence he immediately added, <font color="Maroon"><i>By
departing;</i></font> for the sin of defection is accompanied with
perfidy.<sup><font color="Maroon">F61</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>13. </b>He also pointed out the remedy, so that they might not fall into
this wickedness, and that was, to <font color="Maroon"><i>exhort one
another.</i></font> For as by nature we are inclined to evil, we have need of
various helps to retain us in the fear of God. Unless our faith be now and then
raised up, it will lie prostrate; unless it be warmed, it will be frozen; unless
it be roused, it will grow torpid. He would have us then to stimulate one
another by mutual exhortations, so that Satan may not creep into our hearts, and
by his fallacies draw us away from God. And this is a way of speaking that ought
to be especially observed; for we fall not immediately by the first assault into
this madness of striving against God; but Satan by degrees accosts us artfully
by indirect means, until he holds us ensnared in his delusions. Then indeed
being blinded, we break forth into open
rebellion.<sup><font color="Maroon">F62</font></sup><br></div>
<div>We must then meet this danger in due time, and it is one that is nigh us
all, for nothing is more possible than to be deceived; and from this deception
comes at length hardness of heart. We hence see how necessary it is for us to be
roused by the incessant goads of exhortations. Nor does the Apostle give only a
general precept, that all should take heed to themselves, but he should have
them also to be solicitous for the salvation of every member, so that they
should not suffer any of those who had been once called to perish through their
neglect, and he who feels it his duty so to watch over the salvation of the

good shepherd.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>While it is called today.</i></font> He now applies
what David said more particularly to his own subjects; for he reminds us that
the word <font color="Maroon"><i>today,</i></font> mentioned in the Psalm, ought
not to be confined to the age of David, but that it comprehends every time in
which God may address us. As often, then, and as long as he opened his sacred
mouth to teach us, let this sentence come to our minds, &#8220;Today, if ye will
hear his voice&#8221;. In the same way Paul teaches us that when the Gospel is
preached to us, it is the accepted time in which God hears us, and the Day of
salvation in which he helps us.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470602&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians
6:2.)<br></div>
<div>Now, of this opportunity we ought to avail ourselves; for if through our
sloth we suffer it to pass by, we shall hereafter in vain deplore its loss. So
Christ says,<br></div>
<div align="center"><font color="Navy">&#8220;Walk while ye have the light; come
shortly shall the night.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431235&gt;</font></sup><font color="Navy">John
12:35.)</font><br></div>
<div>The particle <font color="Maroon"><i>while,</i></font> then, or as long as,
intimates that, The seasonable time will not continue always, if we be too
slothful to follow when the Lord calls us. God knocks at our door; unless we
open to him he will no doubt in his turn close against us the gate of his
kingdom. In a word, too late will be their groans who despise the grace offered
to them today. As, then, we know not whether God will extend his calling to
tomorrow, let us not delay. Today he calls us; let us immediately respond to
him, for there is no faith except where there is such a readiness to obey.

<div><b>14.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For we are made partakers,</i></font>
etc. He commends them for having begun well; but lest, under the pretext of the
grace which they had obtained, they should indulge themselves in carnal
security, he says that there was need of perseverance; for many having only
tasted the Gospel, do not think of any progress as though they had reached the
summit. Thus it is that they not only stop in the middle of their race, yea,
nigh the starting-posts, but turn another way. Plausible indeed is this
objection, &#8220;What can we wish more after having found Christ?&#8221; But if
he is possessed by faith, we must persevere in it, so that he may be our
perpetual possession. Christ then has given himself to be enjoyed by us on this
condition, that by the same faith by which we have been admitted into a
participation of him, we are to preserve so great a blessing even to
death.<sup><font color="Maroon">F63</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Hence he says <font color="Maroon"><i>beginning,</i></font> intimating that
their faith was only begun. As <font color="Maroon"><i>hypostasis</i></font>
sometimes means <font color="Maroon"><i>confidence,</i></font> it may be so
taken here; yet the term <font color="Maroon"><i>substance,</i></font> as some
have rendered it, I do not dislike, though I explain it in a way somewhat
different. They think that faith is thus called, because the whole of what man
may have without it is nothing but vanity; but I so regard it, because we recumb
on it alone, as there is no other support on which we can rely. And suitable to
this view is the word <font color="Maroon"><i>steadfast</i></font> or firm; for
we shall be firmly fixed and beyond the danger of vacillating, provided faith be
our foundation. The sum of the whole then is, that faith whose beginnings only
appear in us, is to make constant and steady progress to the
end.<sup><font color="Maroon">F64</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>15.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>While it is said,</i></font> etc. He
intimates that the reason for making progress never ceases as long as we live,
because God calls us daily. For since faith responds to the preaching of the
Gospel, as preaching continues through the whole course of our life, so we ought
to continue growing in faith. The phrase, then, <font color="Maroon"><i>while it
is said,</i></font> is the same as though he had said, &#8220;Since God never
makes an end of speaking, it is not enough for us readily to receive his
doctrine, except we exhibit the same teachableness and obedience tomorrow and
every following day.&#8221;<sup><font color="Maroon">F65</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>16</b><font color="Maroon"><b><i>.</i></b><i> For some, when they had
heard,</i></font> etc. David spoke of the fathers as though that whole
generation were unbelieving; but it appears that some who truly feared God
mingled with the wicked. The apostle mentions this to modify what had been more
severely said by David, in order that we may know that the word is preached to
all for this end, that all may obey it with one consent, and that the whole
people were justly condemned for unbelief, when the body was torn and mutilated
by the defection of the greatest part.<br></div>
<div>But by saying that some <font color="Maroon"><i>provoked,</i></font> while
yet they were by far the greatest part, this object was not only to avoid giving
offense, but also to encourage the Jews to imitate those who believed; as though
he had said, &#8220;As God forbids you to follow the unbelief of the fathers, so
he sets before you other fathers whose faith is to be your example&#8221;. Thus
is mitigated what otherwise might have appeared too hard; that is, had they been
commanded wholly to dissent from their fathers. <font color="Maroon"><i>To come
out by Moses,</i></font> means by the hand of Moses, for he was the minister of
their deliverance. But there is an implied comparison between the benefit which
God had bestowed on them by Moses, and the participation of Christ previously
mentioned.<br></div>
<div><b>17.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But with whom was he grieved,</i></font>
or angry, etc. He means that God had never been angry with his people except for
just causes, as Paul also reminds us in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461005&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 10:5, 6.
Therefore as many chastisements of God as we read were inflicted on the ancient
people, so many grievous sins shall we find which provoked God&#8217;s
vengeance. At the same time we must come to this conclusion, that unbelief was
the chief of all their evils; for though he mentions this the last, he yet means
that it was the primary cause of their curse; and no doubt from the time they
once became unbelievers, they never ceased to add one sin to another, and thus
they brought on themselves new scourges continually. Hence those very persons
who through unbelief rejected the possession of the land offered to them,
pursued their own obstinacy, now lusting, then murmuring, now committing
adultery, then polluting themselves with heathen superstitions, so that their
depravity became more fully manifested.<br></div>
<div>The unbelief, then, which they showed from the beginning, prevented them
from enjoying the kindness of God; for the contempt of his word ever led them to
sin. And as at first they deserved through their unbelief that God should
deprive them of the promised rest, so whatever sin they committed afterwards
flowed from the same fountain.<br></div>
<div>It may be further asked, whether Moses, and Aaron, and those like them,
were included in this number? To this I answer, that the Apostle speaks of the
whole community rather than of individuals. It is certain that there were many
godly men who were either not entangled in the general impiety or soon repented.
Moses&#8217; faith was once shaken and only once, and that for a moment. The
Apostle&#8217;s words, therefore, contain a statement of the whole instead of a
part, a mode of speaking frequently employed when a multitude or body of people
are spoken of. <br></div>

<div><b>1.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Let us therefore fear,</i></font> etc. He
concludes that there was reason to fear lest the Jews to whom he was writing
should be deprived of the blessing offered to them; and then he says,
<font color="Maroon"><i>lest anyone,</i></font> intimating that it was his
anxious desire to lead them, one and all, to God; for it is the duty of a good
shepherd, in watching over the whole flock so to care for every sheep that no
one may be lost; nay, we ought also so to feel for one another that every one
should fear for his neighbors as well as for himself<br></div>
<div>But the fear which is here recommended is not that which shakes the
confidence of faith but such as fills us with such concern that we grow not
torpid with indifference. Let us then fear, not that we ought to tremble or to
entertain distrust as though uncertain as to the issue, but lest we be
unfaithful to God&#8217;s grace.<br></div>
<div>By saying <font color="Maroon"><i>Lest we be disappointed of the promise
left us,</i></font> he intimates that no one comes short of it except he who by
rejecting grace has first renounced the promise; for God is so far from
repenting to do us good that he ceases not to bestow his gifts except when we
despise his calling. The illative <font color="Maroon"><i>therefore,</i></font>
or then means that by the fall of others we are taught humility and watchfulness
according to what Paul also says,<br></div>
<div align="center"><font color="Navy">&#8220;These through unbelief have
fallen; be not thou then high- minded, but
fear.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F66</font></sup><font color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451120&gt;</font></sup><font color="Navy">Romans
11:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><b>2.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For to us,</i></font> etc. He reminds us
that the doctrine by which God invites us to himself at this day is the same
with that which he formerly delivered to the fathers; and why did he say this?
That we may know that the calling of God will in no degree be more profitable to
us than it was to them, except we make it sure by faith. This, then, he
concedes, that the Gospel is indeed preached to
us;<sup><font color="Maroon">F67</font></sup> but lest we should vainly glory,
he immediately adds that the unbelieving whom God had formerly favored with the
participation of so great blessings, yet received from them no fruit, and that
therefore we also shall be destitute of his blessing unless we receive it by
faith. He repeats the word <font color="Maroon"><i>hear</i></font> for this end,
that we may know that hearing is useless except the word addressed to us be by
faith received.<br></div>
<div>But we must here observe the connection between the word and faith. It is
such that faith is not to be separated from the word, and that the word
separated from faith can confer no good; not indeed that the efficacy or power
of the word depends on us; for were the whole world false, he who cannot lie
would still never cease to be true, but the word never puts forth its power in
us except when faith gives it an entrance. It is indeed the power of God unto
salvation, but only to those who believe.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450116&gt;</font></sup>Romans 1:16.) There is in
it revealed the righteousness of God, but it is from faith to faith. Thus it is
that the word of God is always efficacious and saving to men, when viewed in
itself or in its own nature; but no fruit will be found except by those who
believe.<br></div>
<div>As to a former statement, when I said that there is no faith where the word
is wanting, and that those who make such a divorce wholly extinguish faith and
reduce it to nothing, the subject is worthy of special notice. For it hence
appears evident that faith cannot exist in any but in the children of God, to
whom alone the promise of adoption is offered. For what sort of faith have
devils, to whom no salvation is promised? And what sort of faith have all the
ungodly who are ignorant of the word? The hearing must ever precede faith, and
that indeed that we may know that God speaks and not men. <br></div>

<div>He now begins to embellish the passage which he had quoted from David. He
has hitherto taken it, as they say, according to the letter, that is, in its
literal sense; but he now amplifies and decorates it; and thus he rather alludes
to than explains the words of David. This sort of decoration Paul employed in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451006&gt;</font></sup>Romans 10:6, in referring
to these words of Moses, &#8220;Say not, who shall ascend into heaven!&#8221;
etc. Nor is it indeed anything unsuitable, in accommodating Scripture to a
subject in hand, to illustrate by figurative terms what is more simply
delivered. However, the sum of the whole is this, that what God threatens in the
Psalm as to the loss of his rest, applies also to us, inasmuch as he invites us
also at this day to a rest.<br></div>
<div>The chief difficulty of this passage arises from this, that it is perverted
by many. The Apostle had no other thing in view by declaring that there is a
rest for us, than to rouse us to desire it, and also to make us to fear, lest we
should be shut out of it through unbelief He however teaches us at the same
time, that the rest into which an entrance is now open to us, is far more
valuable than that in the land of Canaan. But let us now come to
particulars.<br></div>
<div><b>3.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For we which have believed do enter into
rest,</i></font> or, for we enter into the rest after we have believed, etc. It
is an argument from what is contrary. Unbelief alone shuts us out; then faith
alone opens an entrance. We must indeed bear in mind what he has already stated,
that God being angry with the unbelieving, had sworn that they should not
partake of that blessing. Then they enter in where unbelief does not hinder,
provided only that God invites them. But by speaking in the first person he
allures them with greater sweetness, separating them from aliens.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Although the works,</i></font> etc. To define what
our rest is, he reminds us of what Moses relates, that God having finished the
creation of the world, immediately rested from his works and he finally
concludes, that the true rest of the faithful, which is to continue forever,
will be when they shall rest as God
did.<sup><font color="Maroon">F68</font></sup> And doubtless as the highest
happiness of man is to be united to his God, so ought to be his ultimate end to
which he ought to refer all his thoughts and actions. This he proves, because
God who is said to have rested, declared a long time after that he would not
give his rest to the unbelieving; he would have so declared to no purpose, had
he not intended that the faithful should rest after his own example. Hence he
says, <font color="Maroon"><i>It remaineth that some must enter in:</i></font>
for if not to enter in is the punishment of unbelief, then an entrance, as it
has been said, is open to believers.<br></div>
<div><b>7. </b>But there is some more difficulty in what he immediately
subjoins, that there is another today appointed for us in the Psalm, because the
former people had been excluded; but the words of David (as it may be said) seem
to express no such thing, and mean only this, that God punished the unbelief of
the people by refusing to them the possession of the land. To this I answer,
that the inference is correct, that to us is offered what was denied to them;
for the Holy Spirit reminds and warns us, that we may not do the same thing so
as to incur the same punishment. For how does the matter stand? Were nothing at
this day promised, how could this warning be suitable, &#8220;Take heed lest the
same thing happen to you as to the fathers.&#8221; Rightly then does the Apostle
say, that as the fathers&#8217; unbelief deprived them of the promised
possession, the promise is renewed to their children, so that they may possess
what had been neglected by their fathers.<br></div>
<div><b>8.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For if Jesus had given them
rest,</i></font> or, had obtained rest for them, etc. He meant not to deny but
that David understood by rest the land of Canaan, into which Joshua conducted
the people; but he denies this to be the final rest to which the faithful
aspire, and which we have also in common with the faithful of that age; for it
is certain that they looked higher than to that land; nay, the land of Canaan
was not otherwise so much valued except for this reason, because it was an image
and a symbol of the spiritual inheritance. When, therefore, they obtained
possession of it, they ought not to have rested as though they had attained to
the summit of their wishes, but on the contrary to meditate on what was
spiritual as by it suggested. They to whom David addressed the Psalm were in
possession of that land, but they were reminded of the duty of seeking a better
rest.<br></div>
<div>We then see how the land of Canaan was a rest; it was indeed but
evanescent, beyond which it was the duty of the faithful to advance. In this
sense the Apostle denies that that rest was given by Joshua; for the people
under his guidance entered the promised land for this end, that they might with
greater alacrity advance forward towards heaven.<br></div>
<div>And we may hence easily learn the difference between us and them; for
though the same end is designed for both, yet they had, as added to them,
external types to guide them; not so have we, nor have we indeed any need of
them, for the naked truth itself is set before our eyes. Though our salvation is
as yet in hope, yet as to the truth, it leads directly to heaven; nor does
Christ extend his hand to us, that he may conduct us by the circuitous course of
types and figures, but that he may withdraw us from the world and raise us up to
heaven. Now that the Apostle separates the shadow from the substance, he did so
for this reason, &#8212; because he had to do with the Jews, who were too much
attached to external things.<br></div>
<div>He draws the conclusion, that there is a sabbathizing reserved for Gods
people, that is, a spiritual rest; to which God daily invites us.<br></div>
<div><b>10.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For he that is entered into his
rest,</i></font> or, For he who has rested, etc. This is a definition of that
perpetual Sabbath in which there is the highest felicity, when there will be a
likeness between men and God, to whom they will be united. For whatever the
philosophers may have ever said of the chief good, it was nothing but cold and
vain, for they confined man to himself, while it is necessary for us to go out
of ourselves to find happiness. The chief good of man is nothing else but union
with God; this is attained when we are formed according to him as our
exemplar.<br></div>
<div>Now this conformation the Apostle teaches us takes place when we rest from
our works. It hence at length follows, that man becomes happy by self-denial.
For what else is to cease from our works, but to mortify our flesh, when a man
renounces himself that he may live to God? For here we must always begin, when
we speak of a godly and holy life, that man being in a manner dead to himself,
should allow God to live in him, that he should abstain from his own works, so
as to give place to God to work. We must indeed confess, that then only is our
life rightly formed when it becomes subject to God. But through inbred
corruption this is never the case, until we rest from our own works; nay, such
is the opposition between God&#8217;s government and our corrupt affections,
that he cannot work in us until we rest. But though the completion of this rest
cannot be attained in this life, yet we ought ever to strive for
it.<sup><font color="Maroon">F69</font></sup> Thus believers enter it but on
this condition, &#8212; that by running they may continually go
forward.<br></div>
<div>But I doubt not but that the Apostle designedly alluded to the Sabbath in
order to reclaim the Jews from its external observances; for in no other way
could its abrogation be understood, except by the knowledge of its spiritual
design. He then treats of two things together; for by extolling the excellency
of grace, he stimulates us to receive it by faith, and in the meantime he shows
us in passing what is the true design of the Sabbath, lest the Jews should be
foolishly attached to the outward rite. Of its abrogation indeed he does
expressly speak, for this is not his subject, but by teaching them that the rite
had a reference to something else, he gradually withdraws them from their
superstitious notions. For he who understands that the main object of the
precept was not external rest or earthly worship, immediately perceives, by
looking on Christ, that the external rite was abolished by his coming; for when
the body appears, the shadows immediately vanish away. Then our first business
always is, to teach that Christ is the end of the Law. <br></div>

<div>Having pointed out the goal to which we are to advance, he exhorts us to
pursue our course, which we do, when we habituate ourselves to self-denial. And
as he compares entering into rest to a straight course, he sets falling in
opposition to it, and thus he continues the metaphor in both clauses, at the
same time he alludes to the history given by Moses of those who fell in the
wilderness, because they were rebellious against God.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;042665&gt;</font></sup>Numbers 26:65.) Hence he
says, <font color="Maroon"><i>after the same example,</i></font> signifying as
though the punishment for unbelief and obstinacy is there set before us as in a
picture; nor is there indeed a doubt but that a similar end awaits us, if there
be found in us the same unbelief.<br></div>
<div>Then, &#8220;to fall&#8221; means to perish; or to speak more plainly, it
is to fall, not as to sin, but as a punishment for it. But the figure
corresponds as well with the word to &#8220;enter&#8221;, as with the sad
overthrow of the fathers, by whose example he intended to terrify the
Jews.<br></div>
<div><b>12.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For the word of God is quick,</i></font>
or living, etc. What he says here of the efficacy or power of the word, he says
it, that they might know, that it could not be despised with impunity, as though
he had said, &#8220;Whenever the Lord addresses us by his word, he deals
seriously with us, in order that he may touch all our inmost thoughts and
feelings; and so there is no part of our soul which ought not to be
roused.&#8221;<sup><font color="Maroon">F70</font></sup><br></div>
<div>But before we proceed further, we must inquire whether the Apostle speaks
of the effect of the word generally, or refers only to the faithful.<br></div>
<div>It indeed appears evident, that the word of God is not equally efficacious
in all. For in the elect it exerts its own power, when humbled by a true
knowledge of themselves, they flee to the grace of Christ; and this is never the
case, except when it penetrates into the innermost heart. For hypocrisy must be
sifted, which has marvelous and extremely winding recesses in the hearts of men;
and then we must not be slightly pricked or torn, but be thoroughly wounded,
that being prostrate under a sense of eternal death, we may be taught to die to
ourselves. In short, we shall never be renewed in the whole mind, which Paul
requires, (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490423&gt;</font></sup>Ephesians 4:23,)
until our old man be slain by the edge of the spiritual sword. Hence Paul says
in another place,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;505017&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 2:17,) that
the faithful are offered as a sacrifice to God by the Gospel; for they cannot
otherwise be brought to obey God than by having, as it were, their own will
slain; nor can they otherwise receive the light of God&#8217;s wisdom, than by
having the wisdom of the flesh destroyed. Nothing of this kind is found in the
reprobate; for they either carelessly disregard God speaking to them, and thus
mock him, or clamour against his truth, and obstinately resist it. In short, as
the word of God is a hammer, so they have a heart like the anvil, so that its
hardness repels its strokes, however powerful they may be. The word of God,
then, is far from being so efficacious towards them as to penetrate into them to
<font color="Maroon"><i>the dividing of the soul and the spirit.</i></font>
Hence it appears, that this its character is to be confined to the faithful
only, as they alone are thus searched to the quick.<br></div>
<div>The context, however, shows that there is here a general truth, and which
extends also to the reprobate themselves; for though they are not softened, but
set up a brazen and an iron heart against God&#8217;s word, yet they must
necessarily be restrained by their own guilt. They indeed laugh, but it is a
sardonic laugh; for they inwardly feel that they are, as it were, slain; they
make evasions in various ways, so as not to come before God&#8217;s tribunal;
but though unwilling, they are yet dragged there by this very word which they
arrogantly deride; so that they may be fitly compared to furious dogs, which
bite and claw the chain by which they are bound, and yet can do nothing, as they
still remain fast bound.<br></div>
<div>And further, though this effect of the word may not appear immediately as
it were on the first day, yet it will be found at length by the event, that it
has not been preached to any one in vain. General no doubt is what Christ
declares, when he says, When the Spirit shall come, he will convince the world,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431608&gt;</font></sup>John 16:8 9.) for the
Spirit exercises this office by the preaching, of the Gospel. And lastly, though
the word of God does not always exert its power on man, yet it has it in a
manner included in itself. And the Apostle speaks here of its character and
proper office for this end only, &#8212; that we may know that our consciences
are summoned as guilty before God&#8217;s tribunal as soon as it sounds in our
ears, as though he had said, &#8220;If any one thinks that the air is beaten by
an empty sound when the word of God is preached, he is greatly mistaken; for it
is a living thing and full of hidden power, which leaves nothing in man
untouched.&#8221; The sum of the whole then is this, &#8212; that as soon as God
opens his sacred mouth, all our faculties ought to be open to receive his word;
for he would not have his word scattered in vain, so as to disappear or to fall
neglected on the ground, but he would have it effectually to constrain the
consciences of men, so as to bring them under his authority; and that he has put
power in his word for this purpose, that it may scrutinize all the parts of the
soul, search the thoughts, discern the affections, and in a word show itself to
be the judge.<br></div>
<div>But here a new question arises, &#8220;Is this word to be understood of the
Law or of the Gospel?&#8221; Those who think that the Apostle speaks of the Law
bring these testimonies of Paul, &#8212; that it is the ministration of death,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470306&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 3:6, 7,)
that it is the letter which killeth, that it worketh nothing but wrath,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450415&gt;</font></sup>Romans 4:15,) and similar
passages. But here the Apostle points out also its different effects; for, as we
have said, there is a certain vivifying killing of the soul, which is effected
by the Gospel. Let us then know that the Apostle speaks generally of the truth
of God, when he says, that it is living and efficacious. So Paul testifies, when
he declares, that by his preaching there went forth an odor of death unto death
to the unbelieving, but of life unto life to believers,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470216&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 2:16,) so
that God never speaks in vain; he draws some to salvation, others he drives into
ruin. This is the power of binding and loosing which the Lord conferred on his
Apostles. (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401818&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 18:18.)
And, indeed, he never promises to us salvation in Christ, without denouncing, on
the other hand, vengeance on unbelievers; who by rejecting Christ bring death on
themselves.<sup><font color="Maroon">F71</font></sup><br></div>
<div>It must be further noticed, that the Apostle speaks of God&#8217;s word,
which is brought to us by the ministry of men. For delirious and even dangerous
are those notions, that though the internal word is efficacious, yet that which
proceeds from the mouth of man is lifeless and destitute of all power. I indeed
admit that the power does not proceed from the tongue of man, nor exists in mere
sound, but that the whole power is to be ascribed altogether to the Holy Spirit;
there is, however, nothing in this to hinder the Spirit from putting forth his
power in the word preached. For God, as he speaks not by himself, but by men,
dwells carefully on this point, so that his truth may not be objected to in
contempt, because men are its ministers. So Paul, by saying, that the Gospel is
the power of God, (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450116&gt;</font></sup>Romans
1:16.) designedly adorned with this distinction his own preaching, though he saw
that it was slandered by some and despised by others. And when in another place,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451008&gt;</font></sup>Romans 10:8,) he teaches
us that salvation is conferred by the doctrine of faith, he expressly says that
it was the doctrine which was preached. We indeed find that God ever commends
the truth administered to us by men, in order to induce us to receive it with
reverence.<br></div>
<div>Now, by calling the word <font color="Maroon"><i>quick</i></font> or living
he must be understood as referring to men; which appears still clearer by the
second word, <font color="Maroon"><i>powerful,</i></font> for he shows what sort
of life it possesses, when he expressly says that it is efficacious; for the
Apostle&#8217;s object was to teach us what the word is to
us.<sup><font color="Maroon">F72</font></sup> The
<font color="Maroon"><i>sword</i></font> is a metaphorical word often used in
Scripture; but the Apostle not content with a simple comparison, says, that
God&#8217;s word is <font color="Maroon"><i>sharper than any sword,</i></font>
even than a sword that cuts on both sides, or
<font color="Maroon"><i>two-edged</i></font>; for at that time swords were in
common use, which were blunt on one side, and sharp on the other.
<font color="Maroon"><i>Piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and
spirit,</i></font> or to the dividing of the soul and spirit, etc. The word
<font color="Maroon"><i>soul</i></font> means often the same with
<font color="Maroon"><i>spirit;</i></font> but when they occur together, the
first includes all the affections, and the second means what they call the
intellectual faculty. So Paul, writing to the Thessalonians, uses the words,
when he prays God to keep their spirit, and soul, and body blameless until the
coming of Christ, (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520523&gt;</font></sup>1
Thessalonians 5:23,) he meant no other thing, but that they might continue pure
and chaste in mind, and will, and outward actions. Also Isaiah means the same
when he says,<br></div>
<div align="center"><font color="Navy">&#8220;My soul desired thee in the night;
I sought thee with my spirit.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232609&gt;</font></sup><font color="Navy">Isaiah
26:9.)</font><br></div>
<div>What he doubtless intends to show is, that he was so intent on seeking God,
that he applied his whole mind and his whole heart. I know that some give a
different explanation; but all the sound-minded, as I expect, will assent to
this view.<br></div>
<div>Now, to come to the passage before us, it is said that God&#8217;s word
<font color="Maroon"><i>pierces,</i></font> or reaches to the dividing of soul
and spirit, that is, it examines the whole soul of man; for it searches his
thoughts and scrutinizes his will with all its desires. And then he adds
<font color="Maroon"><i>the joints and marrow,</i></font> intimating that there
is nothing so hard or strong in man, nothing so hidden, that the powerful word
cannot pervade it.<sup><font color="Maroon">F73</font></sup> Paul declares the
same when he says, that prophecy avails to reprove and to judge men, so that the
secrets of the heart may come, to light.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461424&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 14:24.) And
as it is Christ&#8217;s office to uncover and bring to light the thoughts from
the recesses of the heart, this he does for the most part by the
Gospel.<br></div>
<div>Hence God&#8217;s word is a <font color="Maroon"><i>discerner,</i></font>
(<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kritiko&lt;v,</font> one that has power
to discern,) for it brings the light of knowledge to the mind of man as it were
from a labyrinth, where it was held before entangled. There is indeed no thicker
darkness than that of unbelief, and hypocrisy is a horrible blindness; but
God&#8217;s word scatters this darkness and chases away this hypocrisy. Hence
the separating or discerning which the Apostle mentions; for the vices, hid
under the false appearance of virtues, begin then to be known, the varnish being
wiped away. And if the reprobate remain for a time in their hidden recesses, yet
they find at length that God&#8217;s word has penetrated there also, so that
they cannot escape God&#8217;s judgment. Hence their clamour and also their
fury, for were they not smitten by the word, they would not thus betray their
madness, but they would seek to elude the word, or by evasion to escape from its
power, or to pass it by unnoticed; but these things God does not allow them to
do. Whenever then they slander God&#8217;s word, or become enraged against it,
they show that they feel within its power, however unwillingly and
reluctantly.<sup><font color="Maroon">F74</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>13.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Neither is there any
creature,</i></font> etc. The conjunction here, as I think, is causal, and may
be rendered <font color="Maroon"><i>for;</i></font> for in order to confirm this
truth, that whatever is hid in man is discerned and judged by God&#8217;s word,
he draws an argument from the nature of God himself. There is no creature, he
says, which is hid from the eyes of God; there is, therefore, nothing so deep in
man&#8217;s soul, which cannot be drawn forth into light by that word that
resembles its own author, for as it is God&#8217;s office to search the heart,
so he performs this examination by his word.<br></div>
<div>Interpreters, without considering that God&#8217;s word is like a long
staff by which he examines and searches what lies deep in our hearts, have
strangely perverted this passage; and yet they have not relieved themselves. But
all difficulty disappears when we take this view, &#8212; that we ought to obey
God&#8217;s word in sincerity and with cordial affection, because God, who knows
our hearts, has assigned to his word the office of penetrating even into our
inmost thoughts. The ambiguous meaning of the last words has also led
interpreters astray, which they have rendered, &#8220;Of whom we speak;&#8221;
but they ought, on the contrary, to be rendered, <font color="Maroon"><i>With
whom we have to do.</i></font> The meaning is, that it is God who deals with us,
or with whom we have a concern; and that, therefore, we ought not to trifle with
him as with a mortal man, but that whenever his word is set before us, we ought
to tremble, for nothing is hid from him. <br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><b>14.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Seeing then that we have,</i></font> or,
Having then, etc. He has been hitherto speaking of Christ&#8217;s apostleship,
But he how passes on to his second office. For we have said that the Son of God
sustained a twofold character when he was sent to us, even that of a teacher and
of a priest. The Apostle, therefore, after having exhorted the Jews obediently
to embrace the doctrine of Christ, now shows what benefit his priesthood has
brought to us; and this is the second of the two points which he handles. And
fitly does he connect the priesthood with the apostleship, since he reminds us
that the design of both is to enable us to come to God. He employs an inference,
<font color="Maroon"><i>then;</i></font> for he had before referred to this
great truth, that Christ is our high
priest;<sup><font color="Maroon">F75</font></sup> but as the character of the
priesthood cannot be known except through teaching, it was necessary to prepare
the way, so as to render men willing to hear Christ. It now remains, that they
who acknowledge Christ as their teacher, should become teachable disciples, and
also learn from his mouth, and in his school, what is the benefit of his
priesthood, and what is its use and end.<br></div>
<div>In the first place he says, <font color="Maroon"><i>Having a great high
priest,</i><sup>F76</sup><i> Jesus Christ, let us hold fast our
profession,</i></font> or confession. Confession is here, as before, to be taken
as a metonymy for faith; and as the priesthood serves to confirm the doctrine,
the Apostle hence concludes that there is no reason to doubt or to waver
respecting the faith of the Gospel, because the Son of God has approved and
sanctioned it; for whosoever regards the doctrine as not confirmed, dishonors
the Son of God, and deprives him of his honor as a priest; nay, such and so
great a pledge ought to render us confident, so as to rely unhesitantly on the
Gospel.<br></div>
<div><b>15.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For we have not,</i></font> etc. There
is in the name which he mentions, <font color="Maroon"><i>the Son of
God,</i></font> such majesty as ought to constrain us to fear and obey him. But
were we to contemplate nothing but this in Christ, our consciences would not be
pacified; for who of us does not dread the sight of the Son of God, especially
when we consider what our condition is, and when our sins come to mind? The Jews
might have had also another hindrance, for they had been accustomed to the
Levitical priesthood; they saw in that one mortal man, chosen from the rest, who
entered into the sanctuary, that by his prayer he might reconcile his brethren
to God. It is a great thing, when the Mediator, who can pacify God towards us,
is one of ourselves. By this sort of allurement the Jews might have been
ensnared, so as to become ever attached to the Levitical priesthood, had not the
Apostle anticipated this, and showed that the Son of God not only excelled in
glory, but that he was also endued with equal kindness and compassion towards
us.<br></div>
<div>It is, then, on this subject that he speaks, when he says that he was
<font color="Maroon"><i>tried by our infirmities,</i></font> that he might
condole with us. As to the word sympathy,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">(sumpaqei&gt;a,)</font> I am not disposed
to indulge in refinements; for frivolous, no less than curious, is this
question, &#8220;Is Christ now subject to our sorrows?&#8221; It was not,
indeed, the Apostle&#8217;s object to weary us with such subtleties and vain
speculations, but only to teach us that we have not to go far to seek a
Mediator, since Christ of his own accord extends his hand to us, that we have no
reason to dread the majesty of Christ since he is our brother, and that there is
no cause to fear, lest he, as one unacquainted with evils, should not be touched
by any feelings of humanity, so as to bring us help, since he took upon him our
infirmities, in order that he might be more inclined to succor
us.<sup><font color="Maroon">F77</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Then the whole discourse of the Apostle refers to what is apprehended by
faith, for he does not speak of what Christ is in himself, but shows what he is
to us. By the <font color="Maroon"><i>likeness,</i></font> he understands that
of nature, by which he intimates that Christ has put on our flesh, and also its
feelings or affections, so that he not only paroled himself to be real man, but
had also been taught by his own experience to help the miserable; not because
the Son of God had need of such a training, but because we could not otherwise
comprehend the care he feels for our salvation. Whenever, then, we labor under
the infirmities of our flesh, let us remember that the son of God experienced
the same, in order that he might by his power raise us up, so that we may not be
overwhelmed by them.<br></div>
<div>But it may be asked, What does he mean by
<font color="Maroon"><i>infirmities?</i></font> The word is indeed taken in
various senses. Some understand by it cold and heat; hunger and other wants of
the body; and also contempt, poverty, and other things of this mind, as in many
places in the writings of Paul, especially in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471210&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 12:10. But
their opinion is more correct who include, together with external evils, the
feelings of the souls such as fear, sorrow, the dread of death, and similar
things.<sup><font color="Maroon">F78</font></sup><br></div>
<div>And doubtless the restriction, <font color="Maroon"><i>without
sin,</i></font> would not have been added, except he had been speaking of the
inward feelings, which in us are always sinful on account of the depravity of
our nature; but in Christ, who possessed the highest rectitude and perfect
purity, they were free from everything vicious. Poverty, indeed, and diseases,
and those things which are without us, are not to be counted as sinful. Since,
therefore, he speaks of infirmities akin to sin, there is no doubt but that he
refers to the feelings or affections of the mind, to which our nature is liable,
and that on account of its infirmity. For the condition of the angels is in this
respect better than ours; for they sorrow not, nor fear, nor are they harassed
by variety of cares, nor by the dread of death. These infirmities Christ of his
own accord undertook, and he willingly contended with them, not only that he
might attain a victory over them for us, but also that we may feel assured that
he is present with us whenever we are tried by them.<br></div>
<div>Thus he not only really became a man, but he also assumed all the qualities
of human nature. There is, however, a limitation added,
<font color="Maroon"><i>without sin;</i></font> for we must ever remember this
difference between Christ&#8217;s feelings or affections and ours, that his
feelings were always regulated according to the strict rule of justice, while
ours flow from a turbid fountain, and always partake of the nature of their
source, for they are turbulent and
unbridled.<sup><font color="Maroon">F79</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>16.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Let us therefore come boldly,</i></font>
or, with confidence, etc. He draws this conclusion, &#8212; that an access to
God is open to all who come to him relying on Christ the Mediator; nay, he
exhorts the faithful to venture without any hesitation to present themselves
before God. And the chief benefit of divine teaching is a sure confidence in
calling on God, as, on the other hand, the whole of religion falls to the
ground, and is lost when this certainty is taken away from
consciences.<br></div>
<div>It is hence obvious to conclude, that under the Papacy the light of the
Gospel is extinct, for miserable men are bidden to doubt whether God is
propitious to them or is angry with them. They indeed say that God is to be
sought; but the way by which it is possible to come to him is not pointed out,
and the gate is barred by which alone men can enter. They confess in words that
Christ is a Mediator, but in reality they make the power of his priesthood of
none effect, and deprive him of his honor.<br></div>
<div>For we must hold this principle, &#8212; that Christ is not really known as
a Mediator except all doubt as to our access to God is removed; otherwise the
conclusion here drawn would not stand, &#8220;We have a high priest Who is
willing to help us; therefore we may come bold and without any hesitation to the
throne of grace.&#8221; And were we indeed fully persuaded that Christ is of his
own accord stretching forth his hand to us, who of us would not come in perfect
confidence?<sup><font color="Maroon">F80</font></sup> It is then true what I
said, that its power is taken away from Christ&#8217;s priesthood whenever men
have doubts, and are anxiously seeking for mediators, as though that one were
not sufficient, in whose patronage all they who really trust, as the Apostle
here directs them, have the assurance that their prayers are heard.<br></div>
<div>The ground of this assurance is, that the throne of God is not arrayed in
naked majesty to confound us, but is adorned with a new name, even that of
<font color="Maroon"><i>grace</i></font>, which ought ever to be remembered
whenever we shun the presence of God. For the glory of God, when we contemplate
it alone, can produce no other effect than to fill us with despair; so awful is
his throne. The Apostle, then, that he might remedy our diffidence, and free our
minds from all fear and trembling, adorns it with &#8220;grace,&#8221; and gives
it a name which can allure us by its sweetness, as though he had said,
&#8220;Since God has affirmed to his throne as it were the banner of
&#8216;grace&#8217; and of his paternal love towards us, there are no reasons
why his majesty should drive us
away.&#8221;<sup><font color="Maroon">F81</font></sup><br></div>
<div>The import of the whole is, that we are to call upon God without fear,
since we know that he is propitious to us, and that this may be done is owing to
the benefit conferred on us by Christ, as we find from
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490312&gt;</font></sup>Ephesians 3:12; for when
Christ receives us under his protection and patronage, he covers with his
goodness the majesty of God, which would otherwise be terrible to us, so that
nothing appears there but grace and paternal favor.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>That we may obtain mercy,</i></font> etc. This is
not added without great reason; it is for the purpose of encouraging as it were
by name those who feel the need of mercy, lest any one should be cast down by
the sense of his misery, and close up his way by his own diffidence. This
expression, &#8220;that we may obtain mercy&#8221;, contains especially this
most delightful truth, that all who, relying on the advocacy of Christ, pray to
God, are certain to obtain mercy; yet on the other hand the Apostle indirectly,
or by implication, holds out a threatening to all who take not this way, and
intimates that God will be inexorable to them, because they disregard the only
true way of being reconciled to him.<br></div>
<div>He adds, <font color="Maroon"><i>To help in time of need,</i></font> or,
for a seasonable help; that is, if we desire to obtain all things necessary for
our salvation.<sup><font color="Maroon">F82</font></sup> Now, this
seasonableness refers to the time of calling, according to those words of
Isaiah, which Paul accommodates to the preaching of the Gospel, &#8220;Behold,
now is the accepted time,&#8221; etc.,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234908&gt;</font></sup>Isaiah 49:8;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470602&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 6:2;) for the
Apostle refers to that &#8220;today,&#8221; during which God speaks to us. If we
defer hearing until tomorrow, when God is speaking to us today, the unseasonable
night will come, when what now may be done can no longer be done; and we shall
in vain knock when the door is closed. <br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><b>1.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For every high priest,</i></font> etc. He
compares Christ with the Levitical priests, and he teaches us what is the
likeness and the difference between them; and the object of the whole discourse
is, to show what Christ&#8217;s office really is, and also to prove that
whatever was ordained under the law was ordained on his account. Hence the
Apostle passes on at last to show that the ancient priesthood was
abolished.<br></div>
<div>He first says that the priests were <font color="Maroon"><i>taken from
among men;</i></font> secondly, that they did not act a private part but for the
whole people; thirdly, that they were not to come empty to appease God, but
furnished with sacrifices; fourthly, that they were not to be exempt from human
infirmities, that they might more readily succor the distressed; and lastly,
that they were not presumptuously to rush into this office, and that then only
was the honor legitimate when they were chosen and approved by God. We shall
consider briefly each of these points.<br></div>
<div>We must first, however, expose the ignorance of those who apply these
things to our time, as though there was at this day the same need of priests to
offer sacrifices; at the same time there is no necessity for a long refutation.
For what can be more evident than that the reality found in Christ is compared
with its types, which, being prior in time, have now ceased? But this will
appear more fully from the context. How extremely ridiculous then are they who
seek by this passage to establish and support the sacrifice of the mass! I now
return to the words of the Apostle.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Taken from among men,</i></font> etc. This he says
of the priests. It hence follows that it was necessary for Christ to be a real
man; for as we are very far from God, we stand in a manner before him in the
person of our priest, which could not be, were he not one of us. Hence, that the
Son of God has a nature in common with us, does not diminish his dignity, but
commends it the more to us; for he is fitted to reconcile us to God, because he
is man. Therefore Paul, in order to prove that he is a Mediator, expressly calls
him man; for had he been taken from among angels or any other beings, we could
not by him be united to God, as he could not react down to us.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>For men,</i></font> etc. This is the
<font color="Maroon"><i>second</i></font> clause; the priest was not privately a
minister for himself, but was appointed for the common good of the people. But
it is of great consequence to notice this, so that we may know that the
salvation of us all is connected with and revolves on the priesthood of Christ.
The benefit is expressed in these words, <font color="Maroon"><i>ordains those
things which pertain to God.</i></font> They may, indeed, be explained in two
ways, as the verb <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kaqi&gt;statai</font>
has a passive as well as an active sense. They who take it passively give this
version, &#8220;is ordained in those things,&#8221; etc.; and thus they would
have the preposition <font color="Maroon"><i>in</i></font> to be understood; I
approve more of the other rendering, that the high priest takes care of or
ordains the things pertaining to God; for the construction flows better, and the
sense is fuller.<sup><font color="Maroon">F83</font></sup> But still in either
way, what the Apostle had in view is the same, namely, that we have no
intercourse with God, except there be a priest; for, as we are unholy, what have
we to do with holy things? We are in a word alienated from God and his service
until a priest interposes and undertakes our cause.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>That he may offer both gifts,</i></font> etc. The
<font color="Maroon"><i>third</i></font> thing he mentions respecting a priest
is the offering of gifts. There are however here two things, gifts and
sacrifices; the first word includes, as I think, various kinds of sacrifices,
and is therefore a general term; but the second denotes especially the
sacrifices of expiation. Still the meaning is, that the priest without a
sacrifice is no peacemaker between God and man, for without a sacrifice sins are
not atoned for, nor is the wrath of God pacified. Hence, whenever reconciliation
between God and man takes place, this pledge must ever necessarily precede. Thus
we see that angels are by no means capable of obtaining for us God&#8217;s
favor, because they have no sacrifice. The same must be thought of Prophets and
Apostles. Christ alone then is he, who having taken away sins by his own
sacrifice, can reconcile God to us.<br></div>
<div><b>2.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Who can,</i></font> etc. This
<font color="Maroon"><i>fourth</i></font> point has some affinity to the first,
and yet it may be distinguished from it; for the Apostle before taught us that
mankind are united to God in the person of one man, as all men partake of the
same flesh and nature; but now he refers to another thing, and that is, that the
priest ought to be kind and gentle to sinners, because he partakes of their
infirmities. The word which the Apostle uses,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">metriopaqei~n</font> is differently
explained both by Greek and Latin
interpreters.<sup><font color="Maroon">F84</font></sup> I, however, think that
it simply means one capable of sympathy. All the things which are here said of
the Levitical priests do not indeed apply to Christ; for Christ we know was
exempt from every contagion of sin; he therefore differed from others in this
respect, that he had no necessity of offering a sacrifice for himself. But it is
enough for us to know that he bare our infirmities, though free from sin and
undefiled. Then, as to the ancient and Levitical priests, the Apostle says, that
they were subject to human infirmity, and that they made atonement also for
their own sins, that they might not only be kind to others when gone astray, but
also condole or sympathize with them. This part ought to be so far applied to
Christ as to include that exception which he mentioned before, that is, that he
bare our infirmities, being yet without sin. At the same time, though ever free
from sin, yet that experience of infirmities before described is alone
abundantly sufficient to incline him to help us, to make him merciful and ready
to pardon, to render him solicitous for us in our miseries. The sum of what is
said is, that Christ is a brother to us, not only on account of unity as to
flesh and nature, but also by becoming a partaker of our infirmities, so that he
is led, and as it were formed, to show forbearance and kindness. The participle,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">duna&gt;menov</font> is more forcible
than in our common tongue, <font color="Maroon"><i>qui possit,</i></font>
&#8220;who can,&#8221; for it expresses aptness or fitness.
<font color="Maroon"><i>The ignorant</i></font> and those
<font color="Maroon"><i>out of the way,</i></font> or erring, he has named
instead of sinners, according to what is done in Hebrew; for
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hgg&ccedil;</font> ,
<font color="Maroon"><i>shegage,</i></font> means every kind of error or
offense, as I shall have presently an occasion to explain.<br></div>
<div><b>4.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And no man,</i></font> etc. There is to
be noticed in this verse partly a likeness and partly a difference. What makes
an office lawful is the call of God; so that no one can rightly and orderly
perform it without being made fit for it by God. Christ and Aaron had this in
common, that God called them both; but they differed in this, that Christ
succeeded by a new and different way and was made a perpetual priest. It is
hence evident that Aaron&#8217;s priesthood was temporary, for it was to cease.
We see the object of the Apostle; it was to defend the right of Christ&#8217;s
priesthood; and he did this by showing that God was its author. But this would
not have been sufficient, unless it was made evident that an end was to be put
to the old in order that a room might be obtained for this. And this point he
proves by directing our attention to the terms on which Aaron was appointed, for
we are not to extend them further than God&#8217;s decree; and he will presently
make it evident how long God had designed this order to continue. Christ then is
a lawful priest, for he was appointed by God&#8217;s authority. What is to be
said of Aaron and his successors? That they had as much right as was granted
them by the Lord, but not so much as men according to their own fancy concede to
them.<br></div>
<div>But though this has been said with reference to what is here handled, yet
we may hence draw a general truth, &#8212; that no government is to be set up in
the Church by the will of men, but that we are to wait for the command of God,
and also that we ought to follow a certain rule in electing ministers, so that
no one may intrude according to his own humor. Both these things ought to be
distinctly noticed for the Apostle here speaks not of persons only, but also of
the office itself; nay, he denies that the office which men appoint without
God&#8217;s command is lawful and divine. For as it appertains to God only to
rule his Church, so he claims this right as his own, that is, to prescribe the
way and manner of administration. I hence deem it as indisputable, that the
Papal priesthood is spurious; for it has been framed in the workshop of men. God
nowhere commands a sacrifice to be offered now to him for the expiation of sins;
nowhere does he command priests to be appointed for such a purpose. While then
the Pope ordains his priests for the purpose of sacrificing, the Apostle denies
that they are to be counted lawful priests; they cannot therefore be such,
except by some new privilege they exalt themselves above Christ, for he dared
not of himself to take upon him this honor, but waited for the command of the
Father.<br></div>
<div>This also ought to be held good as to persons, that no individual is of
himself to seize on this honor without public authority. I speak now of offices
divinely appointed. At the same time it may sometimes be, that one, not called
by God, is yet to be tolerated, however little he may be approved, provided the
office itself be divine and approved by God; for many often creep in through
ambition or some bad motives, whose call has no evidence; and yet they are not
to be immediately rejected, especially when this cannot be done by the public
decision of the Church. For during two hundred years before the coming of Christ
the foulest corruptions prevailed with respect to the priesthood, yet the right
of honor, proceeding from the calling of God, still continued as to the office
itself; and the men themselves were tolerated, because the freedom of the Church
was subverted. It hence appears that the greatest defect is the character of the
office itself, that is, when men of themselves invent what God has never
commanded. The less endurable then are those Romish sacrificers, who prattle of
nothing but their own titles, that they may be counted sacred, while yet they
have chosen themselves without any authority from God.<br></div>
<div><b>5.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Thou art my Son,</i></font> etc. This
passage may seem to be far-fetched; for though Christ was begotten of God the
Father, he was not on this account made also a priest. But if we consider the
end for which Christ was manifested to the world, it will plainly appear that
this character necessarily belongs to him. We must however bear especially in
mind what we said on the first chapter; that the begetting of Christ, of which
the Psalmist speaks, was a testimony which the Father rendered to him before
men. Therefore the mutual relation between the Father and the Son is not what is
here intended; but regard is rather had to men to whom he was manifested. Now,
what sort of Son did God manifest to us? One indued with no honor, with no
power? Nay, one who was to be a Mediator between himself and man; his begetting
then included his
priesthood.<sup><font color="Maroon">F85</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>6</b><font color="Maroon"><b><i>.</i></b><i> As he saith in another
place,</i></font> or, elsewhere, etc. Here is expressed more clearly what the
Apostle intended. This is a remarkable passage, and indeed the whole Psalm from
which it is taken; for there is scarcely anywhere a clearer prophecy respecting
Christ&#8217;s eternal priesthood and his kingdom. And yet the Jews try all
means to evade it, in order that they might obscure the glory of Christ; but
they cannot succeed. They apply it to David, as though he was the person whom
God bade to sit on his right hand; but this is an instance of extreme
effrontery; for we know that it was not lawful for kings to exercise the
priesthood. On this account, Uzziah, that is, for the sole crime of
intermeddling with an office that did not belong to him, so provoked God that he
was smitten with leprosy.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;142618&gt;</font></sup>2 Chronicles 26:18.) It is
therefore certain that neither David nor any one of the kings is intended
here.<br></div>
<div>If they raise this objection and say, that princes are sometimes called
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynhk
</font><font color="Maroon"><i>cohenim</i></font>, priests, I indeed allow it,
but I deny that the word can be so understood here. For the comparison here made
leaves nothing doubtful: Melchisedec was God&#8217;s priest; and the Psalmist
testifies that that king whom God has set on his right hand would be a |kohen|
according to the order of Melchisedec. Who does not see that this is to be
understood of the priesthood? For as it was a rare and almost a singular thing
for the same person to be a priest and a king, at least an unusual thing among
God&#8217;s people, hence he sets forth Melchisedec as the type of the Messiah,
as though he had said, &#8220;The royal dignity will not prevent him to exercise
the priesthood also, for a type of such a thing has been already presented in
Melchisedec.&#8221; And indeed all among the Jews, possessed of any modesty,
have conceded that the Messiah is the person here spoken of, and that his
priesthood is what is commended.<br></div>
<div>What is in Greek, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kata&lt;
ta&gt;xin</font> <font color="Maroon"><i>according to the order,</i></font> is
in Hebrew, <font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytrbdAl[</font>
<font color="Maroon"><i>ol-deberti</i></font>, and means the same, and may be
rendered, &#8220;according to the way&#8221; or manner: and hereby is confirmed
what I have already said, that as it was an unusual thing among the people of
God for the same person to bear the office of a king and of a priest, an ancient
example was brought forward, by which the Messiah was represented. The rest the
Apostle himself will more minutely set forth in what follows. <br></div>

<div><b>7.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Who in the days,</i></font> etc. As the
form and beauty of Christ is especially disfigured by the cross, while men do
not consider the end for which he humbled himself, the Apostle again teaches us
what he had before briefly referred to, that his wonderful goodness shines forth
especially in this respect, that he for our good subjected himself to our
infirmities. It hence appears that our faith is thus confirmed, and that his
honor is not diminished for having borne our evils.<br></div>
<div>He points out two causes why it behooved Christ to suffer, the proximate
and the ultimate. The proximate was, that he might learn obedience; and the
ultimate, that he might be thus consecrated a priest for our
salutation.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>The days of his flesh</i></font> no doubt mean his
life in this world. It hence follows, that the word
<font color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font> does not signify what is material, but
a condition, according to what is said in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461550&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 15:50,
&#8220;Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God.&#8221; Rave then do
those fanatical men who dream that Christ is now divested of his flesh, because
it is here intimated that he has outlived the days of his flesh for it is one
thing to be a real man, though endued with a blessed immortality; it is another
thing to be liable to those human sorrows and infirmities, which Christ
sustained as long as he was in this world, but has now laid aside, having been
received into heaven.<br></div>
<div>Let us now look into the subject. Christ who was a Son, who sought relief
from the Father and was heard, yet suffered death, that thus he might be taught
to obey. There is in every word a singular importance. By
<font color="Maroon"><i>days of the flesh</i></font> he intimates that the time
of our miseries is limited, which brings no small alleviation. And doubtless
hard were our condition, and by no means tolerable, if no end of suffering were
set before us. The three things which follow bring us also no small
consolations; Christ was a Son, whom his own dignity exempted from the common
lot of men, and yet he subjected himself to that lot for our sakes: who now of
us mortals can dare refuse the same condition? Another argument may be added,
&#8212; though we may be pressed down by adversity, yet we are not excluded from
the number of God&#8217;s children, since we see him going before us who was by
nature his only Son; for that we are counted his children is owing only to the
gift of adoption by which he admits us into a union with him, who alone lays
claim to this honor in his own right.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>When he had offered up prayers,</i></font> etc. The
second thing he mentions respecting Christ is, that he, as it became him, sought
a remedy that he might be delivered from evils; and he said this that no one
might think that Christ had an iron heart which felt nothing; for we ought
always to consider why a thing is said. Had Christ been touched by no sorrow, no
consolation could arise to us from his sufferings; but when we hear that he also
endured the bitterest agonies of mind, the likeness becomes then evident to us.
Christ, he says, did not undergo death and other evils because he disregarded
them or was pressed down by no feeling of distress, but he prayed with tears, by
which he testified the extreme anguish of his
soul.<sup><font color="Maroon">F86</font></sup> Then by
<font color="Maroon"><i>tears</i></font> and <font color="Maroon"><i>strong
crying</i></font> the Apostle meant to express the intensity of his grief, for
it is usual to show it by outward symptoms; nor do I doubt but that he refers to
that prayer which the Evangelists mention, &#8220;Father, if it be possible, let
this cup pass from me,&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402642&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 26:42;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422242&gt;</font></sup>Luke 22:42;) and also to
another, &#8220;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402746&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 27:46.) For in the
second instance mention is made by the evangelists of strong crying; and in the
first it is not possible to believe that his eyes were dry, since drops of
blood, through excessive grief, flowed from his body. It is indeed certain that
he was reduced to great straits; and being overwhelmed with real sorrows, he
earnestly prayed his Father to bring him
help.<sup><font color="Maroon">F87</font></sup><br></div>
<div>And what application is to be made of this? Even this, that whenever our
evils press upon us and overwhelm us, we may call to mind the Son of God who
labored under the same; and since he has gone before us there is no reason for
us to faint. We are at the same time reminded that deliverance from evils can be
found from no other but from God alone, and what better guidance can we have as
to prayer than the example of Christ? He betook himself immediately to the
Father. And thus the Apostle indicates what ought to be done by us when he says
that he offered prayers to him who was able to deliver him from death; for by
these words he intimates that he rightly prayed, because he fled to God the only
Deliverer. His <font color="Maroon"><i>tears</i></font> and
<font color="Maroon"><i>crying</i></font> recommend to us ardor and earnestness
in prayer, for we ought not to pray to God formally, but with ardent
desires.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>And was heard,</i></font> etc. Some render the
following words, &#8220;on account of his reverence&#8221; or fears but I wholly
differ from them. In the first place he puts the word alone
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejulaqei&gt;av</font> without the
possessive &#8220;his&#8221;; and then there is the preposition
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpo&lt;</font> &#8220;from,&#8221; not
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpe&lt;r</font> &#8220;on account
of,&#8221; or any other signifying a cause or a reason. As, then,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujla&gt;qeia </font>means for the most
part fear or anxiety, I doubt not but that the Apostle means that Christ was
heard from that which he feared, so that he was not overwhelmed by his evils or
swallowed up by death. For in this contest the Son of God had to engage, not
because he was tried by unbelief, the source of all our fears, but because he
sustained as a man in our flesh the judgment of God, the terror of which could
not have been overcome without an arduous effort. Chrysostom interprets it of
Christ&#8217;s dignity, which the Father in a manner reverenced; but this cannot
be admitted. Others render it &#8220;piety.&#8221; But the explanation I have
given is much more suitable, and requires no long arguments in its
favor.<sup><font color="Maroon">F88</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Now he added this third particular, lest we should think that
Christ&#8217;s prayers were rejected, because he was not immediately delivered
from his evils; for at no time was God&#8217;s mercy and aid wanting to him. And
hence we may conclude that God often hears our prayers, even when that is in no
way made evident. For though it belongs not to us to prescribe to him as it were
a fixed rule, nor does it become him to grant whatsoever requests we may
conceive in our minds or express with our tongues, yet he shows that he grants
our players in everything necessary for our salvation. So when we seem
apparently to be repulsed, we obtain far more than if he fully granted our
requests.<br></div>
<div>But how was Christ heard from what he feared, as he underwent the death
which he dreaded? To this I reply, that we must consider what it was that he
feared; why was it that he dreaded death except that he saw in it the curse of
God, and that he had to wrestle with the guilt of all iniquities, and also with
hell itself? Hence was his trepidation and anxiety; for extremely terrible is
God&#8217;s judgment. He then obtained what he prayed for, when he came forth a
conqueror from the pains of death, when he was sustained by the saving hand of
the Father, when after a short conflict he gained a glorious victory over Satan,
sin, and hell. Thus it often happens that we ask this or that, but not for a
right end; yet God, not granting what we ask, at the same time finds out himself
a way to succor us.<br></div>
<div><b>8.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Yet learned he obedience,</i></font> etc.
The proximate end of Christ&#8217;s sufferings was thus to habituate himself to
obedience; not that he was driven to this by force, or that he had need of being
thus exercised, as the case is with oxen or horses when their ferocity is to be
tamed, for he was abundantly willing to render to his Father the obedience which
he owed. But this was done from a regard to our benefit, that he might exhibit
to us an instance and an example of subjection even to death itself. It may at
the same time be truly said that Christ by his death learned fully what it was
to obey God, since he was then led in a special manner to deny himself; for
renouncing his own will, he so far gave himself up to his Father that of his own
accord and willingly he underwent that death which he greatly dreaded. The
meaning then is that Christ was by his sufferings taught how far God ought to be
submitted to and obeyed.<br></div>
<div>It is then but right that we also should by his example be taught and
prepared by various sorrows, and at length by death itself, to render obedience
to God; nay, much more necessary is this in our case, for we have a disposition
contumacious and ungovernable until the Lord subdues us by such exercises to
bear his yoke. This benefit, which arises from the cross, ought to allay its
bitterness in our hearts; for what can be more desirable than to be made
obedient to God? But this cannot be effected but by the cross, for in prosperity
we exult as with loose reins; nay, in most cases, when the yoke is shaken off,
the wantonness of the flesh breaks forth into excesses. But when restraint is
put on our will, when we seek to please God, in this act only does our obedience
show itself; nay, it is an illustrious proof of perfect obedience when we choose
the death to which God may call us, though we dread it, rather than the life
which we naturally desire.<br></div>
<div><b>9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And being made perfect, </i></font>or
sanctified, etc. Here is the ultimate or the remoter end, as they call it, why
it was necessary for Christ to suffer: it was that he might thus become
initiated into his priesthood, as though the Apostle had said that the enduring
of the cross and death were to Christ a solemn kind of consecration, by which he
intimates that all his sufferings had a regard to our salvation. It hence
follows, that they are so far from being prejudicial to his dignity that they
are on the contrary his glory; for if salvation be highly esteemed by us, how
honorably ought we to think of its cause or author? For he speaks not here of
Christ only as an example, but he ascends higher, even that he by his obedience
has blotted out our transgressions. He became then the cause of salvation,
because he obtained righteousness for us before God, having removed the
disobedience of Adam by an act of an opposite kind, even obedience.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Sanctified</i></font> suits the passage better than
&#8220;made perfect.&#8221; The Greek word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">teleiwqei&lt;v</font> means both; but as
he speaks here of the priesthood, he fitly and suitably mentions sanctification.
And so Christ himself speaks in another place, &#8220;For their sakes I sanctify
myself.&#8221; (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431719&gt;</font></sup>John
17:19.) It hence appears that this is to be properly applied to his human
nature, in which he performed the office of a priest, and in which he also
suffered.<sup><font color="Maroon">F89</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>To all them that obey him.</i></font> If then we
desire that Christ&#8217;s obedience should be profitable to us, we must imitate
him; for the Apostle means that its benefit shall come to none but to those who
obey. But by saying this he recommends faith to us; for he becomes not ours, nor
his blessings, except as far as we receive them and him by faith. He seems at
the same time to have adopted a universal term,
<font color="Maroon"><i>all,</i></font> for this end, that he might show that no
one is precluded from salvation who is but teachable and becomes obedient to the
Gospel of Christ.<br></div>
<div><b>10.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Called of God,</i></font> or named by
God, etc. As it was necessary that he should pursue more at large the comparison
between Christ and Melchisedec, on which he had briefly touched, and that the
mind of the Jews should be stirred up to greater attention, he so passes to a
digression that he still retails his argument.<br></div>
<div><b>11.</b> He therefore makes a preface by saying that he had
<font color="Maroon"><i>many things</i></font> to say, but that they were to
prepare themselves lest these things should be said in vain. He reminds them
that they were <font color="Maroon"><i>hard</i></font> or difficult things; not
indeed to repel them, but to stimulate them to greater attention. For as things
that are easily understood render us slothful, so we become more keenly bent on
hearing when anything obscure is set before us. He however states that the cause
of the difficulty was not in the subject but in themselves. And indeed the Lord
speaks to us so clearly and without any obscurity, that his word is rightly
called our light; but its brightness become dim through our
darkness.<sup><font color="Maroon">F90</font></sup> This happens partly through
our dullness and partly through our sloth; for though we are very dull to
understand the truth of God, yet there is to be added to this vice the depravity
of our affections, for we apply our minds to vanity rather than to God&#8217;s
truth. We are also continually impeded either by our perverseness, or by the
cares of the world, or by the lusts of our flesh<font color="Maroon"><i>. Of
whom</i></font> does not refer to Christ, but to Melchisedec; yet he is not
referred to as a private man, but as the type of Christ, and in a manner
personating him. <br></div>

<div><b>12.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For when for the time ye
ought,</i></font> etc. This reproof contains in it very sharp goads to rouse the
Jews from their sloth. He says that it was unreasonable and disgraceful that
they should still continue in the elements, in the first rudiments of knowledge,
while they ought to have been teachers. &#8220;You ought,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;to have been the instructors of others, but ye are not even disciples
capable of comprehending an ordinary truth; for ye do not as yet understand the
first rudiments of Christianity.&#8221; That he might, however, make them the
more ashamed of themselves, he mentions the &#8220;first principles,&#8221; or
the elements of the beginning of God&#8217;s words, as though he had said, You
do not know the alphabet. We must, indeed, learn through life; for he alone is
truly wise who owns that he is very far from perfect knowledge; but we ought
still to profit so much by learning as not to continue always in the first
principles. Nor are we to act in such a way, that what is said by Isaiah should
be verified in us,<br></div>
<div align="center"><font color="Navy">&#8220;There shall be to you a precept on
precept, a precept on precept,&#8221; etc.

<div>but we ought, on the contrary, so to exert ourselves, that our progress may
correspond to<font color="Maroon"><i> the time</i></font> allowed us.<br></div>
<div>Doubtless, not only years, but days also, must be accounted for; so that
every one ought to strive to make progress; but few there are who summon
themselves to an account as to past time, or who show any concern for the
future. We are, therefore, justly punished for our sloth, for most of us remain
in elements fitted for children. We are further reminded, that it is the duty of
every one to impart the knowledge he has to his brethren; so that no one is to
retain what he knows to himself, but to communicate it to the edification of
others.<sup><font color="Maroon">F91</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Such as have need of milk.</i></font> Paul uses the
same metaphor in 1 Corinthians 3:2; and he reproaches the Corinthians with the
same fault with what is mentioned here, at least with one that is very similar;
for he says, that they were carnal and could not bear solid food. Milk then
means an elementary doctrine suitable to the ignorant. Peter takes the word in
another sense, when he bids us to desire the milk that is without deceit,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600202&gt;</font></sup>1 Peter 2:2;) for there is
a twofold childhood, that is, as to wickedness, and as to understanding; and so
Paul tells us, &#8220;Be not children in understanding, but in
wickedness.&#8221; (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461420&gt;</font></sup>1
Corinthians 14:20.) They then who are so tender that they cannot receive the
higher doctrine, are by way of reproach called children.<br></div>
<div>For the right application of doctrines is to join us together, so that we
may grow to a perfect manhood, to the measure of full age, and that we should
not be like children, tossed here and there, and carried about by every wind of
doctrine. (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490414&gt;</font></sup>Ephesians 4:14.)
We must indeed show some indulgence to those who have not yet known much of
Christ, if they are not capable as yet of receiving
<font color="Maroon"><i>solid food,</i></font> but he who has had time to grow,
if he till continues a child, is not entitled to any excuse. We indeed see that
Isaiah brands the reprobate with this mark, that they were like children newly
weaned from the breasts.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232809&gt;</font></sup>Isaiah 28:9.) The doctrine
of Christ does indeed minister milk to babes as well as strong meat to adults;
but as the babe is nourished by the milk of its nurse, not that it may ever
depend on the breast, but that it may by degrees grow and take stronger food; so
also at first we must suck milk from Scripture, so that we may afterwards feed
on its bread. The Apostle yet so distinguishes between milk and strong food,
that he still understands sound doctrine by both, but the ignorant begin with
the one, and they who are well-taught are strengthened by the other.<br></div>
<div><b>13.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For every one who uses milk,</i></font>
or, who partakes of milk, etc. He means those who from tenderness or weakness as
yet refuse solid doctrine; for otherwise he who is grown up is not averse to
milk. But he reproves here an infancy in understanding, such as constrains God
even to prattle with us. He then says, that babes are not fit to receive the
<font color="Maroon"><i>word of righteousness,</i></font> understanding by
righteousness the perfection of which he will presently
speak.<sup><font color="Maroon">F92</font></sup> For the Apostle does not here,
as I think, refer to the question, how we are justified before God, but takes
the word in a simpler sense, as denoting that completeness of knowledge which
leads to perfection, which office Paul ascribes to the Gospel in his epistle to
the Colossians, 1:28; as though he had said, that those who indulge themselves
in their ignorance preclude themselves from a real knowledge of Christ, and that
the doctrine of the Gospel is unfruitful in them, because they never reach the
goal, nor come even near it.<br></div>
<div><b>14.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Of full age,</i></font> or perfect, etc.
He calls those perfect who are adults; he mentions them in opposition to babes,
as it is done in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460206&gt;</font></sup>1
Corinthians 2:6; 14:20;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490413&gt;</font></sup>Ephesians 4:13. For the
middle and manly age is the full age of human life; but he calls those by a
figure men in Christ; who are spiritual. And such he would have all Christians
to be, such as have attained by continual practice a habit to
<font color="Maroon"><i>discern between good and evil.</i></font> For he cannot
have been otherwise taught aright in the truth, except we are fortified by his
protection against all the falsehoods and delusions of Satan; for on this
account it is called the sword of the Spirit. And Paul points out this benefit
conferred by sound doctrine when he says, &#8220;That we may not be carried
about by every wind of doctrine.&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490414&gt;</font></sup>Ephesians 4:14.) And truly
what sort of faith is that which doubts, being suspended between truth and
falsehood? Is it not in danger of coming to nothing every moment?<br></div>
<div>But not satisfied to mention in one word the mind, he mentions all the
<font color="Maroon"><i>senses,</i></font> in order to show that we are ever to
strive until we be in every way furnished by God&#8217;s word, and be so armed
for battle, that Satan may by no means steal upon us with his
fallacies.<sup><font color="Maroon">F93</font></sup><br></div>
<div>It hence appears what sort of Christianity there is under the Papacy, where
not only the grossest ignorance is commended under the name of simplicity, but
where the people are also most rigidly prevented from seeking real knowledge;
nay, it is easy to judge by what spirit they are influenced, who hardly allow
that to be touched which the Apostle commands us to handle continually, who
imagine that a laudable neglect which the Apostle here so severely reproves, who
take away the word of God, the only rule of discerning rightly, which discerning
he declares to be necessary for all Christians! But among those who are freed
from this diabolical prohibition and enjoy the liberty of learning, there is yet
often no less indifference both as to hearing and reading. When thus we exercise
not our powers, we are stupidly ignorant and void of all discernment. <br></div>

they were to proceed forward to the goal. For by <font color="Maroon"><i>the

superstruction, wearies himself with foolish and useless labor. In short, as the
builder must begin with the foundation, so must he go on with his work that the
house may be built. Similar is the case as to Christianity; we have the first
principles as the foundation, but the higher doctrine ought immediately to
follow which is to complete the building. They then act most unreasonably who
remain in the first elements, for they propose to themselves no end, as though a
builder spent all his labor on the foundation, and neglected to build up the
house. So then he would have our faith to be at first so founded as afterwards
to rise upwards, until by daily progress it be at length
completed.<sup><font color="Maroon">F94</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Of repentance from dead works,</i></font> etc. He
here refers to a catechism commonly used. It is hence a probable conjecture that
this Epistle was written, not immediately after the promulgation of the Gospel,
but when they had some kind of polity established in the Churches; such as this,
that the catechumen made a confession of his faith before he was admitted to
baptism. And there were certain primary points on which the pastor questioned
the catechumen, as it appears from the various testimonies of the fathers; there
was an examination had especially on the creed called the Apostles&#8217; Creed.
This was the first entrance, as it were, into the church to those who were
adults and enlisted under Christ, as they were before alienated from faith in
him. This custom the Apostle mentions, because there was a short time fixed for
catechumens, during which they were taught the doctrine of religion, as a master
instructs his children in the alphabet, in order that he may afterwards advance
them to higher things.<br></div>
<div>But let us examine what he says. He mentions
<font color="Maroon"><i>repentance</i></font> and
<font color="Maroon"><i>faith,</i></font> which include the fullness of the
Gospel; for what else does Christ command his Apostles to preach, but repentance
and faith? When, therefore, Paul wished to show that he had faithfully performed
his duty, he alleged his care and assiduity in teaching these two things. It
seems then (as it may be said) unreasonable that the Apostle should bid
repentance and faith to be omitted, when we ought to make progress in both
through the whole course of our life. But when he adds,
<font color="Maroon"><i>from dead works,</i></font> he intimates that he speaks
of first repentance; for though every sin is a dead work, either as it leads to
death, or as it proceeds from the spiritual death of the soul; yet the faithful,
already born again of the Spirit of God, cannot be said properly to repent from
dead works. Regeneration is not indeed made perfect in them; but because of the
seed of new life which is in them, however small it may be, this at least may be
said of them that they cannot be deemed dead before God. The Apostle then does
not include in general the whole of repentance, the practice of which ought to
continue to the end; but he refers only to the beginning of repentance, when
they who were lately and for the first time consecrated to the faith, commenced
a new life. So also the word, <font color="Maroon"><i>faith,</i></font> means
that brief summary of godly doctrine, commonly called the Articles of
Faith.<br></div>
<div>To these are added, <font color="Maroon"><i>the resurrection of the dead
and eternal judgment.</i></font> These are some of the highest mysteries of
celestial wisdom; nay, the very end of all religion, which we ought to bear in
mind through the whole course of our life. But as the very same truth is taught
in one way to the ignorant, and in another way to those who have made some
proficiency, the Apostle seems here to refer to the common mode of questioning,
&#8220;Dost thou believe the resurrection of the dead? Dost thou believe eternal
life?&#8221; These things were suitable to children, and that only once;
therefore to turn back to them again was nothing else but to
retrograde.<br></div>
<div><b>2.</b><font color="Maroon"><i> Of the doctrine of baptisms,</i></font>
etc. Some read them separately, &#8220;of baptisms and of doctrine;&#8221; but I
prefer to connect them, though I explain them differently from others; for I
regard the words as being in apposition, as grammarians say, according to this
form, &#8220;Not laying again the foundation of repentance, of faith in God, of
the resurrection of the dead, which is the doctrine of baptisms and of the
laying on of hands.&#8221; If therefore these two clauses, the doctrine of
baptisms and of the laying on of hands, be included in a parenthesis, the
passage would run better; for except you read them as in apposition, there would
be the absurdity of a repetition. For what is the doctrine of baptism but what
he mentions here, faith in God, repentance, judgment, and the like?<br></div>
<div>Chrysostom thinks that he uses &#8220;baptisms&#8221; in the plural number,
because they who returned to first principles, in a measure abrogated their
first baptism: but I cannot agree with him, for the doctrine had no reference to
many baptisms, but by baptisms are meant the solemn rites, or the stated days of
baptizing.<br></div>
<div>With baptism he connects the <font color="Maroon"><i>laying on of
hands;</i></font> for as there were two sorts of catechumens, so there were two
rites. There were heathens who came not to baptism until they made a profession
of their faith. Then as to these, these, the catechizing was wont to precede
baptism.<sup><font color="Maroon">F95</font></sup> But the children of the
faithful, as they were adopted from the womb, and belonged to the body of the
Church by right of the promise, were baptized in infancy; but after the time of
infancy, they having been instructed in the faith, presented themselves as
catechumens, which as to them took place after baptism; but another symbol was
then added, the laying on of hands.<br></div>
<div>This one passage abundantly testifies that this rite had its beginning from
the Apostles, which afterwards, however, was turned into superstition, as the
world almost always degenerates into corruptions, even with regard to the best
institutions. They have indeed contrived the fiction, that it is a sacrament by
which the spirit of regeneration is conferred, a dogma by which they have
mutilated baptism for what was peculiar to it, they transferred to the
imposition of hands. Let us then know, that it was instituted by its first
founders that it might be an appointed rite for prayer, as Augustine calls it.
The profession of faith which youth made, after having passed the time of
childhood, they indeed intended to confirm by this symbol, but they thought of
nothing less than to destroy the efficacy of baptism. Wherefore the pure
institution at this day ought to be retained, but the superstition ought to be
removed. And this passage tends to confirm pedobaptism; for why should the same
doctrine be called as to some baptism, but as to others the imposition of hands,
except that the latter after having received baptism were taught in the faith,
so that nothing remained for them but the laying on of hands? <br></div>

<div><b>3.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>This will we do,</i></font> etc. A
dreadful denunciation follows; but the Apostle thus fulminated, lest the Jews
should indulge their own supineness, and trifle with the favor of God; as though
he had said, &#8220;There ought not in this case it to be any delay; for there
will not always be the opportunity for making progress; it is not in man&#8217;s
power to bound at once, whenever he pleases, from the starting point to the
goal; but progress in our course is the special gift of God.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><b>4.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For it is impossible,</i></font> etc.
This passage has given occasion to many to repudiate this Epistle, especially as
the Novatians armed themselves with it to deny pardon to the fallen. Hence those
of the Western Church, in particular, refused the authority of this Epistle,
because the sect of Novatus annoyed them; and they were not sufficiently
conversant in the truth so as to be equal to refute it by argument. But when the
design of the Apostle is understood, it then appears evident that there is
nothing here which countenances so delirious an error. Some who hold sacred the
authority of the Epistle, while they attempt to dissipate this absurdity, yet do
nothing but evade it. For some take &#8220;impossible&#8221; in the sense of
rare or difficult, which is wholly different from its meaning. Many confine it
to that repentance by which the catechumens in the ancient Church were wont to
be prepared for baptism, as though indeed the Apostles prescribed fasting, or
such things to the baptized. And then what great thing would the Apostle have
said, by denying that repentance, the appendage of baptism, could be repeated?
He threatens with the severest vengeance of God all those who would cast away
the grace which had been once received; what weight would the sentence have had
to shake the secure and the wavering with terror, if he only reminded them that
there was no longer room for their first repentance? For this would extend to
every kind of offense. What then is to be said? Since the Lord gives the hope of
mercy to all without exception, it is wholly unreasonable that any one for any
cause whatever should be precluded.<br></div>
<div>The knot of the question is in the word, <font color="Maroon"><i>fall
away.</i></font> Whosoever then understands its meaning, can easily extricate
himself from every difficulty. But it must be noticed, that there is a twofold
falling away, one particular, and the other general. He who has in anything, or
in any ways offended, has fallen away from his state as a Christian; therefore
all sins are so many fallings. But the Apostle speaks not here of theft, or
perjury, or murder, or drunkenness, or adultery; but he refers to a total
defection or falling away from the Gospel, when a sinner offends not God in some
one thing, but entirely renounces his grace.<br></div>
<div>And that this may be better understood, let us suppose a contrast between
the gifts of God, which he has mentioned, and this falling away. For he falls
away who forsakes the word of God, who extinguishes its light, who deprives
himself of the taste of the heavens or gift, who relinquishes the participation
of the Spirit. Now this is wholly to renounce God. We now see whom he excluded
from the hope of pardon, even the apostates who alienated themselves from the
Gospel of Christ, which they had previously embraced, and from the grace of God;
and this happens to no one but to him who sins against the Holy Spirit. For he
who violates the second table of the Law, or transgresses the first through
ignorance, is not guilty of this defection; nor does God surely deprive any of
his grace in such a way as to leave them none remaining except the
reprobate.<br></div>
<div>If any one asks why the Apostle makes mention here of such apostasy while
he is addressing believers, who were far off from a perfidy so heinous; to this
I answer, that the danger was pointed out by him in time, that they might be on
their guard. And this ought to be observed; for when we turn aside from the
right way, we not only excuse to others our vices, but we also impose on
ourselves. Satan stealthily creeps on us, and by degrees allures us by
clandestine arts, so that when we go astray we know not that we are going
astray. Thus gradually we slide, until at length we rush headlong into ruin. We
may observe this daily in many. Therefore the Apostle does not without reason
forewarn all the disciples of Christ to beware in time; for a continued torpor
commonly ends in lethargy, which is followed by alienation of mind.<br></div>
<div>But we must notice in passing the names by which he signalizes the
knowledge of the Gospel. He calls it
<font color="Maroon"><i>illumination;</i></font> it hence follows that men are
blind, until Christ, the light of the world, enlightens them. He calls it
<font color="Maroon"><i>a tasting of the heavenly gift;</i></font> intimating
that the things which Christ confers on us are above nature and the world, and
that they are yet tasted by faith. He calls it the
<font color="Maroon"><i>participation</i></font> of the Spirit; for he it is who
distributes to every one, as he wills, all the light and knowledge which he can
have; for without him no one can say that Jesus is the Lord,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461203&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 12:3;) he
opens for us the eyes of our minds, and reveals to us the secret things of God.
He calls it a <font color="Maroon"><i>tasting of the good word of
God;</i></font> by which he means, that the will of God is therein revealed, not
in any sort of way, but in such a way as sweetly to delight us; in short, by
this title is pointed out the difference between the Law and the Gospel; for
that has nothing but severity and condemnation, but this is a sweet testimony of
God&#8217;s love and fatherly kindness towards us. And lastly, he calls it a
<font color="Maroon"><i>tasting of the powers of the world to come;</i></font>
by which he intimates, that we are admitted by faith as it were into the kingdom
of heaven, so that we see in spirit that blessed immortality which is hid from
our senses.<sup><font color="Maroon">F96</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Let us then know, that the Gospel cannot be otherwise rightly known than by
the illumination of the Spirit, and that being thus drawn away from the world,
we are raised up to heaven, and that knowing the goodness of God we rely on his
word.<br></div>
<div>But here arises a new question, how can it be that he who has once made
such a progress should afterwards fall away? For God, it may be said, calls none
effectually but the elect, and Paul testifies that they are really his sons who
are led by his Spirit,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450814&gt;</font></sup>Romans 8:14;) and he
teaches us, that it is a sure pledge of adoption when Christ makes us partakers
of his Spirit. The elect are also beyond the danger of finally falling away; for
the Father who gave them to be preserved by Christ his Son is greater than all,
and Christ promises to watch over them all so that none may perish. To all this
I answer, That God indeed favors none but the elect alone with the Spirit of
regeneration, and that by this they are distinguished from the reprobate; for
they are renewed after his image and receive the earnest of the Spirit in hope
of the future inheritance, and by the same Spirit the Gospel is sealed in their
hearts. But I cannot admit that all this is any reason why he should not grant
the reprobate also some taste of his grace, why he should not irradiate their
minds with some sparks of his light, why he should not give them some perception
of his goodness, and in some sort engrave his word on their hearts. Otherwise,
where would be the temporal faith mentioned by
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;410417&gt;</font></sup>Mark 4:17? There is
therefore some knowledge even in the reprobate, which afterwards vanishes away,
either because it did not strike roots sufficiently deep, or because it withers,
being choked up.<sup><font color="Maroon">F97</font></sup><br></div>
<div>And by this bridle the Lord keeps us in fear and humility; and we certainly
see how prone human nature is otherwise to security and foolish confidence. At
the same time our solicitude ought to be such as not to disturb the peace of
conscience. For the Lord strengthens faith in us, while he subdues our flesh:
and hence he would have faith to remain and rest tranquilly as in a safe haven;
but he exercises the flesh with various conflicts, that it may not grow wanton
through idleness.<br></div>
<div><b>6.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>To renew them again into
repentance,</i></font> etc. Though this seems hard, yet there is no reason to
charge God with cruelty when any one suffers only the punishment of his own
defection; nor is this inconsistent with other parts of Scripture, where
God&#8217;s mercy is offered to sinners as soon as they sigh for it,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;261827&gt;</font></sup>Ezekiel 18:27;) for
repentance is required, which he never truly feels who has once wholly fallen
away from the Gospel; for such are deprived, as they deserve, of God&#8217;s
Spirit and given up to a reprobate mind, so that being the slaves of the devil
they rush headlong into destruction. Thus it happens that they cease not to add
sin to sin, until being wholly hardened they despise God, or like men in
despair, express madly their hatred to him. The end of all apostates is, that
they are either smitten with stupor, and fear nothing, or curse God their judge,
because they cannot escape from
him.<sup><font color="Maroon">F98</font></sup><br></div>
<div>In short, the Apostle warns us, that repentance is not at the will of man,
but that it is given by God to those only who have not wholly fallen away from
the faith. It is a warning very necessary to us, lest by often delaying until
tomorrow, we should alienate ourselves more and more from God. The ungodly
indeed deceive themselves by such sayings as this, &#8212; that it will be
sufficient for them to repent of their wicked life at their last breath. But
when they come to die, the dire torments of conscience which they suffer, prove
to them that the conversion of man is not an ordinary work. As then the Lord
promises pardon to none but to those who repent of their iniquity, it is no
wonder that they perish who either through despair or contempt, rush on in their
obstinacy into destruction. But when any one rises up again after falling, we
may hence conclude that he had not been guilty of defection, however grievously
he may have sinned.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Crucifying again,</i></font> etc. He also adds this
to defend God&#8217;s severity against the calumnies of men; for it would be
wholly unbecoming, that God by pardoning apostates should expose his own Son to
contempt. They are then wholly unworthy to obtain mercy. But the reason why he
says, that Christ would thus be crucified again, is, because we die with him for
the very purpose of living afterwards a new life; when therefore any return as
it were unto death, they have need of another sacrifice, as we shall find in the
tenth chapter. Crucifying <font color="Maroon"><i>for themselves</i></font>
means as far as in them lies. For this would be the case, and Christ would be
slandered as it were triumphantly, were it allowed men to return to him after
having fallen away and forsaken him. <br></div>

<div><b>7.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For the earth,</i></font> etc. This is a
similitude most appropriate to excite a desire to make progress in due time, for
as the earth cannot bring forth a good crop in harvest except it causes the seed
as soon as it is sown to germinate, so if we desire to bring forth good fruit,
as soon as the Lord sows his word, it ought to strike roots in us without delay;
for it cannot be expected to fructify, if it be either choked or perish. But as
the similitude is very suitable, so it must be wisely applied to the design of
the Apostle.<br></div>
<div>The earth, he says, which by sucking in the rain immediately produces a
blade suitable to the seed sown, at length by God&#8217;s blessing produces a
ripe crop; so they who receive the seed of the Gospel into their hearts and
bring forth genuine shoots, will always make progress until they produce ripe
fruit. On the contrary, the earth, which after culture and irrigation brings,
forth nothing but thorns, affords no hope of a harvest; nay, the more that grows
which is its natural produce, the more hopeless is the case. Hence the only
remedy the husbandman has is to burn up the noxious and useless weeds. So they
who destroy the seed of the Gospel either by their indifference or by corrupt
affections, so as to manifest no sign of good progress in their life, clearly
show themselves to be reprobates, from whom no harvest can be
expected.<br></div>
<div>The Apostle then not only speaks here of the fruit of the Gospel, but also
exhorts us promptly and gladly to embrace it, and he further tells us, that the
blade appears presently after the seed is sown, and that growing follows the
daily irrigations. Some render
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">qota&gt;nhn eu]qeto&lt;n</font> &#8220;a
seasonable shoot,&#8221; others, &#8220;a shoot meet;&#8221; either meaning
suits the place; the first refers to time, the second to
quality.<sup><font color="Maroon">F99</font></sup> The allegorical meanings with
which interpreters have here amused themselves, I pass by, as they are quite
foreign to the object of the writer.<br></div>
<div><b>9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But we are persuaded,</i></font> etc. As
the preceding sentences were like thunderbolts, by which readers might have been
struck dead, it was needful to mitigate this severity. He therefore says now,
that he did not speak in this strain, as though he entertained such an opinion
of them. And doubtless whosoever wishes to do good by teaching, ought so to
treat his disciples as ever to add encouragement to them rather than to diminish
it, for there is nothing that can alienate us more from attending to the truth
than to see that we are deemed to be past hope. The Apostle then testifies that
he thus warned the Jews, because he had a good hope of them, and was anxious to
lead them to salvation. We hence conclude, that not only the reprobate ought to
be reproved severely and with sharp earnestness, but also the elect themselves,
even those whom we deem to be the children of God.<br></div>
<div><b>10.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For God is not unrighteous,</i></font>
etc. These words signify as much as though he had said, that from good
beginnings he hoped for a good end.<br></div>
<div>But here a difficulty arises, because he seems to say that God is bound by
the services of men: &#8220;I am persuaded,&#8221; he says, &#8220;as to your
salvation, because God cannot forget your works.&#8221; He seems thus to build
salvation on works, and to make God a debtor to them. And the sophists, who
oppose the merits of works to the grace of God, make much of this sentence,
&#8220;God is not unrighteous.&#8221; For they hence conclude that it would be
unjust for him not to render for works the reward of eternal salvation. To this
I briefly reply that the Apostle does not here speak avowedly of the cause of
our salvation, and that therefore no opinion can be formed from this passage as
to the merits of works, nor can it be hence determined what is due to works. The
Scripture shows everywhere that there is no other fountain of salvation but the
gratuitous mercy of God: and that God everywhere promises reward to works, this
depends on that gratuitous promise, by which he adopts us as his children, and
reconciles us to himself by not imputing our sins. Reward then is reserved for
works, not through merit, but the free bounty of God alone; and yet even this
free reward of works does not take place, except we be first received into favor
through the kind mediation of Christ.<br></div>
<div>We hence conclude, that God does not pay us a debt, but performs what he
has of himself freely promised, and thus performs it, inasmuch as he pardons us
and our works; nay, he looks not so much on our works as on his own grace in our
works. It is on this account that he forgets not our works, because he
recognizes himself and the work of his Spirit in them. And this is to be
<font color="Maroon"><i>righteous,</i></font> as the Apostle says, for he cannot
deny himself. This passage, then, corresponds with that saying of Paul,
&#8220;He who has begun in you a good work will perfect it.&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500106&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 1:6.) For what
can God find in us to induce him to love us, except what he has first conferred
on us? In short, the sophists are mistaken in imagining a mutual relation
between God&#8217;s righteousness and the merits of our works, since God on the
contrary so regards himself and his own gifts, that he carries on to the end
what of his own goodwill he has begun in us, without any inducement from
anything we do; nay, God is righteous in recompensing works, because he is true
and faithful: and he has made himself a debtor to us, not by receiving anything
from us; but as Augustine says, by freely promising all
things.<sup><font color="Maroon">F100</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>And labor of love,</i></font> etc. By this he
intimates that we are not to spare labor, if we desire to perform duty towards
our neighbors; for they are not only to be helped by money, but also by counsel,
by labor, and in various other ways. Great sedulity, then, must be exercised,
many troubles must be undergone, and sometimes many dangers must be encountered.
Thus let him who would engage in the duties of love, prepare himself for a life
of labor.<sup><font color="Maroon">F101</font></sup><br></div>
<div>He mentions in proof of their love, that they had
<font color="Maroon"><i>ministered</i></font> and were still
<font color="Maroon"><i>ministering</i></font> to the
<font color="Maroon"><i>saints.</i></font> We are hence reminded, that we are
not to neglect to serve our brethren. By mentioning the
<font color="Maroon"><i>saints</i></font>, he means not that we are debtors to
them alone; for our love ought to expand and be manifested towards all mankind;
but as the household of faith are especially recommended to us, peculiar
attention is to be paid to them; for as love, when moved to do good, has partly
a regard to God, and partly to our common nature, the nearer any one is to God,
the more worthy he is of being assisted by us. In short, when we acknowledge any
one as a child of God, we ought to embrace him with brotherly love.<br></div>
<div>By saying that they <font color="Maroon"><i>had ministered</i></font> and
were <font color="Maroon"><i>still ministering,</i></font> he commended their
perseverance; which in this particular was very necessary; for there is nothing
to which we are more prone than to weariness in well-doing. Hence it is, that
though many are found ready enough to help their brethren, yet the virtue of
constancy is so rare, that a large portion soon relax as though their warmth had
cooled. But what ought constantly to stimulate us is even this one expression
used by the apostle, that the love shown to the saints is shown
<font color="Maroon"><i>towards the name</i></font> of the Lord; for he
intimates that God holds himself indebted to us for whatever good we do to our
neighbors, according to that saying,<br></div>

<div><b>11.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And we desire,</i></font> etc. As he
blended with exhortation, lest he should altogether grieve their minds; so he
now freely reminds them of what was still wanting in them, lest his courtesy
should appear to have in it any flattery. &#8220;You have made,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;your love evident by many acts of kindness; it remains, however, that
your faith should correspond with it; you have sedulously labored not to be
wanting in your duties to men; but with no less earnestness it behooves you to
make progress in faith, so as to manifest before God its unwavering and full
certainty.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>Now, by these words the Apostle shows that there are two parts in
Christianity which correspond with the two tables of the Law. Therefore, he who
separates the one from the other, has nothing but what is mutilated and mangled.
And hence it appears what sort of teachers they are who make no mention of
faith, and enjoin only the duty of honesty and uprightness towards men; nay, it
is a profane philosophy, that dwells only on the outward mask of righteousness,
if indeed it deserves to be called philosophy; for it so unreasonably performs
its own duties, that it robs God, to whom the preeminence belongs, of his own
rights. Let us then remember, that the life of a Christian is not complete in
all its parts, unless we attend to faith as well as to love.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>To the full assurance of hope,</i></font> or, to
the certainty of hope, etc. As they who professed the Christian faith were
distracted by various opinions, or were as yet entangled in many superstitions,
he bids them to be so fixed in firm faith, as no longer to vacillate nor be
driven here and there, suspended between alternate winds of doubts. This
injunction is, however, applicable to all; for, as the truth of God is
unchangeably fixed, so faith, which relies on him, when it is true, ought to be
certain, surmounting every doubt. It is a full assurance,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">plhrofori&gt;a,</font><sup><font color="Maroon">F102</font></sup><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">
</font>an undoubting persuasion, when the godly mind settles it with itself,
that it is not right to call in question what God, who cannot deceive or lie,
has spoken.<br></div>
<div>The word hope, is here to be taken for faith, because of its affinity to
it. The Apostle, however, seems to have designedly used it, because he was
speaking of perseverance. And we may hence conclude how far short of faith is
that general knowledge which the ungodly and the devils have in common; for they
also believe that God is just and true, yet they derive hence no good hope, for
they do not lay hold on his paternal favor in Christ. Let us then know that true
faith is ever connected with hope.<br></div>
<div>He said <font color="Maroon"><i>to the end,</i></font> or perfection; and
he said this, that they might know that they had not yet reached the goal, and
were therefore to think of further progress. He mentioned diligence, that they
might know that they were not to sit down idly, but to strive in earnest. For it
is not a small thing to ascend above the heavens, especially for these who
hardly creep on the ground, and when innumerable obstacles are in the way. There
is indeed, nothing more difficult than to keep our thoughts fixed on things in
heaven, when the whole power of our nature inclines downwards, and when Satan or
numberless devices draw us back to the earth. hence it is, that he bids us to
beware of sloth or effeminacy.<br></div>
<div><b>12.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But followers,</i></font> or imitators,
etc. To sloth he opposes imitation; it is then the same thing as though he said,
that there was need of constant alacrity of mind; but it had far more weight,
when he reminded them, that the fathers were not made partakers of the promises
except through the unconquerable firmness of faith; for examples convey to us a
more impressive idea of things. When a naked truth is set before us, it does not
so much affect us, as when we see what is required of us fulfilled in the person
of Abraham. But Abraham&#8217;s example is referred to, not because it is the
only one, but because it is more illustrious than that of any other. For though
Abraham had this faith in common with all the godly; yet it is not without
reason that he is called the father of the faithful. It is, then, no wonder that
the Apostle selected him from all the rest, and turned towards him the eyes of
his readers as to the clearest mirror of faith.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Faith and patience,</i></font> etc. What is meant
is, a firm faith, which has patience as its companion. For faith is what is,
chiefly required; but as many who make at first a marvelous display of faith,
soon fail, he shows, that the true evidence of that faith which is not fleeting
and evanescent, is endurance. By saying that the
<font color="Maroon"><i>promises</i></font> were obtained by
<font color="Maroon"><i>faith,</i></font> he takes away the notion of merits;
and still more clearly by saying, that they came by &#8220;inheritance&#8221;;
for we are in no other way made heirs but by the right of
adoption.<sup><font color="Maroon">F103</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>13.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For when God made a promise to
Abraham,</i></font> etc. His object was to prove, that the grace of God is
offered to us in vain, except we receive the promise by faith, and constantly
cherish it in the bosom of our heart. And he proves it by this argument, that
when God promised a countless offspring to Abraham, it seemed a thing
incredible; Sarah had been through life barren; both had reached a sterile old
age, when they were nearer the grave than to a conjugal bed; there was no vigor
to beget children, when Sarah&#8217;s womb, which had been barren through the
prime of life, was now become dead. Who could believe that a nation would
proceed from them, equaling the stars in number, and like the sand of the sea?
It was, indeed, contrary to all reason. Yet Abraham looked for this and feared
no disappointment, because he relied on the Word of
God.<sup><font color="Maroon">F104</font></sup> We must, then, notice the
circumstance as to time, that the Apostle&#8217;s reasoning may appear evident;
and what he subjoins refers to this &#8212; that he was made partaker of this
blessing, but that it was after he had waited for what no one could have thought
would ever come to pass. In this way ought glory to be given to God; we must
quietly hope for what he does not as yet show to our senses, but hides from us
and for a long time defers, in order that our patience may be
exercised.<br></div>
<div>Why God did <font color="Maroon"><i>swear by himself</i></font> we shall
presently see. The manner of swearing, <font color="Maroon"><i>Except blessing I
will bless thee,</i></font> we have explained what it means in the third
chapter: God&#8217;s name is not here expressed, but must be understood, for
except he performs what he promises, he testifies that he is not to he counted
true and faithful. <br></div>

<div><b>16.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For men,</i></font> etc. It is an
argument from the less to the greater; if credit is given to man, who is by
nature false, when he swears, and for this reason, because he confirms what he
says by God&#8217;s name, how much more credit is due to God, who is eternal
truth, when he swears by himself?<br></div>
<div>Now he mentions several things to commend this declaration; and first he
says that men <font color="Maroon"><i>swear by the greater;</i></font> by which
he means that they who are wanting in due authority borrow it from another. He
adds that there is so much reverence in an oath that it suffices for
confirmation, and puts an end to all disputes where the testimonies of men and
other proofs are wanting. Then is not he a sufficient witness for himself whom
all appeal to as a witness? Is he not to obtain credit for what he says, who, by
his authority, removes all doubts among others? If God&#8217;s name, pronounced
by man&#8217;s tongue, possesses so much superiority, how much more weight ought
it to have, when God himself swears by his own name? Thus much as to the main
point.<br></div>
<div>But here in passing, two things are to be noticed, &#8212; that we are to
swear by God&#8217;s name when necessity requires, and that Christians are
allowed to make an oath, because it is a lawful remedy for removing contentions.
God in express words bids us to swear by his name; if other names are blended
with it, the oath is profaned. For this there are especially three reasons: when
there is no way of bringing the truth to light, it is not right, for the sake of
verifying it, to have recourse to any but to God, who is himself eternal truth;
and then, since he alone knows the heart, his own office is taken from him, when
in things hidden, of which men can form no opinion, we appeal to any other
judge; and thirdly, because in swearing we not only appeal to him as a witness,
but also call upon him as an avenger of perjury in case we speak falsely. It is
no wonder, then, that he is so greatly displeased with those who swear by
another name, for his own honor is thus disparaged. And that there are different
forms often used in Scripture, makes nothing against this truth; for they did
not swear by heaven or earth, as though they ascribed any divine power to them,
or attributed to them the least portion of divinity, but by this indirect
protestation, so to speak, they had a regard to the one true God. There are
indeed various kinds of protestations; but the chief one is, when we refer to
God as a judge and directly appeal to his judgment-seat; another is, when we
name things especially dear to us as our life, or our head, or anything of this
kind; and the third is, when we call creatures as witnesses before God. But in
all these ways we swear properly by no other than by God. hence they betray
their impiety no less than their ignorance, who contend that it is lawful to
connect dead saints with God so as to attribute to them the right of
punishing.<br></div>
<div>Further, this passage teaches us, as it has been said, that an oath may be
lawfully used by Christians; and this ought to be particularly observed, on
account of fanatical men who are disposed to abrogate the practice of solemn
swearing which God has prescribed in his Law. For certainly the Apostle speaks
here of the custom of swearing as of a holy practice, and approved by God.
Moreover, he does not say of it as having been formerly in use, but as of a
thing still practiced. Let it then be employed as a help to find out the truth
when other proofs are wanting.<br></div>
<div><b>17.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>God, willing,</i></font> etc. See how
kindly God as a gracious Father accommodates himself to our slowness to believe;
as he sees that we rest not on his simple word, that he might more fully impress
it on our hearts he adds an oath. Hence also it appears how much it concerns us
to know that there is such a certainty respecting his goodwill towards us, that
there is no longer any occasion for wavering or for trembling. For when God
forbids his name to be taken in vain or on a slight occasion, and denounces the
severest vengeance on all who rashly abuse it, when he commands reverence to be
rendered to his majesty, he thus teaches us that he holds his name in the
highest esteem and honor. The certainty of salvation is then a necessary thing;
for he who forbids to swear without reason has been pleased to swear for the
sake of rendering it certain. And we may hence also conclude what great account
he makes of our salvation; for in order to secure it, he not only pardons our
unbelief, but giving up as it were his own right, and yielding to us far more
than what we could claim, he kindly provides a remedy for it.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Unto the heirs of promise,</i></font> etc. He seems
especially to point out the Jews; for though the heirship came at length to the
Gentiles, yet the former were the first lawful heirs, and the latter, being
aliens, were made the second heirs, and that beyond the right of nature. So
Peter, addressing the Jews in his first sermon, says,<br></div>
<div align="center"><font color="Navy">&#8220;To you and to your children is the
promise made, and to those who are afar of, whom the Lord shall call.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440239&gt;</font></sup><font color="Navy">Acts
2:39.) </font><br></div>
<div>He left indeed a place for adventitious heirs, but he sets the Jews in the
first rank, according to what he also says in the third chapter, &#8220;Ye are
the children of the fathers and of the covenant,&#8221; etc.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440325&gt;</font></sup>Acts 3:25.) So also in
this place the Apostle, in order to make the Jews more ready to receive the
covenant, shows that it was for their sakes chiefly it was confirmed by an oath.
At the same time this declaration belongs at this day to us also, for we have
entered into the place quitted by them through unbelief<br></div>
<div>Observe that what is testified to us in the Gospel is called the
<font color="Maroon"><i>counsel</i></font> of God, that no one may doubt but
that this truth proceeds from the very inmost thoughts of God. Believers ought
therefore to be fully persuaded that whenever they hear the voice of the Gospel,
the secret counsel of God, which lay hid in him, is proclaimed to them, and that
hence is made known to them what he has decreed respecting our salvation before
the creation of the world.<br></div>
<div><b>18.</b><font color="Maroon"><i> That by two immutable things,</i></font>
etc. What God says as well as what he swears is immutable.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191206&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 12:6; Numb. 23:19.)
It may be with men far otherwise; for their vanity is such that there cannot be
much firmness in their word. But the word of God is in various ways extolled; it
is pure and without any dross, like gold seven times purified. Even Balaam,
though an enemy, was yet constrained to bring this testimony,<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy">&#8220;God is not like the sons of men that he should
lie, neither like men that he should repent: has he then said, and shall he not
do it? Has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440325&gt;</font></sup><font color="Navy">Numbers
23:19.)</font><br></div>
<div>The word of God, then, is a sure truth, and in itself authoritative,
(<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aujto&gt;pistov </font>self-worthy of
trust.) But when an oath is added it is an overplus added to a full measure. We
have, then, this strong consolation, that God, who cannot deceive when he
speaks, being not content with making a promise, has confirmed it by an
oath.<sup><font color="Maroon">F105</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Who have fled for refuge,</i></font> etc. By these
words he intimates that we do not truly trust in God except when we forsake
every other protection and flee for refuge to his sure promise, and feel assured
that it is our only safe asylum. Hence by the word flee is set forth our poverty
and our need; for we flee not to God except when constrained. But when he adds
<font color="Maroon"><i>the hope set before us,</i></font> he intimates that we
have not far to go to seek the aid we want, for God himself of his own free will
meets us and puts as it were in our hand what we are to hope for; it is
<font color="Maroon"><i>set before us.</i></font> But as by this truth he
designed to encourage the Jews to embrace the Gospel in which salvation was
offered to them; so also he thus deprived the unbelieving, who rejected the
favor presented to them, of every excuse. And doubtless this might have been
more truly said after the promulgation of the Gospel than under the Law:
&#8220;There is now no reason for you to say, &#8216;Who shall ascent into
heaven? Or, Who shall descend into the deep? Or, Who shall pass over the sea?
For nigh is the word, it is in thy mouth and in thy
heart.&#8217;&#8221;<sup><font color="Maroon"> F106</font></sup>
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053012&gt;</font></sup>Deuteronomy 30:12;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451006&gt;</font></sup>Romans 10:6.)<br></div>
<div>But there is a metonymy in the word
<font color="Maroon"><i>hope,</i></font> for the effect is put for the cause;
and I understand by it the promise on which our hope leans or relies, for I
cannot agree with those who take <font color="Maroon"><i>hope</i></font> here
for the thing hoped for &#8212; by no means: and this also must be added, that
the Apostle speaks not of a naked promise, suspended as it were in the air, but
of that which is received by faith; or, if you prefer a short expression, the
hope here means the promise apprehended by faith. By the word
<font color="Maroon"><i>laying hold,</i></font> as well as by
<font color="Maroon"><i>hope,</i></font> he denotes firmness.<br></div>
<div><b>19.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>As an anchor,</i></font> etc. It is a
striking likeness when he compares faith leaning on God&#8217;s word to an
anchor; for doubtless, as long as we sojourn in this world, we stand not on firm
ground, but are tossed here and there as it were in the midst of the sea, and
that indeed very turbulent; for Satan is incessantly stirring up innumerable
storms, which would immediately upset and sink our vessel, were we not to cast
our anchor fast in the deep. For nowhere a haven appears to our eyes, but
wherever we look water alone is in view; yea, waves also arise and threaten us;
but as the anchor is cast through the waters into a dark and unseen place, and
while it lies hid there, keeps the vessel beaten by the waves from being
overwhelmed; so must our hope be fixed on the invisible God. There is this
difference, &#8212; the anchor is cast downwards into the sea, for it has the
earth as its bottom; but our hope rises upwards and soars aloft, for in the
world it finds nothing on which it can stand, nor ought it to cleave to created
things, but to rest on God alone. As the cable also by which the anchor is
suspended joins the vessel with the earth through a long and dark intermediate
space, so the truth of God is a bond to connect us with himself, so that no
distance of place and no darkness can prevent us from cleaving to him. Thus when
united to God, though we must struggle with continual storms, we are yet beyond
the peril of shipwreck. Hence he says, that this anchor is
<font color="Maroon"><i>sure</i></font> and
<font color="Maroon"><i>steadfast,</i></font> or safe and
firm.<sup><font color="Maroon"> F107</font></sup> It may indeed be that by the
violence of the waves the anchor may be plucked off, or the cable be broken, or
the beaten ship be torn to pieces. This happens on the sea; but the power of God
to sustain us is wholly different, and so also is the strength of hope and the
firmness of his word.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Which entereth into that,</i></font> or those
things, etc. As we have said, until faith reaches to God, it finds nothing but
what is unstable and evanescent; it is hence necessary for it to penetrate even
into heaven. But as the Apostle is speaking to the Jews, he alludes to the
ancient Tabernacle, and says, that they ought not to abide in those things which
are seen, but to penetrate into the inmost recesses, which lie hid within the
veil, as though he had said, that all the external and ancient figures and
shadows were to be passed over, in order that faith might be fixed on Christ
alone.<br></div>
<div>And carefully ought this reasoning to be observed, &#8212; that as Christ
has entered into heaven, so faith ought to be directed there also: for we are
hence taught that faith should look nowhere else. And doubtless it is in vain
for man to seek God in his own majesty, for it is too far removed from them; but
Christ stretches forth his hand to us, that he may lead us to heaven. And this
was shadowed forth formerly under the Law; for the high priest entered the holy
of holies, not in his own name only, but also in that of the people, inasmuch as
he bare in a manner the twelve tribes on his breast and on his shoulders; for as
a memorial for them twelve stones were wrought on the breastplate, and on the
two onyx stones on his shoulders were engraved their names, so that in the
person of one man all entered into the sanctuary together. Rightly then does the
Apostle speak, when he reminds them that our high priest has entered into
heaven; for he has not entered only for himself, but also for us. There is
therefore no reason to fear that access to heaven will be closed up against our
faith, as it is never disjoined from Christ. And as it becomes us to follow
Christ who is gone before, he is therefore called our
<font color="Maroon"><i>Forerunner,</i></font> or
precursor.<sup><font color="Maroon">F108</font></sup><br></div>

<div><b>1.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For this Melchisedec,</i></font> etc. He
has hitherto been stimulating the Jews by exhortations, that they might
attentively consider the comparison between Christ and Melchisedec. At the end
of the last chapter, that he might return from his digression to his subject, he
quoted again the passage from the Psalms; and now he enters fully into what he
had before slightly referred to; for he enumerates particularly the things
connected with Melchisedec, in which he resembled Christ. It is indeed no wonder
that he dwells so minutely on this subject. It was doubtless no common thing
that in a country abounding in the corruptions of so many superstitions, a man
was found who preserved the pure worship of God; for on one side he was nigh to
Sodom and Gomorrah, and on the other to the Canaanites, so that he was on every
side encompassed by ungodly men. Besides, the whole world was so fallen into
impiety, that it is very probable that God was nowhere faithfully worshipped
except in the family of Abraham; for his father and his grandfather, who ought
to have retained true religion, had long before degenerated into idolatry. It
was therefore a memorable fact, that there was still a king who not only
retained true religion, but also performed himself the office of a priest. And
it was doubtless necessary that in him who was to be a type of the Son of God
all things excellent should be found: and that Christ was shadowed forth by this
type is evident from the Psalm referred to; for David did not say without
reason, &#8220;Thou art a priest forever after the order Melchisedec;&#8221; no,
but on the contrary, by these words a sublime mystery was recommended to the
Church.<br></div>
<div>Let us now consider each of those particulars in which the Apostle makes
Christ like Melchisedec.<sup><font color="Maroon">F109</font></sup><br></div>
<div>The first likeness is in the name; for it was not without a mystery that he
was called <font color="Maroon"><i>the King of righteousness</i></font>. For
though this honor is ascribed to kings who rule with moderation and in equity,
yet this belongs really to Christ alone, who not only exercises authority justly
as others do, but also communicates to us the righteous of God, partly when he
makes us to be counted righteous by a gratuitous reconciliation, and partly when
he renews us by his Spirit, that we may lead a godly and holy life. He is then
called the King of righteousness, because of what he effects in diffusing
righteousness on all his people.<sup><font color="Maroon">F110</font></sup> It
hence follows, that out of his kingdom nothing but sin reigns among men. And
therefore Zechariah, when he introduces him, as by the solemn decree of God,
into the possession of his kingdom, thus extols him, &#8212;<br></div>
<div align="center"><font color="Navy">&#8220;Rejoice, O daughter of Sion,
Behold thy righteous King</font><br><font color="Navy">cometh to thee,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;380210&gt;</font></sup><font color="Navy">Zechariah
2:10;)</font><br></div>
<div>intimating that the righteousness, which is otherwise wanting to us, is
brought to us by the coming of Christ.<br></div>
<div>The second likeness which the Apostle states is as to the kingdom of
<font color="Maroon"><i>peace.</i></font> This peace indeed is the fruit of that
righteousness which he has mentioned. It hence follows that wherever
Christ&#8217;s kingdom extends, there peace ought to be, as we find in Isaiah 2
and 9, and in other places. But as peace among the Hebrews means also a
prosperous and happy state, it may be so taken here: yet I prefer to understand
it here of that inward peace which tranquilizes the conscience and renders it
confident before God. And the excellency of this blessing cannot be sufficiently
estimated, unless you consider on the other hand, how miserable a thing it is to
be tormented by constant inquietude; which must necessarily be the case until we
have our consciences pacified by being reconciled to God through
Christ.<br></div>
<div><b>3.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Without father,</i></font> etc. I prefer
this rendering to that of &#8220;unknown father;&#8221; for the Apostle meant to
express something more emphatic than that the family of Melchisedec was obscure
or unknown. Nor does this objection disturb me, that the reality does not
correspond with the figure or type, because Christ has a Father in heaven, and
had a mother on earth; for the Apostle immediately explains his meaning by
adding <font color="Maroon"><i>without descent,</i></font> or kindred. He then
exempts Melchisedec from what is common to others, a descent by birth; by which
he means that he is eternal, so that his beginning from men was not to be sought
after. It is indeed certain that he descended from parents; but the Apostle does
not speak of him here in his private capacity; on the contrary, he sets him
forth as a type of Christ. He therefore allows himself to see nothing in him but
what Scripture contains. For in treating of things respecting Christ, such
reverence ought to be observed as not to know anything but what is written in
the Word of the Lord. Now, as the Holy Spirit in mentioning this king, the most
illustrious of his age, is wholly silent as to his birth, and makes afterwards
no record of his death, is not this the same thing as though eternity was to be
ascribed to him? And what was shadowed forth in Melchisedec is really exhibited
in Christ. It behooves us then to be satisfied with this moderate view, that
while Scripture sets forth to us Melchisedec as one who had never been born and
never died, it shows to us as in a mirror, that Christ has neither a beginning
nor an end.<sup><font color="Maroon">F111</font></sup><br></div>
<div>But we hence also learn how much reverence and sobriety is required as to
the spiritual mysteries of God: for what is not found read in Scripture the
Apostle is not only willing to be ignorant of, but also would have us to seek to
know. And surely it is not lawful for us to allege anything of Christ from our
own thoughts. And Melchisedec is not to be considered here, as they say, in his
private capacity, but as a sacred type of Christ; nor ought we to think that it
was accidentally or inadvertently omitted that no kindred is ascribed to him,
and that nothing is said of his death; but on the contrary, that this was done
designedly by the Spirit, in order to give us an idea of one above the common
order of men. There seems therefore to be no probability in the conjecture of
those who say that Melchisedec was Shem the son of Noah; for if we make him to
be some known individual, we destroy this third likeness between Melchisedec and
Christ.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Made like,</i></font> or assimilated, etc. Not as
far as what was typified required; for we must always bear in mind that there is
but an analogy between the thing signified and the sign; for they make
themselves ridiculous who imagine that he came down from heaven, in order that
there might be a perfect similarity. It is enough that we see in him the
lineaments of Christ, as the form of the living man may be seen in his picture,
while yet the man himself is very different from what represents
him.<sup><font color="Maroon">F112</font></sup> It seems not to be worth
one&#8217;s while to refute the delirious notions of those who dream that Christ
himself, or the holy Spirit, or an angel, appeared at that time; unless indeed
one thought it to be the duty of a right-minded man to dispute with Postillus
and such fanatics; for that impostor asserts that he is Melchisedec with no less
supercilious folly than those mad spirits of old, mentioned by Jerome, who
pretended that they were Christ. <br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><b>4.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Now consider</i></font>, etc. This is the
fourth comparison between Christ and Melchisedec, that Abraham presented tithes
to him. But though tithes were instituted for several reasons, yet the Apostle
here refers only to what serves his present purpose. One reason why tithes were
paid to the Levites was, because they were the children of Abraham, to whose
seed the land was promised. It was, then, by a hereditary right that a portion
of the land was allotted to them; for as they were not allowed to possess land,
a compensation was made to them in tithes. There was also another reason,
&#8212; that as they were occupied in the service of God and the public ministry
of the Church, it was right that they should be supported at the public cost of
the people. Then the rest of the Israelites owed them tithes as a remuneration
for their work. But these reasons bear not at all on the present subject;
therefore, the Apostle passes them by. The only reason now alleged is, that as
the people offered the tithes as a sacred tribute to God, the Levites only
received them. It hence appears that it was no small honor that God in a manner
substituted them for himself. Then Abraham, being one of the chief sergeants of
God and a prophet, having offered tithes to Melchisedec the priest, thereby
confessed that Melchisedec excelled him in dignity. If, then, the
<font color="Maroon"><i>patriarch</i></font> Abraham owned him more honourable
than himself, his dignity must have been singular and extraordinary. The word
<font color="Maroon"><i>patriarch</i></font> is mentioned for the sake of
setting forth his dignity; for it was in the highest degree honourable to him to
have been called a father in the Church of God.<br></div>
<div>Then the argument is this, &#8212; Abraham, who excelled all others, was
yet inferior to Melchisedec; then Melchisedec had the highest place of honor,
and is to be regarded as superior to all the sons of Levi. The first part is
proved, for what Abraham owed to God he gave to Melchisedec: then by paying him
the tenth he confessed himself to be inferior.<br></div>
<div><b>5.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And verily they,</i></font> etc. It would
be more suitable to render the words thus, &#8220;because they are the sons of
Levi.&#8221; The Apostle indeed does not assign it as a reason that they
received tithes because they were the sons of Levi; but he is comparing the
whole tribe with Melchisedec in this way. Though God granted to the Levites the
right of requiring tithes from the people, and thus set them above all the
Israelites, yet they have all descended from the same parent; and Abraham, the
father of them all, paid tithes to a priest of another race: then all the
descendants of Abraham are inferior to this priest. Thus the right conferred on
the Levites was particular as to the rest of their brethren; yet Melchisedec,
without exception, occupies the highest place, so that all are inferior to him.
Some think that the tenths of tenths are intended, which the Levites paid to the
higher priests; but there is no reason thus to confine the general declaration.
The view, then, I have given is the most probable.<br></div>
<div><b>6.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Blessed him,</i></font> etc. This is the
fifth comparison between Christ and Melchisedec. The Apostle assumes it as an
admitted principle that the less is blessed by the greater; and then he adds
that Melchisedec blessed Abraham: hence the conclusion is that the less was
Abraham. But for the sake of strengthening his argument he again raises the
dignity of Abraham; for the more glorious Abraham is made, the higher the
dignity of Melchisedec appears. For this purpose he says that Abraham had the
<font color="Maroon"><i>promises;</i></font> by which he means that he was the
first of the holy race with whom God made the covenant of eternal life. It was
not indeed a common honor that God chose him from all the rest that he might
deposit with him the privilege of adoption and the testimony of his love. But
all this was no hindrance that he should not submit himself in all his
preeminence to the priesthood of Melchisedec. We hence see how great he was to
whom Abraham gave place in these two things, &#8212; that he suffered himself to
be blessed by him, and that he offered him tithes as to God&#8217;s
vicegerent.<br></div>
<div><b>7.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>The less is,</i><sup>F113</sup></font>
etc. Let us first know what the word <font color="Maroon"><i>blessed</i></font>
means here. It means indeed a solemn praying by which he who is invested with
some high and public honor, recommends to God men in private stations and under
his ministry. Another way of blessing is when we pray for one another; which is
commonly done by all the godly. But this blessing mentioned by the Apostle was a
symbol of greater authority. Thus Isaac blessed his son Jacob, and Jacob himself
blessed his grandsons, Ephraim and Manasseh.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012727&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 27:27; 48:15.)
This was not done mutually, for the son could not do the like to the father; but
a higher authority was required for such a blessing as this. And this appears
more evident still from
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;040623&gt;</font></sup>Numbers 6:23, where a
command is given to the priest to bless the people, and then a promise is
immediately added, that they would be blessed whom they blessed. It hence
appears that the blessing of the priest depended on this, &#8212; that it was
not so much man&#8217;s blessing as that of God. For as the priest in offering
sacrifices represented Christ, so in blessing the people he was nothing more
than a minister and legate of the supreme God. In the same sense ought to be
understood what Luke records when he says, that Christ lifted up his hands and
blessed the Apostles. (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422450&gt;</font></sup>Luke
24:50.) The practice of lifting up the hands he no doubt borrowed from the
priests, in order to show that he was the person by whom God the Father blesses
us. Of this blessing mention is also made in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B617&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 116:17;
118:1.<br></div>
<div>Let us now apply this idea to what the apostle treats of: The blessing of
the priest, while it is a divine work is also an evidence of a higher honor;
then Melchisedec, in blessing Abraham, assumed to himself a higher dignity. This
he did, not presumptuously, but according to his right as a priest: then he was
more eminent than Abraham. Yet Abraham was he with whom God was pleased to make
the covenant of salvation; though, then, he was superior to all others, yet he
was surpassed by
Melchisedec.<sup><font color="Maroon">F114</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>8.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Of whom it is witnessed that he
liveth.</i></font> He takes the silence respecting his death, as I have said, as
an evidence of his life. This would not indeed hold as to others, but as to
Melchisedec it ought rightly to be so regarded, inasmuch as he was a type of
Christ. For as the spiritual kingdom and priesthood of Christ are spoken of
here, there is no place left for human conjectures; nor is it lawful for us to
seek to know anything farther than what we read in Scripture. But we are not
hence to conclude that the man who met Abraham is yet alive, as some have
childishly thought, for this is to be applied to the other person whom he
represented, even the Son of God. And by these words the Apostle intended to
show, that the dignity of Melchisedec&#8217;s priesthood was to be perpetual,
while that of the Levites was
temporary.<sup><font color="Maroon">F115</font></sup><br></div>
<div>For he thus reasons, &#8212; those to whom the Law assigns tithes are dying
men; by which it was indicated that the priesthood would some time be abrogated,
as their life came to an end: but the Scripture makes no mention of the death of
Melchisedec, when it relates that tithes were paid to him; so the authority of
his priesthood is limited by no time, but on the contrary there is given an
indication of perpetuity. And this is added for this purpose, lest a posterior
law, as it is usual, should seem to take away from the authority of a former
law. For it might have been otherwise objected and said, that the right which
Melchisedec formerly possessed is now void and null, because God had introduced
another law by Moses, by which he transferred the right to the Levites. But the
Apostle anticipates this objection by saying, that tithes were paid to the
Levites only for a time, because they did not live; but that Melchisedec,
because he is immortal, retains even to the end what was once given to him by
God.<br></div>
<div><b>9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Levi also,</i></font> etc. He advances
farther, and says, that even Levi himself, who was then
<font color="Maroon"><i>in the loins of Abraham</i></font>, was not exempt from
the same subordination; for Abraham, by paying tithes, made himself and his
posterity inferior to the priesthood of
Melchisedec.<sup><font color="Maroon">F116</font></sup> But here one, on the
other hand, may say, that in the same way Judas also of whose seed Christ was
born, paid tithes. But this knot can be easily untied, when one considers two
things which are settled beyond all dispute among Christians: first, Christ is
not to be counted simply as one of the sons of Abraham, but is to be exempted by
a peculiar privilege from the common order of men; and this is what he himself
said, &#8220;If he is the son of David, then does David call him his
Lord?&#8221; (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402245&gt;</font></sup>Matthew
22:45;) secondly, since Melchisedec is a type of Christ, it is by no means
reasonable that the one should be set in opposition to the other; for we must
remember that common saying, that what is subordinate is not in opposition:
hence the type, which comes short of the reality, ought by no means to be
opposed to it, nor can it be, for such is the conflict of equals.<br></div>
<div>These five particulars, mentioned by the Apostle, complete the comparison
between Christ and Melchisedec, and thus is dissipated the gloss of those who
seek to show that the chief likeness between them is in offering of bread and
wine. We see that the Apostle carefully, and even scrupulously, examines here
each of these points; he mentions the name of the man, the seat of his kingdom,
the perpetuity of his life, his right to tithes, and his benediction.<br></div>
<div>There is, forsooth! in these things, less importance than in the oblation!
Shall we say that the Spirit of God, through forgetfulness, omitted this, so
that he dwelt on minor things, and left unnoticed the chief thing, and what was
most necessary for his purpose? I marvel the more that so many of the ancient
doctors of the Church were so led away by this notion, that they dwelt only on
the offering of bread and wine. And thus they spoke, &#8220;Christ is a priest
according to the order of Melchisedec; and Melchisedec offered bread and wine;
then the sacrifice of bread and wine is suitable to the priesthood of
Christ.&#8221; The Apostle will hereafter speak largely of the ancient
sacrifices; but of this new sacrifice of bread and wine he says not a word.
Whence then did ecclesiastical writers derive this notion? Doubtless, as one
error usually leads to another, having of themselves imagined a sacrifice in
Christ&#8217;s Supper without any command from him, and thus adulterated the
Supper by adding a sacrifice, they afterwards endeavored to find out plausible
arguments here and there in order to disguise and cover their error. This
offering of bread and wine pleased them, and was instantly laid hold on without
any discretion. For who can concede that these men were more intelligent than
the Spirit of God? Yet if we receive what they teach, we must condemn
God&#8217;s Spirit for inadvertence in having omitted a matter so important,
especially as the question is avowedly handled!<br></div>
<div>I hence conclude, that the ancients invented a sacrifice, of which Moses
had never thought; for Melchisedec offered bread and wine, not to God, but on
the contrary to Abraham and his companions. These are the words,
&#8220;Melchisedec, king of Salem, went out to meet him, and brought forth bread
and wine; and the same was priest to the most high God, and blessed him.&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011418&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 14:18.) The first
thing mentioned was a royal act; he refreshed those wearied after the battle and
their journey with sustenance; the blessing was the act of a priest. If then his
offering had anything mystical in it, the completion of it is to be found in
Christ, when he fed the hungry and those wearied with fatigue. But the Papists
are extremely ridiculous, who though they deny that there is bread and wine in
the Mass, yet prattle about the sacrifice of bread and wine. <br></div>

<div><b>11.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>If therefore perfection,</i></font> or,
moreover if perfection,<sup><font color="Maroon">F117</font></sup> etc. From the
same testimony the Apostle concludes, that the old covenant was abrogated by the
coming of Christ. He has hitherto spoken of the office and person of the priest;
but as God had instituted a priesthood for the purpose of ratifying the Law, the
former being abolished, the latter necessarily ceases. That this may be better
understood, we must bear in mind the general truth, &#8212; That no covenant
between God and man is in force and ratified, except it rests on a priesthood.
Hence the Apostle says, that the Law was introduced among the ancient people
under the Levitical priesthood; by which he intimates, that it not only
prevailed during the time of the Law, but that it was instituted, as we have
said for the sake of confirming the Law.<br></div>
<div>He now reasons thus, If the ministry of the Church was perfect under the
order of Aaron, why was it necessary to return to another order? For in
perfection nothing can be changed. It then follows, that the ministry of the Law
was not perfect, for that new order was to be introduced of which David
speaks.<sup><font color="Maroon">F118</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>For under it the people received the
Law,</i></font> etc. This parenthesis is inserted in order that we may know that
the Law was annexed to the priesthood. The Apostle had in view to prove that in
the Law of Moses there was no ultimate end at which we ought to stop. This he
proves by the abrogation of the priesthoods and in this way: Had the authority
of the ancient priesthood been such as to be sufficient fully to establish the
Law, God would have never introduced in its place another and a different
priesthood. Now, as some might doubt whether the abolition of the Law followed
the abolition of the priesthood, he says that the Law was not only brought in
under it, but that it was also by it
established.<sup><font color="Maroon">F119</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>12.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For the priesthood being
changed,</i></font> or, transferred, etc. As the authority of the Law and the
priesthood is the same, Christ became not only a priest, but also a Lawgiver; so
that the right of Aaron, as well as of Moses, was transferred to him. The sum of
the whole is, that the ministry of Moses was no less temporary than that of
Aaron; and hence both were annulled by the coming of Christ, for the one could
not stand without the other. By the word <font color="Maroon"><i>Law</i></font>,
we understand what peculiarly belonged to Moses; for the Law contains the rule
of life, and the gratuitous covenant of life; and in it we find everywhere many
remarkable sentences by which we are instructed as to faith, and as to the fear
of God. None of these were abolished by Christ, but only that part which
regarded the ancient priesthood.<br></div>
<div>For Christ is here compared with Moses; whatever then they had in common,
is not to be taken to the account, but only the things in which they differ.
They in common offer God&#8217;s mercy to us, prescribe the rule of a holy and
godly life, teach us the true worship of God, and exhort us to exercise faith
and patience, and all the duties of godliness. But Moses was different from
Christ in this respect, that while the love of the Gospel was not as yet made
known, he kept the people under veils, set forth the knowledge of Christ by
types and shadows, and, in short, accommodated himself to the capacity of
ignorant people, and did not rise higher than to puerile elements. We must then
remember, that the Law is that part of the ministration which Moses had as
peculiarly his own, and different from that of Christ. That law, as it was
subordinate to the ancient priesthood, was abolished when the priesthood was
abolished. And Christ, being made a priest, was invested also with the authority
of a legislator, that he might be the teacher and interpreter of the new
covenant. At the same time, the word Law is applied, though not in its strict
sense, to the Gospel; but this impropriety of language is so far from having
anything harsh in it, that on account of the contrast it adds beauty to the
sentence, as we find in the seventh chapter of the Epistle to the
Romans<br></div>
<div>Moreover, the impiety of the Pope is extremely arrogant, who has inserted
this article in his decretals, that he himself is now invested with the same
authority as Aaron formerly had, because the Law and also the priesthood have
been transferred to him. We see what the Apostle says; he maintains that
ceremonies have ceased since the time when Christ came forth with command to
proclaim the new covenant. It is then absurd hence to conclude, that anything
has been transferred to the ministers of Christ; for Christ himself is alone
contrasted here with Moses and Aaron. Under what pretext then can Antichrist
arrogate to himself any such authority? I do not indeed speak now for the sake
of disproving so gross an arrogance; but it is worth while to remind readers of
this sacrilegious audacity, that they may know that this notorious servant of
the servants of Christ wholly disregards the honor of his Master, and boldly
mangles the Scriptures, that he may have some cloak for his own
tyranny.<br></div>
<div><b>13.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For he of whom these things are
spoken,</i></font> or, said,<sup><font color="Maroon">F120</font></sup> etc. As
the Apostle was speaking to them who confessed Jesus the Son of Mary to be the
Christ, he proves that an end was put to the ancient priesthood, because the new
Priest, who had been set in the place of the old, was of another tribe, and not
of Levi; for according to the Law the honor of the priesthood was to continue,
by a special privilege, in that tribe. But he says that it was
<font color="Maroon"><i>evident</i></font> that Christ was born of the tribe of
Judah, for it was then a fact commonly known. As then they acknowledged that he
was the Christ, it was also necessary that they should be persuaded that he was
the son of David; for he who had been promised could derive his origin from no
other. <br></div>

<div><b>15.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And it is yet far more
evident,</i></font> etc. He proves by another argument, that the Law is
abolished. He reasoned before as to the person of the priest, but now as to the
nature of the priesthood, and the reason for which it was appointed. The ancient
priesthood, he says, had to do with external rites; but in Christ&#8217;s
priesthood there is nothing but what is spiritual. It hence appears, that the
former was evanescent and temporary; but that the latter was to be
perpetual.<br></div>
<div><b>16.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Carnal commandment,</i></font> etc. It
was called <font color="Maroon"><i>carnal</i></font>, because it refers to
things corporal, that is, to external rites. We know how Aaron and his sons were
initiated into their office. What was fulfilled in Christ by the hidden and
celestial power of the Spirit, was shadowed forth under the Law by ointment,
various vestments, the sprinkling of blood, and other earthly ceremonies. Now
this kind of institution was suitable to the nature of the priesthood; it hence
follows, that the priesthood itself was liable to change. At the same time, as
we shall hereafter see, the priesthood was not so carnal, but that it was still
spiritual; but the Apostle here refers only to the difference between Christ and
Aaron. However spiritual then might have been the meaning of these shadows, they
were yet but shadows in themselves; and as they were made up of the elements of
this world, they may justly be called earthly.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>After the power of an endless life,</i></font> or,
of an indissoluble life. As Christ is a perpetual priest, it was necessary, that
he should be different from Aaron as to the manner of his appointment; and so it
was, for it was not Moses, a mortal man, who consecrated him, but the Holy
Spirit, and that not with oil, nor with the blood of goats, nor with the outward
pomp of vestments, but with celestial power, which the Apostle here sets in
opposition to weak elements. We hence see how the eternity of his priesthood was
exhibited in Christ.<br></div>
<div><b>17.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Thou art a priest forever,</i></font>
etc. It is on the single word <font color="Maroon"><i>forever,</i></font> that
the Apostle lays stress in this passage; for he confirms what he said of an
<font color="Maroon"><i>indissoluble life</i></font>. He then shows that Christ
differs from the whole race of Levi, because he is made a priest for
ever.<sup><font color="Maroon">F121</font></sup><br></div>
<div>But here it may be objected, as the Jews also do, that the
word,<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal"> &#181;lw[l</font>
<font color="Maroon"><i>laoulam,</i></font> does not always mean eternity, but
the extent of one age, or, at farthest, a long time; and it is added, that when
Moses speaks of the ancient sacrifices, he often uses this expression,
&#8220;This ordinance shall be forever.&#8221; (Exodus 12:17, and 19:9.) To this
I answer that whenever the sacrifices of the Law are mentioned,
&#8220;forever&#8221; is to be confined to the time of the Law; nor ought this
to be deemed strange; for by the coming of Christ a certain renovation of the
world was effected. Whenever, then, Moses speaks of his own ministration, he
extends the longest time no farther than to Christ. It must yet be also
observed, that &#8220;forever&#8221; is applied to the ancient sacrifices, not
with regard to the external ceremony, but on account of their mystical
signification. On the present occasion, however, this reason ought to be
sufficient, that Moses and his ministrations were for ever; that is, until the
coming of the kingdom of Christ, under whom the world was renovated. Now when
Christ is come, and a perpetual priesthood is given to him, we can find no end
to his age, so that it cannot terminate after a certain period of time. So when
applied to him, the word ought to be understood in the sense of eternity; for by
the context we are always to judge of the meaning of the word,
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;lw[l
</font><font color="Maroon"><i>laoulam</i></font>.<br></div>
<div><b>18.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For there is verily a
disannulling,</i></font> or abrogation, etc. As the Apostle&#8217;s discourse
depends on this hinge, that the Law together with the priesthood had come to an
end, he explains the reason why it ought to have been abolished, even because it
was weak and unprofitable. And he speaks thus in reference to the ceremonies,
which had nothing substantial in them, nor in themselves anything available to
salvation; for the promise of favor annexed to them, and what Moses everywhere
testifies that God would be pacified by sacrifices and that sins would be
expiated, did not properly belong to sacrifices, but were only adventitious to
them. For as all types had a reference to Christ, so from him they derived all
their virtue and effect; nay, of themselves they availed nothing or effected
nothing; but their whole efficacy depended on Christ alone<br></div>
<div>But as the Jews foolishly set up these in opposition to Christ, the
Apostle, referring to this notion, shows the difference between these things and
Christ. For as soon as they are separated from Christ, there is nothing left in
them, but the weakness of which he speaks; in a word, there is no benefit to be
found in the ancient ceremonies, except as they refer to Christ; for in this way
they so made the Jews acquainted with God&#8217;s grace, that they in a manner
kept them in expectation of it. Let us then remember that the Law is useless,
when separated from Christ. And he also confirms the same truth by calling it
the <font color="Maroon"><i>commandment going before;</i></font> for it is a
well-known and common saying, that former laws are abrogated by the latter. The
Law had been promulgated long before David; but he was in possession of his
kingdom when he proclaimed this prophecy respecting the appointment of a new
priest; this new Law then annulled the former.<br></div>
<div><b>19.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For the Law made nothing
perfect,</i></font> etc. As he had spoken rather harshly of the Law, he now
mitigates or, as it were, corrects that asperity; for he concedes to it some
utility, as it had pointed out the way which leads at length to salvation. It
was, however, of such a kind as to be far short of perfection. The Apostle then
reasons thus: The Law was only a beginning; then something more perfect was
necessarily, to follow; for it is not fit that God&#8217;s children should
always continue in childish elements. By the word
<font color="Maroon"><i>bringing in,</i></font> or introduction, he means a
certain preparation made by the Law, as children are taught in those elements
which smooth the way to what is higher. But as the preposition
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpi&lt;</font> denotes a consequence,
when one thing follows another; it ought, as I think, to be thus rendered,
&#8220;but added was an introduction into a better hope.&#8221; For he mentions
two introductions, according to my view; the first by Melchisedec as a type; and
the second by the Law, which was in time later. Moreover, by
<font color="Maroon"><i>Law</i></font> he designates the Levitical priesthood,
which was superadded to the priesthood of Melchisedec.<br></div>
<div>By a <font color="Maroon"><i>better hope</i></font> is to be understood the
condition of the faithful under the reign of Christ; but he had in view the
fathers, who could not be satisfied with the state in which they were then, but
aspired to higher things. Hence that saying, &#8220;Many kings and prophets
desired to see the things which ye see.&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421024&gt;</font></sup>Luke 10:24.) They were
therefore led by the hand of the Law as a schoolmaster, that they might advance
farther.<sup><font color="Maroon">F122</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>By the which we draw nigh,</i></font> etc. There is
to be understood here an implied contrast between us and the fathers; for in
honor and privilege we excel them, as God has communicated to us a full
knowledge of himself, but he appeared to them as it were afar off and obscurely.
And there is an allusion here made to the tabernacle or the temple; for the
people stood afar off in the court, nor was there a nearer access to the
sanctuary opened to any one except to the priests; and into the interior
sanctuary the highest priest only entered; but now, the tabernacle being
removed, God admits us into a familiar approach to himself, which the fathers
were not permitted to have. Then he who still holds to the shadows of the Law,
or seeks to restore them, not only obscures the glory of Christ, but also
deprives us of an immense benefit; for he puts God at a great distance from us,
to approach whom there is a liberty granted to us by the Gospel. And whosoever
continues in the Law, knowingly and willingly deprives himself of the privilege
of approaching nigh to God.<br></div>
<div><b>20.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And inasmuch as not without an
oath,</i></font> etc. Here is another argument, why the Law ought to give place
to the Gospel; for God has set Christ&#8217;s priesthood above that of Aaron,
since in honor to the former he was pleased to make an oath. For when he
appointed the ancient priests, he introduced no oath; but it is said of Christ,
the Lord swore; which was doubtless done for the sake of honoring him. We see
the end for which he again quotes the Psalmist, even that we may know, that more
honor through God&#8217;s oath was given to Christ than to any others. But we
must bear in mind this truth, that a priest is made that he may be the surety of
a covenant. The Apostle hence concludes, that the covenant which God has made by
Christ with us, is far more excellent than the old covenant of which Moses was
the interpreter. <br></div>

<div><b>23.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And they truly,</i></font> etc. He had
already touched on this comparison; but as the subject deserved more attention,
he unfolds it more fully, though the point discussed is different from what it
was before; for then he concluded that the ancient priesthood was to come to an
end because they who exercised it were mortal; but now he simply shows that
Christ remains perpetually a priest. This he does by an argument taken from
things unequal; the ancient priests were many, for death put an end to their
priesthood; but there is no death to prevent Christ from discharging his office.
Then he alone is a perpetual priest. Thus a different cause produces different
effects.<br></div>
<div><b>25.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore he is able to save,</i></font>
etc. This is the fruit of an eternal priesthood, even our salvation, if indeed
we gather this fruit by faith as we ought to do. For where death is or a change,
you will there seek salvation in vain; hence they who cleave to the ancient
priesthood, can never attain salvation. When he says,
<font color="Maroon"><i>them that come unto God,</i></font> or who approach God,
by this phrase he points out the faithful who alone enjoy the salvation procured
by Christ; but he yet at the same time indicates what faith ought to regard in a
mediator. The chief good of man is to be united to his God, with whom is the
fountain of life and of all blessings; but their own unworthiness drives all
away from any access to him. Then the peculiar office of a mediator is to bring
us help in this respect, and to stretch out his hand to us that he may lead us
to heaven. And he ever alludes to the ancient shadows of the Law; for though the
high priest carried the names of the twelve tribes on his shoulders and symbols
on his breast, yet he alone entered the sanctuary, while the people stood in the
court. But now by relying on Christ the Mediator we enter by faith into heaven,
for there is no longer any veil intervening, but God appears to us openly, and
lovingly invites us to a familiar
access.<sup><font color="Maroon">F123</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Seeing he ever liveth,</i></font> etc. What sort of
pledge and how great is this of love towards us! Christ liveth for us, not for
himself! That he was received into a blessed immortality to reign in heaven,
this has taken place, as the Apostle declares, for our sake. Then the life, and
the kingdom, and the glory of Christ are all destined for our salvation as to
their object; nor has Christ any thing, which may not be applied to our benefit;
for he has been given to us by the Father once for all on this condition, that
all his should be ours. He at the same time teaches us by what Christ is doing,
that he is performing his office as a priest; for it belongs to a priest to
<font color="Maroon"><i>intercede</i></font> for the people, that they may
obtain favor with God. This is what Christ is ever doing, for it was for this
purpose that he rose again from the dead. Then of right, for his continual
intercession, he claims for himself the office of the priesthood.<br></div>
<div><b>26.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For such an high priest,</i></font> etc.
He reasons from what is necessarily connected with the subject. These
conditions, or qualifications, as they commonly say, are of necessity required
in a priest &#8212; that he should be just, harmless, and pure from every spot.
This honor belongs to Christ alone. Then what was required for the real
discharge of the office was wanting in the priests of the law. It hence follows,
that there was no perfection in the Levitical priesthood; nor was it indeed in
itself legitimate, unless it was subservient to that of Christ; and, doubtless,
the external ornaments of the high priest indicated this defect; for why were
those costly and splendid vestments used with which God commanded Aaron to be
adorned while performing holy rites, except that they were symbols of a holiness
and excellency far exceeding all human virtues? Now, these types were
introduced, because the reality did not exist. It then appears that Christ alone
is the fully qualified priest.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Separate from sinners,</i></font> etc. This clause
includes all the rest. For there was some holiness, and harmlessness, and purity
in Aaron, but only a small measure; for he and his sons were defiled with many
spots; but Christ, exempt from the common lot of men, is alone free from every
sin; hence in him alone is found real holiness and innocency. For he is not said
to be separate from us, because he repels us from his society, but because he
has this excellency above us all, that he is free from every
uncleanness.<sup><font color="Maroon">F124</font></sup><br></div>
<div>And we hence conclude, that all prayers, which are not supported by
Christ&#8217;s intercession, are rejected.<br></div>
<div>It may, however, be asked as to angels, whether they are separate from
sinners? And if so, what prevents them from discharging the offices of the
priesthood, and from being our mediators with God? To this there is an easy
reply: &#8212; No one is a lawful priest, except he is appointed by God&#8217;s
command; and God has nowhere conferred this honor on angels. It would then be a
sacrilegious usurpation, were they, without being called, to intrude into the
office; besides, it is necessary, as we shall presently see at the beginning of
the next chapter, that the Mediator between God and men should himself be a man.
At the same time the last thing mentioned here by the Apostle is abundantly
sufficient as an answer to the question; for no one can unite us to God but he
who reaches to God; and this is not the privilege of angels, for they are not
said to have been <font color="Maroon"><i>made higher than the
heavens.</i></font> It then belongs to Christ alone to conciliate God to us, as
he has ascended above all the heavens. Now, these words mean the same as though
Christ were said to have been placed above all orders of creatures, so that he
stands eminent above all angels.<br></div>
<div><b>27.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Who needeth not,</i></font> etc. He
pursues the contrast between Christ and the Levitical priests; and he points out
especially two defects, so to speak, in the ancient priesthood, by which it
appears that it was not perfect. And here, indeed, he only touches briefly on
the subject; but he afterwards explains every particular more at large, and
particularly that which refers to the daily sacrifices, as the main question was
respecting these. It is briefly also that I will now touch on the several
points. One of the defects of the ancient priesthood was, that the high priest
offered sacrifices for his own sins; how then could he have pacified God for
others, who had God justly displeased with himself? Then they were by no means
equal to the work of expiating for sins. The other defect was, that they offered
various sacrifices daily; it hence follows, that there was no real expiation;
for sins remain when purgation is repeated. The case with Christ was wholly
different; for he himself needed no sacrifice, as he was sprinkled with no spot
of sin; and such was the sacrifice, that it was alone sufficient to the end of
the world, for he offered
himself.<sup><font color="Maroon">F125</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>28.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For the law,</i></font> etc. From the
defects of men he draws his conclusion as to the weakness of the priesthood, as
though he had said, &#8220;Since the law makes no real priests, the defect must
by some other means be remedied; and it is remedied by the
<font color="Maroon"><i>word of the oath;</i></font> for Christ was made a
priest, being not of the common order of men, but the Son of God, subject to no
defect, but adorned and endowed with the highest perfection.&#8221; He again
reminds us, that the <font color="Maroon"><i>oath</i></font> was posterior to
the law, in order to show that God, being not satisfied with the priesthood of
the law, designed to constitute a better priesthood; for in the institutions of
God what succeeds advances the former to a better state, or it abolishes what
was designed to exist only for a time. <br></div>

<div><b>1.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Now of the things</i></font>, etc. That
readers might know the subject he handles, he reminds them that his object is to
prove that Christ&#8217;s priesthood, by which that of the law had been
abolished, is spiritual. He, indeed, proceeds with the same argument; but as he
contends with various reasonings, he introduced this admonition, that he might
keep his readers attentive to what he had in view.<br></div>
<div>He has already shown that Christ is a high priest; he now contends that his
priesthood is celestial. It hence follows, that by his coming the priesthood
established by Moses under the law was made void, for it was earthly. and as
Christ suffered in the humble condition of his flesh, and having taken the form
of a servant, made himself of no reputation in the world,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 2:7;) the
Apostle reminds us of his ascension, by which was removed not only the reproach
of the cross, but also of that abject and mean condition which he had assumed
together with our flesh; for it is by the power of the Spirit which gloriously
appeared in the resurrection and the ascension of Christ, that the dignity of
his priesthood is to be estimated. He then reasons thus &#8212; &#8220;Since
Christ has ascended to the right hand of God, that he might reign gloriously in
heaven, he is not the minister of the earthly but of the heavenly
sanctuary.<sup><font color="Maroon">F126</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>2.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Of the sanctuary,</i></font> or,
literally, of holy things, etc. The word is to be taken, as being in the neuter
gender; and the Apostle explains himself by saying, <font color="Maroon"><i>of
the true tabernacle.</i><sup>F127</sup></font><br></div>
<div>But it may be asked, whether the tabernacle built by Moses was a false one,
and presumptuously constructed, for there is an implied contrast in the words?
To this I answer, that to us mentioned here is not set in opposition to what is
false, but only to what is typical; as we find in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430117&gt;</font></sup>John 1:17, &#8220;The law
was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.&#8221; Then the
old tabernacle was not the empty inventions of man, but the effigy of the
heavenly tabernacle. As, however, a shadow differs from the substance, and the
sign from the thing signified, the Apostle denies it to have been the true
tabernacle, as though he had said, that it was only a shadow.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Which the Lord pitched,</i></font> or, fixed, etc.
What does the Apostle mean by locating Christ&#8217;s priesthood in heaven? For
doubtless he suffered on earth, and by an earthly blood he atoned for our sins,
for he derived his origin from the seed of Abraham; the sacrifice of his death
was visible; and lastly, that he might offer himself to the Father, it was
necessary for him to descend from heaven to the earth, and as man to become
exposed to the sorrows of this mortal life, and at length to death itself. To
all this I reply, that whatever of an earthly kind appears at first sight to be
in Christ, it is to be viewed spiritually by the eye of faith. Thus his flesh,
which proceeded from the seed of Abraham, since it was the temple of God,
possessed a vivifying power; yea, the death of Christ became the life of the
world, which is certainly above nature. The Apostle therefore does not refer to
what belongs peculiarly to human nature, but to the hidden power of the Spirit;
and hence it is, that the death of Christ has nothing earthly in it. When
therefore we speak of Christ, let us learn to raise up all our thoughts to the
kingdom of God, so that no doubt may remain in us.<br></div>
<div>Nearly to the same purpose is the language of Paul in 2 Corinthians 5:l; he
calls God the builder of this tabernacle, in order to set forth its stability
and perpetuity; for, on the other hand, what is built by men&#8217;s hands, is
unstable, and at last sure to perish. But he says this, because redemption was
truly a divine work, attained by the death of Christ; and in this the power of
Christ manifested itself in a wonderful manner.<br></div>
<div><b>3.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For every high priest,</i></font> etc.
The Apostle intends to show, that Christ&#8217;s priesthood cannot coexist with
the Levitical priesthood. He proves it in this way, &#8212; &#8220;The Law
appointed priests to offer sacrifices to God; it hence appears that the
priesthood is an empty name without a sacrifice. But Christ had no sacrifice,
such as was offered under the Law; it hence follows, that his priesthood is not
earthly or carnal, but one of a more excellent character.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>Let us now examine every clause. The first thing that deserves notice, is
that which he teaches that no priest is appointed except to offer gifts; it is
hence evident, that no favor from God can be obtained for men except through the
interposition of a sacrifice. Hence, that our prayers may be heard, they must be
founded on a sacrifice; their audacity, therefore, is altogether pernicious and
fatal, who pass by Christ and forget his death, and yet rush into the presence
of God. Now, if we wish to pray in a profitable manner, we must learn ever to
set before us the death of Christ, which alone sanctifies our prayers. For God
will never hear us unless he is reconciled; but he must be first pacified, for
our sins cause him to be displeased with us. Sacrifice must necessarily precede,
in order that there may be any benefit from prayer.<br></div>
<div>We may hence further conclude, that no one either among men or angels is
qualified for pacifying God, for all are without any sacrifice of their own
which they can offer to appease God. And hereby is abundantly exposed the
effrontery of the Papists who make Apostles and martyrs to share with Christ as
mediators in the work of intercession; for in vain do they assign them such an
office, except they supply them with
sacrifices.<sup><font color="Maroon">F128</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>4.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For if he were on earth,</i></font> etc.
It is now beyond dispute that Christ is a high priest; but as the office of a
judge does not exist without laws and statutes, so the office of sacrificing
must be connected with Christ as a priest: yet he has no earthly or visible
sacrifice; he cannot then be a priest on earth. We must always hold this truth
that when the Apostle speaks of the death of Christ, he regards not the external
action, but the spiritual benefit. He suffered death as men do, but as a priest
he atoned for the sins of the world in a divine manner; there was an external
shedding of blood, but there was also an internal and spiritual purgation; in a
word, he died on earth, but the virtue and efficacy of his death proceeded from
heaven.<br></div>
<div>What immediately follows some render thus, &#8220;He could not be a priest
of the number of those who offer gifts according to the Law.&#8221; But the
words of the Apostle mean another thing; and therefore I prefer this rendering,
&#8220;He could not be a priest as long as there are priests who,&#8221; etc.
For he intends to show one of these two things, either that Christ is no priest,
while the priesthood of the Law continued, as he had no sacrifice, or that the
sacrifices of the law ceased as soon as Christ appeared. The first of these is
against all reason, for it is an act of impiety to deprive Christ of his
priesthood. It then remains for us to confess, that the Levitical order is now
abolished.<br></div>
<div><b>5.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Who serve unto the example,</i></font>
etc. The verb <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">latreu&gt;ein</font> to
serve, I take here to mean the performing of sacred rites; and so
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn</font> or
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpi&lt;</font> is to be understood. This
is certainly more appropriate than the rendering given by some, &#8220;Who serve
the shadow and example of heavenly things; and the construction in Greek will
admit naturally of the meaning I have proposed. In short, he teaches us that the
true worship of God consists not in the ceremonies of the Law, and that hence
the Levitical priests, while exercising their functions, had nothing but a
shadow and a copy, which is inferior to the prototype, for this is the meaning
of the word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpodei&gt;gma,
</font>exemplar. And he thus anticipates what might have been raised as an
objection; for he shows that the worship of God, according to the ancient
sacrifices, was not superfluous, because it referred to what was higher, even to
heavenly realities.<sup><font color="Maroon">F129</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>As Moses was admonished by God,</i></font> etc.
This passage is found in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022540&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 25:40; and the
apostle adduces it here on purpose, so that he might prove that the whole
service, according to the Law, was nothing more than a picture as it were,
designed to shadow forth what is found spiritually in Christ. God commanded that
all the parts of the tabernacle should correspond with the original pattern,
which had been shown to Moses on the mount. And if the form of the tabernacle
had a reference to something else, then the same must have been the case as to
the rituals and the priesthood; it hence follows that there was nothing real in
them.<br></div>
<div>This is a remarkable passage, for it contains three things entitled to
special notice.<br></div>
<div>First, we hence learn that the ancient rituals were not without reason
appointed, as though God did by them engage the attention of the people as with
the diversions of children; and that the form of the tabernacle was not an empty
thing, intended only to allure and attract the eyes by its external splendor;
for there was a real and spiritual meaning in all these things, since Moses was
commanded to execute every thing according to the original pattern which was
given from heaven. Extremely profane then must the opinion of those be, who hold
that the ceremonies were only enjoined that they might serve as means to
restrain the wantonness of the people, that they might not seek after the
foreign rites of heathens. There is indeed something in this, but it is far from
being all; they omit what is much more important, that they were the means of
retaining the people in their expectation of a Mediator.<br></div>
<div>There is, however, no reason that we should be here overcurious, so as to
seek in every nail and minute things some sublime mystery, as Hesychius did and
many of the ancient writers, who anxiously toiled in this work; for while they
sought refinedly to philosophize on things unknown to them, they childishly
blundered, and by their foolish trifling made themselves ridiculous. We ought
therefore to exercise moderation in this respect, which we shall do if we seek
only to know what has been revealed to us respecting Christ.<br></div>
<div>Secondly, we are here taught that all those modes of worship are false and
spurious, which men allow themselves by their own wit to invent, and beyond
God&#8217;s command; for since God gives this direction, that all things are to
be done according to his own rule, it is not lawful for us to do anything
different from it; for these two forms of expression, &#8220;see that thou do
all things according to the patterns,&#8221; and, &#8220;See that thou do
nothing beyond the pattern,&#8221; amount to the same thing. Then by enforcing
the rule delivered by himself, he prohibits us to depart from it even in the
least thing. For this reason all the modes of worship taught by men fall to the
ground, and also those things called sacraments which have not proceeded from
God.<br></div>
<div>Thirdly, let us hence learn that there are no true symbols of religion but
those which conform to what Christ requires. We must then take heed, lest we,
while seeking to adapt our own inventions to Christ, transfigure him, as the
Papists do, so that he should not be at all like himself; for it does not belong
to us to devise anything as we please, but to God alone it belongs to show us
what to do; it is to be &#8220;according to the pattern&#8221; showed to
us.<br></div>
<div><b>6.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But now has he obtained a more excellent
ministry,</i></font> etc. As he had before inferred the excellency of the
covenant from the dignity of the priesthood, so also now he maintains that
Christ&#8217;s priesthood is more excellent than that of Aaron, because he is
the interpreter and Mediator of a better covenant. Both were necessary, for the
Jews were to be led away from the superstitious observance of rituals, by which
they were prevented from advancing directly forward to the attainment of the
real and pure truth of the Gospel. The Apostle says now that it was but right
that Moses and Aaron should give way to Christ as to one more excellent, because
the gospel is a more excellent covenant than the Law, and also because the death
of Christ was a nobler sacrifice than the victims under the Law.<br></div>
<div>But what he adds is not without some difficulty, &#8212; that the covenant
of the Gospel was proclaimed on better
promises;<sup><font color="Maroon">F130</font></sup> for it is certain that the
fathers who lived under the Law had the same hope of eternal life set before
them as we have, as they had the grace of adoption in common with us, then faith
must have rested on the same promises. But the comparison made by the Apostle
refers to the form rather than to the substance; for though God promised to them
the same salvation which he at this day promises to us, yet neither the manner
nor the character of the revelation is the same or equal to what we enjoy. If
anyone wishes to know more on this subject, let him read the 4th and 5th chapter
of the Epistle to the Galatians and my Institutes. <br></div>

<div><b>7.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For if that first,</i></font> etc. He
confirms what he had said of the excellency of the covenant which God has made
with us through Christ; and he confirms it on this ground, because the covenant
of the Law was neither valid nor permanent; for if nothing was wanting in it,
why was another substituted for it? But another has been substituted; and from
this it is evident that the old covenant was not in every respect perfect. To
prove this he adduces the testimony of Jeremiah, which we shall presently
examine.<br></div>
<div>But it seems hardly consistent to say, that after having said that no place
would have been sought for the second covenant, had the first been faultless, he
should then say that the people were at fault, and that for this cause the new
covenant was introduced as a remedy; and thus it appears unjust, that if the
blame was in the people it should be transferred to God&#8217;s covenant. Then
the argument seems not valid, for though God might have a hundred times blamed
the people, yet the covenant could not on that account be deemed faulty. The
answer to this objection may be easily given. Though the crime of violating the
covenant was justly imputed to the people, who had through their own perfidy
departed from God, yet the weakness of the covenant is also pointed out, because
it was not written in their hearts. Then, to render it perfect and valid, God
declares that it needed an amendment. It was not, therefore, without reason that
the Apostle contended that a place was to be sought for a
second.<sup><font color="Maroon">F131</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>8.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the days come,</i></font> etc.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243131&gt;</font></sup>Jeremiah 31:31-34.) The
Prophet speaks of future time; he arraigns the people of perfidy, because they
continued not faithful after having received the Law. The Law, then, was the
covenant which was broken, as God complains, by the people. To remedy this evil,
he promised a new and a different covenant, the fulfillment of which prophecy
was the abrogation of the old covenant.<br></div>
<div>But it may be said, the Apostle seems unreasonably to turn this prophecy to
suit his own purpose; for here the question is respecting ceremonies, but the
Prophet speaks of the whole Law: what has it to do with ceremonies, when God
inscribes on the heart the rule of a godly and holy life, delivered by the voice
and teaching of men? To this I reply that the argument is applied from the whole
to a part. There is no doubt but that the Prophet includes the whole
dispensation of Moses when he says, &#8220;I have made with you a covenant which
you have not kept.&#8221; Besides, the Law was in a manner clothed with
ceremonies; now when the body is dead, what is the use of garments? It is a
common saying that the accessory is of the same character with his principal. No
wonder, then, that the ceremonies, which are nothing more than appendages to the
old covenant, should come to an end, together with the whole dispensation of
Moses. Nor is it unusual with the Apostles, when they speak of ceremonies, to
discuss the general question respecting the whole Law. Though, then, the prophet
Jeremiah extends wider than to ceremonies, yet as it includes them under the
name of the old covenant, it may be fitly applied to the present
subject.<br></div>
<div>Now, by the <font color="Maroon"><i>days</i></font> which the prophet
mentions, all agree that Christ&#8217;s kingdom is signified; it hence follows,
that the old covenant was changed by the coming of Christ. And he names
<font color="Maroon"><i>the house of Israel and the house of Judah,</i></font>
because the posterity of Abraham had been divided into two kingdoms. So the
promise is to gather again all the elect together into one body, however
separated they may have been formerly.<br></div>
<div><b>9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Not according to the covenant,</i></font>
etc. Here is expressed the difference between the covenant which then existed
and the new one which he caused them to expect. The Prophet might have otherwise
said only: &#8220;I will renew the covenant which through your fault has come to
nothing;&#8221; but he now expressly declares that it would be one unlike the
former. By saying that the covenant was made in the day when he laid holds on
their hand to rescue them from bondage, he enhanced the sin of defection by thus
reminding them of so great a benefit. At the same time he did not accuse one age
only of ingratitude; but as these very men who had been delivered immediately
fell away, and as their posterity after their example continually relapsed,
hence the whole nation had become covenant-breakers.<br></div>
<div>By saying that he <font color="Maroon"><i>disregarded</i></font> them or
cared not for them, he intimates that it would profit them nothing to have been
once adopted as his people, unless he succored them by this new kind of remedy.
At the same time the Prophet expresses in Hebrew something more; but this has
little to do with the present
question.<sup><font color="Maroon">F132</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>10</b><font color="Maroon"><b><i>.</i></b><i> For this is the covenant
that I will make,</i></font> etc. There are two main parts in this covenant; the
first regards the gratuitous remission of sins; and the other, the inward
renovation of the heart; there is a third which depends on the second, and that
is the illumination of the mind as to the knowledge of God. There are here many
things most deserving of notice.<br></div>
<div>The first is, that God calls us to himself without effect as long as he
speaks to us in no other way than by the voice of man. He indeed teaches us and
commands what is right but he speaks to the deaf; for when we seem to hear
anything, our ears are only struck by an empty sound; and the heart, full of
depravity and perverseness, rejects every wholesome doctrine. In short, the word
of God never penetrates into our hearts, for they are iron and stone until they
are softened by him; nay, they have engraven on them a contrary law, for
perverse passions rule within, which lead us to rebellion. In vain then does God
proclaim his Law by the voice of man, unless he writes it by his Spirit on our
hearts, that is, unless he forms and prepares us for obedience. It hence appears
of what avail is freewill and the uprightness of nature before God regenerates
us. We will indeed and choose freely; but our will is carried away by a sort of
insane impulse to resist God. Thus it comes that the Law is ruinous and fatal to
us as long as it remains written only on tables of stone, as Paul also teaches
us. (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470303&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 3:3.) In
short, we then only obediently embrace what God commands, when by his Spirit he
changes and corrects the natural pravity of our hearts; otherwise he finds
nothing in us but corrupt affections and a heart wholly given up to evil. The
declaration indeed is clear, that a new covenant is made according to which God
engraves his laws on our hearts, for otherwise it would be in vain and of no
effect.<sup><font color="Maroon">F133</font></sup><br></div>
<div>The second particular refers to the gratuitous pardon of sins. Though they
have sinned, saith the Lord, yet I will pardon them. This part is also most
necessary; for God never so forms us for obedience to his righteousness, but
that many corrupt affections of the flesh still remain; nay, it is only in part
that the viciousness of our nature is corrected; so that evil lusts break out
now and then. And hence is that contest of which Paul complains, when the godly
do not obey God as they ought, but in various ways offend.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450713&gt;</font></sup>Romans 7:13.) Whatever
desire then there may be in us to live righteously, we are still guilty of
eternal death before God, because our life is ever very far from the perfection
which the Law requires. There would then be no stability in the covenant, except
God gratuitously forgave our sins. But it is the peculiar privilege of the
faithful who have once embraced the covenant offered to them in Christ, that
they feel assured that God is propitious to them; nor is the sin to which they
are liable, a hindrance to them, for they have the promise of pardon.<br></div>
<div>And it must be observed that this pardon is promised to them, not for one
day only, but to the very end of life, so that they have a daily reconciliation
with God. For this favor is extended to the whole of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, as
Paul abundantly proves in the fifth chapter of his second Epistle to the
Corinthians. And doubtless this is the only true asylum of our faith, to which
if we flee not, constant despair must be our lot. For we are all of us guilty;
nor can we be otherwise released then by fleeing to God&#8217;s mercy, which
alone can pardon us.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>And they shall be to me,</i></font> etc. It is the
fruit of the covenant, that God chooses us for his people, and assures us that
he will be the guardian of our salvation. This is indeed the meaning of these
words, <font color="Maroon"><i>And I will be to them a God;</i></font> for he is
not the God of the dead, nor does he take us under his protection, but that he
may make us partakers of righteousness and of life, so that David justly
exclaims, &#8220;Blessed are the people to whom the Lord is God
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19E415&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 144:15.) There is
further no doubt but that this truth belongs also to us; for though the
Israelites had the first place, and are the proper and legitimate heirs of the
covenant, yet their prerogative does not hinder us from having also a title to
it. In short, however far and wide the kingdom of Christ extends, this covenant
of salvation is of the same extent.<br></div>
<div>But it may be asked, whether there was under the Law a sure and certain
promise of salvation, whether the fathers had the gift of the Spirit, whether
they enjoyed God&#8217;s paternal favor through the remission of sins? Yes, it
is evident that they worshipped God with a sincere heart and a pure conscience,
and that they walked in his commandments, and this could not have been the case
except they had been inwardly taught by the Spirit; and it is also evident, that
whenever they thought of their sins, they were raised up by the assurance of a
gratuitous pardon. And yet the Apostle, by referring the prophecy of Jeremiah to
the coming of Christ, seems to rob them of these blessings. To this I reply,
that he does not expressly deny that God formerly wrote his Law on their hearts
and pardoned their sins, but he makes a comparison between the less and the
greater. As then the Father has put forth more fully the power of his Spirit
under the kingdom of Christ, and has poured forth more abundantly his mercy on
mankind, this exuberance renders insignificant the small portion of grace which
he had been pleased to bestow on the fathers. We also see that the promises were
then obscure and intricate, so that they shone only like the moon and stars in
comparison with the clear light of the Gospel which shines brightly on
us.<br></div>
<div>If it be objected and said, that the faith and obedience of Abraham so
excelled, that hardly any such an example can at this day be found in the whole
world; my answer is this, that the question here is not about persons, but that
reference is made to the economical condition of the Church. Besides, whatever
spiritual gifts the fathers obtained, they were accidental as it were to their
age; for it was necessary for them to direct their eyes to Christ in order to
become possessed of them. Hence it was not without reason that the Apostle, in
comparing the Gospel with the Law, took away from the latter what is peculiar to
the former. There is yet no reason why God should not have extended the grace of
the new covenant to the fathers. This is the true solution of the
question.<br></div>
<div><b>11.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And they shall not teach,</i></font>
etc. We have said that the third point is as it were a part of the second,
included in these words, <font color="Maroon"><i>I will put my laws in their
mind</i></font>; for it is the work of the Spirit of God to illuminate our
minds, so that we may know what the will of God is, and also to bend our hearts
to obedience. For the right knowledge of God is a wisdom which far surpasses the
comprehension of man&#8217;s understanding; therefore, to attain it no one is
able except through the secret revelation of the Spirit. Hence Isaiah, in
speaking of the restoration of the Church, says, that all God&#8217;s children
would be his disciples or scholars.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232816&gt;</font></sup>Isaiah 28:16.) The meaning
of our Prophet is the same when he introduces God as saying,
<font color="Maroon"><i>They shall know me.</i></font> For God does not promise
what is in our own power, but what he alone can perform for us. In short, these
words of the Prophet are the same as though he had said, that our minds are
blind and destitute of all right understanding until they are illuminated by the
Spirit of God. Thus God is rightly known by those alone to whom he has been
pleased by a special favor to reveal himself.<br></div>
<div>By saying, <font color="Maroon"><i>From the least to the
greatest,</i></font> he first intimates that God&#8217;s grace would be poured
on all ranks of men, so that no class would be without it. He, secondly, reminds
us that no rude and ignorant men are precluded from this heavenly wisdom, and
that the great and the noble cannot attain it by their own acuteness or by the
help of learning. Thus God connects the meanest and the lowest with the highest,
so that their ignorance is no impediment to the one, nor can the other ascend so
high by their own acumen; but the one Spirit is equally the teacher of them
all.<br></div>
<div>Fanatical men take hence the occasion to do away with public preaching, as
though it were of no use in Christ&#8217;s kingdom; but their madness may be
easily exposed. Their objection is this: &#8220;After the coming of Christ every
one is to teach his neighbor; away then with the external ministry, that a place
may be given to the internal inspiration of God.&#8221; But they pass by this,
that the Prophet does not wholly deny that they would teach one another, but his
words are these, <font color="Maroon"><i>They shall not teach, saying, Know the
Lord;</i></font> as though he had said, &#8220;Ignorance shall not as heretofore
so possess the minds of men as not to know who God is.&#8221; But we know that
the use of teaching is twofold; first, that they who are wholly ignorant may
learn the first elements; and secondly, that those who are initiated may make
progress. As then Christians, as long as they live, ought to make progress, it
cannot surely be said, that any one is so wise that he needs not to be taught;
so that no small part of our wisdom is a teachable spirit. And what is the way
of making progress if we desire to be the disciples of Christ? This is shown to
us by Paul when he says, that Christ gave pastors and teachers.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490411&gt;</font></sup>Ephesians 4:11.) It hence
appears that nothing less was thought of by the Prophet than to rob the Church
of such a benefit.<sup><font color="Maroon">F134</font></sup> His only object
was to show that God would make himself known to small and great, according to
what was also predicted by
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;290228&gt;</font></sup>Joel 2:28. It ought also in
passing to be noticed, that this light of sacred knowledge is promised
peculiarly to the Church; hence this passage belongs to none but to the
household of faith.<sup><font color="Maroon">F135</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>13.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>In that he saith, A new,</i></font> etc.
From the fact of one covenant being established, he infers the subversion of the
other; and by calling it the old covenant, he assumes that it was to be
abrogated; for what is old tends to a
decay.<sup><font color="Maroon">F136</font></sup> Besides, as the new is
substituted, it must be that the former has come to an end; for the second, as
it has been said, is of another character. But if the whole dispensation of
Moses, as far as it was opposed to the dispensation of Christ, has passed away,
then the ceremonies also must have ceased. <br></div>

<div><b>1</b><font color="Maroon"><b><i>.</i></b><i> Then verily the
first,</i></font> etc.<sup><font color="Maroon">F137</font></sup> After having
spoken generally of the abrogation of the old covenant, he now refers specially
to the ceremonies. His object is to show that there was nothing practiced then
to which Christ&#8217;s coming has not put an end. He says first, that under the
old covenant there was a specific form of divine worship, and that it was
peculiarly adapted to that time. It will hereafter appear by the comparison what
kind of things were those rituals prescribed under the Law.<br></div>
<div>Some copies read, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">prw&gt;th
skhnh&lt;</font> the first tabernacle; but I suspect that there is a mistake as
to the word &#8220;tabernacle;&#8221; nor do I doubt but that some unlearned
reader, not finding a noun to the adjective, and in his ignorance applying to
the tabernacle what had been said of the covenant, unwisely added the word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">skhnh&lt; </font>tabernacle. I indeed
greatly wonder that the mistake had so prevailed, that it is found in the Greek
copies almost universally.<sup><font color="Maroon">F138</font></sup> But
necessity constrains me to follow the ancient reading. For the Apostle, as I
have said, had been speaking of the old covenant; he now comes to ceremonies,
which were additions, as it were, to it. He then intimates that all the rites of
the Mosaic Law were a part of the old covenant, and that they partook of the
same ancientness, and were therefore to perish.<br></div>
<div>Many take the word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">latrei&gt;av
</font>as an accusative plural. I agree with those who connect the two words
together, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dikaiw&gt;mata
latrei&gt;av</font> for institutes or rites, which the Hebrews call
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yqwj</font>, and the Greeks have
rendered by the word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dikaiw&gt;mata</font> ordinances. The
sense is, that the whole form or manner of worshipping God was annexed to the
old covenant, and that it consisted of sacrifices, ablutions, and other symbols,
together with the sanctuary. And he calls it a <font color="Maroon"><i>worldly
sanctuary,</i></font> because there was no heavenly truth or reality in those
rites; for though the sanctuary was the effigy of the original pattern which had
been shown to Moses; yet an effigy or image is a different thing from the
reality, and especially when they are compared, as here, as things opposed to
each other. Hence the sanctuary in itself was indeed earthly, and is rightly
classed among the elements of the world, it was yet heavenly as to what it
signified.<sup><font color="Maroon">F139</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>2.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For there was a tabernacle,</i></font>
etc. As the Apostle here touches but lightly on the structure of the tabernacle,
that he might not be detained beyond what his subject required; so will I also
designedly abstain from any refined explanation of it. It is then sufficient for
our present purpose to consider the tabernacle in its three parts, &#8212; the
first was the court of the people; the middle was commonly called the sanctuary;
and the last was the inner sanctuary, which they called, by way of eminence,
<font color="Maroon"><i>the holy of holies.</i><sup>F140</sup></font><br></div>
<div>As to the first sanctuary, which was contiguous to the court of the people,
he says that there were the <font color="Maroon"><i>candlestick</i></font> and
<font color="Maroon"><i>the table</i></font> on which the
<font color="Maroon"><i>shew-bread</i></font> was set: he calls this place, in
the plural number, the holies. Then, after this is mentioned, the most secret
place, which they called the holy of holies, still more remote from the view of
the people, and it was even hid from the priests who ministered in the first
sanctuary; for as by a veil the sanctuary was closed up to the people, so
another veil kept the priests from the holy of holies. There, the Apostle says,
was the <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">qumiath&gt;rion</font> by which
name I understand the altar of incense, or fumigation, rather than the
censer;<sup><font color="Maroon">F141</font></sup> then
<font color="Maroon"><i>the ark of the covenant</i></font>, with its covering,
<font color="Maroon"><i>the two cherubim, the golden pot</i></font> filled with
<font color="Maroon"><i>manna, the rod of Aaron, and the two tables.</i></font>
Thus far the Apostle proceeds in describing the tabernacle.<br></div>
<div>But he says that the pot in which Moses had deposited the manna, and
Aaron&#8217;s rod which had budded, were in the ark with the two tables; but
this seems inconsistent with sacred history, which in 1 King s 8:9, relates that
there was nothing in the ark but the two tables. But it is easy to reconcile
these two passages: God had commanded the pot and Aaron&#8217;s rod to be laid
up before the testimony; it is hence probable that they were deposited in the
ark, together with the tables. But when the Temple was built, these things were
arranged in a different order, and certain history relates it as a thing new
that the ark had nothing else but the two tables.<sup><font color="Maroon">

As nothing can satisfy, curious men, the apostle cuts off every occasion for
refinements unsuitable to his present purpose, and lest a longer discussion of
these things should break off the thread of his argument. If, therefore, any one
should disregard the Apostle&#8217;s example, and dwell more minutely on the
subject, he would be acting very unreasonably. There might be, indeed, an
occasion for doing this elsewhere; but it is now better to attend to the subject
of which he treats: it may further be said, that to philosophize beyond just
limits, which some do, is not only useless, but also dangerous. There are some
things which are not obscure and fitted for the edification of faith; but
discretion and sobriety ought to be observed, lest we seek to be wise above what
God has been pleased to reveal. <br></div>

<div><b>6.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Now, when these things were thus
ordained,</i></font> etc. Omitting other things, he undertakes to handle the
chief point in dispute: he says that the priests who performed sacred rites were
wont to enter the first tabernacle daily, but that the chief priest entered the
holy of holies only yearly with the appointed sacrifice. He hence concludes,
that while the tabernacle under the Law was standing, the sanctuary was closed
up, and that only through that being removed could the way be open for us to the
kingdom of God. We see that the very form of the ancient tabernacle reminded the
Jews that they were to look for something else. Then foolishly did they act who,
by retaining the shadows of the Law, willfully obstructed their own
way.<br></div>
<div>He mentions <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">prw&gt;thn skhnh&lt;n
</font>the first tabernacle, in ver. 2, in a different sense from what it has
here, for here it means the first sanctuary, but there the whole tabernacle; for
he sets it in opposition to the spiritual sanctuary of Christ, which he
presently mentions. He contends that this had fallen for our great benefit, for
through its fall a more familiar access to God has been obtained for
us.<br></div>
<div><b>7.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For himself and for the errors of the
people,</i></font> or for his own and the ignorances of the people. As the verb
|shagag|, means in Hebrew to err, to mistake, so |shgagah|, derived from it,
properly denotes error, or mistake; but yet it is generally taken for any kind
of sin; and doubtless we never sin except when deceived by the allurements of
Satan. The Apostle does not understand by it mere ignorance, as they say, but,
on the contrary, he includes also voluntary sins; but as I have already said, no
sin is free from error or ignorance; for however knowingly and willfully any one
may sin, yet it must be that he is blinded by his lust, so that he does not
judge rightly, or rather he forgets himself and God; for men never deliberately
rush headlong into ruin, but being entangled in the deceptions of Satan, they
lose the power of judging
rightly.<sup><font color="Maroon">F143</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>9.</b><font color="Maroon"><i> Which was a figure,</i></font> etc. The
word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">paraqolh&lt;, </font>used here,
signifies, as I think, the same thing with
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnti&gt;tupov, </font>antitype; for he
means that that tabernacle was a second pattern which corresponded with the
first. For the portrait of a man ought to be so like the man himself, that when
seen, it ought immediately to remind us of him whom it represents. He says
further, that it was a <font color="Maroon"><i>figure,</i></font> or likeness,
<font color="Maroon"><i>for the time then present,</i></font> that is, as long
as the external observance was in force; and he says this in order to confine
its use and duration to the time of the Law; for it means the same with what he
afterwards adds, that all the ceremonies were imposed until the time of
reformation; nor is it any objection that he uses the present tense in saying,
<font color="Maroon"><i>gifts are offered;</i></font> for as he had to do with
the Jews, he speaks by way of concession, as though he were one of those who
sacrificed. <font color="Maroon"><i>Gifts</i></font> and
<font color="Maroon"><i>sacrifices</i></font> differ, as the first is a general
term, and the other is particular.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>That could not make him that did the service
perfect as pertaining to the conscience;</i></font> that is, they did not reach
the soul so as to confer true holiness. I do not reject the words,
<font color="Maroon"><i>make perfect,</i></font> and yet I prefer the
term<font color="Maroon"><i> sanctify,</i></font> as being more suitable to the
context. But that readers may better understand the meaning of the Apostle, let
the contrast between the flesh and the conscience be noticed; he denies that
worshippers could be spiritually and inwardly cleansed by the sacrifices of the
Law. It is added as a reason, that all these rites were of the flesh or carnal.
What then does he allow them to be? It is commonly supposed, that they were
useful only as means of training to men, conducive to virtue and decorum. But
they who thus think do not sufficiently consider the promises which are added.
This gloss, therefore, ought to be wholly repudiated. Absurdly and ignorantly
too do they interpret <font color="Maroon"><i>the ordinances of the
flesh,</i></font> as being such as cleansed or sanctified only the body; for the
Apostle understands by these words that they were earthly symbols, which did not
reach the soul; for though they were true testimonies of perfect holiness, yet
they by no means contained it in themselves, nor could they convey it to men;
for the faithful were by such helps led, as it were, by the hand to Christ, that
they might obtain from him what was wanting in the symbols.<br></div>
<div>Were any one to ask why the Apostle speaks with so little respect and even
with contempt of Sacraments divinely instituted, and extenuates their efficacy?
This he does, because he separates them from Christ; and we know that when
viewed in themselves they are but beggarly elements, as Paul calls them.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480409&gt;</font></sup>Galatians 4:9.)<br></div>
<div><b>10.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Until the time of
reformation,</i></font> etc. Here he alludes to the prophecy of Jeremiah.
(<font face="Palatino">Jeremiah 31:31</font>.)<sup><font color="Maroon">
F143a</font></sup> The new covenant succeeded the old as a reformation. He
expressly mentions <font color="Maroon"><i>meats</i></font> and
<font color="Maroon"><i>drinks,</i></font> and other things of minor importance,
because by these trifling observances a more certain opinion may be formed how
far short was the Law of the perfection of the
Gospel.<sup><font color="Maroon">F144</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>11.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But Christ being come,</i></font> etc.
He now sets before us the reality of the things under the Law, that it may turn
our eyes from them to itself; for he who believes that the things then shadowed
forth under the Law have been really found in Christ, will no longer cleave to
the shadows, but will embrace the substance and the genuine reality.<br></div>
<div>But the particulars of the comparison between Christ and the ancient high
priest, ought to be carefully noticed. He had said that the high priest alone
entered the sanctuary once a year with blood to expiate sins. Christ is in this
life the ancient high priests for he alone possesses the dignity and the office
of a high priest; but he differs from him in this respect, that he brings with
him eternal blessings which secure a perpetuity to his priesthood. Secondly,
there is this likeness between the ancient high priest and ours, that both
entered the holy of holies through the sanctuary; but they differ in this, that
Christ alone entered into heaven through the temple of his own body. That the
holy of holies was once every year opened to the high priest to make the
appointed expiation &#8212; this obscurely prefigured the one true sacrifice of
Christ. To enter once then was common to both, but to the earthly it was every
year, while it was to the heavenly forever, even to the end of the world. The
offering of blood was common to both; but there was a great difference as to the
blood; for Christ offered, not the blood of beasts, but his own blood. Expiation
was common to both; but that according to the Law, as it was inefficacious, was
repeated every year; but the expiation made by Christ is always effectual and is
the cause of eternal salvation to us. Thus, there is great importance almost in
every word. Some render the words, &#8220;But Christ standing by,&#8221; or
asking; but the meaning of the Apostle is not thus expressed; for he intimates
that when the Levitical priests had for the prefixed time performed their
office, Christ came in their place, according to what we found in the seventh
chapter.  <sup><font color="Maroon">F144a</font></sup>  <br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Of good things to come,</i></font> etc. Take these
for eternal things; for as <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">me&gt;llwn
kairo&lt;v,</font> time to come, is set in opposition to the present
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tw~| ejnesthko&gt;ti;</font> so future
blessings are to the present. The meaning is, that we are led by Christ&#8217;s
priesthood into the celestial kingdom of God, and that we are made partakers of
spiritual righteousness and of eternal life, so that it is not right to desire
anything better. Christ alone, then, has that by which he can retain and satisfy
us in himself.<sup><font color="Maroon">F145</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>By a greater and more perfect
tabernacle,</i></font> etc. Though this passage is variously explained, yet I
have no doubt but that he means the body of Christ; for as there was formerly an
access for the Levitical high priest to the holy of holies through the
sanctuary, so Christ through his own body entered into the glory of heaven; for
as he had put on our flesh and in it suffered, he obtained for himself this
privilege, that he should appear before God as a Mediator for us. In the first
place, the word sanctuary is fitly and suitably applied to the body of Christ,
for it is the temple in which the whole majesty of God dwells. He is further
said to have made a way for us by his body to ascend into heaven, because in
that body he consecrated himself to God, he became in it sanctified to be our
true righteousness, he prepared himself in it to offer a sacrifice; in a word,
he made himself in it of no reputation, and suffered the death of the cross;
therefore, the Father highly exalted him and gave him a name above every name,
that every knee should bow to him.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502308&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 2:8-10.) He
then entered into heaven through his own body, because on this account it is
that he now sits at the Father&#8217;s right hand; he for this reason intercedes
for us in heaven, because he had put on our flesh, and consecrated it as a
temple to God the Father, and in it sanctified himself to obtain for us an
eternal righteousness, having made an expiation for our
sins.<sup><font color="Maroon">F146</font></sup><br></div>
<div>It may however seem strange, that he denies the body of Christ to be
<font color="Maroon"><i>of this building</i></font>; for doubtless he proceeded
from the seed of Abraham, and was liable to sufferings and to death. To this I
reply, that he speaks not here of his material body, or of what belongs to the
body as such, but of the spiritual efficacy which emanates from it to us. For as
far as Christ&#8217;s flesh is quickening, and is a heavenly food to nourish
souls, as far as his blood is a spiritual drink and has a cleansing power, we
are not to imagine anything earthly or material as being in them. And then we
must remember that this is said in allusion to the ancient tabernacle, which was
made of wood, brass, skins, silver, and gold, which were all dead things; but
the power of God made the flesh of Christ to be a living and spiritual
temple.<br></div>
<div><b>12.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Neither by the blood of
goats,</i></font> etc. All these things tend to show that the things of Christ
so far excel the shadows of the Law, that they justly reduce them all to
nothing. For what is the value of Christ&#8217;s blood, if it be deemed no
better than the blood of beasts? What sort of expiation was made by his death,
if the purgations according to the Law be still retained? As soon then as Christ
came forth with the efficacious influence of his death, all the typical
observances must necessarily have ceased. <br></div>

<div><b>13.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For if the blood of bulls,</i></font>
etc. This passage has given to many all occasion to go astray, because they did
not consider that sacraments are spoken of, which had a spiritual import. The
cleansing of the flesh they leave explained of what avails among men, as the
heathens had their expiations to blot out the infamy of crimes. But this
explanation is indeed very heathenish; for wrong is done to God&#8217;s
promises, if we restrict the effect to civil matters only. Often does this
declaration occur in the writings of Moses, that iniquity was expiated when a
sacrifice was duly offered. This is no doubt the spiritual teaching of faith.
Besides, all the sacrifices were destined for this end, that they might lead men
to Christ; as the eternal salvation of the soul is through Christ, so these were
true witnesses of this salvation.<br></div>
<div>What then does the Apostle mean when he speaks of the purgations of the
flesh? He means what is symbolical or sacramental, as follows, &#8212; If the
blood of beasts was a true symbol of purgation, so that it cleansed in a
sacramental manner, how much more shall Christ who is himself the truth, not
only bear witness to a purgation by an external rite, but also really perform
this for consciences? The argument then is from the signs to the thing
signified; for the effect by a long time preceded the reality of the
signs.<br></div>
<div><b>14.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Who through the eternal
Spirit,</i></font> etc. He now clearly shows how Christ&#8217;s death is to be
estimated, not by the external act, but by the power of the Spirit. For Christ
suffered as man; but that death becomes saving to us through the efficacious
power of the Spirit; for a sacrifice, which was to be an eternal expiation, was
a work more than human. And he calls the Spirit
<font color="Maroon"><i>eternal</i></font> for this reason, that we may know
that the reconciliation, of which he is the worker or effecter, is
eternal.<sup><font color="Maroon">F147</font></sup> By saying,
<font color="Maroon"><i>without spot,</i></font> or unblamable, though he
alludes to the victims under the Law, which were not to have a blemish or
defect, he yet means, that Christ alone was the lawful victim and capable of
appeasing God; for there was always in others something that might be justly
deemed wanting; and hence he said before that the covenant of the Law was not
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajmempton,</font> blameless.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>From dead works,</i></font> etc. Understand by
these either such works as produce death, or such as are the fruits or effects
of death; for as the life of the soul is our union with God, so they who are
alienated from him through sin may be justly deemed to be dead.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>To serve the living God.</i></font> This, we must
observe, is the end of our purgation; for we are not washed by Christ, that we
may plunge ourselves again into new filth, but that our purity may serve to
glorify God. Besides, he teaches us, that nothing can proceed from us that can
be pleasing to God until we are purified by the blood of Christ; for as we are
all enemies to God before our reconciliation, so he regards as abominable all
our works; hence the beginning of acceptable service is reconciliation. And
then, as no work is so pure and so free from stains, that it can of itself
please God, it is necessary that the purgation through the blood of Christ
should intervene, which alone can efface all stains. And there is a striking
contrast between the living God and dead works.<br></div>
<div><b>15.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And for this cause he is Mediator of the
New Testament,</i></font> etc. He concludes that there is no more need of
another priest, for Christ fulfills the office under the New Testament; for he
claims not for Christ the honor of a Mediator, so that others may at the same
time remain as such with him; but he maintains that all others were repudiated
when Christ undertook the office. But that he might more fully confirm this
fact, he mentions how he commenced to discharge his office of a Mediator; even
through death intervening. Since this is found alone in Christ, being wanting in
all others, it follows that he alone can be justly deemed a
Mediator.<sup><font color="Maroon">F148</font></sup><br></div>
<div>He further records the virtue and efficacy of his death by saying that he
paid the price for sins under the <font color="Maroon"><i>first
covenant</i></font> or testament, which could not be blotted out by the blood of
beasts; by which words he was seeking draw away the Jews from the Law to Christ.
For, if the Law was so weak that all the remedies it applied for expiating sins
did by no means accomplish what they represented, who could rest in it as in a
safe harbor? This one thing, then, ought to have been enough to stimulate them
to seek for something better than the law; for they could not but be in
perpetual anxiety. On the other hand, when we come to Christ, as we obtain in
him a full redemption, there is nothing which can any more distress us. Then, in
these words he shows that the Law is weak, that the Jews might no longer recumb
on it; and he teaches them to rely on Christ, for in him is found whatever can
be desired for pacifying consciences.<br></div>
<div>Now, if any one asks, whether sins under the Law where remitted to the
fathers, we must bear in mind the solution already stated, &#8212; that they
were remitted, but remitted through Christ. Then notwithstanding their external
expiations, they were always held guilty. For this reason Paul says, that the
Law was a handwriting against us.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510214&gt;</font></sup>Colossians 2:14.) For when
the sinner came forward and openly confessed that he was guilty before God, and
acknowledged by sacrificing an innocent animal that he was worthy of eternal
death, what did he obtain by his victim, except that he sealed his own death as
it were by this handwriting? In short, even then they only reposed in the
remission of sins, when they looked to Christ. But if only a regard to Christ
took away sins, they could never have been freed from them, had they continued
to rest in the Law. David indeed declares, that blessed is the man to whom sins
are not imputed, (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193202&gt;</font></sup>Psalm
32:2;) but that he might be a partaker of this blessedness, it was necessary for
him to leave the Law, and to have his eyes fixed on Christ; for if he rested in
the Law, he could never have been freed from guilt.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>They who are called,</i></font> etc. The object of
the divine covenant is, that having been adopted as children, we may at length
be made heirs of eternal life. The Apostle teaches us that we obtain this by
Christ. It is hence evident, that in him is the fulfillment of the covenant. But
the <font color="Maroon"><i>promise of the inheritance</i></font> is to be taken
for the promised inheritance, as though he had said, &#8220;The promise of
eternal life is not otherwise made to us to be enjoined, than through the death
of Christ.&#8221; Life, indeed, was formerly promised to the fathers, and the
same has been the inheritance of God&#8217;s children from the beginning, but we
do not otherwise enter into the possession of it, than through the blood of
Christ previously shed.<br></div>
<div>But he speaks of the <font color="Maroon"><i>called,</i></font> that he
might the more influence the Jews who were made partakers of this calling; for
it is a singular favor, when we have the gift of the knowledge of Christ
bestowed on us. We ought then to take the more heed, lest we neglect so valuable
a treasure, and our thoughts should wander elsewhere. Some regard the
<font color="Maroon"><i>called</i></font> to be the elect, but incorrectly in my
judgment; for the Apostle teaches here the same thing as we find in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450325&gt;</font></sup>Romans 3:25, that
righteousness and salvation have been procured by the blood of Christ, but that
we become partakers of them by faith.<br></div>
<div><b>16.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For where a testament is,</i></font>
etc. Even this one passage is a sufficient proof, that this Epistle was not
written in Hebrew; for <font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tyrb</font> means
in Hebrew a covenant, but not a testament; but in Greek,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diaqh&gt;kh,</font> includes both ideas;
and the Apostle, alluding to its secondary meaning, holds that the promises
should not have been otherwise ratified and valid, had they not been sealed by
the death of Christ. And this he proves by referring to what is usually the case
as to wills or testaments, the effect of which is suspended until the death of
those whose wills they are.<br></div>
<div>The Apostle may yet seem to rest on too weak an argument, so that what he
says may be easily disproved. For it may be said, that God made no testament or
will under the Law; but it was a covenant that he made with the ancient people.
Thus, neither from the fact nor from the name, can it be concluded that
Christ&#8217;s death was necessary. For if he infers from the fact, that Christ
ought to have died, because a testament is not ratified except by the death of
the testator, the answer may be this, that |berit|, the word ever used by Moses,
is a covenant made between those who are alive, and we cannot think otherwise of
the fact itself. Now, as to the word used, he simply alluded, as I have already
said, to the two meanings it has in Greek; he therefore dwells chiefly on the
thing in itself. Nor is it any objection to say, that it was a covenant that God
made with his people; for that very covenant bore some likeness to a testament,
for it was ratified by
blood.<sup><font color="Maroon">F149</font></sup><br></div>
<div>We must ever hold this truth, that no symbols have ever been adopted by God
unnecessarily or unsuitably. And God in establishing the covenant of the law
made use of blood. Then it was not such a contract, as they say, between the
living, as did not require death. Besides, what rightly belongs to a testament
is, that it begins to take effect after death. If we consider that the Apostle
reasons from the thing itself, and not from the word, and if we bear in mind
that he avowedly takes as granted what I have already stated, that nothing has
been instituted in vain by God, there will be no great difficulty.<br></div>
<div>If anyone objects and says, that the heathens ratified covenants according
to the other meaning by sacrifices; this indeed I admit to be true; but God did
not borrow the rite of sacrificing from the practice of the heathens; on the
contrary, all the heathen sacrifices were corruptions, which had derived their
origin from the institutions of God. We must then return to the same point, that
the covenant of God which was made with blood, may be fitly compared to a
testament, as it is of the same kind and character. <br></div>

<div><b>18.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Whereupon neither the first,</i></font>
etc. It hence appears that the fact is what is mainly urged, and that it is not
a question about the word, though the Apostle turned to his own purpose a word
presented to his attention in that language in which he wrote, as though one,
while speaking of God&#8217;s covenant, which is often called in Greek
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">marturi&gt;a,</font> a testimony, were to
recommend it among other things under that title. And doubtless that is a
testimony, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">marturi&gt;a,</font> to which
angels from heaven has borne witness, and of which there have been so many
illustrious witnesses on earth, even all the holy Prophets, Apostles, and a vast
number of martyrs, and of which at last the Son of God himself became a surety.
No one in such a discourse would deem any such thing as unreasonable. And yet
the Hebrew word, <font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hdw[t</font> will admit
of no such meaning as a covenant; but as nothing is advanced but what is
consistent with the thing itself, no scrupulous regard is to be paid to the
meaning of a word.<br></div>
<div>The Apostle then says, that the old testament or covenant was
<font color="Maroon"><i>dedicated with blood.</i></font> He hence concludes,
that men were even then reminded, that it could not be valid and efficacious
except death intervened. For though the blood of beasts was then shed, yet, he
denies that it availed to confine an everlasting covenant. That this may appear
more clearly, we must notice the custom of sprinkling which he quotes from
Moses. He first teaches us that the covenant was dedicated or consecrated, not
that it had in itself anything profane; but as there is nothing so holy that men
by their uncleanness will not defile, except God prevents it by making a renewal
of all things, therefore the dedication was made on account of men, who alone
wanted it.<br></div>
<div>He afterwards adds, that the <font color="Maroon"><i>tabernacle and all the
vessels,</i></font> and also the very <font color="Maroon"><i>book</i></font> of
the law, were <font color="Maroon"><i>sprinkled;</i></font> by which rite the
people were then taught, that God could not be sought or looked to for
salvation, nor rightly worshipped, except faith in every case looked to an
intervening blood. For the majesty of God is justly to be dreaded by us, and the
way to his presence is nothing to us but a dangerous labyrinth, until we know
that he is pacified towards us through the blood of Christ, and that this blood
affords to us a free access. All kinds of worship are then faulty and impure
until Christ cleanses them by the sprinkling of his
blood.<sup><font color="Maroon">F150</font></sup><br></div>
<div>For the tabernacle was a sort of visible image of God; and as the
<font color="Maroon"><i>vessels</i></font> for ministering were destined for his
service, so they were symbols of true worship. But since none of these were for
salvation to the people, we hence reasonably conclude, that where Christ does
not appear with his blood, we have nothing to do with God. So doctrine itself,
however unchangeable may be the will of God, cannot be efficacious for our
benefit, unless it be dedicated by blood, as is plainly set forth in this
verse.<br></div>
<div>I know that others give a different interpretation; for they consider the
tabernacle to be the body of the Church, and vessels the faithful, whose
ministry God employs; but what I have stated is much more appropriate. For
whenever God was to be called upon, they turned themselves to the sanctuary; and
it was a common way of speaking to say that they stood before the Lord when they
appeared in the temple.<br></div>
<div><b>20.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Saying, This is the blood of the
testament,</i><sup> F151</sup></font> etc. If that was the blood of the
testament, then neither the testament was without blood ratified, nor the blood
without the testament available for expiation. It is hence necessary that both
should be united; and we see that before the explanation of the Law, no symbol
was added, for what would a sacrament be except the word preceded it? Hence a
symbol is a kind of appendage to the word. And mark, this word was not whispered
like a magic incantation, but pronounced with a clear voice, as it was destined
for the people, according to what the words of the covenant express,
<font color="Maroon"><i>which God hath enjoined unto you.</i></font>
<sup><font color="Maroon">F152</font></sup> Perverted, then, are the sacraments,
and it is a wicked corruption when there is no explanation of the commandment
given, which is as it were the very soul of the sacrament. Hence the Papists,
who take away the true understanding of things from signs, retain only dead
elements.<br></div>
<div>This passage reminds us that the promises of God are then only profitable
to us when they are confirmed by the blood of Christ. For what Paul testifies in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470120&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 1:20, that
all God&#8217;s promises are yea and amen in Christ &#8212; this happens when
his blood like a seal is engraven on our hearts, or when we not only hear God
speaking, but also see Christ offering himself as a pledge for those things
which are spoken. If this thought only came to our minds, that what we read is
not written so much with ink as with the blood of Christ, that when the Gospel
is preached, his sacred blood distills together with the voice, there would be
far greater attention as well as reverence on our part. A symbol of this was the
sprinkling mentioned by Moses!<br></div>
<div>At the same time there is more stated here than what is expressed by Moses;
for he does not mention that the book and the people were sprinkled, nor does he
name the <font color="Maroon"><i>goats</i></font>, nor the
<font color="Maroon"><i>scarlet wool,</i></font> nor the
<font color="Maroon"><i>hyssop.</i></font> As to the book, that it was sprinkled
cannot be clearly shown, yet the probability is that it was, for Moses is said
to have produced it after he had sacrificed; and he did this when he bound the
people to God by a solemn compact. With regard to the rest, the Apostle seems to
have blended together various kinds of expiations, the reason for which was the
same. Nor indeed was there anything unsuitable in this, since he was speaking of
the general subject Or purgation under the Old Testament, which was done by
means of blood. Now as to the sprinkling made by hyssop and scarlet wool, it is
evident that it represented the mystical sprinkling made by the Spirit. We know
that the hyssop possesses a singular power to cleanse and to purify; so Christ
employs his Spirit to sprinkle us in order to wash us by his own blood when he
leads us to true repentance, when he purifies us from the depraved lusts of our
flesh, when he imbues us with the precious gift of his own righteousness. For it
was not in vain that God had instituted this rite. David also alluded to this
when he said,<br></div>
<div align="center"><font color="Navy">&#8220;Thou wilt sprinkle me, O Lord,
with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195107&gt;</font></sup><font color="Navy">Psalm
51:7.)</font><br></div>
<div>These remarks will be sufficient for those who wish to be sober-minded in
their speculations.<br></div>
<div><b>22.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And almost all things,</i></font> etc.
By saying <font color="Maroon"><i>almost</i></font> he seems to imply that some
things were otherwise purified. And doubtless they often washed themselves and
other unclean things with water. But even water itself derived its power to
cleanse from the sacrifices; so that the Apostle at length truly declares that
without blood there was no remission.<sup><font color="Maroon">
F153</font></sup> Then uncleanness was imputed until it was expiated by a
sacrifice. And as without Christ there is no purity nor salvation, so nothing
without blood can be either pure or saving; for Christ is never to be separated
from the sacrifice of his death. But the Apostle meant only to say that this
symbol was almost always made use of. But if at any time the purgation was not
so made, it was nevertheless through blood, since all the rites derived their
efficacy in a manner from the general expiation. For the people were not each of
them sprinkled, (for how could so small a portion of blood be sufficient for so
large a multitude?) yet the purgation extended to all. Hence the particle
<font color="Maroon"><i>almost</i></font> signifies the same as though he had
said, that the use of this rite was so common that they seldom omitted it in
purgations. For what Chrysostom says, that unfitness is thus denoted, because
these were only figures under the Law, is inconsistent with the Apostle&#8217;s
design.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>No remission,</i></font> etc. Thus men are
prevented from appearing before God; for as he is justly displeased with them
all, there is no ground for them to promise themselves any favor until he is
pacified. But there is but one way of pacification, and that is by an expiation
made by blood: hence no pardon of sins can be hoped for unless we bring blood,
and this is done when we flee by faith to the death of Christ.<br></div>
<div><b>23.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>The patterns,</i></font> or exemplars,
etc. Lest any one should object and say that the blood by which the old
testament was dedicated was different from that of a testator, the Apostle meets
this objection, and says that it was no wonder that the tabernacle which was
earthly was consecrated by the sacrificing of beasts; for there was an analogy
and a likeness between the purification and the things purified. But the
heavenly pattern or exemplar of which he now speaks was to be consecrated in a
very different way; there was here no need of goats or of calves. It hence
follows that the death of the testator was necessary.<br></div>
<div>The meaning then is this, &#8212; as under the Law there were only earthly
images of spiritual things, so the rite of expiation was also, so to speak,
carnal and figurative; but as the heavenly pattern allows of nothing earthly, so
it requires another blood than that of beasts, such as may correspond with its
excellency. Thus the death of the testator is necessary, in order that the
testament may be really consecrated.<br></div>
<div>He calls the kingdom of Christ <font color="Maroon"><i>heavenly
things,</i><sup>F154</sup></font> for it is spiritual and possesses a full
revelation of the truth. <font color="Maroon"><i>Better sacrifices</i></font> he
mentions instead of &#8220;a better sacrifice,&#8221; for it was only one; but
he uses the plural number for the sake of the antithesis or contrast. <br></div>

<div><b>24.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For Christ is not entered,</i></font>
etc. This is a confirmation of the former verse. He had spoken of the true
sanctuary, even the heavenly; he now adds that Christ entered there. It hence
follows that a suitable confirmation is required. <font color="Maroon"><i>The
holy places</i></font> he takes for the sanctuary; he says that it is
<font color="Maroon"><i>not made with hands,</i></font> because it ought not to
be classed with the created things which are subject to decay; for he does not
mean here the <font color="Maroon"><i>heaven</i></font> we see, and in which the
stars shine, but the glorious kingdom of God which is above all the heavens. He
calls the old sanctuary the
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnti&gt;tupon,</font> the antitype of
the true, that is, of the spiritual; for all the external figures represented as
in a mirror what would have otherwise been above our corporeal senses. Greek
writers sometimes use the same word in speaking of our sacraments, and wisely
too and suitably, for every sacrament is a visible image of what is
invisible.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Now to appear,</i></font> etc. So formerly the
Levitical priest stood before God in the name of the people, but typically; for
in Christ is found the reality and the full accomplishment of what was typified.
The ark was indeed a symbol of the divine presence; But it is Christ who really
presents himself before God, and stands there to obtain favor for us, so that
now there is no reason why we should flee from God&#8217;s tribunal, since we
have so kind an advocate, through whose faithfulness and protection we are made
secure and safe. Christ was indeed our advocate when he was on earth; but it was
a further concession made to our infirmity that he ascended into heaven to
undertake there the office of an advocate. So that whenever mention is made of
his ascension into heaven, this benefit ought ever to come to our minds, that he
appears there before God to defend us by his advocacy. Foolishly, then, and
unreasonably the question is asked by some, has he not always appeared there?
For the Apostle speaks here only of his intercession, for the sake of which he
entered the heavenly sanctuary.<br></div>
<div><b>25.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Nor yet that he should offer himself
often,</i></font> etc. How, then, is he a priest, one may say, if he offers no
sacrifices? To this I reply that it is not requited of a priest that he should
be continually sacrificing; for even under the Law there were days appointed for
the chief sacrifices every year; they had also their hours daily morning and
evening. But as that only true sacrifice which Christ offered once for all is
ever efficacious, and thus perpetual in its effects, it is no wonder that on its
virtue, which never fails, Christ&#8217;s eternal priesthood should be
sustained. And here again he shows how and in what things Christ differs from
the Levitical priest. Of the sanctuary he had spoken before; but he notices one
difference as to the kind of sacrifice, for Christ offered himself and not an
animal; and he adds another; that he repeated not his sacrifice, as under the
Law, for the repetition there was frequent and even incessant.<br></div>
<div><b>26.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For then must he often have
suffered,</i></font> etc. He shows how great an absurdity follows, if we do not
count it enough that an expiation has been made by the one sacrifice of Christ.
For he hence concludes that he must have died often; for death is connected with
sacrifices. How this latter supposition is most unreasonable; it then follows
that the virtue of the one sacrifice is eternal and extends to all ages. And he
says <font color="Maroon"><i>since the foundation of the world,</i></font> or
from the beginning of the world<sup><font color="Maroon">F155</font></sup> for
in all ages from the beginning there were sins which needed expiation. Except
then the sacrifice of Christ was efficacious, no one of the fathers would have
obtained salvation; for as they were exposed to God&#8217;s wrath, a remedy for
deliverance would have failed them, had not Christ by suffering once suffered so
much as was necessary to reconcile men to God from the beginning of the world
even to the end. Except then we look for many deaths, we must be satisfied with
the one true sacrifice.<br></div>
<div>And hence it is evident how frivolous is the distinction, in the acuteness
of which the Papists take so much delight; for they say that the sacrifice of
Christ on the cross was bloody, but that the sacrifice of the mass which they
pretend to offer daily to God, is unbloody. Were this subtle evasion adopted,
then the Spirit of God would be accused of inadvertence, having not thought of
such a thing; for the Apostle assumes it here as an admitted truth, that there
is no sacrifice without death. I care nothing that ancient writers have spoken
thus; for it is not in the power of men to invent sacrifices as they please.
Here stands a truth declared by the Holy Spirit, that sins are not expiated by a
sacrifice except blood be shed. Therefore the notion, that Christ is often
offered, is a device of the devil.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>But now once in the end of the world,</i></font>
etc. He calls that the end of the world or the consummation of the ages, which
Paul calls &#8220;the fullness of time,&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480404&gt;</font></sup>Galatians 4:4;) for it was
the maturity of that time which God had determined in his eternal purpose; and
thus cut off is every occasion for men&#8217;s curiosity, that they may not dare
to inquire why it was no sooner, or why in that age rather than in another. For
it behooves us to acquiesce in God&#8217;s secret purpose, the reason for which
appears clear to him, though it may not be evident to us. In short, the Apostle
intimates that Christ&#8217;s death was in due time, as he was sent into the
world for this end by the Father, in whose power is the lawful right to regulate
all things as well as time, and who ordains their succession with consummate
wisdom, though often hid from us<br></div>
<div>This consummation is also set in opposition to the imperfection of past
time; for God so held his ancient people in suspense, that it might have been
easily concluded that things had not yet reached a fixed state. Hence Paul
declares that the end of the ages had come upon us,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461011&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 10:11;) by
which he means that the kingdom of Christ contained the accomplishment of all
things. But since it was the fullness of time when Christ appeared to expiate
sins, they are guilty of offering him an atrocious insult, who seek to renew his
sacrifice, as though all things were not completed by his death. He then
appeared once for all; for had he done so once or twice, there must have been
something defective in the first oblation; but this is inconsistent with
fullness.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>To put away,</i></font> or to destroy
<font color="Maroon"><i>sin</i></font>,
etc.<sup><font color="Maroon">F156</font></sup> This agrees with Daniel&#8217;s
prophecy, in which the sealing up and the abolition of sins are promised, and in
which it is also declared that there would be an end to sacrifices,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;270924&gt;</font></sup>Daniel 9:24-27;) for to
what purpose are expiations when sins are destroyed? But this destruction is
then only effected, when sins are not imputed to those who flee to the sacrifice
of Christ; for though pardon is to be sought daily, as we daily provoke
God&#8217;s wrath; yet as we are reconciled to God in no other way than by the
one death of Christ, sin is rightly said to be put away or destroyed by
it.<br></div>
<div><b>27.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And as it is appointed,</i></font> etc.
The meaning is this: since we patiently wait after death for the day of
judgment, it being the common lot of nature which it is not right to struggle
against; why should there be less patience in waiting for the second coming of
Christ? For if a long interval of time does not diminish, as to men, the hope of
a happy resurrection, how unreasonable would it be to render less honor to
Christ? But less would it be, were we to call upon him to undergo a second
death, when he had once died. Were any one to object and say, that some had died
twice, such as Lazarus, and not <font color="Maroon"><i>once;</i></font> the
answer would be this, &#8212; that the Apostle speaks here of the ordinary lot
of men; but they are to be excepted from this condition, who shall by an
instantaneous change put off corruption,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461551&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 15:51;) for
he includes none but those who wait for a long time in the dust for the
redemption of their bodies.<br></div>
<div><b>28.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>The second time without sin,</i></font>
etc. The Apostle urges this one thing, &#8212; that we ought not to be
disquieted by vain and impure longings for new kinds of expiations, for the
death of Christ is abundantly sufficient for us. Hence he says, that he once
appeared and made a sacrifice to abolish sins, and that at his second coming he
will make openly manifest the efficacy of his death, so that sin will have no
more power to hurt us.<sup><font color="Maroon">F157</font></sup><br></div>
<div>To <font color="Maroon"><i>bear,</i></font> or, take away sins, is to free
from guilt by his satisfaction those who have sinned. He says the sins of
<font color="Maroon"><i>many,</i></font> that is, of all, as in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450515&gt;</font></sup>Romans 5:15. It is yet
certain that all receive no benefit from the death of Christ; but this happens,
because their unbelief prevents them. At the same time this question is not to
be discussed here, for the Apostle is not speaking of the few or of the many to
whom the death of Christ may be available; but he simply means that he died for
others and not for himself; and therefore he opposes many to
one.<sup><font color="Maroon">F158</font></sup><br></div>
<div>But what does he mean by saying that Christ will
<font color="Maroon"><i>appear without sin?</i></font> Some say, without a
propitiation or an expiatory sacrifice for sin, as the word sin is taken in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450803&gt;</font></sup>Romans 8:3;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470521&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 5:21; and in
many places in the writings of Moses; but in my judgment he intended to express
something more suitable to his present purpose, namely, that Christ at his
coming will make it known how truly and really he had taken away sins, so that
there would be no need of any other sacrifice to pacify God; as though he had
said, &#8220;When we come to the tribunal of Christ, we shall find that there
was nothing wanting in his
death.&#8221;<sup><font color="Maroon">F159</font></sup><br></div>
<div>And to the same effect is what he immediately adds,
<font color="Maroon"><i>unto salvation to them who look,</i></font> or wait
<font color="Maroon"><i>for him.</i></font> Others render the sentence
differently, &#8220;To them who look for him unto salvation;&#8221; But the
other meaning is the most appropriate; for he means that those shall find
complete salvation who recumb with quiet minds on the death of Christ; for this
looking for or wanting has a reference to the subject discussed. The Scripture
indeed does elsewhere ascribe this in common to believers, that they look for
the coming of the Lord, in order to distinguish them from the ungodly, by whom
his coming is dreaded, (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520110&gt;</font></sup>1
Thessalonians 1:10;) but as the Apostle now contends that we ought to acquiesce
in the one true sacrifice of Christ, he calls it the looking for Christ, when we
are satisfied with his redemption alone, and seek no other remedies or
helps.<sup><font color="Maroon">F160</font></sup><br></div>

<div><b>1.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For the Law having a shadow,</i></font>
etc. He has borrowed this similitude from the pictorial art; for a shadow here
is in a sense different from what it has in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510217&gt;</font></sup>Colossians 2:17; where he
calls the ancient rites or ceremonies shadows, because they did not possess the
real substance of what they represented. But he now says that they were like
rude lineaments, which shadow forth the perfect picture; for painters, before
they introduce the living colors by the pencil, are wont to mark out the
outlines of what they intend to represent. This indistinct representation is
called by the Greeks
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">skiagrafi&gt;a,</font> which you might
call in Latin, &#8220;umbratilem&#8221;, shadowy. The Greeks had also the
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijkw&lt;n,</font> the full likeness.
Hence also &#8220;eiconia&#8221; are called images
(<font color="Maroon"><i>imagines</i></font>) in Latin, which represent to the
life the form of men or of animals or of places.<br></div>
<div>The difference then which the Apostle makes between the Law and the Gospel
is this, &#8212; that under the Law was shadowed forth only in rude and
imperfect lines what is under the Gospel set forth in living colors and
graphically distinct. He thus confirms again what he had previously said, that
the Law was not useless, nor its ceremonies unprofitable. For though there was
not in them the image of heavenly things, finished, as they say, by the last
touch of the artist; yet the representation, such as it was, was of no small
benefit to the fathers; but still our condition is much more favorable. We must
however observe, that the things which were shown to them at a distance are the
same with those which are now set before our eyes. Hence to both the same Christ
is exhibited, the same righteousness, sanctification, and salvation; and the
difference only is in the manner of painting or setting them forth.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Of good things to come,</i></font> etc. These, I
think, are eternal things. I indeed allow that the kingdom of Christ, which is
now present with us, was formerly announced as future; but the Apostle&#8217;s
words mean that we have a lively image of future blessings. He then understands
that spiritual pattern, the full fruition of which is deferred to the
resurrection and the future world. At the same time I confess again that these
good things began to be revealed at the beginning of the kingdom of Christ; but
what he now treats of is this, that they are not only future blessings as to the
Old Testament, but also with respect to us, who still hope for them.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Which they offered year by year,</i></font> etc. He
speaks especially of the yearly sacrifice, mentioned in Leviticus 16, though all
the sacrifices are here included under one kind. Now he reasons thus: When there
is no longer any consciousness of sin, there is then no need of sacrifice; but
under the Law the offering of the same sacrifice was often repeated; then no
satisfaction was given to God, nor was guilt removed nor were consciences
appeased; were it otherwise there would have been made an end of sacrificing. We
must further carefully observe, that he calls those the same sacrifices which
were appointed for a similar purpose; for a better notion may be formed of them
by the design for which God instituted them, than by the different beasts which
were offered.<br></div>
<div>And this one thing is abundantly sufficient to confute and expose the
subtlety of the Papists, by which they seem to themselves ingeniously to evade
an absurdity in defending the sacrifice of the mass; for when it is objected to
them that the repetition of the sacrifice is superfluous, since the virtue of
that sacrifice which Christ offered is perpetual, they immediately reply that
the sacrifice in the mass is not different but the same. This is their answer.
But what, on the contrary, does the Apostle say? He expressly denies that the
sacrifice which is repeatedly offered, though the same, is efficacious or
capable of making an atonement. Now, though the Papists should cry out a
thousand times that the sacrifice which Christ once offered is the same with,
and not different from what they make daily, I shall still always contend,
according to the express words of the Apostle, that since the offerings of
Christ availed to pacify God, not only an end was put to former sacrifices, but
that it is also impious to repeat the sacrifice. It is hence quite evident that
the offering of Christ in the mass is
sacrilegious.<sup><font color="Maroon">F161</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>3.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>A remembrance again,</i></font> etc.
Though the Gospel is a message of reconciliation with God, yet it is necessary
that we should daily remember our sins; but what the Apostle means is, that sins
were brought to remembrance that guilt might be removed by the means of the
sacrifice then offered. It is not, then, any kind of remembrance that is here
meant, but that which might lead to such a confession of guilt before God, as
rendered a sacrifice necessary for its removal.<br></div>
<div>Such is the sacrifice of the mass with the Papists; for they pretend that
by it the grace of God is applied to us in order that sins may be blotted out.
But since the Apostle concludes that the sacrifices of the Law were weak,
because they were every year repeated in order to obtain pardon, for the very
same reason it may be concluded that the sacrifice of Christ was weak, if it
must be daily offered, in order that its virtue may be applied to us. With
whatever masks, then, they may cover their mass, they can never escape the
charge of an atrocious blasphemy against Christ.<br></div>
<div><b>4.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For it is not possible,</i></font> etc.
He confirms the former sentiment with the same reason which he had adduced
before, that the blood of beasts could not cleanse souls from sin. The Jews,
indeed, had in this a symbol and a pledge of the real cleansing; but it was with
reference to another, even as the blood of the calf represented the blood of
Christ. But the Apostle is speaking here of the efficacy of the blood of beasts
in itself. He therefore justly takes away from it the power of cleansing. There
is also to be understood a contrast which is not expressed, as though he had
said, &#8220;It is no wonder that the ancient sacrifices were insufficient, so
that they were to be offered continually, for they had nothing in them but the
blood of beasts, which could not reach the conscience; but far otherwise is the
power of Christ&#8217;s blood: It is not then right to measure the offering
which he has made by the former sacrifices.&#8221; <br></div>

<div><b>5.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore, when he cometh,</i></font>
etc. This entering into the world was the manifestation of Christ in the flesh;
for when he put on man&#8217;s nature that he might be a Redeemer to the world
and appeared to men, he is said to have then come into the world, as elsewhere
he is said to have descended from heaven.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430641&gt;</font></sup>John 6:41.) And yet the
fortieth Psalm, which he quotes, seems to be improperly applied to Christ, for
what is found there by no means suits his character, such as, &#8220;My
iniquities have laid hold on me,&#8221; except we consider that Christ willingly
took on himself the sins of his members. The whole of what is said, no doubt,
rightly accords with David; but as it is well known that David was a type of
Christ, there is nothing unreasonable in transferring to Christ what David
declared respecting himself, and especially when mention is made of abolishing
the ceremonies of the Law, as the case is in this passage. Yet all do not
consider that the words have this meaning, for they think that sacrifices are
not here expressly repudiated, but that the superstitious notion which had
generally prevailed, that the whole worship of God consisted in them, is what is
condemned; and if it be so, it may be said that this testimony has little to do
with the present question. It behaves us, then, to examine this passage more
minutely, that it may appear evident whether the apostle has fitly adduced
it.<br></div>
<div>Everywhere in the Prophets sentences of this kind occur, that sacrifices do
not please God, that they are not required by him, that he sets no value on
them; nay, on the contrary, that they are an abomination to him. But then the
blame was not in the sacrifices themselves, but what was adventitious to them
was referred to; for as hypocrites, while obstinate in their impiety, still
sought to pacify God with sacrifices, they were in this manner reproved. The
Prophets, then, rejected sacrifices, not as they were instituted by God, but as
they were vitiated by wicked men, and profaned through unclean consciences. But
here the reason is different, for he is not condemning sacrifices offered in
hypocrisy, or otherwise not rightly performed through the depravity and
wickedness of men; but he denies that they are required of the faithful and
sincere worshippers of God; for he speaks of himself who offered them with a
clean heart and pure hands, and yet he says that they did not please
God.<br></div>
<div>Were any one to except and say that they were not accepted on their own
account or for their own worthiness, but for the sake of something else, I
should still say that unsuitable to this place is an argument of this kind; for
then would men be called back to spiritual worship, when ascribing too much to
external ceremonies; then the Holy Spirit would be considered as declaring that
ceremonies are nothing with God, when by men&#8217;s error they are too highly
exalted.<br></div>
<div>David, being under the Law, ought not surely to have neglected the rite of
sacrificing. He ought, I allow, to have worshipped God with sincerity of heart;
but it was not lawful for him to omit what God had commanded, and he had the
command to sacrifice in common with all the rest. We hence conclude that he
looked farther than to his own age, when he said,
<font color="Maroon"><i>Sacrifice thou wouldest not.</i></font> It was, indeed,
in some respects true, even in David&#8217;s time, that God regarded not
sacrifices; but as they were yet all held under the yoke of the schoolmaster,
David could not perform the worship of God in a complete manner, unless when
clothed, so to speak, in a form of this kind. We must, then, necessarily come to
the kingdom of Christ, in order that the truth of God&#8217;s unwillingness to
receive sacrifice may fully appear. There is a similar passage in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191610&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 16:10, &#8220;Thou
wilt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption;&#8221; for though God
delivered David for a time from corruption, yet this was not fully accomplished
except in Christ.<br></div>
<div>There is no small importance in this, that when he professes that he would
do the <font color="Maroon"><i>will</i></font> of God, he assigns no place to
sacrifices; for we hence conclude that without them there may be a perfect
obedience to God, which could not be true were not the Law annulled. I do not,
however, deny but that David in this place, as well as in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195116&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 51:16, so extenuated
external sacrifices as to prefer to them that which is the main thing; but there
is no doubt but that in both places he cast his eyes on the kingdom of Christ.
And thus the Apostle is a witness, that Christ is justly introduced as the
speaker in this Psalm, in which not even the lowest place among God&#8217;s
commandments is allowed to sacrifices, which God had yet strictly required under
the Law.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>But a body hast thou prepared me,</i></font> etc.
The words of David are different, &#8220;An ear hast thou bored for me,&#8221; a
phrase which some think has been borrowed from an ancient rite or custom of the
Law, (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022106&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 21:6;) for if
any one set no value on the liberty granted at the jubilee, and wished to be
under perpetual servitude, his ear was bored with an awl. The meaning, as they
thinks was this, &#8220;Thou shalt have me, O Lord, as a servant forever.&#8221;
I, however, take another view, regarding it as intimating docility and
obedience; for we are deaf until God opens our ears, that is, until he corrects
the stubbornness that cleaves to us. There is at the same time an implied
contrast between the promiscuous and vulgar mass, (to whom the sacrifices were
like phantoms without any power,) and David, to whom God had discovered their
spiritual and legitimate use and application.<br></div>
<div>But the Apostle followed the Greek translators when he said, &#8220;A body
hast thou prepared;&#8221; for in quoting these words the Apostles were not so
scrupulous, provided they perverted not Scripture to their own purpose. We must
always have a regard to the end for which they quote passages, for they are very
careful as to the main object, so as not to turn Scripture to another meaning;
but as to words and other things, which bear not on the subject in hand, they
use great freedom.<sup><font color="Maroon">F162</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>7.</b><font color="Maroon"><i> In the volume or chapter of the
book,</i></font> etc. Volume is properly the meaning of the Hebrew word; for we
know that books were formerly rolled up in the form of a cylinder. There is also
nothing unreasonable in understanding <font color="Maroon"><i>book</i></font> as
meaning the Law, which prescribes to all God&#8217;s children the rule of a holy
life; though it seems to me a more suitable view to consider him as saying, that
he deemed himself to be in the catalogue of those who render themselves obedient
to God. The Law, indeed, bids us all to obey God; but David means, that he was
numbered among those who are called to obey God; and then he testifies that he
obeyed his vocation, by adding, <font color="Maroon"><i>I come to do thy
will;</i></font> and this peculiarly belongs to Christ. For though all the
saints aspire after the righteousness of God, yet it is Christ alone who was
fully competent to do God&#8217;s will.<br></div>
<div>This passage, however, ought to stimulate us all to render prompt obedience
to God; for Christ is a pattern of perfect obedience for this end, that all who
are his may contend with one another in imitating him, that they may together
respond to the call of God, and that their life may exemplify this saying,
<font color="Maroon"><i>Lo, I come.</i></font> To the same purpose is what
follows, <font color="Maroon"><i>It is written,</i></font> that is, that we
should do the will of God, according to what is said elsewhere, that the end of
our election is, to be holy and unblamable in his sight.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510122&gt;</font></sup>Colossians
1:22.)<br></div>
<div><b>9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>He taketh away,</i></font> etc. See now
why and for what purpose this passage was quoted, even that we may know that the
full and perfect righteousness under the kingdom of Christ stands in no need of
the sacrifices of the Law; for when they are removed, the will of God is set up
as a perfect rule. It hence follows, that the sacrifices of beasts were to be
removed by the priesthood of Christ, as they had nothing in common with it. For
there was no reason, as we have said, for him to reject the sacrifices on
account of an accidental blame; for he is not dealing with hypocrites, nor does
he condemn the superstition of perverted worship; but he denies that the usual
sacrifices are required of a pious man rightly instructed, and he testifies that
without sacrifices God is fully and perfectly obeyed.<br></div>
<div><b>10.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By the which will,</i></font> etc. After
having accommodated to his subject David&#8217;s testimony, he now takes the
occasion to turn some of the words to his own purpose, but more for the sake of
ornament than of explanation. David professed, not so much in his own person as
in that of Christ, that he was ready to do the will of God. This is to be
extended to all the members of Christ; for Paul&#8217;s doctrine is general,
when he says, &#8220;This is the will of God, even your sanctification, that
every one of you abstain from uncleanness&#8221;.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520403&gt;</font></sup>1 Thessalonians 4:3.) But
as it was a supereminent example of obedience in Christ to offer himself to the
death of the cross, and as it was for this especially that he put on the form of
a servant, the Apostle says, that Christ by offering himself fulfilled the
command of his Father, and that we have been thus
<font color="Maroon"><i>sanctified.</i><sup>F163</sup></font> When he
adds<font color="Maroon"><i>, through the offering of the body,</i></font> etc.,
he alludes to that part of the Psalm, where he says, &#8220;A body hast thou
prepared for me,&#8221; at least as it is found in Greek. He thus intimates that
Christ found in himself what could appease God, so that he had no need of
external aids. For if the Levitical priests had a fit body, the sacrifices of
beasts would have been superfluous. But Christ alone was sufficient, and was by
himself capable of performing whatever God required. <br></div>

<div><b>11.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And every priest,</i></font> etc. Here
is the conclusion of the whole argument, &#8212; that the practice of daily
sacrificing is inconsistent with and wholly foreign to the priesthood of Christ;
and that hence after his coming the Levitical priests whose custom and settled
practice was daily to offer, were deposed from their office; for the character
of things which are contrary is, that when one thing is set up, the other falls
to the ground. He has hitherto labored enough, and more than enough, in
defending the priesthood of Christ; the conclusion then is, that the ancient
priesthood, which is inconsistent with this, has ceased; for all the saints find
a full consecration in the one offering of Christ. At the same time the word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tetelei&gt;wken,</font> which I render
&#8220;has consecrated,&#8221; may yet be rendered &#8220;has perfected;&#8221;
but I prefer the former meaning, because he treats here of sacred
things.<sup><font color="Maroon">F164</font></sup><br></div>
<div>By saying, <font color="Maroon"><i>them who are sanctified,</i></font> he
includes all the children of God; and he reminds us that the grace of
sanctification is sought elsewhere in vain.<br></div>
<div>But lest men should imagine that Christ is now idle in heaven, he repeats
again that he <font color="Maroon"><i>sat down at God&#8217;s right
hand;</i></font> by which phrase is denoted, as we have seen elsewhere, his
dominion and power. There is therefore no reason for us to fear, that he will
suffer the efficacy of his death to be destroyed or to lie buried; for he lives
for this end, that by his power he may fill heaven and earth. He then reminds us
in the words of the Psalm how long this state of things is to be, even until
Christ shall lay prostrate all his enemies. If then our faith seeks Christ
sitting on God&#8217;s right hand, and recumbs quietly on him as there sitting,
we shall at length enjoy the fruit of his victory; yea, when our foes, Satan,
sin, death, and the whole world are vanquished, and when corruption of our flesh
is cast off, we shall triumph for ever together with our head.<br></div>
<div><b>15.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>The Holy Ghost also is a
witness,</i></font> etc.<sup><font color="Maroon">F165</font></sup> This
testimony from Jeremiah is not adduced the second time without reason or
superfluously. He quoted it before for a different purpose, even to show that it
was necessary for the Old Testament to be abrogated, because another, a new one,
had been promised, and for this end, to amend the weakness of the
old.<sup><font color="Maroon">F166</font></sup> But he has now another thing in
view; for he takes his stand on these words alone, <font color="Maroon"><i>Their
iniquities will I remember no more;</i></font> and hence he concludes, that
there is no more need of a sacrifice since sins are blotted
out.<sup><font color="Maroon">F167</font></sup><br></div>
<div>This inference may indeed seem not to be well founded; for though formerly
there were innumerable promises as to the remission of sins under the Law and in
the prophets, yet the Church ceased not to offer sacrifices; hence remission of
sins does not exclude sacrifices. But if you consider each particular more
closely, you will find that the fathers also had the same promises as to the
remission of sins, under the Law, as we have at this day; relying on them, they
called on God, and rejoiced in the pardon they obtained. And yet the Prophet, as
though he had adduced something new and unheard of before, promises that there
would be no remembrance of sins before God under the new covenant. Hence we may
conclude, that sins are now remitted in a way different from what they were
formerly; but this difference is not in the promise, nor in faith, but in the
very price by which remissions is procured. God then does not now remember sins,
because an expiation has been made once for all; otherwise what is said by the
Prophet would have been to no purpose, that the benefit of the New Testament was
to be this &#8212; that God would no more remember sins.<br></div>
<div>Now, since we have come to the close of the discussion respecting the
priesthood of Christ, readers must be brief reminded, that the sacrifices of the
Law are not more effectually proved here to have been abolished, than the
sacrifice of the mass practiced by the Papists is proved to be a vain
fiction.<br></div>
<div>They maintain that their mass is a sacrifice for expiating the sins of the
living and of the dead; but the Apostle denies that there is now any place for a
sacrifice, even since the time in which the prophecy of Jeremiah has been
fulfilled.<br></div>
<div>They try to make an evasion by saying, that it is not a new sacrifice, or
different from that of Christ, but the same; on the contrary, the Apostle
contends that the same sacrifice ought not to be repeated, and declares that
Christ&#8217;s sacrifice is only one, and that it was offered for all; and,
further, he often claims for Christ alone the honor of being a priest, so that
no one was fit to offer him but himself alone.<br></div>
<div>The Papists have another evasion, and call their sacrifice bloodless; but
the Apostle affirms it as a truth without exception, that death is necessary in
order to make a sacrifice.<br></div>
<div>The Papists attempt to evade again by saying, that the mass is the
application of the one sacrifice which Christ has made; but the Apostle teaches
us on the contrary, that the sacrifices of the Law were abolished by
Christ&#8217;s death for this reason, because in them a remembrance of sins was
made; it hence appears evident, that this kind of application which they have
devised has ceased.<br></div>
<div>In short, let the Papists twist themselves into any forms they please, they
can never escape from the plain arguments of the Apostle, by which it appears
clear that their mass abounds in impieties; for first, according to the
Apostle&#8217;s testimony, Christ alone was fit to offer himself; in the mass he
is offered by other hands; &#8212; secondly, the Apostle asserts that
Christ&#8217;s sacrifice was not only one, but was also once offered, so that it
is impious to repeat it; but in the mass, however they may prate about the
sacrifice, yet it is evidently made every day, and they themselves confess it;
&#8212; thirdly, the Apostle acknowledges no sacrifice without blood and death;
they then chatter in vain, that the sacrifice they offer is bloodless; &#8212;
fourthly, the Apostle in speaking of obtaining pardon for sins, bids us to flee
to that one sacrifice which Christ offered on the cross, and makes this
distinction between us and the fathers, that the rite of continually sacrificing
was done away by the coming of Christ; but the Papists, in order to make the
death of Christ efficacious, require daily applications by means of a sacrifice;
so that they calling themselves Christians, differ nothing from the Jews except
in the external symbol. <br></div>

<div><b>19.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Having therefore, brethren,</i></font>
etc. He states the conclusion or the sum of his previous doctrine, to which he
then fitly subjoins a serious exhortation, and denounces a severe threatening on
those who had renounced the grace of Christ. Now, the sum of what he had said
is, that all the ceremonies by which an access under the Law was open to the
sanctuary, have their real fulfillment in Christ, so that to him who has Christ,
the use of them is superfluous and useless To set this forth more fully, he
allegorically describes the access which Christ has opened to us; for he
compares heaven to the old sanctuary, and sets forth the things which have been
spiritually accomplished in Christ in typical expressions. Allegories do indeed
sometimes obscure rather than illustrate a subject; but when the Apostle
transfers to Christ the ancient figures of the Law, there is no small elegance
in what he says, and no small light is attained; and he did this, that we may
recognize as now really exhibited in him whatever the Law shadowed forth. But as
there is great weight almost in every word, so we must remember that there is
here to be understood a contrast, &#8212; the truth or reality as seen in
Christ, and the abolition of the ancient types.<br></div>
<div>He says first, that we have <font color="Maroon"><i>boldness to enter into
the holiest.</i></font> This privilege was never granted to the fathers under
the Law, for the people were forbidden to enter the visible sanctuary, though
the high priest bore the names of the tribes on his shoulders, and twelve stones
as a memorial of them on his breast. But now the case is very different, for not
only symbolically, but in reality an entrance into heaven is made open to us
through the favor of Christ, for he has made us a royal
priesthood.<sup><font color="Maroon">F168</font></sup><br></div>
<div>He adds, <font color="Maroon"><i>by the blood of Jesus,</i></font> because
the door of the sanctuary was not opened for the periodical entrance of the high
priest, except through the intervention of blood. But he afterwards marks the
difference between this blood and that of beasts; for the blood of beasts, as it
soon turns to corruption, could not long retain its efficacy; but the blood of
Christ, which is subject to no corruption, but flows ever as a pure stream, is
sufficient for us even to the end of the world. It is no wonder that beasts
slain in sacrifice had no power to quicken, as they were dead; but Christ who
arose from the dead to bestow life on us, communicates his own life to us. It is
a perpetual consecration of the way, because the blood of Christ is always in a
manner distilling before the presence of the Father, in order to irrigate heaven
and earth.<br></div>
<div><b>20.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Through the veil,</i></font> etc. As the
veil covered the recesses of the sanctuary and yet afforded entrance there, so
the divinity, though hid in the flesh of Christ, yet leads us even into heaven;
nor can any one find God except he to whom the man Christ becomes the door and
the way. Thus we are reminded, that Christ&#8217;s glory is not to be estimated
according to the external appearance of his flesh; nor is his flesh to be
despised, because it conceals as a veil the majesty of God, while it is also
that which conducts us to the enjoyment of all the good things of God.<br></div>
<div><b>21.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And having a high priest,</i></font>
etc. Whatever he has previously said of the abrogation of the ancient
priesthood, it behaves us now to bear in mind, for Christ could not be a priest
without having the former priests divested of their office, as it was another
order. He then intimates that all those things which Christ had changed at his
coming ought to be relinquished; and God has set him over his whole house for
this end, &#8212; that every one who seeks a place in the Church, may submit to
Christ and choose him, and no other, as his leader and
ruler.<sup><font color="Maroon">F169</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>22.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Let us draw near with a true
heart,</i></font> etc. As he shows that in Christ and his sacrifice there is
nothing but what is spiritual or heavenly, so he would have what we bring on our
part to correspond. The Jews formerly cleansed themselves by various washings to
prepare themselves for the service of God. It is no wonder that the rites for
cleansing were carnal, since the worship of God itself, involved in shadows, as
yet partook in a manner of what was carnal. For the priest, being a mortal, was
chosen from among sinners to perform for a time sacred things; he was, indeed,
adorned with precious vestments, but yet they were those of this world, that he
might stand in the presence of God; he only came near the work of the covenant;
and to sanctify his entrance, he borrowed for a sacrifice a brute animal either
from herd or the flock. But in Christ all these things are far superior; He
himself is not only pure and innocent, but is also the fountain of all holiness
and righteousness, and was constituted a priest by a heavenly oracle, not for
the short period of a mortal life, but perpetually. To sanction his appointment
an oath was interposed. He came forth adorned with all the gifts of the Holy
Spirit in the highest perfection; he propitiated God by his own blood, and
reconciled him to men; he ascended up above all the heavens to appear before God
as our Mediator.<br></div>
<div>Now, on our part, nothing is to be brought but what corresponds with all
this, as there ought to be a mutual agreement or concord between the priest and
the people. Away then with all the external washings of the flesh, and cease let
the whole apparatus of ceremonies; for the Apostle sets a
<font color="Maroon"><i>true</i></font>
<font color="Maroon"><i>heart,</i></font> and the certainty of faith, and a
cleansing from all vices, in opposition to these external rites. And hence we
learn what must be the frame of our minds in order that we may enjoy the
benefits conferred by Christ; for there is no coming to him without an upright
or a true heart, and a sure faith, and a pure conscience.<br></div>
<div>Now, a <font color="Maroon"><i>true</i></font> or sincere heart is opposed
to a heart that is hypocritical and
deceitful.<sup><font color="Maroon">F170</font></sup> By the term
<font color="Maroon"><i>full assurance,</i></font>
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">plhrofori&gt;a </font>the Apostle points
out the nature of faith, and at the same time reminds us, that the grace of
Christ cannot be received except by those who possess a fixed and unhesitating
conviction. The<font color="Maroon"><i> sprinkling of the heart from an evil
conscience</i></font> takes place, either when we are, by obtaining pardon,
deemed pure before God, or when the heart, cleansed from all corrupt affections,
is not stimulated by the goads of the flesh. I am disposed to include both these
things.<sup><font color="Maroon">F171</font></sup> What follows,
<font color="Maroon"><i>our bodies washed with pure water,</i></font> is
generally understood of baptism; but it seems to me more probable that the
Apostle alludes to the ancient ceremonies of the Law; and so by water he
designates the Spirit of God, according to what is said by Ezekiel, &#8220;I
will sprinkle clean water upon you.&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;263625&gt;</font></sup>Ezekiel 36:25.) The
meaning is, that we are made partakers of Christ, if we come to him, sanctified
in body and soul; and yet that this sanctification is not what consists in a
visible parade of ceremonies, but that it is from faith, pure conscience, and
that cleanness of soul and body which flows from, and is effected by, the Spirit
of God. So Paul exhorts the faithful to cleanse themselves from all filthiness
of flesh and spirit, since they had been adopted by God as his
children.<sup><font color="Maroon">F172</font></sup>
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470701&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians
7:1.)<br></div>
<div><b>23.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Let us hold fast,</i></font> etc. As he
exhorts here the Jews to persevere, he mentions hope rather than faith; for as
hope is born of faith, so it is fed and sustained by it to the last. He requires
also <font color="Maroon"><i>profession</i></font> or confession, for it is not
true faith except it shows itself before men. And he seems indirectly to touch
the dissimulation of those who paid too much attention, in order to please their
own nation, to the ceremonies of the Law. He therefore bids them not only to
believe with the heart, but also to show and to profess how much they honored
Christ.<br></div>
<div>But we ought carefully to notice the reason which he subjoins,
<font color="Maroon"><i>for he is faithful that promised.</i></font> For we
hence first learn, that our faith rests on this foundation, that God is true,
that is, true to his promise, which his word contains; for that we may believe,
the voice or word of God must precede; but it is not every kind of word that is
capable of producing faith; a promise alone is that on which faith recumbs. And
so from this passage we may learn the mutual relation between the faith of men
and the promise of God; for except God promises, no one can
believe.<sup><font color="Maroon">F173</font></sup><br></div>

<div><b>24.</b><font color="Maroon"><i> And let us consider one
another,</i></font> etc. I doubt not but that he addresses the Jews especially
in this exhortation. It is well-known how great was the arrogance of that
nation; being the posterity of Abraham, they boasted that they alone, to the
exclusion of all others, had been chosen by the Lord to inherit the covenant of
eternal life. Inflated by such a privilege, they despised other nations, and
wished to be thought as being alone in the Church of God; nay, they
superciliously arrogated to themselves the name of being The Church. It was
necessary for the Apostles to labor much to correct this pride; and this, in my
judgment, is what the Apostle is doing here, in order that the Jews might not
bear it ill that the Gentiles were associated with them and united as one body
in the Church.<br></div>
<div>And first, indeed, he says, <font color="Maroon"><i>Let us consider one
another;</i></font> for God was then gathering a Church both from the Jews and
from the Gentiles, between whom there had always been a great discord, so that
their union was like the combination of fire and water. Hence the Jews recoiled
from this, for they thought it a great indignity that the Gentiles, should be
made equal with them. To this goad of wicked emulation which pricked them, the
Apostle sets up another in opposition to it, even that of
<font color="Maroon"><i>love;</i></font> or the word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">paroxusmo&lt;v,</font> which he uses,
signifies the ardor of contention. Then that the Jews might not be inflamed with
envy, and be led into contention, the Apostle exhorts them to a godly emulation,
even to stimulate one another to
love.<sup><font color="Maroon">F174</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>25.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Not forsaking the assembling of
ourselves together,</i></font> etc. This confirms the view that has been given.
The composition of the Greek word ought to be noticed; for
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpi&lt;</font>signifies an addition;
then <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpisunagwgh&lt;,</font> assembling
together, means a congregation increased by additions. The wall of partition
having been pulled down, God was then gathering those as his children who had
been aliens from the Church; so the Gentiles were a new and unwonted addition to
the Church. This the Jews regarded as a reproach to them, so that many made a
secession from the Church, thinking that such a mixture afforded them a just
excuse; nor could they be easily induced to surrender their own right; and
further, they considered the right of adoption as peculiar, and as belonging
exclusively to themselves. The Apostle, therefore, warns them, lest this
equality should provoke them to forsake the Church; and that he might not seem
to warn them for no reason, he mentions that this neglect was common to
many.<sup><font color="Maroon">F175</font></sup><br></div>
<div>We now understand the design of the apostle, and what was the necessity
that constrained him to give this exhortation. We may at the same time gather
from this passage a general doctrine:<br></div>
<div>It is an evil which prevails everywhere among mankind, that every one sets
himself above others, and especially that those who seem in anything to excel
cannot well endure their inferiors to be on an equality with themselves. And
then there is so much morosity almost in all, that individuals would gladly make
churches for themselves if they could; for they find it so difficult to
accommodate themselves to the ways and habits of others. The rich envy one
another; and hardly one in a hundred can be found among the rich, who allows to
the poor the name and rank of brethren. Unless similarity of habits or some
allurements or advantages draw us together, it is very difficult even to
maintain a continual concord among ourselves. Extremely needed, therefore, by us
all is the admonition to be stimulated to love and not to envy, and not to
separate from those whom God has joined to us, but to embrace with brotherly
kindness all those who are united to us in faith. And surely it behaves us the
more earnestly to cultivate unity, as the more eagerly watchful Satan is, either
to tear us by any means from the Church, or stealthily to seduce us from it. And
such would be the happy effect, were no one to please himself too much, and were
all of us to preserve this one object, mutually to provoke one another to love,
and to allow no emulation among ourselves, but that of doing &#8220;good
works&#8221;. For doubtless the contempt of the brethren, moroseness, envy,
immoderate estimate of ourselves, and other sinful impulses, clearly show that
our love is either very cold, or does not at all exist.<br></div>
<div>Having said, &#8220;Not forsaking the assembling together,&#8221; he adds,
<font color="Maroon"><i>But exhorting</i></font> one another; by which he
intimates that all the godly ought by all means possible to exert themselves in
the work of gathering together the Church on every side; for we are called by
the Lord on this condition, that every one should afterwards strive to lead
others to the truth, to restore the wandering to the right way, to extend a
helping hand to the fallen, to win over those who are without. But if we ought
to bestow so much labor on those who are yet aliens to the flock of Christ, how
much more diligence is required in exhorting the brethren whom God has already
joined to us?<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>As the manner of some is,</i></font> etc. It hence
appears that the origin of all schisms was, that proud men, despising others,
pleased themselves too much. But when we hear that there were faithless men even
in the age of the Apostles, who departed from the Church, we ought to be less
shocked and disturbed by similar instances of defection which we may see in the
present day. It is indeed no light offense when men who had given some evidence
of piety and professed the same faith with us, fall away from the living God;
but as it is no new thing, we ought, as I have already said, to be less
disturbed by such an event. But the Apostle introduced this clause to show that
he did not speak without a cause, but in order to apply a remedy to a disease
that was making progress.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>And so much the more,</i></font> etc. Some think
this passage to be of the same import with that of Paul,<br></div>
<div align="center"><font color="Navy">&#8220;It is time to awake out of sleep,
for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451311&gt;</font></sup><font color="Navy">Romans
13:11.)</font><br></div>
<div>But I rather think that reference is here made to the last coming of
Christ, the expectation of which ought especially to rouse us to the practice of
a holy life as well as to careful and diligent efforts in the work of gathering
together the Church. For to what end did Christ come except to collect us all
into one body from that dispersion in which we are now wandering? Therefore, the
nearer his coming is, the more we ought to labor that the scattered may be
assembled and united together, that there may be one fold and one shepherd
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431016&gt;</font></sup>John 10:16.)<br></div>
<div>Were any one to ask, how could the Apostle say that those who were as yet
afar off from the manifestation of Christ, saw the day near and just at hand? I
would answer, that from the beginning of the kingdom of Christ the Church was so
constituted that the faithful ought to have considered the Judge as coming soon;
nor were they indeed deceived by a false notion, when they were prepared to
receive Christ almost every moment; for such was the condition of the Church
from the time the Gospel was promulgated, that the whole of that period might
truly and properly be called the last. They then who have been dead many ages
ago lived in the last days no less than we. Laughed at is our simplicity in this
respect by the worldly-wise and scoffers, who deem as fabulous all that we
believe respecting the resurrection of the flesh and the last judgment; but that
our faith may not fail through their mockery, the Holy Spirit reminds us that a
thousand years are before God as one day,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;610308&gt;</font></sup>2 Peter 3:8;) so that
whenever we think of the eternity of the celestial kingdom no time ought to
appear long to us. And further, since Christ, after having completed all things
necessary for our salvation, has ascended into heaven, it is but reasonable that
we who are continually looking for his second manifestation should regard every
day as though it were the last.<sup><font color="Maroon">
F176</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>26.</b><font color="Maroon"><i> For if we sin willfully,</i></font> or
voluntarily etc. He shows how severe a vengeance of God awaits all those who
fall away from the grace of Christ; for being without that one true salvation,
they are now as it were given up to an inevitable destruction. With this
testimony <font color="Maroon"><i>Novatus</i></font> and his sect formerly armed
themselves, in order to take away the hope of pardon from all indiscriminately
who had fallen after baptism. They who were not able to refute his calumny chose
rather to deny the authority of this Epistle than to subscribe to so great an
absurdity. But the true meaning of the passage, unaided by any help from any
other part, is quite sufficient of itself to expose the effrontery of
<font color="Maroon"><i>Novatus</i></font>.<br></div>
<div>Those who <font color="Maroon"><i>sin,</i></font> mentioned by the Apostle,
are not such as offend in any way, but such as forsake the Church, and wholly
alienate themselves from Christ. For he speaks not here of this or of that sin,
but he condemns by name those who willfully renounced fellowship with the
Church. But there is a vast difference between particular fallings and a
complete defection of this kind, by which we entirely fall away from the grace
of Christ. And as this cannot be the case with any one except he has been
already enlightened, he says, <font color="Maroon"><i>If we sin willfully, after
that we have received the knowledge of the truth;</i></font> as though he had
said, &#8220;If we knowingly and willingly renounce the grace which we had
obtained.&#8221; It is now evident how widely apart is this doctrine from the
error of <font color="Maroon"><i>Novatus</i></font>.<br></div>
<div>And that the Apostle here refers only to apostates, is clear from the whole
passage; for what he treats of is this, that those who had been once received
into the Church ought not to forsake it, as some were wont to do. He now
declares that there remained for such no sacrifice for sin, because they had
willfully sinned after having received the knowledge of the truth. But as to
sinners who fall in any other way, Christ offers himself daily to them, so that
they are to seek no other sacrifice for expiating their sins. He denies, then,
that any sacrifice remains for them who renounce the death of Christ, which is
not done by any offense except by a total renunciation of the faith.<br></div>
<div>This severity of God is indeed dreadful, but it is set forth for the
purpose of inspiring terror. He cannot, however, be accused of cruelty; for as
the death of Christ is the only remedy by which we can be delivered from eternal
death, are not they who destroy as far as they can its virtue and benefit worthy
of being left to despair? God invites to daily reconciliation those who abide in
Christ; they are daily washed by the blood of Christ, their sins are daily
expiated by his perpetual sacrifice. As salvation is not to be sought except in
him, there is no need to wonder that all those who willfully forsake him are
deprived of every hope of pardon: this is the import of the adverb
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e]ti,</font> more. But Christ&#8217;s
sacrifice is efficacious to the godly even to death, though they often sin; nay,
it retains ever its efficacy, for this very reason, because they cannot be free
from sin as long as they dwell in the flesh. The Apostle then refers to those
alone who wickedly forsake Christ, and thus deprive themselves of the benefit of
his death.<br></div>
<div>The clause, &#8220;after having received the knowledge of the truth,&#8221;
was added for the purpose of aggravating their ingratitude; for he who willingly
and with deliberate impiety extinguishes the light of God kindled in his heart
has nothing to allege as an excuse before God. Let us then learn not only to
receive with reverence and prompt docility of mind the truth offered to us, but
also firmly to persevere in the knowledge of it, so that we may not suffer the
terrible punishment of those who despise it.<sup><font color="Maroon">
F177</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>27.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But a certain fearful looking
for,</i></font> etc. He means the torment of an evil conscience which the
ungodly feel, who not only have no grace, but who also know that having tasted
grace they have lost it forever through their own fault; such must not only be
pricked and bitten, but also tormented and lacerated in a dreadful manner. Hence
it is that they war rebelliously against God, for they cannot endure so strict a
Judge. They indeed try in every way to remove the sense of God&#8217;s wrath,
but all in vain; for when God allows them a short respite, he soon draws them
before his tribunal, and harasses them with the torments which they especially
shun.<br></div>
<div>He adds, <font color="Maroon"><i>fiery indignation,</i></font> or the heat
of fire; by which he means, as I think, a vehement impulse or a violent ardor.
The word <font color="Maroon"><i>fire</i></font> is a common metaphor; for as
the ungodly are now in a heat through dread of divine wrath, so they shall then
burn through the same feeling. Nor is it unknown to me, that the sophists have
refinedly speculated as to this fire; but I have no regard of their glosses,
since it is evident that it is the same mode of speaking as when Scripture
connects fire with worm.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236624&gt;</font></sup>Isaiah 66:24.) But no man
doubts but that worm is used metaphorically to designate that dreadful torment
of conscience by which the ungodly are
gnawed.<sup><font color="Maroon">F178</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Which shall devour the adversaries.</i></font> It
shall so devour them as to destroy, but not to consume them; for it will be
inextinguishable. And thus he reminds us, that they are all to be counted the
enemies of Christ who have refused to hold the place granted them among the
faithful; for there is no intermediate state, as they who depart from the Church
give themselves up to Satan. <br></div>

<div><b>28.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>He that despised,</i></font> etc. This
is an argument from the less to the greater; for if it was a capital offense to
violate the law of Moses, how much heavier punishment does the rejection of the
gospel deserve, a sin which involves so many and so heinous impieties! This
reasoning was indeed most fitted to impress the Jews; for so severe a punishment
on apostates under the Law was neither new to them, nor could it appear unjustly
rigorous. They ought then to have acknowledged that vengeance just, however
severe, by which God now sanctions the majesty of his
Gospel<sup><font color="Maroon">F179</font></sup>.<br></div>
<div>Hereby is also confirmed what I have already said, that the Apostle speaks
not of particular sins, but of the entire denial of Christ; for the Law did not
punish all kinds of transgressions with death, but apostasy, that is, when any
one wholly renounced religion; for the Apostle referred to a passage in
Deuteronomy 17:2-7,<sup><font color="Maroon">F180</font></sup> where we find,
that if any one violated God&#8217;s covenant by worshipping foreign gods, he
was to be brought outside of the gate and stoned to death.<br></div>
<div>Now, though the Law proceeded from God, and Moses was not its author, but
its minister, yet the Apostle calls it the law of Moses, because it had been
given through him: this was said in order to amplify the more the dignity of the
Gospel, which has been delivered to us by the Son of God.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Under two or three witnesses,</i></font> etc. This
bears not on the present subject; but it was a part of the civil law of Moses
that two or three witnesses were required to prove the accused guilty. However,
we hence learn what sort of crime the Apostle meant; for had not this been
added, an opening would have been left for many false conjectures. But now it is
beyond all dispute that he speaks of apostasy. At the same time that equity
ought to be observed which almost all statesmen have adopted, that no one is to
be condemned without being proved guilty by the testimony of two
witnesses<sup><font color="Maroon">F181</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>29.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Who has trodden under foot the Son of
God,</i></font> etc. There is this likeness between apostates under the Law and
under the Gospel, that both perish without mercy; but the kind of death is
different; for the Apostle denounces on the despisers of Christ not only the
deaths of the body, but eternal perdition. And therefore he says that a sorer
punishment awaits them. And he designates the desertion of Christianity by three
things; for he says that thus the Son of God is trodden under foot, that his
blood is counted an unholy thing, and that despite is done to the Spirit of
grace. Now, it is a more heinous thing to tread under foot than to despise or
reject; and the dignity of Christ is far different from that of Moses; and
further, he does not simply set the Gospel in opposition to the Law, but the
person of Christ and of the Holy Spirit to the person of Moses.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>The blood of the covenant,</i></font> etc. He
enhances ingratitude by a comparison with the benefits. It is the greatest
indignity to count the blood of Christ unholy, by which our holiness is
effected; this is done by those who depart from the faith. For our faith looks
not on the naked doctrine, but on the blood by which our salvation has been
ratified. He calls it the blood of the
<font color="Maroon"><i>covenant</i></font>, because then only were the promises
made sure to us when this pledge was added. But he points out the manner of this
confirmation by saying that we are
<font color="Maroon"><i>sanctified</i></font>; for the blood shed would avail us
nothing, except we were sprinkled with it by the Holy Spirit; and hence come our
expiation and sanctification. The apostle at the same time alludes to the
ancient rite of sprinkling, which availed not to real sanctification, but was
only its shadow or image.<sup><font color="Maroon">F182</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>The Spirit of grace.</i></font> He calls it the
Spirit of grace from the effects produced; for it is by the Spirit and through
his influence that we receive the grace offered to us in Christ. For he it is
who enlightens our minds by faith, who seals the adoption of God on our hearts,
who regenerates us unto newness of life, who grafts us into the body of Christ,
that he may live in us and we in him. He is therefore rightly called the Spirit
of grace, by whom Christ becomes ours with all his blessings. But to do despite
to him, or to treat him with scorn, by whom we are endowed with so many
benefits, is an impiety extremely wicked. Hence learn that all who willfully
render useless his grace, by which they had been favored, act disdainfully
towards the Spirit of God.<br></div>
<div>It is therefore no wonder that God so severely visits blasphemies of this
kind; it is no wonder that he shows himself inexorable towards those who tread
under foot Christ the Mediator, who alone reconciles us to himself; it is no
wonder that he closes up the way of salvation against those who spurn the Holy
Spirit, the only true
guide.<sup><font color="Maroon">F183</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>30.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For we know him that hath
said,</i></font> etc. Both the passages are taken from
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053235&gt;</font></sup>Deuteronomy 32:35, 36. But
as Moses there promises that God would take vengeance for the wrongs done to his
people, it seems that the words are improperly and constrainedly applied to the
vengeance referred to here; for what does the Apostle speak of? Even that the
impiety of those who despised God would not be unpunished. Paul also in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451219&gt;</font></sup>Romans 12:19, knowing the
true sense of the passage, accommodates it to another purpose; for having in
view to exhort us to patience, he bids us to give place to God to take
vengeance, because this office belongs to him; and this he proves by the
testimony of Moses. But there is no reason why we should not turn a special
declaration to a universal truth. Though then the design of Moses was to console
the faithful, as they would have God as the avenger of wrongs done to them; yet
we may always conclude from his words that it is the peculiar office of God to
take vengeance on the ungodly. Nor does he pervert his testimony who hence
proves that the contempt of God will not be unpunished; for he is a righteous
judge who claims to himself the office of taking vengeance.<br></div>
<div>At the same time the Apostle might here also reason from the less to the
greater, and in this manner: &#8220;God says that he will not suffer his people
to be injured with impunity, and declares that he will surely be their avenger:
If he suffers not wrongs done to men to be unpunished, will he not avenge his
own? Has he so little or no care and concern for his own glory, as to connive at
and pass by indignities offered to him?&#8221; But the former view is more
simple and natural, &#8212; that the Apostle only shows that God will not be
mocked with impunity, since it is his peculiar office to render to the ungodly
what they have deserved.<sup><font color="Maroon">F184</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>The Lord shall judge his people.</i></font> Here
another and a greater difficulty arises; for the meaning of Moses seems not to
agree with what here intended. The Apostle seems to have quoted this passage as
though Moses had used the word punish, and not judge; but as it immediately
follows by way of explanation, &#8220;He will be merciful to his saints,&#8221;
it appears evident that to judge here is to act as a governor, according to its
frequent meaning in the Hebrew; but this seems to have little to do with the
present subject. Nevertheless he who weighs well all things will find that this
passage is fitly and suitably adduced here; for God cannot govern the Church
without purifying it, and without restoring to order the confusion that may be
in it. Therefore this governing ought justly to be dreaded by hypocrites, who
will then be punished for usurping a place among the faithful, and for
perfidiously using the sacred name of God, when the master of the family
undertakes himself the care of setting in order his own house. It is in this
sense that God is said to arise to judge his people, that is, when he separates
the truly godly from hypocrites,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;190104&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 1:4;) and in
<font face="Palatino">Psalm 125:5,</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
F184a</font></sup> where the Prophet speaks of exterminating hypocrites, that
they might no more dare to boast that they were of the Church, because God bore
with them; he promises peace to Israel after having executed his
judgment.<br></div>
<div>It was not then unreasonably that the apostle reminded them that God
presided over his Church and omitted nothing necessary for its rightful
government, in order that they might all learn carefully to keep themselves
under his power, and remember that they had to render an account to their
judge.<sup><font color="Maroon">F185</font></sup><br></div>
<div>He hence concludes that <font color="Maroon"><i>it is a fearful thing to
fall into the hands of the living God.</i></font> A mortal man, however incensed
he may be, cannot carry his vengeance beyond death; but God&#8217;s power is not
bounded by so narrow limits; besides, we often escape from men, but we cannot
escape from God&#8217;s judgment. Who soever then considers that he has to do
with God, must (except he be extremely stupid) really tremble and quake; nay,
such an apprehension of God must necessarily absorb the whole man, so that no
sorrows, or torments can be compared with it. In short, whenever our flesh
allures us or we flatter ourselves by any means in our sins, this admonition
alone ought to be sufficient to arouse us, that &#8220;it is a fearful thing to
fall into to hands of the living God;&#8221; for his wrath is furnished with
dreadful punishments which are to be forever.<br></div>
<div>However, the saying of David, when he exclaimed, that it was better to fall
into Gods hands than into the hands of men,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;102414&gt;</font></sup>2 Samuel 24:14,) seems to
be inconsistent with what is said here. But this apparent inconsistency
vanishes, when we consider that David, relying confidently on God&#8217;s mercy,
chose him as his Judge rather than men; for though he knew that God was
displeased with him, yet he felt confident that he would be reconciled to him;
in himself, indeed, he was prostrate on the ground, but yet he was raised up by
the promise of grace. As then he believed God not to be inexorable, there is no
wonder that he dreaded his wrath less, than that of men; but the Apostle here
speaks of God&#8217;s wrath as being dreadful to the reprobate, who being
destitute of the hope of pardon, expect nothing but extreme severity, as they
have already closed up against themselves the door of grace. And we know that
God is set forth in various ways according to the character of those whom he
addresses; and this is what David means when he says, &#8220;With the merciful
thou wilt be merciful, and with the froward thou wilt be froward.&#8221;

<div><b>32.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But call to remembrance,</i></font> etc.
In order to stimulate them, and to rouse their alacrity to go forward, he
reminds them of the evidences of piety which they had previously manifested; for
it is a shameful thing to begin well, and to faint in the middle of our course,
and still more shameful to retrograde after having made great progress. The
remembrance then of past warfare, if it had been carried on faithfully and
diligently under the banner of Christ, is at length useful to us, not as a
pretext for sloth, as though we had already served our time, but to render us
more active in finishing the remaining part of our course. For Christ has not
enlisted us on this condition, that we should after a few years ask for a
discharge like soldiers who have served their time, but that we should pursue
our warfare even to the end.<br></div>
<div>He further strengthens his exhortation by saying, that they had already
performed great exploits at a time when they were as yet new recruits: the more
shame then would it be to them, if now they fainted after having been long
tried; for the word <font color="Maroon"><i>enlightened</i></font> is to be
limited to the time when they first enlisted under Christ, as though he had
said, &#8220;As soon as ye were initiated into the faith of Christ, ye underwent
hard and arduous contests; now practice ought to have rendered you stronger, so
as to become more courageous.&#8221; He, however, at the same time reminds them,
that it was through God&#8217;s favor that they believed, and not through their
own strength; they were enlightened when immersed in darkness and without eyes
to see, except light from above had shone upon them. Whenever then those things
which we have done or suffered for Christ come to our minds, let them be to us
so many goads to stir us on to higher
attainments.<sup><font color="Maroon">F186</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>33.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Partly, whilst ye were made,</i></font>
etc. We see who they were whom he addresses, even those whose faith had been
proved by no common trials, and yet he refrains not from exhorting them to
greater things. Let no man therefore deceive himself by self-flattery as though
he had reached the goal, or had no need of incentives from others.<br></div>
<div>Now he says, that they had been <font color="Maroon"><i>made gazingstocks
both by reproaches and afflictions,</i></font> or exposed to public shame by
reproaches and distresses, as though they were exposed on a public
theater.<sup><font color="Maroon">F187</font></sup> We hence learn that the
persecutions which they had sustained were remarkably severe. But we ought
especially to notice the latter clause, when he says that they became
<font color="Maroon"><i>companions</i></font>, or associates of the godly in
their persecutions; for as it is Christ&#8217;s cause for which all the godly
contend, and as it is what their contend for in common, whatever one of them
suffers, all the rest ought to transfer, as it were, to themselves; and this is
what ought by all means to be done by us, unless we would separate ourselves
from Christ himself.<sup><font color="Maroon">F188</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>34.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And took
joyfully,</i><sup>F189</sup></font> etc. There is no doubt but as they were men
who had feelings, the loss of their goods caused them grief; but yet their
sorrow was such as did not prevent the joy of which the Apostle speaks. As
poverty is deemed an evil, the plunder of their goods considered in itself
touched them with grief; but as they looked higher, they found a cause for joy,
which allayed whatever grief they felt. It is indeed thus necessary that our
thoughts should be drawn away from the world, by looking at the heavenly
recompense; nor do I say any other thing but what all the godly find to be the
case by experience. And no doubt we joyfully embrace what we are persuaded will
end in our salvation; and this persuasion the children of God doubtless have
respecting the conflicts which they undertake for the glory of Christ. Hence
carnal feelings never so prevail in overwhelming them with grief, but that with
their minds raised up to heaven they emerge into spiritual joy.<br></div>
<div>And this is proved by what he subjoins, <font color="Maroon"><i>knowing
that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.</i></font> Joyfully
then did they endure the plundering of their goods, not because they were glad
to find themselves plundered; but as their minds were fixed on the recompense,
they easily forgot the grief occasioned by their present calamity. And indeed
wherever there is a lively perception of heavenly things, the world with all its
allurements is not so relished, that either poverty or shame can overwhelm our
minds with grief. If then we wish to bear anything for Christ with patience and
resigned minds, let us accustom ourselves to a frequent meditation on that
felicity, in comparison with which all the good things of the world are nothing
but refuse. Nor are we to pass by these words, &#8220;knowing that ye
have&#8221;;<sup><font color="Maroon">F190</font></sup> for except one be fully
persuaded that the inheritance which God has promised to his children belongs to
him, all his knowledge will be cold and useless.<br></div>
<div><b>35.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Cast not away, therefore,</i></font>
etc. He shows what especially makes us strong to persevere, even the retaining
of confidence; for when that is lost, we lose the recompense set before us. It
hence appears that confidence is the foundation of a godly and holy life. By
mentioning <font color="Maroon"><i>reward,</i></font> he diminishes nothing from
the gratuitous promise of Salvation; for the faithful know that their labor is
not vain in the Lord in such a way that they still rest on God&#8217;s mercy
alone. But it has been often stated elsewhere how reward is not incompatible
with the gratuitous imputation of righteousness. <br></div>

<div><b>36.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For ye have need of patience,</i></font>
etc. He says that patience is necessary, not only because we have to endure to
the end, but as Satan has innumerable arts by which he harasses us; and hence
except we possess extraordinary patience, we shall a thousand times be broken
down before we come to the half of our course. The inheritance of eternal life
is indeed certain to us, but as life is like a race, we ought to go on towards
the goal. But in our way there are many hindrances and difficulties, which not
only delay us, but which would also stop our course altogether, except we had
great firmness of mind to pass through them. Satan craftily suggests every kind
of trouble in order to discourage us. In short, Christians will never advance
two paces without fainting, except they are sustained by
patience.<sup><font color="Maroon">F191</font></sup> This then is the only way
or means by which we can firmly and constantly advance; we shall not otherwise
obey God, nor even enjoy the promised inheritance, which is here by metonymy
called the &#8220;promise&#8221;.<br></div>
<div><b>37.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For yet a little while,</i></font> or,
for yet a very little time, etc. That it may not be grievous to us to endure, he
reminds us that the time will not be long. There is indeed nothing that avails
more to sustain our minds, should they at any time become faint, than the hope
of a speedy and near termination. As a general holds forth to his soldiers the
prospect that the war will soon end, provided they hold out a little longer; so
the Apostle reminds us that the Lord will shortly come to deliver us from all
evils, provided our minds faint not through want of firmness.<br></div>
<div>And in order that this consolation might have more assurance and authority,
he adduces the testimony of the Prophet Habakkuk.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350204&gt;</font></sup>Habakkuk 2:4.) But as he
follows the Greek version, he departs somewhat from the words of the Prophet. I
will first briefly explain what the Prophet says, and then we shall compare it
with what the Apostle relates here.<br></div>
<div>When the Prophet had spoken of the dreadful overthrow of his own nation,
being terrified by his prophecy, he had nothing to do but to quit as it were the
world, and to betake himself to his watchtower; and his watchtower was the Word
of God, by which he was raised as it were into heaven. Being thus placed in this
station, he was bidden to write a new prophecy, which brought to the godly the
hope of salvation. Yet as men are naturally unreasonable, and are so hasty in
their wishes that they always think God tardy, whatever haste he may make, he
told them that the promise would come without delay; at the same time he added,
&#8220;If it tarries, wait for it.&#8221; By which he meant, that what God
promises will never come so soon, but that it seems to us to tarry, according to
an old proverb, &#8220;Even speed is delay to desire.&#8221; Then follow these
words, &#8220;Behold, his soul that is lifted up is not upright in him; but the
just shall live by his faith.&#8221; By these words he intimates that the
ungodly, however they may be fortified by defenses, should not be able to stand,
for there is no life of security but by faith. Let the unbelieving then fortify
themselves as they please, they can find nothing in the whole world but what is
fading, so that they must ever be subject to trembling; but their faith will
never disappoint the godly, because it rests on God. This is the meaning of the
Prophet.<br></div>
<div>Now the Apostle applies to God what Habakkuk said of the promise; but as
God by fulfilling his promises in a manner shows what he is, as to the subject
itself there is not much difference; nay, the Lord comes whenever he puts forth
his hand to help us. The Apostle follows the Prophet in saying, That it would be
shortly; because God defers not his help longer than it is expedient; for he
does not by delaying time deceive us as men are wont to do; but he knows his own
time which he suffers not to pass by without coming to our aid at the moment
required. Now he says, <font color="Maroon"><i>He that cometh will come, and
will not tarry.</i></font> Here are two clauses: by the first we are taught that
God will come to our aid, for he has promised; and by the second, that he will
do so in due time, not later than he
ought.<sup><font color="Maroon">F192</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>38.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Now the just,</i></font> etc. He means
that patience is born of faith; and this is true, for we shall never be able to
carry on our contests unless we are sustained by faith, even as, on the other
hand, John truly declares, that our victory over the world is by faith.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620504&gt;</font></sup>1 John 5:4.) It is by
faith that we ascend on high; that we leap over all the perils of this present
life, and all its miseries and troubles; that we possess a quiet standing in the
midst of storms and tempests. Then the Apostle announced this truth, that all
who are counted just before God do not live otherwise than by faith. And the
future tense of the verb <font color="Maroon"><i>live,</i></font> betokens the
perpetuity of this life. Let readers consult on this subject
<font face="Palatino">Romans 1:17</font>,<sup><font color="Maroon"> F192a
</font></sup> and <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480311&gt;</font></sup>Galatians
3:11, where this passage is quoted.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>But if any man draw back,</i></font> etc. This is
the rendering of <font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlp[</font> elation, as
used by the Prophet, for the words are, &#8220;Where there shall be elation or
munition, the soul of that man shall not continue right in him.&#8221; The
Apostle gives here the Greek version, which partly agrees with the words of the
Prophet, and partly differs from them. For this drawing back differs but little,
if anything, from that elation or pride with which the ungodly are inflated,
since their refractory opposition to God proceeds from that false confidence
with which they are inebriated; for hence it is that they renounce his authority
and promise themselves a quiet state, free from all evil. They may be said,
then, to draw back, when they set up defenses of this kind, by which they drive
away every fear of God and reverence for his name. And thus by this expression
is intimated the power of faith no less than the character of impiety; for pride
is impiety, because it renders not to God the honor due to him, by rendering man
obedient to him. From self-security, insolence, and contempt, it comes that as
long as it is well with the wicked, they dare, as one has said, to insult the
clouds. But since nothing is more contrary to faith than this drawing back, for
the true character of faith is, that it draws a man unto submission to God when
drawn back by his own sinful nature.<br></div>
<div>The other clause, &#8220;He will not please my soul,&#8221; or as I have
rendered it more fully, &#8220;My soul shall not delight in him,&#8221; is to be
taken as the expression of the Apostle&#8217;s feeling; for it was not his
purpose to quote exactly the words of the Prophet, but only to refer to the
passage to invite readers to a closer examination of
it.<sup><font color="Maroon">F193</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>39.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But we are not of them which draw
back,</i></font> etc. The Apostle made a free use of the Greek version, which
was most suitable to the doctrine which he was discussing; and he now wisely
applies it. He had before warned them, lest by forsaking the Church they should
alienate themselves from the faith and the grace of Christ; he now teaches them
that they had been called for this end, that they might not draw back. And he
again sets faith and drawing back in opposition the one to the other, and also
the preservation of the soul to its perdition.<br></div>
<div>Now let it be noticed that this truth belongs also to us, for we, whom God
has favored with the light of the Gospel, ought to acknowledge that we have been
called in order that we may advance more and more in our obedience to God, and
strive constantly to draw nearer to him. This is the real preservation of the
soul, for by so doing we shall escape eternal perdition. <br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><b>1.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Now faith,</i></font> etc. Whoever made
this the beginning of the eleventh chapter, has unwisely disjointed the context;
for the object of the Apostle was to prove what he had already said -that there
is need of patience.<sup><font color="Maroon">F194</font></sup> He had quoted
the testimony of Habakkuk, who says that the just lives by faith; he now shows
what remained to be proved &#8212; that faith can be no more separated from
patience than from itself. The order then of what he says is this, &#8212;
&#8220;We shall not reach the goal of salvation except we have patience, for the
Prophet declares that the just lives by faith; but faith directs us to things
afar off which we do not as yet enjoy; it then necessarily includes
patience.&#8221; Therefore the minor proposition in the argument is this,
<font color="Maroon"><i>Faith is the substance of things hoped for,</i></font>
etc. It is hence also evident, that greatly mistaken are they who think that an
exact definition of faith is given here; for the Apostle does not speak here of
the whole of what faith is, but selects that part of it which was suitable to
his purpose, even that it has patience ever connected with
it.<sup><font color="Maroon">F195</font></sup> Let us now consider the
words.<br></div>
<div>He calls faith the <font color="Maroon"><i>hypostasis,</i></font> the
substance of things hoped for. We indeed know that what we hope for is not what
we have as it were in hand, but what is as yet hid from us, or at least the
enjoyment of which is delayed to another time. The Apostle now teaches us the
same thing with what we find in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450824&gt;</font></sup>Romans 8:24; where it is
said that what is hoped for is not seen, and hence the inference is drawn, that
it is to be waited for in patience. So the Apostle here reminds us, that faith
regards not present things, but such as are waited for. Nor is this kind of
contradiction without its force and beauty: Faith, he says, is the hypostasis,
the prop, or the foundation on which we plant our foot, &#8212; the prop of
what? Of things absent, which are so far from being really possessed by us, that
they are far beyond the reach of our understanding.<br></div>
<div>The same view is to be taken of the second clause, when he calls faith the
<font color="Maroon"><i>evidence</i></font> or demonstration of things
<font color="Maroon"><i>not seen;</i></font> for demonstration makes things to
appear or to be seen; and it is commonly applied to what is subject to our
senses.<sup><font color="Maroon">F195a</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Then these two things, though apparently inconsistent, do yet perfectly
harmonize when we speak of faith; for the Spirit of God shows to us hidden
things, the knowledge of which cannot reach our senses: Promised to us is
eternal life, but it is promised to the dead; we are assured of a happy
resurrection, but we are as yet involved in corruption; we are pronounced just,
as yet sin dwells in us; we hear that we are happy, but we are as yet in the
midst of many miseries; an abundance of all good things is promised to us, but
still we often hunger and thirst; God proclaims that he will come quickly, but
he seems deaf when we cry to him. What would become of us were we not supported
by hope, and did not our minds emerge out of the midst of darkness above the
world through the light of God&#8217;s word and of his Spirit? Faith, then, is
rightly said to be the subsistence or substance of things which are as yet the
objects of hope and the evidence of things not seen.
<font color="Maroon"><i>Augustine</i></font> sometimes renders evidence
&#8220;conviction,&#8221; which I do not disapprove, for it faithfully expresses
the Apostle&#8217;s meaning: but I prefer &#8220;demonstration,&#8221; as it is
more literal. <br></div>

<div><b>2.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For by it the
elders,</i><sup>F196</sup></font> etc. He handles this subject to the end of the
chapter &#8212; that the fathers obtained salvation and were accepted by God in
no other way than by faith.<br></div>
<div>The Jews indeed had some reasons for paying great deference to the fathers;
but a foolish admiration of the fathers had so prevailed among them, that it
proved a great hindrance to a thorough surrender of themselves to Christ and to
his government. It was occasioned either by ambition or superstition, or by
both. For when they heard that they were the blessed and holy seed of Abraham,
inflated with this distinction they fixed their eyes on men rather than on God.
Then added to this was a false emulation; for they did not consider what was
mainly worthy of imitation in their fathers. It thus happened that they became
attached to the old ceremonies, as though the whole of religion and perfect
holiness consisted in them. This error the Apostle exposes and condemns; and be
shows what was the chief excellency of the fathers, in order that their
posterity might understand how they might become really like them.<br></div>
<div>Let us then bear in mind that the main point and the very hinge on which
the Apostle&#8217;s argument turns is this, &#8212; That all the fathers from
the beginning of the world, were approved by God in no other way than by being
united to him by faith: and this he shows, that the Jews might know that by
faith alone they could be bound together in holy unity with the fathers, and
that as soon as they renounced faith, they became banished from the Church, and
that they were then no longer the legitimate children of Abraham, but a
degenerate race and
bastards.<sup><font color="Maroon">F197</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>3.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Through,</i></font> or by,
<font color="Maroon"><i>faith we understand,</i><sup>F198</sup></font> etc. This
is a most striking proof of the last verse; for we differ nothing from the brute
creation, if we understand not that the world has been created by God. To what
end have men been endued with understanding and reason, except that they might
acknowledge their Creator? But it is by faith alone we know that it was God who
created the world. No wonder then that faith shone forth in the fathers above
all other virtues.<br></div>
<div>But it may be here asked, Why does the Apostle assert that what even
infidels acknowledge is only understood by faith? For the very appearance of
heaven and earth constrains even the ungodly to acknowledge some Maker; and
hence Paul condemns all for ingratitude, because they did not, after having
known God, give him the honor due to him.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450125&gt;</font></sup>Romans 1:25.) And no doubt
religion would not have so prevailed among all nations, had not men&#8217;s
minds been impressed with the convictions that God is the Creator of the world.
It thus then appears that this knowledge which the Apostle ascribes to faith,
exists without faith.<br></div>
<div>To this I reply, &#8212; that though there has been an opinion of this kind
among heathens, that the world was made by God, it was yet very evanescent, for
as soon as they formed a notion of some God, they became instantly vain in their
imaginations, so that they groped in the dark, having in their thoughts a mere
shadow of some uncertain deity, and not the knowledge of the true God. Besides,
as it was only a transient opinion that flit in their minds, it was far from
being anything like knowledge. We may further add, that they assigned to fortune
or chance the supremacy in the government of the world, and they made no mention
of God&#8217;s providence which alone rules everything. Men&#8217;s minds
therefore are wholly blind, so that they see not the light of nature which
shines forth in created things, until being irradiated by God&#8217;s Spirit,
they begin to understand by faith what otherwise they cannot comprehend. Hence
most correctly does the Apostle ascribe such an understanding to faith; for they
who have faith do not entertain a slight opinion as to God being the Creator of
the world, but they have a deep conviction fixed in their minds and behold the
true God. And further, they understand the power of his word, not only as
manifested instantaneously in creating the world, but also as put forth
continually in its preservation; nor is it his power only that they understand,
but also his goodness, and wisdom, and justice. And hence they are led to
worship, love, and honor him.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Not made of things which do appear.</i></font> As
to this clause, all interpreters seem to me to have been mistaken; and the
mistake has arisen from separating the preposition from the participle
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">fai&lt;nome&gt;nwn.</font> They give this
rendering, &#8220;So that visible things were made from things which do not
appear.&#8221; But from such words hardly any sense can be elicited, at least a
very jejune sense; and further, the text does not admit of such a meaning, for
then the words must have been, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejk mh&lt;
fainome&gt;nwn:</font> but the order adopted by the Apostle is different. If,
then, the words were rendered literally, the meaning would be as follows,
&#8212; &#8220;So that they became the visible of things not visible,&#8221; or,
not apparent. Thus the preposition would be joined to the participle to which it
belongs. Besides, the words would then contain a very important truth, &#8212;
that we have in this visible world, a conspicuous image of God; and thus the
same truth is taught here, as in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450120&gt;</font></sup>Romans 1:20, where it is
said, that the invisible things of God are made known to us by the creation of
the world, they being seen in his works. God has given us, throughout the whole
framework of this world, clear evidences of his eternal wisdom, goodness, and
power; and though he is in himself invisible, he in a manner becomes visible to
us in his works.<sup><font color="Maroon">F199</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Correctly then is this world called the mirror of divinity; not that there
is sufficient clearness for man to gain a full knowledge of God, by looking at
the world, but that he has thus so far revealed himself, that the ignorance of
the ungodly is without excuse. Now the faithful, to whom he has given eyes, see
sparks of his glory, as it were, glittering in every created thing. The world
was no doubt made, that it might be the theater of the divine glory.<br></div>
<div><b>4.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith Abel offered,</i></font> etc.
The Apostle&#8217;s object in this chapter is to show, that however excellent
were the works of the saints, it was from faith they derived their value, their
worthiness, and all their excellences; and hence follows what he has already
intimated, that the fathers pleased God by faith alone.<br></div>
<div>Now he commends faith here on two accounts, &#8212; it renders obedience to
God, for it attempts and undertakes nothing, but what is according to the rule
of God&#8217;s word, &#8212; and it relies on God&#8217;s promises, and thus it
gains the value and worth which belongs to works from his grace alone. Hence,
wherever the word faith is found in this chapter, we must bear in mind, that the
Apostle speaks of it, in order that the Jews might regard no other rule than
God&#8217;s word, and might also depend alone on his promises.<br></div>
<div>He says, first, that Abel&#8217;s
<font color="Maroon"><i>sacrifice</i></font> was for no other reason preferable
to that of his brother, except that it was sanctified by
faith:<sup><font color="Maroon">F200</font></sup> for surely the fat of brute
animals did not smell so sweetly, that it could, by its odor, pacify God. The
Scripture indeed shows plainly, why God accepted his sacrifice, for
Moses&#8217;s words are these, &#8220;God had respect to Abel, and to his
gifts.&#8221; It is hence obvious to conclude, that his sacrifice was accepted,
because he himself was graciously accepted. But how did he obtain this favor,
except that his heart was purified by faith.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>God testifying,</i></font> etc. He confirms what I
have already stated, that no works, coming from us can please God, until we
ourselves are received into favor, or to speak more briefly, that no works are
deemed just before God, but those of a just man: for he reasons thus, &#8212;
God bore a testimony to Abel&#8217;s gifts; then he had obtained the praise of
being just before God.<sup><font color="Maroon">F201</font></sup><br></div>
<div>This doctrine is useful, and ought especially to be noticed, as we are not
easily convinced of its truth; for when in any work, anything splendid appears,
we are immediately rapt in admiration, and we think that it cannot possibly be
disapproved of by God: but God, who regards only the inward purity of the heart,
heeds not the outward masks of works. Let us then learn, that no right or good
work can proceed from us, until we are justified before God.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>By it he being dead,</i></font> etc. To faith he
also ascribes this, &#8212; that God testified that Abel was no less the object
of his care after his death, than during his life: for when he says, that though
dead, he still speaketh, he means, as Moses tells us, that God was moved by his
violent death to take vengeance. When, therefore, Abel or his blood is said to
speak, the words are to be understood figuratively. It was yet a singular
evidence of God&#8217;s love towards him, that he had a care for him when he was
dead; and it hence appears, that he was one of God&#8217;s saints, whose death
is precious to him.<sup><font color="Maroon">F202</font></sup><br></div>

<div><b>5.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith Enoch,</i></font> etc. He chose
a few of the most ancient, that he might make a transition to Abraham and his
posterity. He teaches us that through faith, it was that Enoch was
translated.<br></div>
<div>But we ought especially to consider the reason why God in so unusual a
manner removed him from the earth. The event was remarkable, and hence all may
know how dear he was to God. Impiety and all kinds of corruptions then prevailed
everywhere. Had he died as other men, it would have not occurred to any, that he
was thus preserved from the prevailing contagion by God&#8217;s providence; but,
as he was taken away without dying, the hand of God from heaven, removing him as
it were from the fire, was openly manifested. It was not to then an ordinary
honor with which God had favored him. Moses indeed tells us, that he was a
righteous man, and that he walked with God; but as righteousness begins with
faith, it is justly ascribed to his faith, that he pleased
God.<sup><font color="Maroon">F203</font></sup><br></div>
<div>As to the subtle questions which the curious usually moot, it is better to
pass them over, without taking much notice of them. They ask, what became of
these two men, Enoch and Elijah? And then, that they may not appear merely to
ask questions, they imagine that they are reserved for the last days of the
Church, that they may then come forth into the world; and for this purpose the
Revelation of John is referred to. Let us leave this airy philosophy to those
light and vain minds, which cannot be satisfied with what is solid. Let it
suffice us to know, that their translation was a sort of extraordinary death;
nor let us doubt but that they were divested of their mortal and corruptible
flesh, in order that they might, with the other members of Christ, be renewed
into a blessed immortality.<sup><font color="Maroon">F204</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>6.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But without faith,</i></font> etc. What
is said here belongs to all the examples which the Apostle records in this
chapter; but as there is in the passage some measure of obscurity, it is
necessary to examine its meaning more closely.<br></div>
<div>But there is no better interpreter than the Apostle himself. The proof,
then, which he immediately subjoins, may serve as an explanation. The reason he
assigns why no one can please God without faith, is this, &#8212; because no one
will ever come to God, except he believes that God is, and is also convinced
that he is a remunerator to all who seek him. If access then to God is not
opened, but by faith, it follows, that all who are without it, are the objects
of God&#8217;s displeasure. Hence the Apostle shows how faith obtains favor for
us, even because faith is our teacher as to the true worship of God, and makes
us certain as to his goodwill, so that we may not think that we seek him in
vain. These two clauses ought not to be slightly passed over, &#8212; that we
must believe that God is, and that we ought to feel assured that he is not
sought in vain.<sup><font color="Maroon">F205</font></sup><br></div>
<div>It does not indeed seem a great matter, when the Apostle requires us to
believe that God is; but when you more closely consider it, you will find that
there is here a rich, profound, and sublime truth; for though almost all admit
without disputing that God is, yet it is evident, that except the Lord retains
us in the true and certain knowledge of himself, various doubts will ever creep
in, and obliterate every thought of a Divine Being. To this vanity the
disposition of man is no doubt prone, so that to forget God becomes an easy
thing. At the same time the Apostle does not mean, that men ought to feel
assured that there is some God, for he speaks only of the true God; nay, it will
not be sufficient for you to form a notion of any God you please; but you must
understand what sort of Being the true God is; for what will it profit us to
devise and form an idol, and to ascribe to it the glory due to God?<br></div>
<div>We now then perceive what the Apostle means in the first clause; he denies
that we can have an access to God, except we have the truth, that God is deeply
fixed in our hearts, so as not to be led here and there by various
opinions.<br></div>
<div>It is hence evident, that men in vain weary themselves in serving God,
except they observe the right way, and that all religions are not only vain, but
also pernicious, with which the true and certain knowledge of God is not
connected; for all are prohibited from having any access to God, who do not
distinguish and separate him from all idols; in short, there is no religion
except where this truth reigns dominant. But if the true knowledge of God has
its seat in our hearts it will not fail to lead us to honor and fear him; for
God, without his majesty is not really known. Hence arises the desire to serve
him, hence it comes that the whole life is so formed, that he is regarded as the
end in all things<br></div>
<div>The second clause is that we ought to be fully persuaded that God is not
sought in vain; and this persuasion includes the hope of salvation and eternal
life, for no one will be in a suitable state of heart to seek God except a sense
of the divine goodness be deeply felt, so as to look for salvation from him. We
indeed flee from God, or wholly disregard him, when there is no hope of
salvation. But let us bear in mind, that this is what must be really believed,
and not held merely as a matter of opinions; for even the ungodly may sometimes
entertain such a notion, and yet they do not come to God; and for this reason,
because they have not a firm and fixed
faith.<sup><font color="Maroon">F206</font></sup> This then is the other part of
faith by which we obtain favor with God, even when we feel assured that
salvation is laid up for us in him.<br></div>
<div>But many shamefully pervert this clause; for they hence elicit the merits
of works, and the conceit about deserving. And they reason thus: &#8220;We
please God by faith, because we believe him to be a rewarder; then faith has
respect to the merits of works.&#8221; This error cannot be better exposed, than
by considering how God is to be sought; while any one is wandering from the
right way of seeking him,<sup><font color="Maroon">F207</font></sup> he cannot
be said to be engaged in the work. Now Scripture assigns this as the right way,
&#8212; that a man, prostrate in himself, and smitten with the conviction that
he deserves eternal death, and in self-despair, is to flee to Christ as the only
asylum for salvation. Nowhere certainly can we find that we are to bring to God
any merits of works to put us in a state of favor with him. Then he who
understands that this is the only right way of seeking God, will be freed from
every difficulty on the subject; for reward refers not to the worthiness or
value of works but to faith.<br></div>
<div>Thus, these frigid glosses of the Sophists, such as, &#8220;by faith we
please God, for we deserve when we intend to please,&#8221; fall wholly to the
ground. The Apostle&#8217;s object was to carry us much higher, even that
conscience might feel assured that it is not a vain thing to seek God; and this
certainty or assurance far exceeds what we can of ourselves attain, especially
when any one considers his own self. For it is not to be laid down as an
abstract principle, that God is a rewarder to those who seek him; but every one
of us ought individually to apply this doctrine to himself, so that we may know
that we are regarded by God, that he has such a care for our salvation as never
to be wanting to us, that our prayers are heard by him, that he will be to us a
perpetual deliverer. But as none of these things come to us except through
Christ, our faith must ever regard him and cleave to him alone.<br></div>
<div>From these two clauses, we may learn how, and why it is impossible for man
to please God without faith; God justly regards us all as objects of his
displeasure, as we are all by nature under his curse; and we have no remedy in
our own power. It is hence necessary that God should anticipate us by his grace;
and hence it comes, that we are brought to know that God is, and in such a way
that no corrupt superstition can seduce us, and also that we become assured of a
certain salvation from him.<br></div>
<div>Were any one to desire a fuller view of this subject, he should make his
commencement here, &#8212; that we in vain attempt to try anything, except we
look to God; for the only true end of life is to promote his glory; but this can
never be done, unless there be first the true knowledge of him. Yet this is
still but the half of faith, and will profit us but little, except confidence be
added. Hence faith will only then be complete and secure us God&#8217;s favor,
when we shall feel a confidence that we shall not seek him in vain, and thus
entertain the certainty of obtaining salvation from him. But no one, except he
be blinded by presumption, and fascinated by self-love, can feel assured that
God will be a rewarder of his merits. Hence this confidence of which we speak
recumbs not on works, nor on man&#8217;s own worthiness, but on the grace of God
alone; and as grace is nowhere found but in Christ, it is on him alone that
faith ought to be fixed. <br></div>

<div><b>7.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith Noah,</i></font> etc. It was a
wonderful example of magnanimity, that when the whole world were promising
themselves impunity, and securely and unrestrainedly indulging themselves in
sinful pleasures, Noah alone paid regard to Gods vengeance though deferred for a
considerable time, &#8212; that he greatly wearied himself for a hundred and
twenty years in building the ark, &#8212; that he stood unshaken amidst the
scoffs of so many ungodly men, &#8212; that he entertained no doubt but that he
would be safe in the midst of the ruin of the whole world, &#8212; yea, that he
felt sure of life as it were in the grave, even in the ark. It is briefly that I
shall touch on the subject; each one can better for himself weigh all the
circumstances.<br></div>
<div>The Apostle ascribes to faith the praise of so remarkable a fortitude. He
has been hitherto speaking of the fathers who lived in the first age of the
world; but it was a kind of regeneration when Noah and his family emerged from
the deluge. It is hence evident that in all ages men have neither been approved
by God, nor performed anything worthy of praise otherwise than by
faith.<br></div>
<div>Let us now then see what are the things he presents to our consideration in
the case of Noah. They are the following, &#8212; that having been warned of
things to come, but not yet made visible, he feared, &#8212; that he built an
ark, &#8212; that he condemned the world by building it, &#8212; and that he
became the heir of that righteousness which is
faith.<sup><font color="Maroon">F208</font></sup><br></div>
<div>What I have just mentioned is that which especially sets forth the power of
faith; for the Apostle ever reminds us of this truth, that faith is the evidence
of things not seen; and doubtless it is its peculiar office to behold in
God&#8217;s word the things which are hid, and far removed from our senses. When
it was declared to Noah that there would be a deluge after one hundred and
twenty years, first, the length of time might have removed every fear; secondly,
the thing in itself seemed incredible; thirdly, he saw the ungodly heedlessly
indulging in sinful pleasures; and lastly, the terrible announcement of a deluge
might have appeared to him as intended only to terrify men. But Noah attended so
much to God&#8217;s word, that turning away his eyes from the appearance of
things at that time, he feared the destruction which God had threatened, as
though it was present. Hence the faith which he had in God&#8217;s word prepared
him to render obedience to God; and of this he afterwards gave a proof by
building the ark.<br></div>
<div>But here a question is raised. Why does the Apostle make faith the cause of
fear, since it has respect to promises of grace rather than to threatening? For
Paul for this reason calls the Gospel, in which God&#8217;s righteousness is
offered to us for salvation, the word of faith. It seems then to have been
improperly stated, that Noah was by faith led to fear. To this, I reply, that
faith indeed properly springs from promises; it is founded on them, it rests on
them. We hence say that Christ is the real object of faith, for through him our
heavenly Father is reconciled to us, and by him all the promises of salvation
are sealed and confirmed. Yet there is no reason why faith should not look to
God and reverently receive whatever he may say; or if you prefer another way of
stating the subject, it rightly belongs to faith to hear God whenever he speaks,
and unhesitatingly to embrace whatsoever may proceed from his sacred mouth. Thus
far it has regard to commands and threatening, as well as to gratuitous
promises. But as no man is moved as he ought and as much as is needful, to obey
God&#8217;s commands, nor is sufficiently stirred up to deprecate his wrath,
unless he has already laid hold on the promises of grace, so as to acknowledge
him as a kind Father, and the author of salvation, &#8212; hence the Gospel is
called the word of faith, the principal part being stated for the whole; and
thus is set forth the mutual relation that there is between them both. Faith,
then, though its most direct regard is to God&#8217;s promises, yet looks on his
threatening so far as it is necessary for it to be taught to fear and obey
God.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Prepared an ark,</i></font> etc. Here is pointed
out that obedience which flows from faith as water from a fountain. The work of
building the ark was long and laborious. It might have been haltered by the
scoffs of the ungodly, and thus suspended a thousand times; nor is there a doubt
but they mocked and derided the holy man on every side. That he then bore their
wanton insults with an unshaken spirit, is a proof that his resolution to obey
was not of an ordinary kind. But how was it that he so perseveringly obeyed God
except that he had previously rested on the promise which gave him the hope of
deliverance; and in this confidence he persevered even to the last; for he could
not have had the courage willingly to undergo so many toils, nor could he have
been able to overcome so many obstacles, nor could he have stood so firm in his
purpose for so long a time, had he not beforehand possessed this
confidence.<br></div>
<div>It hence appears that faith alone is the teacher of obedience; and we may
on the contrary draw this conclusion, that it is unbelief that prevents us to
obey God. And at this day the unbelief of the world exhibits itself dreadfully
in this way, for there are a very few who obey God.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>By the which he condemned the world,</i></font>
etc. It were strange to say that Noah&#8217;s deliverance condemned the world,
and the context will hardly allow faith to be meant; we must then understand
this of the ark. And he is said on two accounts to have by the ark condemned the
world; for by being so long occupied in building it, he took away every excuse
from the wicked; &#8212; and the event which followed proved how just was the
destruction of the world; for why was the ark made the means of deliverance to
one family, except that the Lord thus spared a righteous man that he should not
perish with the ungodly. Had he then not been preserved, the condemnation of the
world would not have been so apparent. Noah then by obeying God&#8217;s command
condemned by his example the obstinate disobedience of the world: his wonderful
deliverance from the midst of death, was an evidence that the world justly
perished; for God would have doubtless saved it, had it not been unworthy of
salvation<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Of the righteousness which is by faith.</i></font>
This is the last thing in the character of Noah, which the Apostle reminds us to
observe. Moses records that he was a righteous man: history does not expressly
say that the cause and root of his righteousness was faith, but the Apostle
declares that as arising from the facts of the case. And this is not only true,
because no one ever devotes himself really and sincerely to God&#8217;s service,
but he who relies on the promises of his paternal kindness, and feels assured
that his life is approved by him; but also on this account, because the life of
no one, however holy it may be, when tried by the rule of God&#8217;s law, can
please him without pardon being granted. Then righteousness must necessarily
recumb on faith. <br></div>

<div><b>8.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith Abraham,</i></font> etc. He
comes now to Abraham, who is the chief father of God&#8217;s church on earth,
and in whose name the Jews gloried, as though by the distinction of being the
holy race of Abraham alone, they were removed from the common order of men. But
he now reminds them of what they ought to possess as the main thing, that they
might be counted among his children. He therefore calls their attention to
faith, for Abraham himself had no excellency which did not proceed from
faith.<br></div>
<div>He first teaches us that faith was the cause why he immediately obeyed God
when he was commanded to remove from his own country; and then that through the
same faith it was that he went on without wavering, according to what he was
called to do even to the end. By these two things, &#8212; his promptness in
obeying, and his perseverance, was Abraham&#8217;s faith most clearly
proved.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>When he was called,</i></font> etc. The old Latin
translator and Erasmus apply this to his name, which is extremely tame and
frigid. On the contrary, I refer it to the oracle by which he was called from
his own country. He indeed did in this way undergo a voluntary exile, while yet
he did nothing but by God&#8217;s command; and no doubt it is one of the chief
things which belong to faith, not to move a step except God&#8217;s word shows
us the way, and as a lantern gives us light, according to what David says.
(Psalm 119:105.) Let us then learn that it is a thing to be observed through
life, that we are to undertake nothing to which God does not call us.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>To go out into a place,</i><sup>F209</sup></font>
etc. To the command was added a promise, that God would give him a land for an
inheritance. This promise he immediately embraced, and hastened as though he was
sent to take possession of this land. It is a no ordinary trial of faith to give
up what we have in hand, in order to seek what is afar off, and unknown to us.
For when God commanded him to leave his own country, he did not point out the
place where he intended him to live, but left him in suspense and perplexity of
mind: &#8220;go&#8221;, he said, &#8220;into the place that I will show
thee.&#8221; (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011201&gt;</font></sup>Genesis
12:1.) Why did he defer to point out the place, except that his faith might be
more and more exercised? Besides, the love of his native land might not only
have retarded the alacrity of Abraham, but also held him so bound to it, so as
not to quit his home. His faith then was not of an ordinary kind, which thus
broke through all hindrances and carried him where the Lord called him to
go.<br></div>
<div><b>9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith he sojourned,</i></font> etc.
The second particular is, that having entered into the land, he was hardly
received as a stranger and a sojourner. Where was the inheritance which he had
expected? It might have indeed occurred instantly to his mind, that he had been
deceived by God. Still greater was the disappointment, which the Apostle does
not mention, when shortly after a famine drove him from the country, when he was
compelled to flee to the land of Gerar; but the Apostle considered it enough to
say, as a commendation to his faith, that he became a sojourner in the land of
promise; for to be a sojourner seemed contrary to what had been promised. That
Abraham then courageously sustained this trial was an instance of great
fortitude; but it proceeded from faith alone.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>With Isaac and Jacob,</i></font> etc. He does not
mean that they dwelt in the same tent, or lived at the same time; but he makes
Abraham&#8217;s son and grandson his companions, because they sojourned alike in
the inheritance promised to them, and yet failed not in their faith, however
long it was that God delayed the time; for the longer the delay the greater was
the trial; but by setting up the shield of faith they repelled all the assaults
of doubt and unbelief.<sup><font color="Maroon">F210</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>10.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For he looked for,</i></font> etc. He
gives a reason why he ascribes their patience to faith, even because they looked
forward to heaven. This was indeed to see things invisible. It was no doubt a
great thing to cherish in their hearts the assurance given them by God
respecting the possession of the land until it was after some ages realized; yet
as they did not confine their thoughts, no, not to that land, but penetrated
even into heaven, it was still a clearer evidence of their faith.<br></div>
<div>He calls heaven a <font color="Maroon"><i>city that has
foundations,</i></font> because of its perpetuity; for in the world there is
nothing but what is transitory and fading. It may indeed appear strange that he
makes God the Maker of heavens as though he did not also create the earth; to
this I answer, that as in earthly buildings, the hands of men make use of
materials, the workmanship of God is not unfitly set in opposition to them. Now,
whatever is formed by men is like its authors in instability; so also is the
perpetuity of the heavenly life, it corresponds with the nature of God its
founder.<sup><font color="Maroon">F211</font></sup> Moreover, the Apostle
teaches us that all weariness is relieved by expectation, so that we ought never
to be weary in following God.<br></div>
<div><b>11.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Through faith also, Sarah
herself,</i></font> etc. That women may know that this truth belongs to them as
well as to men, he adduces the example of Sarah; which he mentions in preference
to that of others, because she was the mother of all the faithful.<br></div>
<div>But it may seem strange that her faith is commended, who was openly charged
with unbelief; for she laughed at the word of the angel as though it were a
fable; and it was not the laugh of wonder and admiration, for otherwise she
would not have been so severely reproved by the angel. It must indeed be
confessed, that her faith was blended with
unbelief;<sup><font color="Maroon">F212</font></sup> but as she cast aside her
unbelief when reproved, her faith is acknowledged by God and commended. What
then she rejected at first as being incredible, she afterwards as soon as she
heard that it came from God, obediently received.<br></div>
<div>And hence we deduce a useful doctrine, &#8212; that when our faith in some
things wavers or halts, it ceases not to be approved of God, provided we indulge
not the spirit of unbelief. The meaning then is, that the miracle which God
performed when Isaac was born, was the fruit of the faith of Abraham, and of his
wife, by which they laid hold on the power of God.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Because she judged him faithful,</i></font> etc.
These reasons, by which the power and character of faith are set forth, ought to
be carefully noticed. Were any one only to hear that Sarah brought forth a child
through faith, all that is meant would not be conveyed to him, but the
explanation which the Apostle adds removes every obscurity; for he declares that
Sarah&#8217;s faith was this, &#8212; that she counted God to be true to his
word, that is, to what he had promised.<br></div>
<div>There are two clauses to this declaration; for we hence learn first, that
there is no faith without God&#8217;s word, for of his faithfulness we cannot be
convinced, until he has spoken. And this of itself is abundantly sufficient to
confute the fiction of the sophists respecting implicit faith; for we must ever
hold that there is a mutual relation between God&#8217;s word and our faith. But
as faith is founded chiefly, according to what has been already said, on the
benevolence or kindness of God, it is not every word, though coming from his
mouth, that is sufficient; but a promise is necessary as an evidence of his
favor. Hence Sarah is said to have counted God faithful who had promised. True
faith then is that which hears God speaking and rests on his promise.<br></div>
<div><b>12.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Therefore sprang there even of
one,</i></font> etc. He now also reminds the Jews, that it was by faith that
they were the descendants of Abraham; for he was as it were half
dead,<sup><font color="Maroon">F213</font></sup> and Sarah his wife, who had
been barren in the flower of her age, was now sterile, being far advanced in
years. Sooner then might oil be expected to flow from a stone, than a nation to
proceed from them: and yet there sprang from them an innumerable multitude. If
now the Jews are proud of their origin, let them consider what it was. Whatever
they are, everything is doubtless to be ascribed to the faith of Abraham and
Sarah. It hence follows, that they cannot retain and defend the position they
have acquired in any other way than by faith. <br></div>

<div><b>13.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>These all died in faith,</i></font> etc.
He enhances by a comparison the faith of the patriarchs: for when they had only
tasted of the promises, as though fully satisfied with their sweetness, they
despised all that was in the world; and they never forgot the taste of them,
however small it was either in life or in death. 
<sup><font color="Maroon">F215</font></sup><br></div>
<div>At the same time the expression <font color="Maroon"><i>in
faith,</i></font> is differently explained. Some understand simply this that
they died in faith, because in this life they never enjoyed the promised
blessings, as at this day also salvation is hid from us, being hoped for. But I
rather assent to those who think that there is expressed here a difference
between us and the fathers; and I give this explanation, &#8212; &#8220;Though
God gave to the fathers only a taste of that grace which is largely poured on
us, though he showed to them at a distance only an obscure representation of
Christ, who is now set forth to us clearly before our eyes, yet they were
satisfied and never fell away from their faith: how much greater reason then
have we at this day to persevere? If we grow faint, we are doubly
inexcusable&#8221;. It is then an enhancing circumstance, that the fathers had a
distant view of the spiritual kingdom of Christ, while we at this day have so
near a view of it, and that they hailed the promises afar off, while we have
them as it were quite near us; for if they nevertheless persevered even unto
death, what sloth will it be to become wearied in faith, when the Lord sustains
us by so many helps. Were any one to object and say, that they could not have
believed without receiving the promises on which faith is necessarily founded:
to this the answer is, that the expression is to be understood comparatively;
for they were far from that high position to which God has raised us. Hence it
is that though they had the same salvation promised them, yet they had not the
promises so clearly revealed to them as they are to us under the kingdom of
Christ; but they were content to behold them afar
off.<sup><font color="Maroon">F216</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>And confessed that they were strangers,</i></font>
etc. This confession was made by Jacob, when he answered Pharaoh, that the time
of his pilgrimage was short compared with that of his fathers, and full of many
sorrows. (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;014709&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 47:9.)
Since Jacob confessed himself a pilgrim in the land, which had been promised to
him as a perpetual inheritance, it is quite evident that his mind was by no
means fixed on this world, but that he raised it up above the heavens. Hence the
Apostle concludes, that the fathers, by speaking thus, openly showed that they
had a better country in heaven; for as they were pilgrims here, they had a
country and an abiding habitation elsewhere.<br></div>
<div>But if they in spirit amid dark clouds, took a flight into the celestial
country, what ought we to do at this day? For Christ stretches forth his hand to
us, as it were openly, from heaven, to raise us up to himself. If the land of
Canaan did not engross their attention, how much more weaned from things below
ought we to be, who have no promised habitation in this world?<br></div>
<div><b>15.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And truly if they had been
mindful,</i></font> etc. He anticipates an objection that might have been made,
&#8212; that they were strangers because they had left their own country. The
apostle meets this objection, and says, that though they called themselves
strangers, they yet did not think of Mesopotamia; for if they had a desire to
return, they might have done so: but they had willingly banished themselves from
it, nay, they had disowned it, as though it did not belong to them. By another
country, then, they meant, that which is beyond this
world.<sup><font color="Maroon">F217</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>16.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore God is not ashamed,</i></font>
etc. He refers to that passage, &#8220;I am the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;020306&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 3:6.) It is a
singular honor when God makes men illustrious, by attaching his name to them;
and designs thus to have himself distinguished from idols. This privilege, as
the Apostle teaches us, depends also on faith; for when the holy fathers aspired
to a celestial country, God on the other hand counted them as citizens. We are
hence to conclude, that there is no place for us among God&#8217;s children,
except we renounce the world, and that there will be for us no inheritance in
heaven, except we become pilgrims on earth; Moreover, the Apostle justly
concludes from these words, &#8212; &#8220;I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac,
and of Jacob,&#8221; that they were heirs of heaven, since he who thus speaks is
not the God of the dead, but of the living. <br></div>

<div><b>17.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith Abraham,</i></font> etc. He
proceeds with the history of Abraham, and relates the offering up of his son;
and it was a singular instance of firmness, so that there is hardly another like
it to be found. Hence for the sake of enhancing it, he adds,
<font color="Maroon"><i>when he was tempted,</i></font> or tried. Abraham had
indeed already proved what he was, by many trials; yet as this trial surpassed
every other, so the Apostle would have it to be regarded above all his trials.
It is then as though he had said, &#8220;The highest excellency of Abraham was
the sacrificing of his son:&#8221; for God is said to have then in an especial
manner tried him. And yet this act flowed from faith; then Abraham had nothing
more excellent than faith, which brought forth such extraordinary
fruit.<br></div>
<div>The word, <font color="Maroon"><i>tempted</i></font> or tried, means no
other thing than proved. What James says, that we are not tempted by God, is to
be understood differently, (Jas. 1:13;) he means that God does not tempt us to
do evil; for he testifies that this is really done by every man&#8217;s own
lust. At the same time he says not that God does not try our integrity and
obedience, though God does not thus search us, as if he knew not otherwise what
is hid in our hearts; nay, God wants no probation that he may know us; but when
he brings us to the light, that we may by our works show what was before hid, he
is said to try or prove us; and then that which is made openly manifest, is said
to be made known to God. For it is a very usual and frequent mode of speaking in
Scripture, that what is peculiar to men is ascribed to God.<br></div>
<div>The sacrificing of Isaac is to be estimated according to the purpose of the
heart: for it was not owing to Abraham that he did not actually perform what he
was commanded to do. His resolution to obey was then the same, as though he had
actually sacrificed his son.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>And offered up his only-begotten Son,</i></font>
etc. By these various circumstances, the Apostle intended to show, how great and
how severe the trial of Abraham was; and there are still other things related by
Moses, which had the same tendency. Abraham was commanded to take his own son,
his only begotten and beloved son Isaac, to lead to the place, which was
afterwards to be shown to him, and there to sacrifice him with his own hands.
These tender words God seems to have designedly accumulated, that he might
pierce the inmost heart of the holy man, as with so many wounds; and then that
he might more severely try him, he commanded him to go a three-days&#8217;
journey. How sharp, must we think, was his anguish to have continually before
his eyes his own son, whom he had already resolved to put to a bloody death! As
they were coming to the place, Isaac pierced his breast with yet a new wound, by
asking him, &#8220;Where is the victim?&#8221; The death of a son, under any
circumstances, must have been very grievous, a bloody death would have still
caused a greater sorrow; but when he was bidden to slay his own, &#8212; that
indeed must have been too dreadful for a father&#8217;s heart to endure; and he
must have been a thousand times disabled, had not faith raised up his heart
above the world. It is not then without reason, that the apostle records that he
was then <font color="Maroon"><i>tried.</i></font><br></div>
<div>It may, however, be asked, why is Isaac called the only begotten, for
Ishmael was born before him and was still living. To this the answer is, that by
God&#8217;s express command he was driven from the family, so that he was
accounted as one dead, at least, he held no place among Abraham&#8217;s
children.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>And he that received the promises,</i></font> etc.
All the things we have hitherto related, however deeply they must have wounded
the heart of Abraham, yet they were but slight wounds compared with this trial,
when he was commanded, after having received the promises, to slay his son
Isaac; for all the promises were founded on this declaration, &#8220;In Isaac
shall thy seed be called,&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012112&gt;</font></sup>Genesis
21:12;)<sup><font color="Maroon">F218</font></sup> for when this foundation was
taken away, no hope of blessing or of grace remained. Here nothing earthly was
the matter at issue, but the eternal salvation of Abraham, yea, of the whole
world. Into what straits must the holy man have been brought when it came to his
mind, that the hope of eternal life was to be extinguished in the person of his
son? And yet by faith he emerged above all these thoughts, so as to execute what
he was commanded. Since it was a marvelous fortitude to struggle through so many
and so great obstacles, justly is the highest praise awarded to faith, for it
was by faith alone that Abraham continued invincibly.<br></div>
<div>But here arises no small difficulty, How is it that Abraham&#8217;s faith
is praised when it departs from the promise? For as obedience proceeds from
faith, so faith from the promise; then when Abraham was without the promise, his
faith must have necessarily fallen to the ground. But the death of Isaac, as it
has been already said, must have been the death as it were of all the promises;
for Isaac is not to be considered as a common man, but as one who had Christ
included in him. This question, which would have been otherwise difficult to be
solved, the Apostle explains by adding immediately, that Abraham ascribed this
honor to God, that he was able to raise his son again from the dead. He then did
not renounce the promise given to him, but extended its power and its truth
beyond the life of his son; for he did not limit God&#8217;s power to so narrow
bounds as to tie it to Isaac when dead, or to extinguish it. Thus he retained
the promise, because he bound not God&#8217;s power to Isaac&#8217;s life, but
felt persuaded that it would be efficacious in his ashes when dead no less than
in him while alive and breathing.<br></div>
<div><b>19.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>From whence also,</i></font> etc. As
though he said, &#8220;Nor did hope disappoint Abraham, for it was a sort of
resurrection, when his son was so suddenly delivered from the midst of death.
The word<font color="Maroon"><i> figure,</i></font> which is here used, is
variously explained. I take it simply as meaning likeness; for though Isaac did
not really rise from the dead, yet he seemed to have in a manner risen, when he
was suddenly and wonderfully rescued through the unexpected favor of
God.<sup><font color="Maroon">F219</font></sup> However, I do not dislike what
some say, who think that our flesh, which is subject to death, is set forth in
the ram which was substituted for Isaac. I also allow that to be true which some
have taught, that this sacrifice was a representation of Christ. But I have now
to state what the Apostle meant, not what may in truth be said; and the real
meaning here, as I think, is, that Abraham did not receive his Son otherwise
than if he had been restored from death to new life.<br></div>
<div><b>20.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith Isaac,</i></font> etc. It was
also the work of faith to bless as to future things; for when the thing itself
does not exist and the word only appears, faith must necessarily bear rule. But
first we must notice of what avail is the blessing of which he speaks. For to
<font color="Maroon"><i>bless</i></font> often means to pray for a blessing. But
the blessing of Isaac was very different; for it was as it were an introduction
into the possession of the land, which God had promised to him and his
posterity. And yet he had nothing in that land but the right of burial. Then
strange seemed these high titles, &#8220;Let people serve thee, and tribes bow
down to thee,&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012729&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 27:29;) for what
dominion could he have given who himself was hardly a free man? We hence see
that this blessing depended on faith; for Isaac had nothing which he could have
bestowed on his children but the word of God.<br></div>
<div>It may, however, be doubted whether there was any faith in the blessing
given to Esau, as he was a reprobate and rejected by God. The answer is easy,
for faith mainly shone forth, when he distinguished between the two twins born
to him, so that he gave the first place to the younger; for following the oracle
of God, he took away from the firstborn the ordinary right of nature. And on
this depended the condition of the whole nation, that Jacob was chosen by God,
and that this choice was sanctioned by the blessing of the father.<br></div>
<div><b>21.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith Jacob,</i></font> etc. It was
the Apostle&#8217;s object to attribute to faith whatever was worthy of
remembrance in the history of the people: as, however, it would have been
tedious to recount everything, he selected a few things out of many, such at
this. For the tribe of Ephraim was so superior to the rest, that they in a
manner did lie down under its shade; for the Scripture often includes the ten
tribes under this name. And yet Ephraim was the younger of the two sons of
Joseph, and when Jacob blessed him and his brother, they were both young. What
did Jacob observe in the younger, to prefer him to the first born? Nay, when he
did so, his eyes were dim with age, so that he could not see. Nor did he lay his
right hand by chance on the head of Ephraim, but he crossed his hands, so that
he moved his right hand to the left side. Besides, he assigned to them two
portions, as though he was now the Lord of that land, from which famine had
driven him away. There was nothing here agreeable to reason; but faith ruled
supreme. If, then, the Jews wish to be anything, they should glory in nothing
else, but in faith.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>And worshipped on the top,</i></font> etc. This is
one of those places from which we may conclude that the points were not formerly
used by the Hebrews; for the Greek translators could not have made such a
mistake as to put staff here for a bed, if the mode of writing was then the same
as now. No doubt Moses spoke of the head of his couch, when he said
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hfmh &ccedil;ar l[</font> but the Greek
translators rendered the words, &#8220;On the top of his staff&#8221; as though
the last word was written, <font color="Maroon"><i>mathaeh.</i></font> The
Apostle hesitated not to apply to his purpose what was commonly received: he was
indeed writing to the Jews; but they who were dispersed into various countries,
had changed their own language for the Greek. And we know that the Apostles were
not so scrupulous in this respect, as not to accommodate themselves to the
unlearned, who had as yet need of milk; and in this there is no danger, provided
readers are ever brought back to the pure and original text of Scripture. But,
in reality, the difference is but little; for the main thing was, that Jacob
worshipped, which was an evidence of his gratitude. He was therefore led by
faith to submit himself to his
son.<sup><font color="Maroon">F220</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>22.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith Joseph,</i></font> etc. This is
the last thing which Moses records respecting the patriarchs, and it deserves to
be particularly noticed; for wealth, luxuries, and honors, made not the holy man
to forget the promise, nor detained him in Egypt; and this was an evidence of no
small faith. For whence had he so much greatness of mind, as to look down on
whatever was elevated in the world, and to esteem as nothing whatever was
precious in it, except that he had ascended up into heaven. In ordering his
bones to be exported, he had no regard to himself, as though his grave in the
land of Canaan would be sweeter or better than in Egypt; but his only object was
to sharpen the desire of his own nation, that they might more earnestly aspire
after redemption; he wished also to strengthen their faith, so that they might
confidently hope that they would be at length delivered. <br></div>

<div><b>23.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith Moses,</i></font> etc. There
have been others, and those heathens, who from no fear of God, but only from a
desire of propagating an offspring, preserved their own children at the peril of
life; but the Apostle shows that the parents of Moses were inducted to save him
for another reason, even for this, &#8212; that as God had promised to them,
under their oppression, that there would come some time a deliverer, they relied
confidently on that promise, and preferred the safety of the infant to their
own.<br></div>
<div>But he seems to say what is contrary to the character of faith, when he
says that they were induced to do this by the beauty of the child; for we know
that Jesse was reproved, when he brought his sons to Samuel as each excelled in
personal appearance; and doubtless God would not have us to regard what is
externally attractive. To this I answer, that the parents of Moses were not
charmed with beauty, so as to be induced by pity to save him, as the case is
commonly with men; but that there was some mark, as it were, of future
excellency imprinted on the child, which gave promise of something
extraordinary. There is, then, no doubt but that by his very appearance they
were inspired with the hope of an approaching deliverance; for they considered
that the child was destined for the performance of great things.<br></div>
<div>Moreover, it ought to have had a great weight with the Jews, to hear that
Moses, the minister of their redemption, had been in an extraordinary manner
rescued from death by means of faith. We must, however, remark, that the faith
here praised was very weak; for after having disregarded the fear of death, they
ought to have brought up Moses; instead of doing so, they exposed him. It is
hence evident that their faith in a short time not only wavered, but wholly
failed; at least they neglected their duty when they cast forth the infant on
the bank of the river. But it behaves us to be more encouraged when we hear that
their faith, though weak, was yet so approved by God as to secure that life to
Moses, on which depended the deliverance of the Church.<br></div>
<div><b>24.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith Moses, when he was come to
years,</i></font> etc. The example of Moses ought to have been remembered by the
Jews, more than that of any other; for through him they were delivered from
bondage, and the covenant of God was renewed, with them, and the constitution of
the Church established by the publication of the Law. But if faith is to be
considered as the main thing in Moses, it would be very strange and unreasonable
that he should draw them away to anything else. It hence follows that all they
make a poor proficiency in the Law who are not guided by it to faith.<br></div>
<div>Let us now see what the things are for which he commends the faith of
Moses. The first excellency he mentions is, that when grown up, he disregarded
the adoption of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter. He refers to his age, for had he done
this when a boy, it might have been imputed to his levity, or his ignorance; for
as understanding and reason are not strong in children, they heedlessly rush
headlong into any course of life; young people also are often carried here and
there by unreflecting ardor. That we may then know that nothing was done
thoughtlessly, and without a long deliberation, the Apostle says, that he was of
mature age, which is also evident from
history.<sup><font color="Maroon">F221</font></sup><br></div>
<div>But he is said to have disregarded his adoption; for when he visited his
brethren, when he tried to relieve them, when he avenged their wrongs, he fully
proved that he preferred to return to his own nation, rather than to remain in
the king&#8217;s court: it was then the same as a voluntary rejection of it.
This the Apostle ascribes to faith; for it would have been much better for him
to remain in Egypt, had he not been persuaded of the blessing promised to the
race of Abraham; and of this blessing, the only witness was God&#8217;s promise;
for he could see nothing of the kind with his eyes. It hence appears, that he
beheld by faith what was far removed from his sight.<br></div>
<div><b>26</b><font color="Maroon"><b><i>.</i></b><i> Esteeming the reproach of
Christ greater riches,</i></font> etc. This clause ought to be carefully
noticed; for we here learn that we ought to shun as a deadly poison whatever
cannot be enjoyed without offending God; for the
<font color="Maroon"><i>pleasures of sin</i></font> he calls all the allurements
of the world which draw us away from God and our calling. But the comforts of
our earthly life, which we are allowed by pure conscience, and God&#8217;s
permission to enjoy, are not included here. Let us then ever remember that we
ought to know and understand what God allows us. There are indeed some things in
themselves lawful, but the use of which is prohibited to us, owing to
circumstances as to time, place, or other things. Hence as to all the blessings
connected with the present life, what is ever to be regarded is, that they
should be to us helps and aids to follow God and not hindrances. And he calls
these pleasures of sin temporary or for <font color="Maroon"><i>a
time,</i></font> because they soon vanish away together with life
itself.<sup><font color="Maroon">F222</font></sup><br></div>
<div>In opposition to these he sets the <font color="Maroon"><i>reproach of
Christ,</i></font> which all the godly ought willingly to undergo. For those
whom God has chosen, he has also foreordained to be conformed to the image of
his own son; not that he exercises them all by the same kind of reproaches or by
the same cross, but that they are all to be so minded as not to decline to
undertake the cross in common with Christ. Let every one then bear in mind, that
as he is called to this fellowship he is to throw off all hindrances. Nor must
we omit to say, that he reckons among the reproaches of Christ all the
ignominious trials which the faithful have had to endure from the beginning of
the world; for as they were the member of the same body, so they had nothing
different from what we have. As all sorrows are indeed the rewards of sin, so
they are also the fruits of the curse pronounced on the first man: but whatever
wrongs we endure from the ungodly on account of Christ, these he regards as his
own.<sup><font color="Maroon">F223</font></sup> Hence Paul gloried that he made
up what was wanting as to the sufferings of Christ. Were we rightly to consider
this, it would not be so grievous and bitter for us to suffer for
Christ.<br></div>
<div>He also explains more fully what he means in this clause by the
<font color="Maroon"><i>reproach of Christ,</i></font> by what he has previously
declared when he said, that Moses chose to<font color="Maroon"><i> suffer
affliction with the people of God.</i></font> He could not have otherwise avowed
himself as one of God&#8217;s people, except he had made himself a companion to
his own nation in their miseries. Since, then, this is the end, let us not
separate ourselves from the body of the Church: whatever we suffer, let us know
that it is consecrated on account of the head. So on the other hand he calls
those things the <font color="Maroon"><i>treasures of Egypt,</i></font> which no
one can otherwise possess than by renouncing and forsaking the Church.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>For he had respect unto the recompense of the
reward,</i></font> or for he looked to the
remuneration.<sup><font color="Maroon">F224</font></sup> He proves by the
description he gives, that the magnanimity of Moses&#8217; mind was owing to
faith; for he had his eyes fixed on the promise of God. For he could not have
hoped that it would be better for him to be with the people of Israel than with
the Egyptians, had he not trusted in the promise and in nothing else.<br></div>
<div>But if any one hence concludes, that his faith did not recumb on
God&#8217;s mercy alone, because he had respect to the reward; to this I answer,
that the question here is not respecting righteousness or the cause of
salvation, but that the Apostle generally includes what belongs to faith. Then
faith, as to righteousness before God, does not look on reward, but on the
gratuitous goodness of God, not on our works but on Christ alone; but faith,
apart from justification, since it extends generally to every word of God, has
respect to the reward that is promised; yea, by faith we embrace whatever God
promises: but he promises reward to works; then faith lays hold on this. But all
this has no place in free justification, for no reward for works can be hoped
for, except the imputation of gratuitous justification goes before<br></div>
<div><b>27.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith he forsook Egypt,</i></font>
etc. This may be said of his first as well as of his second departure, that is,
when he brought out the people with him. He then indeed left Egypt when he fled
from the house of Pharaoh. Add to this, that his going out is recorded by the
Apostle before he mentions the celebration of the Passover. He seems then to
speak of the flight of Moses; nor is what he adds, that
he<font color="Maroon"><i> feared not the wrath of the king,</i></font> any
objection to this, though Moses himself relates that he was constrained to do so
by fear. For if we look at the beginning of his course he did not fear, that is,
when he avowed himself to be the avenger of his people. However, when I consider
all the circumstances, I am inclined to regard this as his second departure; for
it was then that he bravely disregarded the fierce wrath of the king, being
armed with such power by God&#8217;s Spirit, that he often of his own accord
defied the fury of that wild beast. It was doubtless an instance of the
wonderful strength of faith, that he brought out a multitude untrained for war
and burdened with many incumbrances, and yet hoped that a way would be opened to
him by God&#8217;s hand through innumerable difficulties. He saw a most powerful
king in a furious rage, and he knew that he would not cease till he had tried
his utmost. But as he knew that God had commanded him to depart, he committed
the event to him, nor did he doubt but that he would in due time restrain all
the assaults of the Egyptians.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>As seeing him who is invisible.</i></font> Nay, but
he had seen God in the midst of the burning bush: this then seems to have been
said improperly, and not very suitable to the present subject. I indeed allow,
that Moses was strengthened in his faith by that vision, before he took in hand
the glorious work of delivering the people; but I do not admit that it was such
a view of God, as divested him of his bodily senses, and transferred him beyond
the trials of this world. God at that time only showed him a certain symbol of
his presence; but he was far from seeing God as he is. Now, the Apostle means,
that Moses so endured, as though he was taken up to heaven, and had God only
before his eyes; and as though he had nothing to do with men, was not exposed to
the perils of this world and had no contests with Pharaoh. And yet, it is
certain, that he was surrounded with so many difficulties, that he could not but
think sometimes that God was far away from him, or at least, that the obstinacy
of the king, furnished as it was with so many means of resistance, would at
length overcome him.<br></div>
<div>In short, God appeared to Moses in such a way, as still to leave room for
faith; and Moses, when beset by terrors on every side, turned all his thoughts
to God. He was indeed assisted to do this, by the vision which we have
mentioned; but yet he saw more in God than what that symbol intimated: for he
understood his power, and that absorbed all his fears and dangers. Relying on
God&#8217;s promise, he felt assured that the people, though then oppressed by
the tyranny of the Egyptians, were already, as it were, the lords of the
promised land.<sup><font color="Maroon">F225</font></sup><br></div>
<div>We hence learn, that the true character of faith is to set God always
before our eyes; secondly, that faith beholds higher and more hidden things in
God than what our senses can perceive; and thirdly, that a view of God alone is
sufficient to strengthen our weakness, so that we may become firmer than rocks
to withstand all the assaults of Satan. It hence follows, that the weaker and
the less resolute any one is, the less faith he has. <br></div>

<div><b>28.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Through faith he kept the
Passover,</i></font> etc. This ought to have availed much to commend faith to
the Jews; for they held this first sacrifice of the Passover in the highest
esteem. But, he says, that it was kept by faith, not because the Paschal lamb
was a type of Christ, but because its benefit did not appear, when he sprinkled
the doorposts with blood: when therefore the effect was yet hid, it was
necessarily looked for by faith. Nay, it might have seemed strange, that Moses
should set a few drops of blood, as a remedy, in opposition to God&#8217;s
vengeance; but being satisfied with God&#8217;s word alone, that the people
would be exempt from the scourge that was coming on the Egyptians, he did not
hesitate. Hence the Apostle justly commends his faith in this respect.<br></div>
<div>They who explain that the Passover was by faith celebrated by Moses,
because he had respect to Christ, say indeed what is true; but the Apostle here
records simply his faith, because he acquiesced in God&#8217;s word alone, when
the effect did not appear: therefore out of place here are philosophical
refinements. And the reason why he mentions Moses alone, as celebrating the
Passover, seems to be this, that God through him instituted the
Passover.<sup><font color="Maroon">F226</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>29.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith they passed,</i></font> etc. It
is certain, that many in that multitude were unbelieving; but the Lord granted
to the faith of a few, that the whole multitude should pass through the Red Sea
dry-shod. But in doing the same thing, there was a great difference between the
Israelites and the Egyptians; while the former passed through safely, the latter
coming after them were drowned. Whence was this difference, but that the
Israelites had the word of God, and that the Egyptians were without it. The
argument then derives its force from what happened to the contrary; hence, he
says, that the <font color="Maroon"><i>Egyptians were drowned.</i></font> That
disastrous event was the punishment of their temerity, as on the other hand, the
Israelites were preserved safe, because they relied on God&#8217;s word, and
refused not to march through the midst of the waters.<br></div>
<div><b>30.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith the walls of Jericho
fell,</i></font> etc. As he had before taught us, that the yoke of bondage was
by faith broken asunder, so now he tells us, that by the same faith the people
gained the possession of the promised land. For at their first entrance the city
Jericho stood in their way; it being fortified and almost impregnable, it
impeded any farther progress, and they had no means to assail it. The Lord
commanded all the men-of-war to go round it once every day, and on the seventh
day seven times. It appeared to be a work childish and ridiculous; and yet they
obeyed the divine command; nor did they do so in vain, for success according to
the promise followed. It is evident, that the walls did not fall through the
shout of men, or the sound of trumpets; but because the people believed that the
Lord would do what he had promised.<br></div>
<div>We may also apply this event to our benefit and instruction: for it is not
otherwise, than by faith, that we can be freed from the tyranny of the Devil,
and be brought to liberty; and by the same faith, it is that we can put to
flight our enemies, and that all the strongholds of hell can be
demolished.<br></div>
<div><b>31.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By faith the harlot Rahab,</i></font>
etc. Though at the first view, this example may seem, on account of the meanness
of the person, hardly entitled to notice, and even unworthy of being recorded,
yet it was not unsuitably, nor without reason, adduced by the Apostle. He has
hitherto shown that the Patriarchs, whom the Jews most honored and venerated,
did nothing worthy of praise except through faith; and that all the benefits
conferred on us by God, even the most remarkable, have been the fruits of the
same faith: but he now teaches us, that an alien woman, not only of a humble
condition among her own people, but also a harlot, had been adopted into the
body of the Church through faith.<br></div>
<div>It hence follows, that those who are most exalted, are of no account before
God, unless they have faith; and that, on the other hand, those who are hardly
allowed a place among the profane and the reprobate, are by faith introduced
into the company of angels.<br></div>
<div>Moreover, James also bears testimony to the faith of Rahab, (James 2:25,)
and it may be easily concluded from sacred history, that she was endued with
true faith; for she professed her full persuasion of what God had promised to
the Israelites; and of those whom fear kept from entering the land, she asked
pardon for herself and her friends, as though they were already conquerors; and
in all this, she did not consider men, but God himself. The evidence of her
faith was, that she received the spies at the peril of her life: then, by means
of faith, she escaped safe from the ruin of her own city. She is mentioned as a
<font color="Maroon"><i>harlot,</i></font> in order to amplify the grace of
God.<br></div>
<div>Some, indeed, render <font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hnwz</font> a
hostess, as though she kept a public house, or an inn; but as the word means a
harlot everywhere in Scripture, there is no reason why we should explain it
otherwise in this place. The Rabbis, thinking it strange and disgraceful to
their nation, were it said, that the spies entered into the house of a harlot;
have invented this forced meaning.<sup><font color="Maroon">F227</font></sup>
But such a fear was groundless; for in the history of Joshua, this word, harlot,
is expressly added, in order that we may know that the spies came into the city
Jericho clandestinely, and concealed themselves in a harlot&#8217;s house. At
the same time this must be understood of her past life; for faith is an evidence
of repentance. <br></div>

<div><b>32.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And what shall I say more?</i></font>
etc. As it was to be feared, that by referring to a few examples, he should
appear to confine the praises of faith to a few men; he anticipates this, and
says, that there would be no end if he was to dwell on every instance; for what
he had said of a few extended to the whole Church of God.<br></div>
<div>He first refers to the time that intervened between Joshua and David, when
the Lord raised up judges to govern the people; and such were the four he now
mentions, <font color="Maroon"><i>Gideon, Barak, Samson</i></font>, and
<font color="Maroon"><i>Jephthah.</i></font><br></div>
<div>It seemed indeed strange in <font color="Maroon"><i>Gideon,</i></font> with
three hundred men to attack an immense host of enemies, and to shake pitchers
appeared like a sham alarm. <font color="Maroon"><i>Barak</i></font> was far
inferior to his enemies, and was guided only by the counsel of a woman.
<font color="Maroon"><i>Samson</i></font> was a mere countryman, and had never
used any other arms than the implements of husbandry: what could he do against
such proved conquerors, by whose power the whole people had been subdued? Who
would not at first have condemned the rashness of
<font color="Maroon"><i>Jephthah</i></font>, who avowed himself the avenger of a
people already past hope? But as they all followed the guidance of God, and
being animated by his promise, undertook what was commanded them, they have been
honored with the testimony of the Holy
Spirit.<sup><font color="Maroon">F228</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Then the Apostle ascribes all that was praiseworthy in them to faith;
though there was not one of them whose faith did not
halt.<font color="Maroon"><i> Gideon</i></font> was slower to take up arms than
what he ought to have been; nor did he venture without some hesitation to commit
himself to God. <font color="Maroon"><i>Barak</i></font> at first trembled, so
that he was almost forced by the reproofs of Deborah.
<font color="Maroon"><i>Samson</i></font> being overcome by the blandishments of
a concubine, inconsiderately betrayed the safety of the whole people.
<font color="Maroon"><i>Jephthah</i></font>, hasty in making a foolish vow, and
too obstinate in performing it, marred the finest victory by the cruel death of
his own daughter. Thus, in all the saints, something reprehensible is ever to be
found; yet faith, though halting and imperfect, is still approved by God. There
is, therefore, no reason why the faults we labor under should break us down, or
dishearten us, provided we by faith go on in the race of our calling.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Of David,</i></font> etc. Under David&#8217;s name
he includes all the pious kings, and to them he adds
<font color="Maroon"><i>Samuel</i></font> and the
<font color="Maroon"><i>Prophets.</i></font> He therefore means in short to
teach us, that the kingdom of Judah was founded in faith; and that it stood to
the last by faith. The many victories of David, which he had gained over his
enemies, were commonly known. Known also, was the uprightness of Samuel, and his
consummate wisdom in governing the people. Known too were the great favors
conferred by God on prophets and kings. The Apostle declares that there are none
of these things which ought not to be ascribed to faith.<br></div>
<div>But it is to some only of these innumerable benefits of God that he refers,
in order that the Jews might from them draw a general conclusion, &#8212; that
as the Church has always been preserved by God&#8217;s hand through faith, so at
this day there is no other way by which we may know his kindness towards
us.<br></div>
<div>It was by faith that David so many times returned home as a conqueror; that
Hezekiah recovered from his sickness; that Daniel came forth safe and untouched
from the lions&#8217; den, and that his friends walked in a burning furnace as
cheerfully as on a pleasant meadow. Since all these things were done by faith,
we must feel convinced, that in no other way than by faith is God&#8217;s
goodness and bounty to be communicated to us. And that clause ought especially
to be noticed by us, where it is said that they <font color="Maroon"><i>obtained
the promises</i></font> by faith;<sup><font color="Maroon">F229</font></sup> for
though God continues faithful, were we all unbelieving, yet our unbelief makes
the promises void, that is, ineffectual to us.<br></div>
<div><b>34.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Out of weakness were made
strong,</i></font> etc. Chrysostom refers this to the restoration of the Jews
from exile, in which they were like men without hope; I do not disapprove of its
applications to Hezekiah. We might at the same time extend it wider, that the
Lord, by his hand, raised on high his saints, whenever they were cast down; and
brought help to their weakness, so as to endue them with full strength.

<div><b>35.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Women received,</i></font> etc. He had
already mentioned instances in which God had remunerated the faith of his
servants, he now refers to examples of a different kind, &#8212; that saints,
reduced to extreme miseries, struggled by faith so as to persevere invincible
even to death. These instances at the first view widely differ: some triumphed
gloriously over vanquished enemies, were preserved by the Lord through various
miracles, and were rescued by means new and unusual from the midst of death;
while others were shamefully treated, were despised by almost the whole world,
were consumed by want, were so hated by all as to be compelled to hide
themselves in the coverts of wild beasts, and lastly, were drawn forth to endure
savage and cruel tortures: and these last seemed wholly destitute of God&#8217;s
aid, when he thus exposed them to the pride and the cruelty of the ungodly. They
seem then to have been very differently treated from the former ones; and yet
faith ruled in both, and was alike powerful in both; nay, in the latter its
power shone forth in a much clearer light. For the victory of faith appears more
splendid in the contempt of death than if life were extended to the fifth
generation. It is a more glorious evidence of faith, and worthy of higher
praise, when reproaches, want, and extreme troubles are borne with resignation
and firmness, than when recovery from sickness is miraculously obtained, or any
other benefit from God.<br></div>
<div>The sum of the whole is, that the fortitude of the saints, which has shone
forth in all ages, was the work of faith; for our weakness is such that we are
not capable of overcoming evils, except faith sustains us. But we hence learn,
that all who really trust in God are endued with power sufficient to resist
Satan in whatever way he may assail them, and especially that patience in
enduring evils shall never be wanting to us, if faith be possessed; and that,
therefore, we are proved guilty of unbelief when we faint under persecutions and
the cross. For the nature of faith is the same now as in the days of the holy
fathers whom the Apostle mentions. If, then, we imitate their faith, we shall
never basely break down through sloth or listlessness.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Others were tortured,</i></font> etc. As to this
verb, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejtumpani&gt;sqhsan,</font> I have
followed Erasmus, though others render it &#8220;imprisoned.&#8221; But the
simple meaning is, as I think, that they were stretched on a rack, as the skin
of a drum, which is distended.<sup><font color="Maroon">F230</font></sup> By
saying that they were <font color="Maroon"><i>tempted,</i></font> he seems to
have spoken what was superfluous; and I doubt not but that the likeness of the
words, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpri&gt;sqhsan</font> and
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpeira&lt;sqhsan,</font> was the reason
that the word was added by some unskillful transcriber, and thus crept into the
text, as also Erasmus has
conjectured.<sup><font color="Maroon">F231</font></sup>
By<font color="Maroon"><i> sheepskins</i></font> and
<font color="Maroon"><i>goatskins</i></font> I do not think that tents made of
skins are meant, but the mean and rough clothing of the saints which they put on
when wandering in deserts.<br></div>
<div>Now though they say that Jeremiah was stoned, that Isaiah was sawn asunder,
and though sacred history relates that Elijah, Elisha, and other Prophets,
wandered on mountains and in caves; yet I doubt not but he here points out those
persecutions which Antiochus carried on against God&#8217;s people, and those
which afterwards followed.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Not accepting deliverance,</i></font> etc. Most
fitly does he speak here; for they must have purchased a short lease of life by
denying God; but this would have been a price extremely shameful. That they
might then live forever in heaven, they rejected a life on earth, which would
have cost them, as we have said, so much as the denial of God, and also the
repudiation of their own calling. But we hear what Christ says, that if we seek
to save our lives in this world, we shall lose them for ever. If, therefore, the
real love of a future resurrection dwells in our hearts, it will easily lead us
to the contempt of death. And doubtless we ought to live only so as to live to
God: as soon as we are not permitted to live to God, we ought willingly and not
reluctantly to meet death. Moreover, by this verse the Apostle confirms what he
had said, that the saints overcome all sufferings by faith; for except their
minds had been sustained by the hope of a blessed resurrection, they must have
immediately failed.<sup><font color="Maroon">F232</font></sup><br></div>
<div>We may hence also derive a needful encouragement, by which we may fortify
ourselves in adversities. For we ought not to refuse the Lord&#8217;s favor of
being connected with so many holy men, whom we know to have been exercised and
tried by many sufferings. Here indeed are recorded, not the sufferings of a few
individuals, but the common persecutions of the Church, and those not for one or
two years, but such as continued sometimes from grandfathers even to their
grandchildren. No wonder, then, if it should please God to prove our faith at
this day by similar trials; nor ought we to think that we are forsaken by him,
who, we know, cared for the holy fathers who suffered the same before
us.<sup><font color="Maroon">F233</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>38.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Of whom the world was not
worthy,</i></font> etc. As the holy Prophets wandered as fugitives among wild
beasts, they might have seemed unworthy of being sustained on the earth; for how
was it that they could find no place among men? But the Apostle inverts this
sentiment, and says that the world was not worthy of them; for wherever
God&#8217;s servants come, they bring with them his blessing like the fragrance
of a sweet odor. Thus the house of Potiphar was blessed for Joseph&#8217;s sake,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;013905&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 39:5;) and Sodom
would have been spared had ten righteous men been found in it.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011832&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 18:32.) Though
then the world may cast out God&#8217;s servants as offscourings, it is yet to
be regarded as one of its judgments that it cannot bear them; for there is ever
accompanying them some blessing from God. Whenever the righteous are taken away
from us, let us know that such events are presages of evil to us; for we are
unworthy of having them with us, lest they should perish together with
us.<br></div>
<div>At the same time the godly have abundant reasons for consolation, though
the world may cast them out as offscourings; for they see that the same thing
happened to the prophets, who found more clemency in wild animals than in men.
It was with this thought that Hilary comforted himself when he saw the church
taken possession of by sanguinary tyrants, who then employed the Roman emperor
as their executioner; yea, that holy man then called to mind what the Apostle
here says of the Prophets; &#8212; &#8220;Mountains and forests,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and dungeons and prisons, are safer for me than splendid temples; for the
Prophets, while abiding or buried in these, still prophesied by the Spirit of
God.&#8221; So also ought we to be animated so as boldly to despise the world;
and were it to cast us out, let us know that we go forth from a fatal gulf, and
that God thus provides for our safety, so that we may not sink in the same
destruction.<br></div>
<div><b>39.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And these all,</i></font> etc. This is
an argument from the less to the greater; for if they on whom the light of grace
had not as yet so brightly shone displayed so great a constancy in enduring
evils, what ought the full brightness of the Gospel to produce in us? A small
spark of light led them to heaven; when the sun of righteousness shines over us,
with what pretense can we excuse ourselves if we still cleave to the earth? This
is the real meaning of the
Apostle.<sup><font color="Maroon">F235</font></sup><br></div>
<div>I know that Chrysostom and others have given a different explanation, but
the context clearly shows, that what is intended here is the difference in the
grace which God bestowed on the faithful under the Law, and that which he
bestows on us now. For since a more abundant grace is poured on us, it would be
very strange that we should have less faith in us. He then says that those
fathers who were endued with so remarkable a faith, had not yet so strong
reasons for believing as we have. Immediately after he states the reason,
because God intended to unite us all into one body, and that he distributed a
small portion of grace to them, that he might defer its full perfection to our
time, even to the coming of Christ.<br></div>
<div>And it is a singular evidence of God&#8217;s benevolence towards us, that
though he has shown himself bountifully to his children from the beginning of
the world, he yet has so distributed his grace as to provide for the well-being
of the whole body. What more could any of us desire, than that in all the
blessings which God bestowed on Abraham, Moses, David, and all the Patriarchs,
on the Prophets and godly kings, he should have a regard for us, so that we
might be united together with them in the body of Christ? Let us then know that
we are doubly and treble ungrateful to God, if less faith appears in us under
the kingdom of Christ than the fathers had under the Law, as proved by so many
remarkable examples of patience. By the words, that they received not the
promise, is to be understood its ultimate fulfillment, which took place in
Christ, on which subject something has been said already. <br></div>

<div><b>1.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore, seeing we also,</i></font>
etc. This conclusion is, as it were, an epilogue to the former chapter, by which
he shows the end for which he gave a catalogue of the saints who excelled in
faith under the Law, even that every one should be prepared to imitate them; and
he calls a large multitude metaphorically a
<font color="Maroon"><i>cloud,</i></font> for he sets what is dense in
opposition to what is thinly
scattered.<sup><font color="Maroon">F236</font></sup> Had they been a few in
number, yet they ought to have roused us by their example; but as they were a
vast throng, they ought more powerfully to stimulate us.<br></div>
<div>He says that we are so surrounded by this dense throng, that wherever we
turn our eyes many examples of faith immediately meet us. The word
<font color="Maroon"><i>witnesses</i></font> I do not take in a general sense,
as though he called them the martyrs of God, and I apply it to the case before
us, as though he had said that faith is sufficiently proved by their testimony,
so that no doubt ought to be entertained; for the virtues of the saints are so
many testimonies to confirm us, that we, relying on them as our guides and
associates, ought to go onward to God with more alacrity.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Let us lay aside every weight,</i></font> or every
burden, etc. As he refers to the likeness of a race, he bids us to be lightly
equipped; for nothing more prevents haste than to be encumbered with burdens.
Now there are various burdens which delay and impede our spiritual course, such
as the love of this present life, the pleasures of the world, the lusts of the
flesh, worldly cares, riches also and honors, and other things of this kind.
Whosoever, then, would run in the course prescribed by Christ, must first
disentangle himself from all these impediments, for we are already of ourselves
more tardy than we ought to be, so no other causes of delay should be
added.<br></div>
<div>We are not however bidden to cast away riches or other blessings of this
life, except so far as they retard our course for Satan by these as by toils
retains and impedes us.<br></div>
<div>Now, the metaphor of a race is often to be found in Scripture; but here it
means not any kind of race, but a running contest, which is wont to call forth
the greatest exertions. The import of what is said then is, that we are engaged
in a contest, even in a race the most celebrated, that many witnesses stand
around us, that the Son of God is the umpire who invites and exhorts us to
secure the prize, and that therefore it would be most disgraceful for us to grow
weary or inactive in the midst of our course. And at the same time the holy men
whom he mentioned, are not only witnesses, but have been associates in the same
race, who have beforehand shown the way to us; and yet he preferred calling them
witnesses rather than runners, in order to intimate that they are not rivals,
seeking to snatch from us the prize, but approves to applaud and hail our
victory; and Christ also is not only the umpire, but also extends his hand to
us, and supplies us with strength and energy; in short, he prepares and fits us
to enter on our course, and by his power leads us on to the end of the
race.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>And the sin which does so easily beset
us,</i></font> or, stand around us, etc. This is the heaviest burden that
impedes us. And he says that we are entangled, in order that we may know, that
no one is fit to run except he has stripped off all toils and snares. He speaks
not of outward, or, as they say, of actual sin, but of the very fountain, even
concupiscence or lust, which so possesses every part of us, that we feel that we
are on every side held by its
snares.<sup><font color="Maroon">F237</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Let us run with patience,</i></font> etc. By this
word <font color="Maroon"><i>patience,</i></font> we are ever reminded of what
the Apostle meant to be mainly regarded in faith, even that we are in spirit to
seek the kingdom of God, which is invisible to the flesh, and exceeds all that
our minds can comprehend; for they who are occupied in meditating on this
kingdom can easily disregard all earthly things. He thus could not more
effectually withdraw the Jews from their ceremonies, than by calling their
attention to the real exercises of faith, by which they might learn that
Christ&#8217;s kingdom is spiritual, and far superior to the elements of the
world.<br></div>
<div><b>2.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Who for the joy that was set before
him,</i></font> etc. Though the expression in Latin is somewhat ambiguous, yet
according to the words in Greek the Apostle&#8217;s meaning is quite clear; for
he intimates, that though it was free to Christ to exempt himself from all
trouble and to lead a happy life, abounding in all good things, he yet underwent
a death that was bitter, and in every way ignominious. For the expression,
<font color="Maroon"><i>for joy,</i></font> is the same as, instead of joy; and
joy includes every kind of enjoyment. And he says, <font color="Maroon"><i>set
before him,</i></font> because the power of availing himself of this joy was
possessed by Christ, had it so pleased him. At the same time if any one thinks
that the preposition <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnti&lt;</font>
denotes the final cause, I do not much object; then the meaning would be, that
Christ refused not the death of the cross, because he saw its blessed issue. I
still prefer the former
exposition.<sup><font color="Maroon">F238</font></sup><br></div>
<div>But he commends to us the patience of Christ on two accounts, because he
endured a most bitter death, and because he despised shame. He then mentions the
glorious end of his death, that the faithful might know that all the evils which
they may endure will end in their salvation and glory, provided they follow
Christ. So also says James, &#8220;Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and ye
know the end.&#8221; (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;590511&gt;</font></sup>James
5:11.) Then the Apostle means that the end of our sufferings will be the same
with those of Christ, according to what is said by Paul, &#8220;If we suffer
with him, we shall also reign together.&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450817&gt;</font></sup>Romans 8:17.)<br></div>
<div><b>3.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For consider him,</i></font> etc. He
enforces his exhortation by comparing Christ with us; for if the Son of God,
whom it behaves all to adore, willingly underwent such severe conflicts, who of
us should dare to refuse to submit with him to the same? For this one thought
alone ought to be sufficient to conquer all temptations, that is, when we know
that we are companions or associates of the Son of God, and that he, who was so
far above us, willingly came down to our condition, in order that he might
animate us by his own example; yea, it is thus that we gather courage, which
would otherwise melt away, and turn as it were into despair. <br></div>

<div><b>4.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Ye have not yet, resisted unto
blood,</i></font> etc. He proceeds farther, for he reminds us, that even when
the ungodly persecute us for Christ&#8217;s sake, we are then contending against
sin. Into this contest Christ could not enter, for he was pure and free from all
sin; in this respect, however, we are unlike him, for sin always dwells in us,
and afflictions serve to subdue and put it to flight.<br></div>
<div>In the first place we know that all the evils which are in the world, and
especially death, proceed from sin; but this is not what the Apostle treats of;
he only teaches us, that the persecutions which we endure for the Gospel&#8217;s
sake, are on another account useful to us, even because they are remedies to
destroy sin; for in this way God keeps us under the yoke of his discipline, lest
our flesh should become wanton; he sometimes also thus checks the impetuous, and
sometimes punishes our sins, that we may in future be more cautious. Whether
then he applies remedies to our sins, or anticipates us before we sin, he thus
exercises us in the conflict with sin, referred to by the Apostle. With this
honor indeed the Son of God favors us, that he by no means regards what we
suffer for his Gospel as a punishment for sin. It behooves us still to
acknowledge what we hear from the Apostle in this place, that we so plead and
defend the cause of Christ against the ungodly, that at the same time we are
carrying on war with sin, our intestine enemy. Thus God&#8217;s grace towards us
is twofold &#8212; the remedies he applies to heal our vices, he employs for the
purpose of defending his
gospel.<sup><font color="Maroon">F239</font></sup><br></div>
<div>But let us bear in mind whom he is here addressing, even those who had
joyfully suffered the loss of their goods and had endured many reproaches; and
yet he charges them with sloth, because they were fainting half way in the
contest, and were not going on strenuously to the end. There is therefore no
reason for us to ask a discharge from the Lord, whatever service we may have
performed; for Christ will have no discharged soldiers, but those who have
conquered death itself.<br></div>
<div><b>5.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And ye have forgotten,</i></font> etc. I
read the words as a question; for he asks, whether they had forgotten,
intimating that it was not yet time to forget. But he enters here on the
doctrine, that it is useful and needful for us to be disciplined by the cross;
and he refers to the testimony of Solomon, which includes two parts; the first
is, that we are not to reject the Lord&#8217;s correction; and in the second the
reason is given, because the Lord loves those whom he
chastises.<sup><font color="Maroon">F240</font></sup> But as Solomon thus
begins, my &#8220;Son&#8221;, the Apostle reminds us that we ought to be allured
by so sweet and kind a word, as that this exhortation should wholly penetrate
into our hearts.<sup><font color="Maroon">F241</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Now Solomon&#8217;s argument is this: &#8212; If the scourges of God
testify his love towards us, it is a shame that they should be regarded with
dislike or hatred. For they who bear not to be chastised by God for their own
salvation, yea, who reject a proof of his paternal kindness, must be extremely
ungrateful.<br></div>
<div><b>6.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For whom the Lord loveth,</i></font> etc.
This seems not to be a well-founded reason; for God visits the elect as well as
the reprobate indiscriminately, and his scourges manifest his wrath oftener than
his love; and so the Scripture speaks, and experience confirms. But yet it is no
wonder that when the godly are addressed, the effect of chastisements which they
feel, is alone referred to. For however severe and angry a judge God may show
himself towards the reprobate, whenever he punishes them; yet he has no other
end in view as to the elect, but to promote their salvation; it is a
demonstration of his paternal love. Besides, the reprobate, as they know not
that they are governed by God&#8217;s hand, for the most part think that
afflictions come by chance. As when a perverse youth, leaving his father&#8217;s
house, wanders far away and becomes exhausted with hunger, cold, and other
evils, he indeed suffers a just punishment for his folly, and learns by his
sufferings the benefit of being obedient and submissive to his father, but yet
he does not acknowledge this as a paternal chastisement; so is the case with the
ungodly, who having in a manner removed themselves from God and his family, do
not understand that God&#8217;s hand reaches to them.<br></div>
<div>Let us then remember that the taste of God&#8217;s love towards us cannot
be had by us under chastisements, except we be fully persuaded that they are
fatherly scourges by which he chastises us for our sins. No such thing can occur
to the minds of the reprobate, for they are like fugitives. It may also be
added, that judgment must begin at God&#8217;s house; though, then, he may
strike aliens and domestics alike, he yet so puts forth his hand as to the
latter as to show that they are the objects of his peculiar care. But the
previous one is the true solution, even that every one who knows and is
persuaded that he is chastised by God, must immediately be led to this thought,
that he is chastised because he is loved by God. For when the faithful see that
God interposes in their punishment, they perceive a sure pledge of his love, for
unless he loved them he would not be solicitous about their salvation. Hence the
Apostle concludes that God is offered as a Father to all who endure correction.
For they who kick like restive horses, or obstinately resist, do not belong to
this class of men. In a word, then, he teaches us that God&#8217;s corrections
are then only paternal, when we obediently submit to
him.<sup><font color="Maroon">F242</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>7.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For what son is he,</i></font> etc. He
reasons from the common practice of men, that it is by no means right or meet
that God&#8217;s children should be exempt from the discipline of the cross; for
if no one is to be found among us, at least no prudent man and of a sound
judgment, who does not correct his children &#8212; for without discipline they
cannot be led to a right conduct &#8212; how much less will God neglect so
necessary a remedy, who is the best and the wisest Father?<br></div>
<div>If any one raises an objection, and says that corrections of this kind
cease among men as soon as children arrive at manhood: to this I answer, that as
long as we live we are with regard to God no more than children, and that this
is the reason why the rod should ever be applied to our backs. Hence the Apostle
justly infers, that all who seek exemption from the cross do as it were withdraw
themselves from the number of his children.<br></div>
<div>It hence follows that the benefit of adoption is not valued by us as it
ought to be, and that the grace of God is wholly rejected when we seek to
withdraw ourselves from his scourges; and this is what all they do who bear not
their afflictions with patience. But why does he call those who refuse
correction <font color="Maroon"><i>bastards</i></font> rather than aliens? Even
because he was addressing those who were members of the Church, and were on this
account the children of God. He therefore intimates that the profession of
Christ would be false and deceitful if they withdrew themselves from the
discipline of the Father, and that they would thus become bastards, and be no
more children.<sup><font color="Maroon">F243</font></sup><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><b>9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Furthermore, we have had fathers of our
flesh,</i></font> etc. This comparison has several parts: the first is, that if
we showed so much reverence to the fathers from whom we have descended according
to the flesh, as to submit to their discipline, much more honor is due to God
who is our spiritual Father; another is, that the discipline which fathers use
as to their children is only useful for the present life, but that God looks
farther, having in view to prepare us for an eternal life; and the third is,
that men chastise their children as it seems good to them, but that God
regulates his discipline in the best manner, and with perfect wisdom, so that
there is nothing in it but what is duly ordered. He then, in the first place,
makes this difference between God and men, that they are the fathers of the
flesh, but he of the spirit; and on this difference he enlarges by comparing the
flesh with the spirit.<br></div>
<div>But it may be asked, Is not God the Father also of our flesh? For it is not
without reason that Job mentions the creation of men as one of the chief
miracles of God: hence on this account also he is justly entitled to the name of
Father. Were we to say that he is called the Father of spirits, because he alone
creates and regenerates our souls without the aid of man, it might be said again
that Paul glories in being the spiritual father of those whom he had begotten in
Christ by the Gospel. To these things I reply, that God is the Father of the
body as well as of the soul, and, properly speaking, he is indeed the only true
Father; and that this name is only as it were by way of concession applied to
men, both in regard of the body and of the soul. As, however, in creating souls,
he does use the instrumentality of men, and as he renews them in a wonderful
manner by the power of the Spirit, he is peculiarly called, by way of eminence,
the Father of spirits.<sup><font color="Maroon">F244</font></sup><br></div>
<div>When he says, <font color="Maroon"><i>and we gave them
reverence,</i></font> he refers to a feeling implanted in us by nature, so that
we honor parents even when they treat us harshly. By saying,
<font color="Maroon"><i>in subjection to the Father of spirits,</i></font> he
intimates that it is but just to concede to God the authority he has over us by
the right of a Father. By saying, <font color="Maroon"><i>and live,</i></font>
he points out the cause or the end, for the conjunction &#8220;and&#8221; is to
be rendered <font color="Maroon"><i>that,</i></font> &#8212; &#8220;that we may
live.&#8221; Now we are reminded by this word
<font color="Maroon"><i>live,</i></font> that there is nothing more ruinous to
us than to refuse to surrender ourselves in obedience to God.<br></div>
<div><b>10.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For they verily for a few
days,</i></font> etc. The second amplification of the subject, as I have said,
is that God&#8217;s chastisements are appointed to subdue and mortify our flesh,
so that we may be renewed for a celestial life. It hence appears that the fruit
or benefit is to be perpetual; but such a benefit cannot be expected from men,
since their discipline refers to civil life, and therefore properly belongs to
the present world. It hence follows that these chastisements bring far greater
benefit, as the spiritual holiness conferred by God far exceeds the advantages
which belong to the body.<br></div>
<div>Were any one to object and say, that it is the duty of parents to instruct
their children in the fear and worship of God, and that therefore their
discipline seems not to be confined to so short a time; to this the answer is,
that this is indeed true, but the Apostle speaks here of domestic life, as we
are wont commonly to speak of civil government; for though it belongs to
magistrates to defend religion, yet we say that their office is confined to the
limits of this life, for otherwise the civil and earthly government cannot be
distinguished from the spiritual kingdom of Christ.<br></div>
<div>Moreover when God&#8217;s <font color="Maroon"><i>chastisements</i></font>
are said to be profitable to make men <font color="Maroon"><i>partners of his
holiness,</i></font> this is not to be so taken as though they made us really
holy, but that they are helps to sanctify us, for by them the Lord exercises us
in the work of mortifying the flesh.<br></div>
<div><b>11.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Now no chastening,</i></font> etc. This
he adds, lest we should measure God&#8217;s chastisements by our present
feelings; for he shows that we are like children who dread the rod and shun it
as much as they can, for owing to their age they cannot yet judge how useful it
may be to them. The object, then, of this admonition is, that chastisements
cannot be estimated aright if judged according to what the flesh feels under
them, and that therefore we must fix our eyes on the end: we shall thus receive
the <font color="Maroon"><i>peaceable fruit of righteousness.</i></font> And by
the <font color="Maroon"><i>fruit of righteousness</i></font> he means the fear
of the Lord and a godly and holy life, of which the cross is the teacher. He
calls it<font color="Maroon"><i> peaceable,</i></font> because in adversities we
are alarmed and disquieted, being tempted by impatience, which is always noisy
and restless; but being chastened, we acknowledge with a resigned mind how
profitable did that become to us which before seemed bitter and
grievous.<sup><font color="Maroon">F245</font></sup><br></div>

After having taught us that God regards our salvation when he chastises us, he
then exhorts us to exert ourselves vigorously; for nothing will more weaken us
and more fully discourage us than through the influence of a false notion to
have no taste of God&#8217;s grace in adversities. There is, therefore, nothing
more efficacious to raise us up than the intimation that God is present with us,
even when he afflicts us, and is solicitous about our welfare. But in these
words he not only exhorts us to bear afflictions with courage, but also reminds
us that there is no reason for us to be supine and slothful in performing our
duties; for we find more than we ought by experience how much the fear of the
cross prevents us to serve God as it behooves us. Many would be willing to
profess their faith, but as they fear persecution, hands and feet are wanting to
that pious feeling of the mind. Many would be ready to contend for God&#8217;s
glory, to defend what is good and just in private and in public, and to do their
duties to God and their brethren; but as danger arises from the hatred of the
wicked, as they see that troubles, and those many, are prepared for them, they
rest idly with their hands as it were folded.<br></div>
<div>Were then this extreme fear of the cross removed, and were we prepared for
endurance, there would be nothing in us not fitted and adapted for the work of
doing God&#8217;s will. This, then, is what the Apostle means here, &#8220;You
have your hands,&#8221; he says, &#8220;hanging down and your knees feeble,
because ye know not what real consolation there is in adversity; hence ye are
slow to do your duty: but now as I have shown how useful to you is the
discipline of the cross, this doctrine ought to put new vigor in all your
members, so that you may be ready and prompt, both with your hands and feet, to
follow the call of God.&#8221; Moreover, he seems to allude to a passage in
Isaiah, (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;233503&gt;</font></sup>Isaiah 35:3;) and
there the Prophet commands godly teachers to strengthen trembling knees and weak
hands by giving them the hope of favor; but the Apostle bids all the faithful to
do this; for since this is the benefit of the consolation which God offers to
us, then as it is the office of a teacher to strengthen the whole Church, so
every one ought, by applying especially the doctrine to his own case, to
strengthen and animate
himself.<sup><font color="Maroon">F246</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>13.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And make straight paths,</i></font> etc.
He has been hitherto teaching us to lean on God&#8217;s consolations, so that we
may be bold and strenuous in doing what is right, as his help is our only
support; he now adds to this another thing, even that we ought to walk prudently
and to keep to a straight course; for indiscreet ardor is no less an evil than
inactivity and softness. At the same time this straightness of the way which he
recommends, is preserved when a man&#8217;s mind is superior to every fear, and
regards only what God approves; for fear is ever very ingenious in finding out
byways. As then we seek circuitous courses, when entangled by sinful fear; so on
the other hand every one who has prepared himself to endure evils, goes on in a
straight way wheresoever the Lord calls him, and turns not either to the right
hand or to the left. In short, he prescribes to us this rule for our conduct,
&#8212; that we are to guide our steps according to God&#8217;s will, so that
neither fear nor the allurements of the world, nor any other things, may draw us
away from it.<sup><font color="Maroon">F247</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Hence be adds, <font color="Maroon"><i>Lest that which is lame be turned
out of the way,</i></font> or, lest halting should go astray; that is, lest by
halting ye should at length depart far from the way. He calls it halting, when
men&#8217;s minds fluctuate, and they devote not themselves sincerely to God. So
spoke Elijah to the double-minded who blended their own superstitions with
God&#8217;s worship, &#8220;How long halt ye between two opinions?&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;111821&gt;</font></sup>1 Kings 18:21.) And it is
a befitting way of speaking, for it is a worse thing to go astray than to halt.
Nor they who begin to halt do not immediately turn from the right way, but by
degrees depart from it more and more, until having been led into a diverse path
so they remain entangled in the midst of Satan&#8217;s labyrinth. Hence the
apostle warns us to strive for the removal of this halting in due time; for if
we give way to it, it will at length turn us far away from God.<br></div>
<div>The words may indeed be rendered, &#8220;Lest halting should grow
worse,&#8221; or turn aside; but the meaning would remain the same; for what the
Apostle intimates is, that those who keep not a straight course, but gradually
though carelessly turn here and there, become eventually wholly alienated from
God.<sup><font color="Maroon">F248</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>14.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Follow peace,</i></font> etc. Men are so
born that they all seem to shun peace; for all study their own interest, seek
their own ways, and care not to accommodate themselves to the ways of others.
Unless then we strenuously labor to follow peace, we shall never retain it; for
many things will happen daily affording occasion for discords. This is the
reason why the Apostle bids us to <font color="Maroon"><i>follow</i></font>
peace, as though he had said, that it ought not only to be cultivated as far as
it may be convenient to us, but that we ought to strive with all care to keep it
among us. And this cannot be done unless we forget many offenses and exercise
mutual forbearance.<sup><font color="Maroon">F249</font></sup><br></div>
<div>As however peace cannot be maintained with the ungodly except on the
condition of approving of their vices and wickedness, the Apostle immediately
adds, that <font color="Maroon"><i>holiness</i></font> is to be followed
together with peace; as though he commended peace to us with this exception,
that the friendship of the wicked is not to be allowed to defile or pollute us;
for holiness has an especial regard to God. Though then the whole world were
roused to a blazing war, yet holiness is not to be forsaken, for it is the bond
of our union with God. In short, let us quietly cherish concord with men, but
only, according to the proverb, as far as conscience allows.<br></div>
<div>He declares, that without holiness <font color="Maroon"><i>no man shall see
the Lord;</i></font> for with no other eyes shall we see God than those which
have been renewed after his image.<br></div>
<div><b>15.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Looking diligently,</i></font> or,
taking care, or, attentively providing,
etc.<sup><font color="Maroon">F250</font></sup> By these words he intimates that
it is easy to fall away from the grace of God; for it is not without reason that
attention is required, because as soon as Satan sees us secure or remiss, he
instantly circumvents us. We have, in short, need of striving and vigilance, if
we would persevere in the grace of God.<br></div>
<div>Moreover, under the word <font color="Maroon"><i>grace,</i></font> he
includes our whole vocation. If any one hence infers that the grace of God is
not efficacious, except we of our own selves cooperate with it, the argument is
frivolous. We know how great is the slothfulness of our flesh; it therefore
wants continual incentives; but when the Lord stimulates us by warning and
exhortation, he at the same time moves and stirs up our hearts, that his
exhortations may not be in vain, or pass away without effect. Then from precepts
and exhortations we are not to infer what man can do of himself, or what is the
power of freewill; for doubtless the attention or diligence which the Apostle
requires here is the gift of God.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Lest any root,</i></font> etc. I doubt not but that
he refers to a passage written by Moses in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052918&gt;</font></sup>Deuteronomy 29:18; for
after having promulgated the Law, Moses exhorted the people to beware, lest any
root germinating should bear gall and wormwood among them. He afterwards
explained what he meant, that is, lest any one, felicitating himself in sin, and
like the drunken who are wont to excite thirst, stimulating sinful desires,
should bring on a contempt of God through the alluring of hope of impunity. The
same is what the Apostle speaks of now; for he foretells what will take place,
that is, if we suffer such a root to grow, it will corrupt and defile many; he
not only bids every one to irradiate such a pest from their hearts, but he also
forbids them to allow it to grow among them. It cannot be indeed but that these
roots will ever be found in the Church, for hypocrites and the ungodly are
always mixed with the good; but when they spring up they ought to be cut down,
lest by growing they should choke the good seed.<br></div>
<div>He mentions <font color="Maroon"><i>bitterness</i></font> for what Moses
calls gall and wormwood; but both meant to express a root that is poisonous and
deadly. Since then it is so fatal an evil, with more earnest effort it behooves
us to check it, lest it should rise and creep
farther.<sup><font color="Maroon">F251</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>16.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Lest there be any fornicator or profane
person,</i></font> etc. As he had before exhorted them to holiness, so now, that
he might reclaim them from defilements opposed to it, he mentions a particular
kind of defilement, and says, &#8220;Lest there be any fornicator.&#8221; But he
immediately comes to what is general, and adds, &#8220;or a profane
person;&#8221; for it is the term that is strictly contrary to holiness. The
Lord calls us for this end, that he may make us holy unto obedience: this is
done when we renounce the world; but any one who so delights in his own filth
that he continually rolls in it, profanes himself. We may at the same time
regard the profane as meaning generally all those who do not value God&#8217;s
grace so much as to seek it and despise the world. But as men become profane in
various ways, the more earnest we ought to strive lest an opening be left for
Satan to defile us with his corruptions. And as there is no true religion
without holiness, we ought to make progress continually in the fear of God, in
the mortifying of the flesh, and in the whole practice of piety; for as we are
profane until we separate from the world so if we roll again in its filth we
renounce holiness.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>As Esau,</i></font> etc. This example may be viewed
as an exposition of the word <font color="Maroon"><i>profane</i></font>; for
when Esau set more value on one meal than on his birthright, he lost his
blessing. Profane then are all they in whom the love of the world so reigns and
prevails that they forget heaven: as is the case with those who are led away by
ambition, or become fond of money or of wealth, or give themselves up to
gluttony, or become entangled in any other pleasures; they allow in their
thoughts and cares no place, or it may be the last place, to the spiritual
kingdom of Christ.<br></div>
<div>Most appropriate then is this example; for when the Lord designs to set
forth the power of that love which he has for his people, he calls all those
whom he has called to the hope of eternal life his firstborn. Invaluable indeed
is this honor with which he favors us; and all the wealth, all the conveniences,
the honors and the pleasures of the world, and everything commonly deemed
necessary for happiness, when compared with this honor, are of no more value
than a morsel of meat. That we indeed set a high value on things which are
nearly worth nothing, arises from this, &#8212; that depraved lust dazzles our
eyes and thus blinds us. If therefore we would hold a place in God&#8217;s
sanctuary, we must learn to despise morsels of meat of this kind, by which Satan
is wont to catch the
reprobate.<sup><font color="Maroon">F252</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>17.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>When he would have inherited the
blessing,</i></font> etc. He at first regarded as a sport the act by which he
had sold his birthright, as though it was a child&#8217;s play; but at length,
when too late, he found what a loss he had incurred, when the blessing
transferred by his father to Jacob was refused to him. Thus they who are led
away by the allurements of this world alienate themselves from God, and sell
their own salvation that they may feed on the morsels of this world, without
thinking that they lose anything, nay, they flatter and applaud themselves, as
though they were extremely happy. When too late their eyes are opened, so that
being warned by the sight of their own wickedness, they become sensible of the
loss of which they made no account.<br></div>
<div>While Esau was hungry, he cared for nothing but how he might have his
stomach well filled; when full he laughed at his brother, and judged him a fool
for having voluntarily deprived himself of a meal. Nay, such is also the
stupidity of the ungodly, as long as they burn with depraved lusts or
intemperately plunge themselves into sinful pleasures; after a time they
understand how fatal to them are all the things which they so eagerly desired.
The word &#8220;rejected&#8221; means that he was repulsed, or denied his
request.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>For he found no place of repentance,</i></font>
etc.; that is, he profited nothing, he gained nothing by his late repentance,
though he sought with tears the blessing which by his own fault he had
lost.<sup><font color="Maroon">F253</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Now as he denounces the same danger on all the despisers of God&#8217;s
grace, it may be asked, whether no hope of pardon remains, when God&#8217;s
grace has been treated with contempt and his kingdom less esteemed than the
world? To this I answer, that pardon is not expressly denied to such, but that
they are warned to take heed, lest the same thing should happen to them also.
And doubtless we may see daily many examples of God&#8217;s severity, which
prove that he takes vengeance on the mockings and scoffs of profane men: for
when they promise themselves tomorrow, he often suddenly takes them away by
death in a manner new and unexpected; when they deem fabulous what they hear of
God&#8217;s judgment, he so pursues them that they are forced to acknowledge him
as their judge; when they have consciences wholly dead, they afterwards feel
dreadful agonies as a punishment for their stupidity. But though this happens
not to all, yet as there is this danger, the Apostle justly warns all to
beware.<br></div>
<div>Another question also arises, Whether the sinner, endued with repentance,
gains nothing by it? For the Apostle seems to imply this when he tells us that
Esau&#8217;s repentance availed him nothing. My reply is, that repentance here
is not to be taken for sincere conversion to God; but it was only that terror
with which the Lord smites the ungodly, after they have long indulged themselves
in their iniquity. Nor is it a wonder that this terror should be said to be
useless and unavailing, for they do not in the meantime repent nor hate their
own vices, but are only tormented by a sense of their own punishment. The same
thing is to be said of <font color="Maroon"><i>tears;</i></font> whenever a
sinner sighs on account of his sins, the Lord is ready to pardon him, nor is
God&#8217;s mercy ever sought in vain, for to him who knocks it shall be opened,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400708&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 7:8;) but as the
tears of Esau were those of a man past hope, they were not shed on account of
having offended God; so the ungodly, however they may deplore their lot,
complain and howl, do not yet knock at God&#8217;s door for mercy, for this
cannot be done but by faith. And the more grievously conscience torments them,
the more they war against God and rage against him. They might indeed desire
that an access should be given them to God; but as they expect nothing but his
wrath, they shun his presence. Thus we often see that those who often say, as in
a jest, that repentance is sufficiently in time when they are drawing towards
their end, do then cry bitterly, amidst dreadful agonies, that the season of
obtaining repentance is past; for that they are doomed to destruction because
they did not seek God until it was too late. Sometimes, indeed, they break out
into such words as these, &#8220;Oh! if &#8212; oh! if;&#8221; but presently
despair cuts short their prayers and chokes their voice, so that they proceed no
farther. <br></div>

<div><b>18.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For ye are not come,</i></font> etc. He
fights now with a new argument, for he proclaims the greatness of the grace made
known by the Gospel, that we may reverently receive it; and secondly, he
commends to us its benign characters that he might allure us to love and desire
it. He adds weight to these two things by a comparison between the Law and the
Gospel; for the higher the excellency of Christ&#8217;s kingdom than the
dispensation of Moses, and the more glorious our calling than that of the
ancient people, the more disgraceful and the less excusable is our ingratitude,
unless we embrace in a becoming manner the great favor offered to us, and humbly
adore the majesty of Christ which is here made evident; and then, as God does
not present himself to us clothed in terrors as he did formerly to the Jews, but
lovingly and kindly invites us to himself, so the sin of ingratitude will be
thus doubled, except we willingly and in earnest respond to his gracious
invitation.<sup><font color="Maroon">F254</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Then let us first remember that the Gospel is here compared with the Law;
and secondly, that there are two parts in this comparison, &#8212; that
God&#8217;s glory displays itself more illustriously in the Gospel than in the
Law, &#8212; and that his invitation is now full of love, but that formerly
there was nothing but the greatest terrors.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Unto the mount that might be
touched,</i><sup>F255</sup></font> etc. This sentence is variously expounded;
but it seems to me that an earthly mountain is set in opposition to the
spiritual; and the words which follow show the same thing,
<font color="Maroon"><i>that burned with fire, blackness, darkness,
tempest,</i></font> etc.; for these were signs which God manifested, that he
might secure authority and reverence to his
Law.<sup><font color="Maroon">F256</font></sup> When considered in themselves
they were magnificent and truly celestial; but when we come to the kingdom of
Christ, the things which God exhibits to us are far above all the heavens. It
hence follows, that all the dignity of the Law appears now earthly: thus mount
Sinai might have been touched by hands; but mount Sion cannot be known but by
the spirit. All the things recorded in the nineteenth chapter of Exodus were
visible things; but those which we have in the kingdom of Christ are hid from
the senses of the flesh.<sup><font color="Maroon">F257</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Should any one object and say, that the meaning of all these things was
spiritual, and that there are at this day external exercises of religion by
which we are carried up to heaven: to this I answer, that the Apostle speaks
comparatively; and no one can doubt but that the Gospel, contrasted with the
Law, excels in what is spiritual, but the Law in earthly symbols.<br></div>
<div><b>19.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>They that heard entreated,</i></font>
etc. This is the second clause, in which he shows that the Law was very
different from the Gospel; for when it was promulgated there was nothing but
terrors on every side. For everything we read of in the nineteenth chapter of
Exodus was of this kind, and intended to show to the people that God had
ascended his tribunal and manifested himself as a strict judge. If by chance an
innocent beast approached, he commanded it to be killed: how much heavier
punishment awaited sinners who were conscious of their guilt, nay, who knew
themselves to be condemned to eternal death by the Law? But the Gospel contains
nothing but love, provided it be received by faith. What remains to be said you
may read in the third chapter of the Second Epistle to the
Corinthians.<br></div>
<div>But by the words the people <font color="Maroon"><i>entreated,</i></font>
etc., is not to be understood that they refused to hear God, but that they
prayed not to be constrained to hear God himself speaking; for by the
interposition of Moses their dread was somewhat
mitigated.<sup><font color="Maroon">F258</font></sup> Yet interpreters are at a
loss to know how it is that the Apostle ascribes these words to Moses,
<font color="Maroon"><i>I exceedingly fear and quake;</i></font> for we read
nowhere that they were expressed by Moses. But the difficulty may be easily
removed, if we consider that Moses spoke thus in the name of the people, whose
requests as their delegate he brought to God. It was, then, the common complaint
of the whole people; but Moses is included, who was, as it were, the speaker for
them all.<sup><font color="Maroon">F259</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>22.</b><font color="Maroon"><i> Unto mount Sion,</i></font> etc. He
alludes to those prophecies in which God had formerly promised that his Gospel
should thence go forth, as in Isaiah 2:l-4, and in other places. Then he
contrasts mount Sion with mount Sinai; and he further adds,
<font color="Maroon"><i>the heavenly Jerusalem,</i></font> and he expressly
calls it heavenly, that the Jews might not cleave to that which was earthly, and
which had flourished under the Law; for when they sought perversely to continue
under the slavish yoke of the Law, mount Sion was turned into mount Sinai as
Paul teaches us in the fourth chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians. Then by
the heavenly Jerusalem he understood that which was to be built throughout the
whole world, even as the angel, mentioned by Zechariah, extended his line from
the east even to the west.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>To an innumerable company of angels,</i></font>
etc. He means that we are associated with angels, chosen into the ranks of
patriarchs, and placed in heaven among all the spirits of the blessed, when
Christ by the Gospel calls us to himself. But it is an incalculable honor,
conferred upon us by our heavenly Father, that he should enroll us among angels
and the holy fathers. The expression, <font color="Maroon"><i>myriads of
angels,</i></font> in taken from the book of Daniel, though I have followed
Erasmus, and rendered it <font color="Maroon"><i>innumerable company of
angels.</i><sup>F260</sup></font><br></div>
<div><b>23.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>The firstborn,</i></font> etc. He does
not call the children of God indiscriminately the firstborn, for the Scripture
calls many his children who are not of this number; but for the sake of honor he
adorns with this distinction the patriarchs and other renowned saints of the
ancient Church. He adds, which are written in heaven, because God is said to
have all the elect enrolled in his book or secret catalogue, as Ezekiel
speaks.<sup><font color="Maroon">F261</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>The judge of all,</i></font> etc. This seems to
have been said to inspire fear, as though he had said, that grace is in such a
way altered to us, that we ought still to consider that we have to do with a
judge, to whom an account must be given if we presumptuously intrude into his
sanctuary polluted and profane.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>The spirits of just men,</i></font> etc. He adds
this to intimate that we are joined to holy souls, which have put off their
bodies, and left behind them all the filth of this world; and hence he says that
they are consecrated or &#8220;made perfect&#8221;, for they are no more subject
to the infirmities of the flesh, having laid aside the flesh itself. And hence
we may with certainty conclude, that pious souls, separated from their bodies,

companions.<br></div>
<div><b>24.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And to Jesus the Mediator,</i></font>
etc. He adds this in the last place, because it is he alone through whom the
Father is reconciled to us, and who renders his face serene and lovely to us, so
that we may come to him without fear. At the same time he shows how Christ
becomes our Mediator, even through his own
<font color="Maroon"><i>blood,</i></font> which after the Hebrew mode of
speaking he calls the blood of <font color="Maroon"><i>sprinkling,</i></font>
which means sprinkled blood; for as it was once for all shed to make an
atonement for us, so our souls must be now cleansed by it through faith. At the
same time the Apostle alludes to the ancient rite of the Law, which has been
before mentioned.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>That speaketh better things,</i></font> etc. There
is no reason why <font color="Maroon"><i>better</i></font> may not be rendered
adverbially in the following manner, &#8212; &#8220;Christ&#8217;s blood cries
more efficaciously, and is better heard by God than the blood of Abel.&#8221; It
is, however, preferable to take the words literally: the blood of Christ is said
to speak <font color="Maroon"><i>better things</i></font>, because it avails to
obtain pardon for our sins. The <font color="Maroon"><i>blood of Abel</i></font>
did not properly cry out; for it was his murder that called for vengeance before
God. But the blood of Christ cries out, and the atonement made by it is heard
daily.<sup><font color="Maroon">F262</font></sup><br></div>

<div><b>25.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>See that ye refuse not him that
speaketh,</i></font> etc. He uses the same verb as before, when he said that the
people entreated that God should not speak to them; but he means as I think,
another thing, even that we ought not to reject the word destined for us. He
further shows what he had in view in the last comparison, even that the severest
punishment awaits the despisers of the Gospel, since the ancients under the Law
did not despise it with impunity. And he pursues the argument from the less to
the greater, when he says, that God or Moses spoke then on earth, but that the
same God or Christ speaks now from heaven. At the same time I prefer regarding
God in both instances as the speaker. And he is said to have spoken on earth,
because he spoke in a lower strain. Let us ever bear in mind that he refers to
the external ministration of the Law, which, as compared with the gospel,
partook of what was earthly, and did not lead men&#8217;s minds above the
heavens unto perfect wisdom; for though the Law contained in it the same truth,
yet as it was only a training school, perfection could not belong to
it.<sup><font color="Maroon">F263</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>26.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Whose voice then shook the
earth,</i></font> etc. Though God shook the earth when he published his Law, yet
he shows that he now speaks more gloriously, for he shakes both earth and
heaven. He quotes on the subject the testimony of the Prophet Haggai, though he
gives not the words literally; but as the Prophet foretells a future shaking of
the earth and the heaven, the Apostle borrows the idea in order to teach us that
the voice of the Gospel not only thunders through the earth, but also penetrates
above the heavens. But that the Prophet speaks of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, is
beyond any dispute, for it immediately follows in the same passage, &#8220;I
will shake all nations; and come shall the desire of all nations, and I will
fill this house with glory.&#8221; It is however certain that neither all
nations have been gathered into one body, except under the banner of Christ, nor
has there been any desire in which we ought to acquiesce but Christ alone, nor
was the temple of Solomon exceeded in glory until the magnificence of Christ
became known through the whole world. The Prophet then no doubt refers to the
time of Christ. But if at the commencement of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, not only
the lower parts of the world were shaken, but his power also reached the heaven,
the Apostle justly concludes that the doctrine of the Gospel is sublimer than
that of the Law, and ought to be more distinctly heard by all
creatures.<sup><font color="Maroon">F264</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>27.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And this word, yet once more,</i></font>
etc. The words of the Prophet are these, &#8220;Yet a little while;&#8221; and
he means that the calamity of the people would not be perpetual, but that the
Lord would succor them. But the Apostle lays no stress on this expression; he
only infers from the shaking of the heaven and the earth that the state of the
world was to be changed at the coming of Christ; for things created are subject
to decay, but Christ&#8217;s kingdom is eternal; then all creatures must needs
be brought into a better
state.<sup><font color="Maroon">F265</font></sup><br></div>
<div>He makes hence a transition to another exhortation, that we are to lay hold
on that kingdom which cannot be shaken; for the Lord shakes us for this end,
that he may really and forever establish us in himself. At the same time I
prefer a different reading, which is given by the ancient Latin version,
&#8220;Receiving a kingdom, we have grace,&#8221; etc. When read affirmatively,
the passage runs best, &#8212; &#8220;We, in embracing the Gospel, have the gift
of the Spirit of Christ, that we may reverently and devoutly worship God.&#8221;
If it be read as an exhortation, &#8220;Let us have,&#8221; it is a strained and
obscure mode of speaking. The Apostle means in short, as I think, that provided
we enter by faith into Christ&#8217;s kingdom, we shall enjoy constant grace,
which will effectually retain us in the service of God; for as the kingdom of
Christ is above the world, so is the gift of
regeneration.<sup><font color="Maroon">F266</font></sup><br></div>
<div>By saying that God is to be served
<font color="Maroon"><i>acceptably,</i></font>
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujare&gt;stwv,
</font><font color="Maroon"><i>with reverence and fear,</i></font> he intimates
that though he requires us to serve with promptitude and delight, there is yet
no service approved by him except it be united with humility and due reverence.
Thus he condemns froward confidence of the flesh, as well as the sloth which
also proceeds from it.<sup><font color="Maroon">F267</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>29.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For our God,</i></font> etc. As he had
before kindly set before us the grace of God, so he now makes known his
severity; and he seems to have borrowed this sentence from the fourth chapter of
Deuteronomy. Thus we see that God omits nothing by which he may draw us to
himself; he begins indeed with love and kindness, so that we may follow him the
more willingly; but when by alluring he effects but little, he terrifies
us.<br></div>
<div>And doubtless it is expedient that the grace of God should never be
promised to us without being accompanied with threatening; for we are so
extremely prone to indulge ourselves, that without the application of these
stimulants the milder doctrine would prove ineffectual. Then the Lord, as he is
propitious and merciful to such as fear him unto a thousand generations; so he
is a jealous God and a just avenger, when despised, unto the third and the
fourth generation.<sup><font color="Maroon">F268</font></sup><br></div>

<div><b>1.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Let brotherly love,</i></font> etc.
Probably he gave this command respecting brotherly love, because a secret hatred
arising from the haughtiness of the Jews was threatening to rend the Churches.
But still this precept is generally very needful, for nothing flows away so
easily as love; when everyone thinks of himself more than he ought, he will
allow to others less than he ought; and then many offenses happen daily which
cause separations.<sup><font color="Maroon">F269</font></sup><br></div>
<div>He calls love <font color="Maroon"><i>brotherly,</i></font> not only to
teach us that we ought to be mutually united together by a peculiar and an
inward feeling of love, but also that we may remember that we cannot be
Christians without being brethren; for he speaks of the love which the household
of faith ought to cultivate one towards another inasmuch as the Lord has bound
them closer together by the common bond of adoption. It was therefore a good
custom in the primitive Church for Christians to call one another brothers; but
now the name as well as the thing itself is become almost obsolete, except that
the monks have appropriated to themselves the use of it when neglected by
others, while at the same time they show by their discords and intestine
factions that they are the children of the evil one.<br></div>
<div><b>2.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Be not forgetful to entertain
strangers,</i></font> etc. This office of humanity has also nearly ceased to be
properly observed among men; for the ancient hospitality, celebrated in
histories, is unknown to us, and Inns now supply the place of accommodations for
strangers. But he speaks not so much of the practice of hospitality as observed
then by the rich; but he rather commends the miserable and the needy to be
entertained, as at that time many were fugitives who left their homes for the
name of Christ.<br></div>
<div>And that he might commend this duty the more, he adds, that angels had
sometimes been entertained by those who thought that they received only men. I
doubt not but that this is to be understood of Abraham and Lot; for having been
in the habit of showing hospitality, they without knowing and thinking of any
such thing, entertained angels; thus their houses were in no common way honored.
And doubtless God proved that hospitality was especially acceptable to him, when
he rendered such a reward to Abraham and to Lot. Were any one to object and say,
that this rarely happened; to this the obvious answer is, &#8212; That not mere
angels are received, but Christ himself, when we receive the poor in his name.
In the words in Greek there is a beautiful alliteration which cannot be set
forth in Latin.<br></div>
<div><b>3.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Remember them that are in
bonds,</i></font> or, Be mindful of the bound, etc. There is nothing that can
give us a more genuine feeling of compassion than to put ourselves in the place
of those who are in distress; hence he says, that we ought to think of those in
bonds as though we were bound with them. What follows the first clause,
<font color="Maroon"><i>As being yourselves also in the body,</i></font> is
variously explained. Some take a general view thus, &#8220;Ye are also exposed
to the same evils, according to the common lot of humanity;&#8221; but others
give a more restricted sense, &#8220;As though ye were in their body.&#8221; Of
neither can I approve, for I apply the words to the body of the Church, so that
the meaning would be this, &#8220;Since ye are members of the same body, it
behooves you to feel in common for each other&#8217;s evils, that there may be
nothing disunited among
you.&#8221;<sup><font color="Maroon">F270</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>4.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Marriage is honourable in all,</i></font>
etc. Some think this an exhortation to the married to conduct themselves
modestly and in a becoming manner, that the husband should live with his wife
temperately and chastely, and not defile the conjugal bed by unbeseeming
wantonness. Thus a verb is to be understood in the sense of exhorting,
&#8220;Let marriage be honorable.&#8221; And yet the indicative
<font color="Maroon"><i>is</i></font> would not be unsuitable; for when we hear
that marriage is honorable, it ought to come immediately to our minds that we
are to conduct ourselves in it honorably and becomingly. Others take the
sentence by way of concession in this way, &#8220;Though marriage is honorable,
it is yet unlawful to commit fornication&#8221;; but this sense, as all must
see, is rigid. I am inclined to think that the Apostle sets marriage here in
opposition to fornication as a remedy for that evil; and the context plainly
shows that this was his meaning; for before he threatens that the Lord would
punish fornicators, he first states what is the true way of escape, even if we
live honourable in a state of marriage.<br></div>
<div>Let this then be the main point, that fornication will not be unpunished,
for God will take vengeance on it. And doubtless as God has blessed the union of
man and wife, instituted by himself, it follows that every other union different
from this is by him condemned and accursed. He therefore denounces punishment
not only on adulterers, but also on fornicators; for both depart from the holy
institution of God; nay, they violate and subvert it by a promiscuous
intercourse, since there is but one legitimate union, sanctioned by the
authority and approval of God. But as promiscuous and vagrant lusts cannot be
restrained without the remedy of marriage, he therefore commends it by calling
it &#8220;honorable&#8221;.<br></div>
<div>What he adds, <font color="Maroon"><i>and the bed undefiled,</i></font> has
been stated, as it seems to me, for this end, that the married might know that
everything is not lawful for them, but that the use of the legitimate bed should
be moderate, lest anything contrary to modesty and chastity be
allowed.<sup><font color="Maroon">F271</font></sup><br></div>
<div>By saying <font color="Maroon"><i>in all men,</i></font> I understand him
to mean, that there is no order of men prohibited from marriage; for what God
has allowed to mankind universally, is becoming in all without exception; I mean
all who are fit for marriage and feel the need of it.<br></div>
<div>It was indeed necessary for this subject to have been distinctly and
expressly stated, in order to obviate a superstition, the seeds of which Satan
was probably even then secretly sowing, even this, &#8212; that marriage is a
profane thing, or at least far removed from Christian perfection; for those
seducing spirits, forbidding marriage, who had been foretold by Paul, soon
appeared. That none then might foolishly imagine that marriage is only permitted
to the people in general, but that those who are eminent in the Church ought to
abstain from it, the Apostle takes away every exception; and he does not teach
us that it is conceded as an indulgence, as Jerome sophistically says, but that
it is honourable. It is very strange indeed that those who introduced the
prohibition of marriage into the world, were not terrified by this so express a
declaration; but it was necessary then to give loose reins to Satan, in order to
punish the ingratitude of those who refused to hear God.<br></div>
<div><b>5.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Let your conversation be without
covetousness,</i></font> etc. While he seeks to correct covetousness, he rightly
and wisely bids us at the same time to be content with our present things; for
it is the true contempt of money, or at least a true greatness of mind in the
right and moderate use of it, when we are content with what the Lord has given
us, whether it be much or little; for certainly it rarely happens that anything
satisfies an avaricious man; but on the contrary they who are not content with a
moderate portion, always seek more even when they enjoy the greatest affluence.
It was a doctrine which Paul had declared, that he had learned, so as to know
how to abound and how to suffer need. Then he who has set limits to his desire
so as to acquiesce resignedly in his lot, has expelled from his heart the love
of money.<sup><font color="Maroon">F272</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>For he has said,</i></font> etc. Here he quotes two
testimonies; the first is taken, as some think, from the first chapter of
Joshua, but I am rather of the opinion that it is a sentence drawn from the
common doctrine of Scripture, as though he had said, &#8220;The Lord everywhere
promises that he will never be wanting to us.&#8221; He infers from this promise
what is found in Psalm 118, that we have the power to overcome fear when we feel
assured of God&#8217;s
help.<sup><font color="Maroon">F273</font></sup><br></div>
<div>Here indeed he plucks up the evil by the very roots, as it is necessary
when we seek to free from it the minds of men. It is certain that the source of
covetousness is mistrust; for whosoever has this fixed in his heart, that he
will never be forsaken by the Lord, will not be immoderately solicitous about
present things, because he will depend on God&#8217;s providence. When therefore
the Apostle is seeking to cure us of the disease of covetousness, he wisely
calls our attention to God&#8217;s promises, in which he testifies that he will
ever be present with us. He hence infers afterwards that as long as we have such
a helper there is no cause to fear. For in this way it can be that no depraved
desires will importune us; for faith alone is that which can quiet the minds of
men, whose disquietude without it is too well known. <br></div>

<div><b>7.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Remember,</i></font> etc. What follows
refers not so much to morals as to doctrine. He first sets before the Jews the
example of those by whom they had been taught; and he seems especially to speak
of those who had sealed the doctrine delivered by them by their own blood; for
he points out something memorable when he says,
<font color="Maroon"><i>considering the end of their conversation;</i></font>
though still there is no reason why we should not understand this generally of
those who had persevered in the true faith to the end, and had rendered a
faithful testimony to sound doctrine through their whole life as well as in
death. But it was a matter of no small importance, that he set before them their
teachers for imitation; for they who have begotten us in Christ ought to be to
us in the place as it were of fathers. Since then they had seen them continuing
firm and unmoved in the midst of much persecutions and of various other
conflicts, they ought in all reason to have been deeply moved and
affected.<sup><font color="Maroon">F274</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>8.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Jesus Christ the same,</i></font> etc.
The only way by which we can persevere in the right faith is to hold to the
foundation, and not in the smallest degree to depart from it; for he who holds
not to Christ knows nothing but mere vanity, though he may comprehend heaven and
earth; for in Christ are included all the treasures of celestial wisdom. This
then is a remarkable passage, from which we learn that there is no other way of
being truly wise than by fixing all our thoughts on Christ alone.<br></div>

possessed the same sovereignty which he holds at this day;
<font color="Maroon"><i>The same,</i></font> he says,
<font color="Maroon"><i>yesterday, and today, and forever.</i></font> By which
words he intimates that Christ, who was then made known in the world, had
reigned from the beginning of the world, and that it is not possible to advance
farther when we come to him. <font color="Maroon"><i>Yesterday</i></font> then
comprehends the whole time of the Old Testament; and that no one might expect a
sudden change after a short time, as the promulgation of the Gospel was then but
recent, he declares that Christ had been lately revealed for this very end, that
the knowledge of him might continue the same for ever.<br></div>
<div>It hence appears that the Apostle is not speaking of the eternal existence
of Christ, but of that knowledge of him which was possessed by the godly in all
ages, and was the perpetual foundation of the Church. It is indeed certain that
Christ existed before he manifested his power; but the question is, what is the
subject of the Apostle. Then I say he refers to quality, so to speak, and not to
essence; for it is not the question, whether he was from eternity with the
Father, but what was the knowledge which men had of him. But the manifestation
of Christ as to its external form and appearance, was indeed different under the
Law from what it is now; yet there is no reason why the Apostle could not say
truly and properly that Christ, as regarded by the faithful, is always the
same.<sup><font color="Maroon">F275</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Diverse doctrines,</i></font> etc. He
concludes that we ought not to fluctuate, since the truth of Christ, in which we
ought to stand firm, remains fixed and unchangeable. And doubtless, variety of
opinions, every kind of superstition, all monstrous errors, in a word, all
corruptions in religion, arise from this, that men abide not in Christ alone;
for it is not in vain that Paul teaches us, that Christ is given to us by God to
be our wisdom.<br></div>
<div>The import then of this passage is that in order that the truth of God may
remain firm in us, we must acquiesce in Christ alone. We hence conclude that all
who are ignorant of Christ are exposed to all the delusions of Satan; for apart
from him there is no stability of faith, but innumerable tossings here and
there. Wonderful then is the acuteness of the Papists, who have contrived quite
a contrary remedy for driving away errors, even by extinguishing or burying the
knowledge of Christ! But let this warning of the Holy Spirit be fixed in our
hearts, that we shall never be beyond the reach of danger except we cleave to
Christ.<br></div>
<div>Now the doctrines which lead us away from Christ, he says, are
<font color="Maroon"><i>divers</i></font> or various, because there is no other
simple and unmixed truth but the knowledge of Christ; and he calls them also
<font color="Maroon"><i>strange</i></font> or foreign, because whatever is apart
from Christ is not regarded by God as his own; and we are hereby also reminded
how we are to proceed, if we would make a due proficiency in the Scripture, for
he who takes not a straight course to Christ, goes after strange doctrines. The
Apostle farther intimates that the Church of God will always have to contend
with strange doctrines and that there is no other means of guarding against them
but by being fortified with the pure knowledge of
Christ.<sup><font color="Maroon">F276</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>For it is a good thing,</i></font> etc. He now
comes from a general principle to a particular case. The Jews, for instance, as
it is well known, were superstitious as to distinctions in meats; and hence
arose many disputes and discords; and this was one of the strange doctrines
which proceeded from their ignorance of Christ. Having then previously grounded
our faith on Christ, he now says that the observance of meats does not conduce
to our salvation and true holiness. As he sets
<font color="Maroon"><i>grace</i></font> in opposition to
<font color="Maroon"><i>meats</i></font>, I doubt not but that by grace he means
the spiritual worship of God and regeneration. In saying
<font color="Maroon"><i>that the heart may be established,</i></font> he alludes
to the word, <font color="Maroon"><i>carried about,</i></font> as though he had
said, &#8220;It is the spiritual grace of God, and not the observance of meats,
that will really establish
us.<sup><font color="Maroon">F277</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Which have not profited them that have been
occupied therein.</i></font> It is uncertain to whom he here refers; for the
fathers who lived under the Law had no doubt a useful training, and a part of it
was the distinction as to meats. It seems then that this is to be understood
rather of the superstitious, who, after the Gospel had been revealed, still
perversely adhered to the old ceremonies. At the same time were we judiciously
to explain the words as applied to the fathers, there would be no inconsistency;
it was indeed profitable for them to undergo the yoke laid on them by the Lord,
and to continue obediently under the common discipline of the godly and of the
whole Church; but the Apostle means that abstinence from meats was in itself of
no avail. And no doubt it is to be regarded as nothing, except as an elementary
instruction at the time when God&#8217;s people were like children as to their
external discipline. To be <font color="Maroon"><i>occupied in meats</i></font>
is to be taken as having a regard to them, so as to make a distinction between
clean and unclean. But what he says of meats may be extended to the other rites
of the Law. <br></div>

<div><b>10.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>We have an altar,</i></font> etc. This
is a beautiful adaptation of an old rite under the Law, to the present state of
the Church. There was a kind of sacrifice appointed, mentioned in the sixteenth
chapter of Leviticus, no part of which returned to the priests and Levites.
This, as he now shows by a suitable allusion, was accomplished in Christ; for he
was sacrificed on this condition, that they who serve the tabernacle should not
feed on him. But by the <font color="Maroon"><i>ministers of the
tabernacle</i></font> he means all those who performed the ceremonies. Then that
we may partake of Christ, he intimates that we must renounce the tabernacle; for
as the word <font color="Maroon"><i>altar</i></font> includes sacrificing and
the victim; so <font color="Maroon"><i>tabernacle,</i></font> all the external
types connected with it.<br></div>
<div>Then the meaning is, &#8220;No wonder if the rites of the Law have now
ceased, for this is what was typified by the sacrifice which the Levites brought
without the camp to be there burnt; for as the ministers of the tabernacle did
eat nothing of it, so if we serve the tabernacle, that is, retain its
ceremonies, we shall not be partakers of that sacrifice which Christ once
offered, nor of the expiation which he once made by his own blood; for his own
blood he brought into the heavenly sanctuary that he might atone for the sin of
the world.&#8221;<sup><font color="Maroon">F278</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>13.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Let us go forth, therefore,</i></font>
etc. That the preceding allegory or mystical similitude might not be frigid and
lifeless, he connects with it an important duty required of all Christians. And
this mode of teaching is what Paul also usually adopts, that he might show to
the faithful what things God would have them to be engaged in, while he was
endeavoring to draw them away from vain ceremonies; as though he had said,
&#8220;This is what God demands from you, but not that work in which you in vain
weary yourselves.&#8221; So now our Apostle speaks; for while he invites us to
leave the tabernacle and to follow Christ, he reminds us that a far different
thing is required of us from the work of serving God in the shade under the
magnificent splendor of the temple; for we must go after him through exiles,
flights, reproaches, and all kinds of afflictions. This warfare, in which we
must strive even unto blood, he sets in opposition to those shadowy practices of
which alone the teachers of ceremonies boasted.<br></div>
<div><b>14.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For here we have no continuing
city,</i></font> etc. He extends still further the going forth which he had
mentioned, even that as strangers and wanderers in this world we should consider
that we have no fixed residence but in heaven. Whenever, therefore, we are
driven from place to place, or whenever any change happens to us, let us think
of what the Apostle teaches us here, that we have no certain shade on earth, for
heaven is our inheritance; and when more and more tried, let us ever prepare
ourselves for our last end; for they who enjoy a very quiet life commonly
imagine that they have a rest in this world: it is hence profitable for us, who
are prone to this kind of sloth, to be often tossed here and there, that we who
are too much inclined to look on things below, may learn to turn our eyes up to
heaven.<br></div>
<div><b>15.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>By him, therefore, let us offer the
sacrifice of praise to God,</i></font> etc. He returns to that particular
doctrine to which he had referred, respecting the abrogation of the ancient
ceremonies; and he anticipates an objection that might have been made; for as
the sacrifices were attached as appendages to the tabernacle, when this was
abolished, it follows that the sacrifices also must have ceased. But the Apostle
had taught us that as Christ had suffered without the gate, we are also called
thither, and that hence the tabernacle must be forsaken by those who would
follow him.<br></div>
<div>Here a question arises, whether any sacrifices remained for Christians; for
this would have been inconsistent, as they had been instituted for the purpose
of celebrating God&#8217; worship. The Apostle, therefore, in due time meets
this objection, and says that another kind of sacrifice remains for us, which no
less pleases God, even the offering of the calves of our lips, as the Prophet
Hoses says.<sup><font color="Maroon">F279</font></sup>
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;281402&gt;</font></sup>Hosea 14:2.) Now that the
sacrifice of praise is not only equally pleasing to God, but of more account
than all those external sacrifices under the Law, appears evident from the
fiftieth Psalm; for God there repudiates all these as things of nought, and bids
the sacrifice of praise to be offered to him. We hence see that it is the
highest worship of God, justly preferred to all other exercises, when we
acknowledge God&#8217;s goodness by thanksgiving; yea, this is the ceremony of
sacrificing which God commends to us now. There is yet no doubt but that under
this one part is included the whole of prayer; for we cannot give him thanks
except when we are heard by him; and no one obtains anything except he who
prays. He in a word means that without brute animals we have what is required to
be offered to God, and that he is thus rightly and really worshipped by
us.<br></div>
<div>But as it was the Apostle&#8217;s design to teach us what is the legitimate
way of worshipping God under the New Testament, so by the way he reminds us that
God cannot be really invoked by us and his name glorified, except through Christ
the mediator; for it is he alone who sanctifies our lips, which otherwise are
unclean, to sing the praises of God; and it is he who opens a way for our
prayers, who in short performs the office of a priest, presenting himself before
God in our name. <br></div>

<div><b>16.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But to do good,</i></font> etc. Here he
points out even another way of offering a due and regular sacrifice, for all the
acts and duties of love are so many sacrifices; and he thereby intimates that
they were foolish and absurd in their wishes who thought that something was
wanting except they offered beasts to God according to the Law, since God gave
them many and abundant opportunities for sacrificing. For though he can derive
no benefit from us, yet he regards prayer a sacrifice, and so much as the chief
sacrifice, that it alone can supply the place of all the rest; and then,
whatever benefits we confer on men he considers as done to himself, and honors
them with the name of sacrifices. So it appears that the elements of the Law are
now not only superfluous, but do harm, as they draw us away from the right way
of sacrificing.<br></div>
<div>The meaning is, that if we wish to sacrifice to God, we must call on him
and acknowledge his goodness by thanksgiving, and further, that we must do good
to our brethren; these are the true sacrifices which Christians ought to offer;
and as to other sacrifices, there is neither time nor place for them.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>For with such sacrifices God is well
pleased.</i></font> There is to be understood here an implied contrast, &#8212;
that he no longer requires those ancient sacrifices which he had enjoined until
the abrogation of the Law.<br></div>
<div>But with this doctrine is connected an exhortation which ought powerfully
to stimulate us to exercise kindness towards our neighbors; for it is not a
common honor that God should regard the benefits we confer on men as sacrifices
offered to himself, and that he so adorns our works, which are nothing worth, as
to pronounce them holy and sacred things, acceptable to him. When, therefore,
love does not prevail among us, we not only rob men of their right, but God
himself, who has by a solemn sentence dedicated to himself what he has commanded
to be done to men.<br></div>
<div>The word <font color="Maroon"><i>communicate</i></font> has a wider meaning
than <font color="Maroon"><i>to do good,</i></font> for it embraces all the
duties by which men can mutually assist one another; and it is a true mark or
proof of love, when they who are united together by the Spirit of God
communicate to one another.<sup><font color="Maroon">F280</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>17.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Obey them,</i></font> etc. I doubt not
but that he speaks of pastors and other rulers of the Church, for there were
then no Christian magistrates; and what follows, <font color="Maroon"><i>for
they watch for your souls,</i></font> properly belongs to spiritual government.
He commands first obedience and then honor to be rendered to
them.<sup><font color="Maroon">F281</font></sup> These two things are
necessarily required, so that the people might have confidence in their pastors,
and also reverence for them. But it ought at the same time to be noticed that
the Apostle speaks only of those who faithfully performed their office; for they
who have nothing but the title, nay, who use the title of pastors for the
purpose of destroying the Church, deserve but little reverence and still less
confidence. And this also is what the Apostle plainly sets forth when he says,
that they <font color="Maroon"><i>watched</i></font> for their souls, &#8212; a
duty which is not performed but by those who are faithful rulers, and are really
what they are called.<br></div>
<div>Doubly foolish, then, are the Papists, who from these words confirm the
tyranny of their own idol: &#8220;The Spirit bids us obediently to receive the
doctrine of godly and faithful bishops, and to obey their wholesome counsels; he
bids us also to honor them.&#8221; But how does this favor mere apes of bishops?
And yet not only such are all those who are bishops under the Papacy, but they
are cruel murderers of souls and rapacious wolves. But to pass by a description
of them, this only will I say at present, that when we are bidden to obey our
pastors, we ought carefully and wisely to find out those who are true and
faithful rulers; for if we render this honor to all indiscriminately, first, a
wrong will be done to the good; and secondly, the reason here added, to honor
them because they watch for souls, will be rendered nugatory. In order,
therefore, that the Pope and those who belong to him may derive support from
this passage, they must all of necessity first prove that they are of the number
of those who watch for our salvation. If this be made evident, there will then
be no question but that they ought to be reverently treated by all the
godly.<sup><font color="Maroon">F282</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>For they watch,</i></font> etc. His meaning is,
that the heavier the burden they bear, the more honor they deserve; for the more
labor anyone undertakes for our sake, and the more difficulty and danger he
incurs for us, the greater are our obligations to him. And such is the office of
bishops, that it involves the greatest labor and the greatest danger; if, then,
we wish to be grateful, we can hardly render to them that which is due; and
especially, as they are to give an account of us to God, it would be disgraceful
for us to make no account of
them.<sup><font color="Maroon">F283</font></sup><br></div>
<div>He further reminds us in what great a concern their labor may avail us,
for, if the salvation of our souls be precious to us, they ought by no means to
be deemed of no account who watch for it. He also bids us to be teachable and
ready to obey, that what pastors do in consequence of what their office demands,
they may also willingly and <font color="Maroon"><i>joyfully</i></font> do; for,
if they have their minds restrained by grief or weariness, though they may be
sincere and faithful, they will yet become disheartened and careless, for vigor
in acting will fail at the same time with their cheerfulness. Hence the Apostle
declares, that it would be <font color="Maroon"><i>unprofitable</i></font> to
the people to cause sorrow and mourning to their pastors by their ingratitude;
and he did this, that he might intimate to us that we cannot be troublesome or
disobedient to our pastors without hazarding our own salvation.<br></div>
<div>As hardly one in ten considers this, it is hence evident how great
generally is the neglect of salvation; nor is it a wonder how few at this day
are found who strenuously watch over the Church of God. For besides, there are
very few who are like Paul, who have their mouth open when the people&#8217;s
ears are closed, and who enlarge their own heart when the heart of the people is
straitened. The Lord also punishes the ingratitude which everywhere prevails.
Let us then remember that we are suffering the punishment of our own
perverseness, whenever the pastors grow cold in their duty, or are less diligent
than they ought to be.<br></div>
<div><b>18.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For we trust,</i></font> etc. After
having commended himself to their prayers, in order to excite them to pray, he
declares that he had a <font color="Maroon"><i>good conscience.</i></font>
Though indeed our prayers ought to embrace the whole world, as love does, from
which they flow; it is yet right and meet that we should be peculiarly
solicitous for godly and holy men, whose probity and other marks of excellency
have become known to us. For this end, then, he mentions the integrity of his
own conscience, that is, that he might move them more effectually to feel an
interest for himself. By saying, I am persuaded, or I
<font color="Maroon"><i>trust,</i></font> he thus partly shows his modesty and
partly his confidence. <font color="Maroon"><i>In all,</i></font> may be applied
to things as well as to men; and so I leave it
undecided.<sup><font color="Maroon">F284</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>19.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>But I beseech you,</i></font> etc. He
now adds another argument, &#8212; that the prayers they would make for him,
would be profitable to them all as well as to himself individually, as though he
had said, &#8220;I do not so much consult my own benefit as the benefit of you
all; for to be restored to you would be the common good of all.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>A probable conjecture may hence perhaps be gathered, that the author of
this Epistle was either beset with troubles or detained by the fear of
persecution, so as not to be able to appear among those to whom he was writing.
It might however be, that he thus spoke, though he was free and at liberty, for
he regarded man&#8217;s steps as being in God&#8217;s hand; and this appears
probable from the end of the Epistle. <br></div>

<div><b>20.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Now the God of peace,</i></font> etc. To
render mutual what he desired them to do, he ends his Epistle with prayer; and
he asks of God to <font color="Maroon"><i>confirm,</i></font> or to fit, or to
perfect them in <font color="Maroon"><i>every good work;</i></font> for such is
the meaning of <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">katarti&gt;sai.</font> We
hence conclude, that we are by no means fit to do good until we are made or
formed for the purpose by God, and that we shall not continue long in doing good
unless he strengthens us; for perseverance is his peculiar gift. Nor is there a
doubt but that as no common gifts of the Spirit had already, as it seems,
appeared in them, the first impression with which they began, is not what is
prayed for, but the polishing, which they were to be made perfect.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>That brought again from the dead,</i></font> etc.
This clause was added for the sake of confirmation; for he intimates that God is
then only prayed to aright by us, to lead us on to perfection, when we
acknowledge his power in the resurrection of Christ, and acknowledge Christ
himself as our pastor. He, in short, would have us to look to Christ, in order
that we may rightly trust in God for help; for Christ was raised from death for
this end, that we might be renewed unto eternal life, by the same power of God;
and he is the great pastor of all, in order that we may protect the sheep
committed to him by the Father.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Through the blood,</i></font> etc. I have rendered
it, &#8220;In the blood;&#8221; for as
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font> &#8220;in,&#8221; is often
taken in the sense of <font color="Maroon"><i>with</i></font>, so I prefer to
regard it here. For it seems to me, that the Apostle means, that Christ so arose
from the dead, that his death was not yet abolished, but that it retains its
efficacy forever, as though he had said, &#8220;God raised up his own son, but
in such a way that the blood he shed once for all in his death is efficacious
after his resurrection for the ratification of the everlasting covenant, and
brings forth fruit the same as though it were flowing
always.&#8221;<sup><font color="Maroon">F286</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>21.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>To do his will,</i></font> etc. He now
gives a definition of good works by laying down God&#8217;s
<font color="Maroon"><i>will</i></font> as the rule; for he thus intimates, that
no works are to be deemed good, but such as are agreeable to the will of God, as
Paul also teaches us in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451202&gt;</font></sup>Romans 12:2, and in many
other places. Let us then remember, that it is the perfection of a good and holy
life, when we live in obedience to his will. The clause which next follows is
explanatory, <font color="Maroon"><i>working</i></font> (or doing)
<font color="Maroon"><i>in you what is well pleasing in his sight.</i></font> He
had spoken of that will which is made known in the Law; he now shows, that in
vain is obtruded on God what he has not commanded; for he values the decrees of
his own will far more than all the inventions of the world.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>Through Jesus Christ,</i></font> etc. This may be
explained in two ways, &#8212; &#8220;Working through Jesus Christ&#8221;, or,
&#8220;Well-pleasing through Jesus Christ.&#8221; Both senses are suitable. For
we know that the spirit of regeneration and also all graces are bestowed on us
through Christ; and then it is certain, that as nothing can proceed from us
absolutely perfect, nothing can be acceptable to God without that pardon which
we obtain through Christ. Thus it comes, that our works, performed by the odor
of Christ&#8217;s grace, emit a sweet fragrance in God&#8217;s presence, while
otherwise they would have a fetid smell. I am disposed to include both
meanings.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>To whom be glory,</i></font> etc. This I refer to
Christ. And as he here ascribes to Christ what peculiarly belongs to God alone,
he thus bears a clear testimony to his divinity; but still if anyone prefers to
explain this of the Father, I do not object; though I embrace the other sense,
as being the most obvious.<br></div>
<div><b>22.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And I beseech you,</i></font> etc. Some
understand this as though he was soliciting them to hear him; but I take another
view; for he mentions, as I think, that he had written in a
<font color="Maroon"><i>few words,</i></font> or briefly, in order that he might
not appear as though he wished to lessen in any degree the ordinary practice of
teaching. Let us hence learn that the Scripture has not been committed to us in
order to silence the voice of pastors, and that we are not to be fastidious when
the same exhortations often sound in our ears; for the holy Spirit has so
regulated the writings which he has dictated to the Prophets and the Apostles,
that he detracts nothing from the order instituted by himself; and the order is,
that constant exhortations should be heard in the Church from the mouth of
pastors. And probably he recommends the <font color="Maroon"><i>word of
exhortation</i></font> for this reason, that though men are by nature anxious to
learn, they yet prefer to hear something new rather than to be reminded of
things known and often heard before. Besides, as they indulge themselves in
sloth, they can ill bear to be stimulated and reproved.<br></div>
<div><b>23.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Know ye that our brother,</i></font>
etc. Since the termination of the Greek verb
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ginw&gt;skete,</font> will admit of
either renderings, we may read, &#8220;Ye know,&#8221; or, &#8220;Know
ye;&#8221; but I prefer the latter reading, though I do not reject the
other.<sup><font color="Maroon">f287</font></sup> The probability is, that he
was informing the Jews on the other side of the sea of what they did not know.
Now, if this <font color="Maroon"><i>Timothy</i></font> was the renowned
companion of Paul, which I am inclined to think, it is very probable that either
Luke or Clement was the author of this Epistle. Paul, indeed, more usually calls
him his son; and then what immediately follows does not apply to Paul; for it
appears that the writer was at liberty and at his own disposal; and besides,
that he was then anywhere rather than at Rome; nay, it is very probable, that he
was going round through various cities, and was then preparing to pass over the
sea. Now all these particulars might have been suitable to the circumstances
either of Luke or of Clement after the death of
Paul.<sup><font color="Maroon">F288</font></sup><br></div>
<div><b>24.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Salute,</i></font> etc. As he writes his
Epistle generally to the Hebrews, it is strange that he bids some, separate from
the rest, to be saluted; but he sends this salutation, as I think, more
particularly to the rulers, as a mark of honor, that he might conciliate them,
and gently lead them to assent to his doctrine. And he adds, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><i>And all the saints.</i></font> He either means the
faithful from among the Gentiles, and refers to them that both Jews and Gentiles
might learn to cultivate unity among themselves; or his object was to intimate,
that they who first received the Epistle, were to communicate it to
others.<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 1:3<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>Who being the
brightness, etc.</i></font><i> </i>The words are rendered by <i>Beza,</i>
&#8220;the effulgence of his glory, and the impress of his person;&#8221; by
<i>Doddridge,</i> &#8220;the effulgent ray of his glory, and the express
delineation of his person;&#8221; <i>by Macknight,</i> &#8220;an effulgence of
his glory, and an exact image of his substance;&#8221; and by <i>Stuart,</i>
&#8220;the radiance of his glory, and the exact image of his substance.&#8221;
The word &#8220;brightness,&#8221; does not adequately express the meaning of
the first word, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpau&gt;gasma</font>,
which signifies an emitted light, a splendor proceeding from an object. The most
suitable word would be, outshining, or irradiation, &#8220;the outshining of his
glory.&#8221; The &#8220;express image&#8221; of our version is the impress, the
engraven or impressed form, derived from the archetype. And
&#8220;impress,&#8221; as given by <i>Beza, </i>fully expresses it.<br></div>
<div>The words are doubtless metaphorical, but the idea is this &#8212; that
Christ, as a Mediator, as the Son of God in human nature, exactly represents
what God is, being the very image of him who is invisible.
&#8220;Substance,&#8221; or essence, is the divine nature in all its glorious
and incomprehensible attributes of power, wisdom, holiness, justice, and
goodness. These and other perfections are exhibited in Christ perfectly, and in
such a way that we can look on them, and in a measure understand them. Hence he
said, &#8220;He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father,&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431409&gt;</font></sup>John 14:9.<br></div>
<div>The word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpo&gt;stasiv,</font><i>
</i>does not mean a &#8220;person,&#8221; either in Scripture or in classic
writers. It is a meaning invented by the fathers during the Arian controversy.
As used in the <i>Sept. </i>and in the New Testament, it means foundation or
basis, <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;264311&gt;</font></sup>Ezekiel 43:11,
&#8212; substance, <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D915&gt;</font></sup>Psalm
139:15, &#8212; expectation,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193811&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 38:11, &#8212; and
confidence, <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470904&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians
9:4. Its classic meaning, according to <i>Stuart, </i>is foundation,
steadfastness, courage, purpose, resolution, determination, substance, essence,
being. There is in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510115&gt;</font></sup>Colossians 1:15, a phrase
of a similar import, with &#8220;the impress of his substance,&#8221; where
Christ is said to be &#8220;the image
(<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ei]cwn</font><i> &#8212; </i>the
likeness) of the invisible God.&#8221; The substance or essence is &#8220;the
invisible God,&#8221; and &#8220;the impress&#8221; is &#8220;the
image.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>&#8220;In the opinion,&#8221; says <i>Stuart,</i> &#8220;that the verse now
under consideration relates to the incarnate Messiah, and not to the Logos in
his divine nature simply considered, I find that Scott and Beza concur, not to
mention others of the most respectable commentators.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>It was the mistaken view which the fathers took of the passage that led
them to invent a new meaning to the word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpo&gt;stasiv</font>; and many have
followed them.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX B</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 1:5.</b><font color="Maroon"><i> Thou art my Son,
etc</i></font>. It is to be observed that Christ <i>is</i> called a Son when his
prophetic office is referred to, ver. 2, when spoken of as a king, ver. 8, when
his priesthood is mentioned, chapter 5:5, and when a comparison is made between
him and Moses, chapter 3:6. But as a king over his people is he represented here
as superior to angels; and David as his type was also called a son because he
was a king. Christ is said here to have derived his name by
&#8220;inheritance&#8221; &#8212; from whom? The Apostle refers throughout to
the Old Testament; and what does Peter say That David, being a Prophet, knew
that God &#8220;would raise up Christ to sit <i>on his </i>throne,&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440230&gt;</font></sup>Acts 2:30. Then the
inheritance in this instance was from David. Christ is God&#8217;s
<i>only-begotten </i>Son as to his divine nature; but he is also a Son in a
peculiar manner, superior to all others, that is, as a Prophet, Priest, and
King. There were types of him in these offices; but they were only types, and
therefore far inferior to him even as to these offices. And angels never
sustained such offices.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX C</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 1:6<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>And again when he
bringeth, etc</i></font><i>. </i>Critics have found some difficulty in the order
in which the particles are arranged here, and have proposed a transposition,
which is not at all necessary. The word &#8220;first-begotten,&#8221; or
first-born, seems to have been used on account of what the previous verse
contains. The words, &#8220;Today have I begotten thee,&#8221; refer clearly to
the resurrection; and Christ is said to have been &#8220;the first-born from the
dead,&#8221; <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510118&gt;</font></sup>Colossians
1:18. Having then referred to Christ&#8217;s resurrection, he now as it were
goes back to his birth, or to the announcement made in prophecy of his coming
into the world, and seems to say, that not only when he became the first-born
from the dead he attained a manifested superiority over angels, but even at his
first introduction into the world, for they were commanded even to worship him.
&#8220;And when again,&#8221; or also, or moreover, &#8220;he introduces,&#8221;
etc.; as though he had said, &#8220;God owned him as his Son by raising him from
the dead; and again, or in addition to this, when he introduced him into the
world, he commanded the angels to worship him.&#8221; So that the subordination
of angels was evident before his resurrection, even at his very introduction
into the world.<br></div>
<div><i>Stuart </i>considers his introduction to be his birth, and regards the
words, &#8220;and let all the angels of God worship him,&#8221; as borrowed,
though not literally, from
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;199707&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 97:7, to express what
is intimated in the account of his birth,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420210&gt;</font></sup>Luke 2:10-14. The Hebrews,
written to, were, he supposes, acquainted with that event.<br></div>
<div>This is the view taken by some of the fathers, <i>Chrysostom </i>and
others. But some, as <i>Mede, </i>thinking the quotation a prophecy, consider
that his second coming is intended, as the contents of the Psalm were deemed to
be descriptive of the day of judgment. A third party, as Dr. <i>Owen, </i>view
the introduction to be Christ&#8217;s birth, and consider the Psalm as giving an
allegorical description of the progress of the Gospel in the world; and this
seems to be the view taken by <i>Calvin, </i>and is apparently the most
consistent.<br></div>
<div>The difference in the quotation is quite immaterial. The words in the Psalm
are, &#8220;Worship him all gods,&#8221; or rather angels; for so is the word
sometimes rendered. The version of the <i>Sept. </i>is<i>,</i> &#8220;Worship
him all ye his angels;&#8221; and here &#8220;God &#8220;is put instead of
&#8220;his.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX D</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 1:10.</b><font color="Maroon"> <i>Thou, Lord, etc.</i></font><i>
</i>The quotation is literally from the <i>Sept., </i>only the order of the
words in the first sentence is changed; and it is literally the Hebrew, except
that <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">su&lt; cu&gt;zie </font>are added.
The Hebrew is, &#8220;Of old the earth hast thou founded, and the work of thy
hands are the heavens.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>Nothing can more clearly prove the <i>divine </i>nature of Christ than this
quotation; and it settles at once the meaning of
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aijw~nav</font><i>; </i>in the 2nd verse,
as it confirms the truth that Christ, the Messiah, being not only the Son but
also the only-begotten of God, is the Creator of the world, even the earth and
the heavens, as here stated. Nor can the word have any other meaning in chapter
9:26, and 11:3.<br></div>
<div>It is generally admitted that this Psalm refers to Christ; and Dr. <i>Owen
</i>mentions three particulars in proof of this, &#8212; the redemption of the
Church, verses 13 and 16, &#8212; the call of the Gentiles, verses 15, 21, and
22, &#8212; and the creation of a new people, verse 18; and he adds, that the
Jews themselves refer the last thing to the time of the Messiah.<br></div>
<div>Referring to the words, &#8220;as a vesture,&#8221; the same author
beautifully observes, that the whole creation is like God&#8217;s vesture, by
which he shews himself to men in his power and wisdom, and that hence it is
said, that he &#8220;clothes himself with light as with a garment,&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A402&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 104:2.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX E</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 1:14<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>Are they not all
ministering spirits, etc</i></font><i>. </i>It is said of Christ also, that he
was a minister or a servant; but while he was a servant, he was at the same time
the Lord of all, which cannot be said of angels. Yet as a servant he was
superior to them; for he became so in a work which they were not capable of
doing. So that as a servant a superiority belongs to him. But his office as a
servant is not contemplated here. Indeed all the names given to him, in common
either with men on earth or with angels in heaven, mean very different things
when applied to him; such as son, servant, priest, king, Savior, etc.<br></div>
<div>It ought to be born in mind that throughout this chapter Christ is spoken
of in his character of a Mediator, and not as to his divine nature simply
considered, and that the reference is made, as to his superiority over angels,
to the testimonies in the Old Testament. He is in this chapter represented as
superior to angels, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>1. </b></font>Because he is called in a peculiar
respect a Son.<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>2.</b></font> Because angels were commanded to
worship him.<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>3.</b></font> Because he is addressed as having an
eternal throne, and being honored more than all his associates as a
king.<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>4.</b></font> Because he is the Creator of the
world.<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>5.</b></font> And lastly, because there is a promise
made to him that all his enemies shall be finally subdued, while angels are only
employed in ministering to his people.<br></div>
<div>Who, after duly considering all these things, can possibly come to any
other conclusion than that the Messiah is a divine person as well as human?
Angels are commanded to worship him, his throne is eternal, he created this
world, and all his enemies shall finally be made his footstool. That he is
sometimes spoken of as having a delegated power, as in verse 2, &#8220;by whom
he (God) made the world,&#8221; and sometimes as acting independently, as in
verse 10, &#8220;Thou, Lord, hast founded the earth;&#8221; all this only
proves, that as he is inferior to the Father in his mediatorial office, so he is
one with the Father as his only-begotten Son. Creation is what God claims as
peculiarly his own work; and were not the Son one in essence with the Father,
creation could not have been ascribed to him.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX F</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 2:1.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Le</i>s<i>t at any time we
should let them</i> <i>slip.</i></font><i> </i>Much has been written as to the
meaning of the verb here used. It is said by <i>Schleusner </i>that it signifies
two things, &#8220;to flow through,&#8221; as waters through a sieve or a leaky
vessel, and &#8220;to flow by,&#8221; as a river. It is used mostly in the
latter sense. <i>Chrysostom </i>and others, both ancient and modern, give it the
sense of falling away or perishing; but, according to <i>Stuart, </i>there is no
instance either in Scripture or the classics which countenances such a meaning.
As it was often the case, so here, the fathers gave what they conceived to be
the general sense, without attending to the precise meaning of the word used;
and thus their propositions are often very loose. Besides, most of them were
wholly ignorant of the language of the Old Testament.<br></div>
<div>To flow by, in the sense of escaping, is its meaning in classical authors;
and <i>Stuart </i>says that all the examples commonly referred to apply only to
<i>things, </i>and not to <i>persons. </i>The word only occurs here in the New
Testament, and once in the <i>Sept.; </i>and there also it refers to a person,
and is clearly used <i>transitively. </i>The passage is
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;200321&gt;</font></sup>Proverbs 3:21, &#8220;O
son, pass not by (or disregard not,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mh&lt; pararjrJuh~v</font>, flow not by,)
but keep (or retain, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">th&gt;rhson</font>)
my counsel and thought.&#8221; The form of the sentence is different in Hebrew,
but the idea is here preserved, &#8220;My son, let them not depart from thine
eyes; keep (retain) sound wisdom and discretion.&#8221; Not to suffer them to
depart from the eyes, is the same as not to pass them by or disregard them.
There is no other idea compatible with the context; and it is what exactly suits
this passage. Then the sentence would be, &#8220;Lest we should at any time
disregard (or neglect) them.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>It is justly observed by <i>Stuart, </i>that everything in the whole
passage is in favor of this meaning: it is the opposite of &#8220;taking
heed;&#8221; and it is often the case in Scripture that the negative idea is
stated as well as the positive, and <i>vice versa. </i>Besides, in verse 3 the
same idea is presented to us on the same subject, &#8220;If we
<i>neglect,</i>&#8221;<i> etc. </i>Indeed, to disregard or neglect may be deemed
as the <i>consequence </i>of not taking heed or attending to a thing.
Inattention to truth is followed by the neglect of what it teaches and
inculcates. Unless we earnestly attend to what we hear, we shall inevitably
neglect what is required. There may be some attention without performance; but
there can be no performance without attention.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX G</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 2:7<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>Thou madest him,
etc</i></font><i>. </i>The reference is to Psalm 8, and has been variously
explained. There are especially three opinions on the subject. Some, like
<i>Calvin </i>and <i>Doddridge, </i>consider that the case of &#8220;man,&#8221;
as described in the Psalm, is <i>alluded </i>to, or accommodated to Christ.
Others, like <i>Grotius, </i>hold that &#8220;man,&#8221; in the Psalm, is to be
understood historically and mystically. The third party, as most of the Fathers,
as well as some later divines, such as <i>Beza, </i>Dr. <i>Owen., </i>and
<i>Stuart, </i>maintain that the Psalm is strictly prophetic. What makes it
difficult to regard it in this light is the exclamation, &#8220;What is
man?&#8221; and also the dominion over the brute creation, which is the only
thing mentioned in the Psalm as constituting the glory and honor of
man.<br></div>
<div>All critics refer on this subject to the grant given to Adam in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010128&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 1:28. But this
grant, forfeited no doubt by Adam&#8217;s sin and fall, was afterwards renewed
to Noah and his sons, when they came out of the ark, and was even enlarged, as
the permission to eat animal food was given them.
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010901&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 9:1-3. It was this
grant no doubt the Psalmist had in view. Noah and his sons were men of faith;
Noah is distinctly said to have been a righteous man. It was to them as bearing
this character that the grant was made. What Adam forfeited was restored to
those restored to God&#8217;s favor, that is, the dominion over the brute
creation and the inheritance of this lower world. But as Canaan was afterwards
to the Israelites a type of heaven, and also a pledge to those who were
Israelites indeed, so might be regarded the possession of the earth granted to
Noah and his sons, though dominion in which &#8220;glory and honor&#8221;
consisted, is what is expressly mentioned in the Psalm; and dominion is the
special subject handled by the Apostle, verse 5.<br></div>
<div>Though man, as to his nature, is inferior to the angels, yet in that nature
God has granted him a dominion never granted to angels. The power over every
living thing in the world was bestowed, not on angels, but on man, according to
the testimony of the Old Testament; so that the power ascribed by the Jews to
angels was not warranted by their own Scriptures. This fact seems to have been
referred to as an introduction to what the Apostle was proceeding to say
respecting Christ, and as an evidence that his human nature, though in itself
inferior to that of angels, did not detract from his superiority; as though he
had said, &#8220;It is no objection that he became man, for even to man, not to
angels, has been granted the dominion of the world.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>Then the Apostle extends the idea, and refers to Christ as one who was to
make good the grant made. The dominion promised to man, especially what that
dominion was a pledge of, was not attained by man; but Christ, who has assumed
his nature, and in this respect became lower than the angels, will yet attain it
for him. It is through Christ indeed that we obtain a right to the things of
this world as well as to the things of the next world. God promises both to his
people; but in Christ only are his promises, yea and amen. The promise made to
man as a believer, both as to this world and the next, is as it were made good
only through Christ, who assumed his nature for this very purpose.<br></div>
<div>By taking this view we avoid the necessity of making that prophetic which
has no appearance of being so, or of supposing that the Psalm is referred to by
way of accommodation. The fact respecting man restored to God&#8217;s favor is
stated, and the Apostle teaches us that the dominion granted to him can only be
realized through Christ, who has already attained that dominion in his own
person, and will eventually confer it on all his people.<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 2:9.</b><font color="Maroon"> <i>That he by the grace of God,
etc</i>.</font> How to connect the different parts of this verse has been a
difficulty which critics have in various ways attempted to remove. There is
hardly a sense in our version. We must either regard a transposition in the
words, or, like <i>Stuart, </i>give the meaning of <i>when </i>to
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">o[pwv</font>, &#8220;when by the grace of
God he had tasted death for all.&#8221; But this is an unnatural meaning, and
therefore not satisfactory. <i>Doddrid</i>g<i>e </i>supposes a transposition,
and gives this version, &#8212;<br></div>
<div>&#8220;But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for
the suffering of death, that by the grace of God he might taste death for every
man, crowned with glory and honor.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><i>Macknight </i>more properly connects &#8220;the suffering of
death&#8221; with &#8220;crowned with glory and honor,&#8221; while he makes a
similar transposition. <i>Bloomfield </i>considers that there is an ellipsis in
the last clause, and gives this rendering, &#8212;<br></div>
<div>&#8220;But him, who was made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, we
behold, on account of having suffered death, crowned with glory and honor, which
suffering he bore, in order that by the grace of God he might taste of death for
every man.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>This borders on tautology, and cannot be admitted. That the transposition
made by <i>Doddridge </i>and <i>Macknight </i>gives the real meaning, admits
hardly of a doubt; and such a version would be the most suitable in our
language. But how to account for the arrangement in the Apostle&#8217;s words
seems to be this, it is a construction according to the system of Hebrew
parallelism; the first and the last clause are connected, and the second and the
third. Let the verse be arranged in lines, and this will become quite evident,
&#8212;<br></div>
<div>&#8220;But him, who was made a little lower than angels, &#8212; We behold,
<i>even </i>Jesus, for the suffering of death, Crowned with glory and honor,
&#8212; That by God&#8217;s grace he might for all taste death.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>The meaning is clearly this, &#8212; that he was made lower than angels in
order to die for all, and that on account of his atoning death he was crowned
with glory and honor; which perfectly accords with what the Apostle teaches us
in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502308&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 2:8-10. See
a similar arrangement in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400706&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 7:6, and
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460611&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians
6:11.<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 2:14</b><i>. </i><font color="Maroon"><i>The power of death,
etc</i></font><i>. </i>This is rendered by <i>Stuart</i> &#8220;deadly
power.&#8221; The genitive after
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">cra&gt;tov</font>; is no doubt in several
instances rendered adjectively, as &#8220;the power of his glory,&#8221; in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510111&gt;</font></sup>Colossians 1:11, &#8220;his
glorious power;&#8221; and &#8220;the power of his might,&#8221; in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490610&gt;</font></sup>Ephesians 6:10, may be
rendered &#8220;His mighty power.&#8221; But there is here an antithesis which
ought to be preserved, &#8212; the death of Christ and the death over which
Satan is said to have power. Christ by his death deprived Satan of his power to
cause death.<br></div>
<div>To &#8220;destroy&#8221; does not suitably express what is meant by the
verb here used. It means to render void, useless, inefficacious, and hence to
overcome, to subdue. When applied to the Law, it means to render void or to
abolish: but when it refers to a person, as here, or to a hostile power, as in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461524&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 15:24, it
means to subjugate, to put down, or to overcome. So here, the rendering most
suitable would be, &#8220;that by death he might overcome (or subdue) him who
had the power of death,&#8221; that is, the power of causing eternal ruin; for
death here must mean the second death. And hence the Rabbinical notion about the
angel of death, that is, of temporal death, has no connection with this
passage.<br></div>
<div>There is here evidently an allusion to
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010313&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 3:13. The
originator of death is Satan, both as to the soul and the body; and hence our
Savior calls him a murderer. To subdue this murderer was to remove the sin which
he introduced, by means of which he brought in death; and this removal of sin
was effected by death, so that the remedy for sin was the same with the effect
which sin produced.<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 2:16<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>For verily he
took not, etc</i></font><i>. </i>The words may be rendered, &#8220;For verily he
lays not hold on angels, but on the seed of Abraham does he lay hold.&#8221;
Both early and later divines have supposed &#8220;nature&#8221; to be
understood; but some moderns, following <i>Cameron </i>of an earlier age, regard
the verb in the sense of bringing aid or help. So <i>Stuart </i>and
<i>Bloomfield. </i>The first renders the verse thus, &#8212;<br></div>
<div>&#8220;Besides, he doth not at all help the angels, but he helpeth the seed
of Abraham.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>The present, the historical present, is used for the past; or if we render
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ouj ga&lt;r dh&gt;pou</font> &#8220;for
nowhere,&#8221; the reference is to Scripture; nowhere in Scripture is such a
thing recorded.<br></div>
<div>But to &#8220;take hold on&#8221; is sufficiently plain and very
expressive. Christ took hold on Peter when he was sinking,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401431&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 14:31:) it is the
same verb. Our Savior took not hold on the angels when sinking into ruin, but he
did take hold on the seed of Abraham to save them from perdition. The connection
seems to be with the preceding verses; therefore
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ga&lt;r</font><i> </i>ought to be
rendered &#8220;for&#8221; and not &#8220;besides,&#8221; as by <i>Stuart,
</i>nor &#8220;moreover,&#8221; as by <i>Macknight. </i>A<i> </i>reason is given
why Christ became partaker of flesh and blood; and the reason was, because he
did not come to deliver angels but the seed of Abraham; that is, his spiritual,
not his natural seed, for he speaks throughout of God&#8217;s sons and
God&#8217;s children. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430112&gt;</font></sup>John 1:12, 13, where the
born of God are represented to be those to whom Christ grants the privilege of
children.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX L</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 3:4</b><font color="Maroon"><b><i>.</i></b><i> He that built,
etc.</i></font><i> </i>This verse has been considered as difficult with respect
to the connection it has with the argument of the Apostle. <i>Stuart </i>states
thus the difficulty, &#8212; &#8220;Moses as the <i>delegate </i>of God was the
founder of the Jewish institution, and Christ is merely declared to be only a
<i>delegated founder, </i>then in what way does the writer make out the
superiority of Christ to Moses. Both were delegates of the same God, and both
the founders of a new and divine dispensation. If Christ, then, is not here
asserted to be founder in some other character than that of a <i>delegate, </i>I
am unable to perceive any force in the writer&#8217;s argument.&#8221; Hence the
Professor comes to the conclusion, that Christ is meant by the Apostle when he
says, &#8220;He who built (or formed) all things is God,&#8221; conceiving that
the argument is otherwise inconclusive.<br></div>
<div>Now, the mistake of the Professor is this, that he makes delegation to be
the comparison and not the <i>character </i>of the delegation. That
Christ&#8217;s power was delegated is quite evident from this passage: Christ is
said to have been &#8220;appointed&#8221; in verse 2, and is said to be
&#8220;faithful,&#8221; which implies that he had an office delegated to him.
Then the delegation is undeniable; and what the Apostle evidently dwells upon is
the superiority of the delegated power: Moses was faithful as a servant in
God&#8217;s house; the people of Israel were previously Gods adopted people; but
Christ has power, a delegated power, to make as it were a new people; he builds
his own house. Moses was a part of the house in which he served; but as Christ
builds his own house, he is worthy of more glory than Moses. These are the
comparisons made by the Apostle.<br></div>
<div>Then this verse is introduced, and that for two reasons, &#8212; first, to
shew that God built the house in which Moses served; and secondly, to intimate
the divine power of Christ, as none but God builds all things. Moses&#8217;
house is called God&#8217;s house in verse 2; and Christ&#8217;s house is called
his own in verse 5. Hence the obvious inference is, that he is one with God, as
God only builds all things, though in his Mediatorial character he acts as
God&#8217;s Apostle and high priest. The same kind of representation we find in
the first chapter: it is said that by him God made the world; and afterwards
that the Son is the Creator, who had founded the earth, and whose work are the
heavens. Creative power, though exercised by Christ as a Mediator, must yet be a
divine power.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX M</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 3:9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Tempted, etc.</i></font> To
understand this passage we must bear in mind the event referred to. The same
year in which the people of Israel came forth from Egypt, they were distressed
for water at Rephidim,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;021701&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 17:1;) and the
place had two names given to it, Massah and Meribah, because the people tempted
God and chided with Moses. The Lord did not swear <i>then </i>that they should
not enter into the land of Canaan; but this was on the following year, after the
return of the spies.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;041420&gt;</font></sup>Numbers 14:20-38.) And God
said then that they had tempted him &#8220;ten times;&#8221; that is, during the
short time since their deliverance from Egypt. It was after <i>ten
</i>temptations that God deprived them of the promised land.<br></div>
<div>Bearing in mind these facts, we shall be able to see the full force of the
passage. The &#8220;provocation&#8221; or contention, and
&#8220;temptation&#8221; refer clearly to the latter instance, as recorded in
Numbers 14, because it was then that God swear that the people should not enter
into his rest. The people&#8217;s conduct was alike in both instances.<br></div>
<div>To connect &#8220;forty years&#8221; with &#8220;grieved&#8221; was the
work of the Punctuists, and this mistake the Apostle corrected; and it is to be
observed that he did not follow in this instance the <i>Septuagint, </i>in which
the words are arranged as divided by the Masorites. Such a rendering as would
correspond with the Hebrew is as follows, &#8212; &#8220;Today when ye hear his
voice,<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>8.</b></font> Harden not your hearts as in the
provocation, In the day of temptation in the wilderness.<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>9.</b></font> When your fathers tempted me, they
proved me And saw my works forty years:<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>10</b></font> I was therefore offended with that
generation and said, Always do they go astray in heart, And they have not known
my ways;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>11.</b></font> So that I swear in my wrath, They
shall by no means enter into my rest.&#8217;&#8221;<br></div>
<div>The meaning of the ninth verse is, that when the children of Israel tempted
God, they proved him, <i>i.e., </i>found out by bitter experience how great his
displeasure was, and saw his works or his dealings with them for forty years. He
retained them in the wilderness during that period until the death of all who
disbelieved his word at the return of the spies; he gave them this proof of his
displeasure. &#8220;Therefore&#8221; in verse 11 is connected with
&#8220;tempted;&#8221; it was because they tempted him that he was offended with
them so as to swear that they should not enter into his rest. There is evidently
a <font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font> left out in Hebrew, found
only in one MS.; but it is required by the future form of the verb. To &#8220;go
astray in heart&#8221; was to disbelieve God&#8217;s word, (see verse 12, and
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;041411&gt;</font></sup>Numbers 14:11;) and not to
have known Gods ways, was not to recognize his power, and goodness, and
faithfulness in their deliverance from Egypt. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;041422&gt;</font></sup>Numbers 14:22. Not to know
here does not mean what <i>Stuart </i>says, not to approve, but not to
comprehend or understand God&#8217;s ways, or not to recognize them as his ways
or doings.<br></div>
<div>The last line is in the form of an oath, &#8220;If they shall enter,&#8221;
etc.; but when in this defective form, the &#8220;if&#8221; may be rendered as a
strong negative, &#8220;by no means.&#8221; <i>Doddridge </i>has

be so viewed, yet it seems not to be right to translate

<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX Q</font><br></div>
<div>&#8220;Quick&#8221; or living, and &#8220;powerful&#8221; or efficacious,
are regarded by many as meaning nearly the same thing; but &#8220;living&#8221;
designates what is valid, what continues in force, as opposed to what is dead
and no longer existing; and &#8220;efficacious&#8221; refers to the effect,
capable of producing the effect designed. Exclusion from rest as to unbelievers
was still living, still in force, abiding the same without any change. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600123&gt;</font></sup>1 Peter 1:23, 25. It was
also in full power so as effectually to exclude from rest all who did not
believe. And then to prevent every evasion, so that no one might think a mere
profession sufficient, or rather to guard against the incipient seduction of
sin, he compares this &#8220;word&#8221; to a sword which can dissect the whole
well-compacted frame of man, so that even the very marrow may be discovered; and
then passing from this simile, he says that this &#8220;word&#8221; is capable
of judging the thoughts and purposes of the heart. And in order to identify as
it were this &#8220;word&#8221; with God himself; he immediately refers to
God&#8217;s omniscience. The design of the Apostle seems to have been to guard
the Hebrews against the deceitfulness of sin; so that they might not give heed
to any of its hidden suggestions.<br></div>
<div><i>Stuart </i>makes the transition from the &#8220;word&#8221; to God at
the end of the twelfth verse, and renders the clause thus, &#8220;He also
judgeth the thoughts and purposes of the heart.&#8221; But this clause may more
properly be viewed as explanatory of what is said of the two-edged
sword.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX R</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 4:12.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Two-edged sword,
etc</i></font><i>. </i>Whether the penetrating, or convincing, or killing power
of the &#8220;word&#8221; is set forth by the metaphor of the
&#8220;sword,&#8221; has been controverted. <i>Beza </i>and <i>Scott, </i>as
well as <i>Calvin, </i>regard its convincing <i>and </i>killing power as
intended. &#8220;It enters,&#8221; says <i>Beta,</i> &#8220;into the inmost
recesses of the soul, so that it indicts on the perverse a deadly wound, and by
killing the old man quickens into life the elect.&#8221; <i>Stuart </i>views its
killing power as alone intended: &#8220;The sense is,&#8221; he observes,
&#8220;that the divine commination is of <i>most deadly </i>punitive
efficacy.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>Now, if the whole passage be duly considered in connection with what is
gone before, there will appear a sufficient reason to conclude, that the
metaphor of &#8220;the sword &#8220;is only intended to shew that the
&#8220;word&#8221; reaches to all the inward workings of the soul, that it
extends to the motives and the most hidden thoughts and purposes of the heart.
The last clause in the 12th verse clearly explains what is meant by the
&#8220;sword;&#8221; and this is further confirmed by the following verse, where
it is said that all things are naked and open to God, of whose word he speaks,
and with whom we have to do. All this seems to concur with the purpose for which
the words were introduced, that is, to warn the Hebrews of the danger of
listening to the seductive and deceiving power of sin.<br></div>
<div>As to the 13th verse, <i>Bloomfield </i>suggests a transposition which
would render the transition from God&#8217;s word to God himself much more easy,
&#8220;Moreover there exists no creature that is not manifest in the sight of
him with whom we have to do; but all things are naked and exposed to his
eyes.&#8221; But the construction here is similar to what we have noticed in two
previous instances, chapter 2:9, and 17, 18; the first and the last clause are
connected, and the two middle clauses.<br></div>
<div>The last sentence is rendered by <i>Grotius,</i> &#8220;of whom is our
word, <i>i.e., </i>of whom we speak; by <i>Beza,</i> &#8220;with whom we have to
do; by <i>Doddridge, Macknig</i>h<i>t, </i>and <i>Stuart,</i> &#8220;to whom we
must give an account.&#8221; Wherever
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">lo&gt;gov</font> signifies
&#8220;account,&#8221; the verb &#8220;to render,&#8221; or a similar verb is
connected with it. There are two instances in the <i>Sept. </i>where it stands
alone with a pronoun in the dative case as here, and it means <i>business,

passage it is connected also, as here, with the preposition
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pro&lt;v</font>. There can therefore be
no doubt but that our version is the right one, &#8220;with whom we have to
do,&#8221; or literally, &#8220;with whom <i>there is </i>to us a
concern.&#8221; There is no <i>usus loquendi, </i>as pleaded by some, in favor
of the other meaning.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX S</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 6:1</b>. <font color="Maroon"><i>Therefore leaving,
etc</i></font><i>. </i>Authors differ as to the character of this passage,
whether it be hortatory or didactic, that is, whether the Apostle, putting
himself as it were with them, exhorts them to advance in knowledge, or,
discharging the office of a teacher, he intimates the course which he means to
pursue. <i>Stuart </i>and some others, as well as <i>Calvin, </i>take the first
view, as though the Apostle had said, &#8220;As the perfect or grown up are
alone capable of receiving strong food, it behooves us to quit the state of
childhood and to advance into the state of manhood, so as to attain perfect
knowledge.&#8221; It is said that this view comports better with what follows,
&#8220;for it is impossible,&#8221; etc.<br></div>
<div>But there are especially two things in the passage which militate against
this view, first, &#8220;not laying the foundation,&#8221; etc. which refers
evidently to teaching; and secondly, the third verse, which also refers to
teaching.<br></div>
<div>It is usual with the Apostle to speak of himself in the plural number: see,
for instance, the 9th verse. &#8220;Therefore&#8221; is a general inference from
what he had been saying, and not from a particular clause, as though he had
said, &#8220;Such being the case with you, let me now therefore, in order to
draw you onward, leave the first principles, and proceed to state things which
are suitable to advanced Christians: it is not my purpose now to preach
repentance and faith in which you have been already taught, and to do this is
unavailing as to those who have fallen away; &#8216;for it is
impossible,&#8217;&#8221; etc. His object was not to convert them to the faith,
but to confirm and advance them in it.<br></div>
<div>Or the whole argument may be more fully stated thus, &#8212; &#8220;What I
design now to do is not to call you to repentance and faith, to require you to
be baptized that you might receive the miraculous gift of the Holy Ghost, and to
teach you the doctrine of the resurrection as confirmed by our Savior&#8217;s
resurrection, and of the day of judgment, when a sentence shall be pronounced on
the just and unjust which shall never be reversed; for all these things have
been long known to you, and you have made a long profession of them: there is
therefore no need of taking such a course, nor is it of any benefit, for if you
fall away, it is impossible to restore you again to repentance.&#8221; But
instead of making the case personal to them, he states it generally. He thus
most powerfully stimulated them to make advances in the knowledge of divine
truths; for not to advance is to retrograde, and to retrograde is the direct way
to apostasy.<br></div>

variously explained.<br></div>
<div><b>1<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>Enlightened</i></font><i>,
&#8212; </i>baptized, say most of the fathers, and some moderns too, but without
any countenance from the use of the word in Scripture, either in the New
Testament or in the <i>Sept. </i>It means to emit light, to bring to light, to
enlighten, and hence to instruct, to teach. It is often used in the <i>Sept.
</i>for a word that means to teach in Hebrew. The taught, the instructed in the
duty and necessity of repentance and in Christian truth generally, were no doubt
&#8220;the enlightened.&#8221; This is the meaning given to it by <i>Crotius,
Beza, Dr</i>. <i>Owen, Doddridge, Scott, Stuart, etc.</i><br></div>
<div><b>2<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>The heavenly</i></font><i>
</i>gift, &#8212; faith &#8212; Christ &#8212; the Holy Spirit &#8212; pardon of
sins &#8212; peace of conscience &#8212; eternal life: all these have been
stated, but the first, &#8220;faith towards God,&#8221; mentioned in the first
verse, is no doubt what is meant.<br></div>
<div><b>3.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Partakers of the Holy
Ghost</i></font><i>; </i>that is, in his miraculous powers, as understood by
most; it is what is evidently intimated by &#8220;baptisms and laying on of
hands&#8221; in the second verse.<br></div>
<div><b>4<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>The good word of
God,</i></font><i> &#8212; </i>the Gospel &#8212; the Gospel covenant &#8212;
the promises of the Gospel &#8212; the heavenly inheritance: such have been the
explanations given. There are but two places where the phrase &#8220;the good
word&#8221; occurs, and that is in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242910&gt;</font></sup>Jeremiah 29:10, and in
33:14; and there it means the promise of restoration given to the Jews, and here
it clearly means the promise of the resurrection mentioned in the second
verse.<br></div>
<div><b>5.</b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>The powers of the world to
come</i></font>;<i> </i>that is, miraculous powers, say most; but
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aijw&lt;n oj me&gt;llwn,</font>
&#8220;the world to come,&#8221; says <i>Schleusner </i>never means in the New
Testament the time of the Gospel, but the future world. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401232&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 12:32;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421830&gt;</font></sup>Luke 18:30;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490121&gt;</font></sup>Ephesians 1:21. He
therefore explains the clause thus, &#8220;The power and efficacy of the
doctrine respecting the future felicity of Christians in heaven.&#8221; It would
have comported more with the &#8220;eternal judgment&#8221; in these converse,
had he said, &#8220;respecting the future state both of the saved and of the
lost in the next world;&#8221; for eternal judgment refers to both.<br></div>
<div>To &#8220;taste,&#8221; according to the usage of Scripture, is to know, to
partake of, to experience, to possess, to enjoy. It does not mean here, as some
have thought, slightly to touch a thing, or to sip it, but to know, to know
experimentally, to feel, or to enjoy.<br></div>
<div>Thus we see that there is a complete correspondence between the particulars
mentioned here and the things stated in verses 1 and 2.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX U</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 6: 4-9.</b> On the subject handled in these verses, <i>Stuart
</i>asks and answers a question thus, &#8220;Does the whole paragraph pertain to
real Christians, or to those who are such only by profession? To the former
beyond all reasonable doubt.&#8221; The question is not suitable, for the
Apostle only speaks of those who had enjoyed certain privileges, and as to
whether they were real or merely professing Christians, he does not treat of.
Paul addressed the Corinthians as &#8220;the Church of God;&#8221; and it might
in the same way be asked, &#8220;Did he address them as real Christians, or as
those who were only such by profession t&#8221; and it might be answered,
&#8220;Doubtless as real Christians.&#8221; And yet we find that he says,
&#8220;Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith.&#8221; What is spoken of
here is the <i>enjoyment </i>of certain privileges and the danger of not making
a right use of them, and even the awful doom of those who disregarded them and
turned away from the truth.<br></div>
<div>Our author indeed fully admits the doctrine of the perseverance of the
saints; but a question of this kind, not relevant to the subject, tends only to
create embarrassment. He indeed afterwards somewhat modifies it by saying, that
&#8220;God treats Christians as free agents and rational beings, and guards them
against defection, not by mere <i>physical </i>force, but by <i>moral </i>means
adapted to their nature as free and rational agents.&#8221; No doubt God thus
acts according to the whole current of Scripture; but this in no way contravenes
the truth, clearly taught in many passages, that his elect people, real
Christians, shall never perish.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX X</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 6:10.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And labor of love,
etc</i></font><i>. </i>Though <i>Griesbach </i>and others have excluded
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tou~ co&gt;pou</font>,
&#8220;labor,&#8221; from the text, yet <i>Bloomfield </i>thinks that there are
sufficient reasons for retaining the words. The greatest number of MSS. contain
them, and they seem necessary to render the passage complete, though the meaning
without them would be the same. There is here an instance of an arrangement
similar to what is found often in the Prophets, as will be seen by putting the
verse in lines, &#8212;<br></div>
<div>&#8220;For not unrighteous is God, To forget your work, And the labor of
that love Which ye have shewed to his name, Having ministered and ministering to
the saints.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>Excluding the first line, we see that the first and last are connected, and
the two middle lines. Their &#8220;work&#8221; was to minister to the saints;
and in addition to this there was &#8220;the labor of that love&#8221; which
they manifested towards God. He would not forget their work in aiding the
saints, nor the love which they had shewn towards his name by an open profession
of it, and activity and zeal in God&#8217;s service. <i>Grotius </i>says that
&#8220;the labor of love&#8221; was in behalf of the Christian faith.<br></div>
<div><i>Stuart </i>says that &#8220;work&#8221; was the outward act, and that
&#8220;love&#8221; was the principle from which it emanated. Examples of this
kind no doubt occur often in Scripture, the not being first stated, and then the
inward principle or motive; but if &#8220;labor&#8221; be retained, this view
cannot be maintained.<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 6:11.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>To the full assurance,
etc.</i></font> The preposition
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pro&lt;v</font>, &#8220;to,&#8221; may be
rendered &#8220;with regard to, in respect of&#8221; If this meaning be given to
it, then the diligence required was with reference to the full assurance of
hope: they were to exercise diligence in order that they might enjoy the
assurance of hope to the end. But if the preposition be rendered &#8220;for the
sake of,&#8221; as by <i>Stuart, </i>then the meaning is, that they were to
exercise the same diligence as they had already exhibited in the work and labor
of love, for the purpose of attaining the full assurance of hope.<br></div>
<div>Now <i>Calvin </i>takes the first meaning; he considers that the Apostle
now refers to the full assurance of hope or of faith as he regards it, as he had
before spoken of the works of benevolence. What follows seems to favor this
view, for the Apostle proceeds to speak of faith and patience as exemplified by
the fathers, especially by Abraham.<br></div>
<div>Some, as <i>Beza, </i>connect &#8220;to the end&#8221; with &#8220;shewing
the same diligence,&#8221; but it is more suitable to connect them with
&#8220;the assurance of hope,&#8221; as it is done by most.<br></div>
<div>The remarks of <i>Scott </i>on the difference of &#8220;the assurance of
hope,&#8221; of &#8220;the understanding,&#8221; and of &#8220;faith,&#8221; are
so clear and discriminating that they shall be added, &#8212;<br></div>
<div>&#8220;He who so understands the Gospel as to perceive the relation of each
part to all the rest, and its use as a part of some great design, in something
of the same manner that a skillful anatomist understands the use and office of
every part of the human body, in relation to the whole, has <i>the full
assurance of understanding; </i>and those things willful appear inconsistent,
useless, or superfluous to others, he perceives essentially necessary to the
system or the great design. The man who is fully convinced that this consistent
and harmonious though complicated design is the work and revelation of God, and
has no doubt the things testified are true, that the promises and threatenings
will be fulfilled, and that Christ will certainly save all true believers, has
<i>the full assurance of faith, </i>though he may through misapprehension, or
temptation, or other causes, doubt of his own personal interest in this
salvation. But he, who beyond doubt or hesitation is assured that he himself is
a true believer, interested in all the precious promises, sealed by the
sanctifying Spirit, and &#8216;a partaker of the glory that shall be
revealed,&#8217; has <i>the full assurance of hope.</i>&#8221;<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 7<i>:</i>14</b><font color="Maroon"><b><i>.</i></b><i> For under
it the people received the Law, etc</i></font><i>. </i>These words are variously
explained. The preposition
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpi&lt;</font> often means
&#8220;for,&#8221; or &#8220;on the account of,&#8221; as
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpj ejlpi&gt;di</font>, &#8220;for the
hope,&#8221; (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442606&gt;</font></sup>Acts 26:6;)
and so <i>Macknight </i>renders it here &#8220;on account of it the people
received the Law.&#8221; It is not true that the people were under the
priesthood when they were subjected to the Law; for the Law was given before the
Levitical priesthood was established: it was after the tabernacle was made and
set up that Aaron and his sons were consecrated priests. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;024012&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 40:12-15.<br></div>
<div><i>Stuart </i>gives another rendering, &#8220;For the Law was given to the
people in connection with this,&#8221; or &#8220;on this condition,&#8221; as he
explains himself in a note. And he observes, &#8220;The meaning is, that the
Levitical priesthood and the Mosaic Law are closely and inseparably linked
together.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>As the Apostle speaks afterwards of the change of the Law, that is,
respecting the priesthood, it is more consistent to regard the same law as
intended here, &#8220;though the people had received a law respecting it,&#8221;
that is, the priesthood. This is parenthetically put in for two reasons, &#8212;
to anticipate an objection on the ground of a divine appointment, and to
introduce the subject for the purpose of shewing that it was an appointment
intended to be changed.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX A 2</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 7:11-17.</b> This passage may be thus rendered,
&#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>11.</b></font>  &#8220;Now if indeed perfection were
by the Levitical priesthood, (though the people had received a law respecting
it,) what need was there still that another priest should rise after the order
of Melchisedec, and not to be named after the order<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>12</b></font>. of Aaron? The priesthood then being
changed, there is of<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>13. </b></font>necessity a change also of the law;
for he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from whom no
one<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>14. </b></font>attended at the altar. It is indeed
evident that our Lord sprang from Judah, of which tribe Moses said
nothing<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>15.</b></font> respecting the priesthood. And this is
still more manifest, since according to the likeness of Melchisedec rises
another<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>16.</b></font> priest; who is made, not according to
the law of carnal<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>17.</b></font> precept, but according to the power of
perpetual life; for he testifies, &#8216;Thou art a priest for ever, according
to the order of Melchisedec.&#8217;&#8221;<br></div>
<div>&#8220;The law of carnal precept&#8221; is the rule that refers to the
present life, life in the flesh, which is frail and uncertain; and contrasted
with it is &#8220;perpetual life, which belongs to Christ as a priest, according
to the quotation which follows. The meaning is, that Christ was not made a
priest according to that law which regulates things belonging to dying men, (see
verse 23,) but in accordance with what was suitable to one endued with permanent
life or existence.<br></div>
<div>The argument of the whole passage seems to be as follows, &#8212; There is
no perfection in the Levitical priesthood, for another priest has been
appointed. This being the case, the law respecting the priesthood must
necessarily be changed; and that it is changed is proved by two things, &#8212;
by the fact that Christ did not spring from the tribe of Levi, and by the
prophetic announcement that he was to be a priest according to the order of
Melchisedec, and consequently a perpetual priest, and not like the sons of
Aaron, who were priests in succession, being all subject to death.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX B 2</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 7:19.</b><font color="Maroon"><i> But the bringing in,
etc</i></font><i>. Theophylact, Luther, Capellus, </i>and others have rendered
this noun as in the same predicament with &#8220;disannulling&#8221; or
abrogation in the former verse, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>18.</b></font>  &#8220;There is therefore an
abrogation of the preceding commandment, on account of its weakness and
uselessness, (for<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>19.</b></font> the law perfected nothing,) and an
introduction of a better hope, through which we draw nigh to
God.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>This passage forms an inference or a conclusion from what has been said.
The &#8220;commandment&#8221; abrogated was respecting the Levitical priesthood.
Its &#8220;weakness&#8221; was, that it could not really atone for sin; and its
uselessness, that it could not make men holy or confer life. The same thing is
expressed in the words included in the parenthesis. But what has been said does
not only prove that the Levitical priesthood is abolished, but also that there
is brought in or introduced a better hope; which means that a better thing than
the Levitical priesthood, which was an object of hope to the ancient saints, is
introduced after that priesthood, and was expressly mentioned by David in the
Psalms many years after the Levitical priesthood was established. This appears
to be the genuine meaning of the passage.<br></div>
<div>Then the following verses come in very suitably, as the
&#8220;introduction&#8221; is mentioned here, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>20.</b></font>  &#8220;And inasmuch as <i>it was
</i>not without an oath, (for they<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>21.</b></font> indeed were made priests without an
oath, but he with an oath, <i>made by </i>him who said to him, &#8216;The Lord
hath sworn and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, according<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>22</b></font>. to the order of Melchisedec,&#8217;)
of a covenant so much the<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>23. </b></font>better is Jesus the surety. They are
also many who are made priests, because they are not suffered by death to
continue; but he, because he abideth for ever, hath a priesthood that passeth
not to another, (or more literally, hath an intransmissible
priesthood.)&#8221;<br></div>
<div>What was not &#8220;without an oath&#8221; was &#8220;the
introduction,&#8221; etc. There are here two additional things stated as proving
the superiority of Christ&#8217;s priesthood: the oath proved that he was the
surety of a better covenant; and his priesthood, unlike that of Aaron, which
passed from one to another, was intransmissible or unsuccessive, as the word
means, and not &#8220;unchangeable,&#8221; as in our version.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX C 2</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 7:27.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Who needeth not daily,
etc</i></font><i>. </i>A difficulty has been raised as to this verse. It is said
that Christ did not, like the priests, offer up a daily sacrifice, first for his
own sins and then for the sins of the people, &#8220;for this he did once when
he offered up himself.&#8221; It seems hence, it is said, that he offered a
sacrifice for himself as well as for the people. In order to explain this, it
has been proposed to take in the following verse; and it has been said that
there is here an arrangement similar to what often occurs in the Prophets; that
is, when two things are stated, the last is first referred to, and then the
first. The two things here are the priest&#8217;s own sins and those of the
people. The Apostle is supposed to speak first of what Christ did as to the sins
of the people, and then that in the following verse he shews that Christ had no
sins of his own, for he became or was made &#8220;a perfect priest,&#8221; and
that &#8220;for ever,&#8221; being sinless not only when he actually offered the
great sacrifice, but also sinless as our intercessor in heaven.<br></div>
<div>This is the explanation of Bishop <i>Jebb, </i>and is adopted by
<i>Bloomfield. </i>That arrangements of this kind are found in the New
Testament, and even in this Epistle is what cannot be doubted. But the last
word, &#8220;perfected,&#8221; will not admit of the meaning given to it,
&#8220;he <i>is </i>and <i>was, </i>and <i>shall be </i>everlastingly perfect
and free from sin.&#8221; Were this its meaning, there would be a complete
correspondence with the former part. Perfection is twice before applied to
Christ in this Epistle, (chapter 2:10; 5:9,) but not in the sense above stated.
When Christ is said to be perfected or made perfect, the meaning is that he is
completely fitted and qualified for his undertaking, or that he has fully
completed his work of expiation. Here the meaning seems to be that he is for
ever made perfect as a priest, having not only once for all made an adequate
atonement for the sins of his people, but also continues a priest for
ever.<br></div>
<div>As to the 27th verse, it may be thus rendered, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>27.</b></font>  &#8220;Who has no need daily to offer
sacrifices, as the high priests, (first for their own sins, and then for those
of the people:) for this he did once for all, when he offered up
himself&#8221;<br></div>
<div>&#8220;This he did&#8221; refers only to the offering of a sacrifice, and
&#8220;for their own sins,&#8221; etc., apply only to the high priests. Thus we
avoid the difficulty alluded to.<br></div>
<div>From an idea that the high priest offered sacrifices only once a year,
<i>i.e., on </i>the day of expiation, <i>Macknight </i>renders
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kaq hJme&gt;ran</font> &#8220;from time
to time,&#8221; etc. He considers it as equivalent to
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kat ejnauto&lt;n</font> &#8220;from year
to year,&#8221; in chapter 10:1, and refers to
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;021310&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 13:10, where
&#8220;from year to year&#8221; is in Hebrew from &#8220;days to days,&#8221;
and the same in the <i>Sept., </i><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajfj
hJmerw~n eijv hJme&gt;rav.</font><i>. </i>Whether the high priest offered
sacrifices daily, is what cannot be ascertained from Scripture, though <i>Stuart
</i>refers to <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;030619&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus
6:19-22, and <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;042803&gt;</font></sup>Numbers 28:3,
4, where nothing satisfactory is found. He quotes indeed some words from
<i>Philo, </i>who says that this was the case. <i>Scott </i>considered that what
was done daily by the priests is here attributed to the high priest, they being
his coadjutors. But <i>Macknight&#8217;s </i>explanation <i>is </i>the most
satisfactory, especially as the comparison throughout is between Christ and the
high priest.<br></div>
<div>The 28th verse may be thus rendered,&#8212;<br></div>
<div>&#8220;For the law made men high priests, who have infirmity; but the word
of the oath, the Son, perfected for ever.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>&#8220;Perfected,&#8221; or completely qualified, that is, as a priest. The
word, perfected, depends as to its specific meaning on the context. The subject
here is the perpetuity of the priest. The high priests under the Law did not
continue because of death, (verse 23,) and this is the &#8220;infirmity&#8221;
mentioned here, though in another place, (chapter 5:2,) it means sinfulness.
Then the perfection of the Son is the perpetuity of his life, referred to in
verses 16 and 24. The high priests died, and hence were not fitted for their
work; but Christ lives, and therefore continues for ever fully qualified for his
office. See verse 26.<br></div>

<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kefa&gt;laion</font> does not mean here a
sum in the sense of a summary, but a principal thing. So <i>Chrysostom
</i>understood it. <i>Macknight&#8217;s </i>version is, &#8220;Now of the things
spoken the chief is;&#8221; <i>Stuart&#8217;s</i> is substantially the same. But
the idea seems to be somewhat different: the literal rendering is, &#8220;Now
the head as to the things said is,&#8221; etc.; that is, the sum total, the
whole amount.<br></div>
<div><i>Parkhurst </i>quotes a passage from <i>Menander </i>which is very
similar to the first part of this verse,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">To&lt; de&lt; kefa&gt;liion tw~n
lo&gt;gwn &amp;Anqrwpov ei+</font>&#8212; &#8220;But the sum of my discourse is,
Thou art a man,&#8221; etc. The word means here the substance or the sum total.
The word <font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;ar</font>, read, in
Hebrew, has a like meaning, the total number of the people,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;023012&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 30:12;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;040402&gt;</font></sup>Numbers 4:2.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX E 2</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 8:9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And I regarded them not,
etc</i></font><i>. </i>The Apostle here follows the <i>Sept., </i>though in some
other parts of this quotation he follows more closely the Hebrew. Our version in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243132&gt;</font></sup>Jeremiah 31:32, is,
&#8220;although I was a husband to them,&#8221; which is not countenanced by any
of the earlier versions. The phrase is peculiar, not found anywhere else except
in <font face="Palatino">Jeremiah 4:17</font>; which is rendered by
<i>Kimchi,</i> &#8220;I have abhorred them.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>The verb means to have, to possess, to rule, to exercise dominion, to
marry; and <i>Pocock </i>and some others think, that it means to loathe, to
disdain, to abhor, when followed as here by the preposition
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font> and it is said that its cognate
in Arabic has this meaning. The <i>Vulg</i>. here is, &#8220;and I have ruled
over them;&#8221; and the <i>Syr.,</i> &#8220;and I have despised them.&#8221;
The expression is softened by the <i>Sept.,</i> &#8220;and I have disregarded
(or cared not) for them.&#8221; The same is done as to the preceding clause,
&#8220;because they continued not in my covenant,&#8221; which is in Hebrew,
though not as rendered in our version, &#8220;because they broke my
covenant.&#8221; So <font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">r&ccedil;a</font>
rendered by the <i>Syr. </i>and the <i>Targ.</i> &#8220;Which my covenant&#8221;
has been derived from the <i>Vulg</i>., and is a construction which the original
will not bear.<br></div>
<div>Still the most probable and the easiest solution is, to suppose a
typographical mistake in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243132&gt;</font></sup>Jeremiah 31:32, the word
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytl[b</font>: being used instead of
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytljb</font>: there being only one
letter different. The reasons for this supposition are these: &#8212; All the
versions are different here from what they are in Jeremiah 4:17, where the same
phrase is supposed to occur, &#8212; and this latter verb is found in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;381108&gt;</font></sup>Zechariah 11:8, followed
by: as here, and means to &#8220;abhor,&#8221; or according to some, to
&#8220;reject.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>There is also another word,
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ytl[n</font> which has been mentioned,
and has but one letter different; and as it is used by Jeremiah himself in
chapter <font face="Palatino">14:19</font>, and with
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font>, in the sense of abhorring or
loathing, it may justly be deemed as the most probable word.<br></div>
<div>But <i>Newcome </i>suggests another thing, a typographical mistake in the
Greek. There is another reading in some copies of the <i>Sept., </i>and that is,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">emelhsa</font>, &#8220;I have cared for
them;&#8221; and this would in substance agree with &#8220;I was a husband to
them.&#8221; This conjecture is less probable; for it involves a mistake both in
the <i>Sept. </i>and in this Epistle. But either of these suppositions would
reconcile the passages; and it is singular that in both cases the change
required is only in <i>one </i>letter!<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 9:2</b><i>. </i><font color="Maroon"><i>The fir</i>s<i>t,
etc</i></font><i>. Doddridge, Macknight, </i>and <i>Stuart, </i>connect
&#8220;the first&#8221; with &#8220;tabernacle,&#8221; but improperly. The
rendering ought to be no doubt as in our version, or as follows, &#8220;For a
tabernacle was made; the first, in which were the candlestick, and the table,
and the shew-bread, which is called holy.&#8221; We find in verse 3, that
&#8220;the Holy of holies&#8221; is also called a tabernacle, which was as it
were the second tabernacle, or the second part of it, see verse 7. The word
&#8220;holy,&#8221; followed by &#8220;of holies,&#8221; is an adjective
agreeing in gender with tabernacle; and &#8220;of holies&#8221; seem to mean
holy things; so that it might be rendered, &#8220;The holy tabernacle of holy
things.&#8221; The accents are of no authority. The word &#8220;holy&#8221; in
the plural with an article, as in verse 8 and 12, designates the Holy of holies;
or it may refer to both places, the sanctuary and the Holy of holies, for the
people were excluded from both; and no access, strictly speaking, applied to
them only.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX G 2</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 9:9, 10.</b> These two verses have greatly tried the ingenuity
of critics, not as to the general meaning, but as to the construction. All agree
as to the general import of the passage, and yet they find a difficulty in the
syntax. This has arisen from not apprehending the style of the Apostle; he often
arranges his sentences according to the practice of the ancient prophets. So he
does here. In verse ninth he mentions two things, &#8220;gifts&#8221; or
oblations and &#8220;sacrifices;&#8221; then he refers first to
&#8220;sacrifices,&#8221; and afterwards to the &#8220;gifts.&#8221; Of the
&#8220;sacrifices,&#8221; he says, that they could not perfect or justify
&#8220;the worshipper,&#8221; for so
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">latreuo&gt;nta</font> ought to be
rendered here; but of &#8220;the gifts,&#8221; together with meats, etc., he
says, that they were only imposed until the time of reformation. Here syntax is
satisfied. The two verses may be thus rendered, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>9.</b></font> &#8220;Which is a type for the present
time, while gifts and sacrifices are offered, which (sacrifices) cannot perfect
the<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>10.</b></font> worshipper as to his conscience, being
imposed (gifts) only, together with meats, and drinks, and divers washings, even
ordinances of the flesh, until the time of reformation.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>Now, there is here a consistency in every part;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">duna&gt;menai</font> is in the same
gender with <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">qusi&gt;ai</font><i>, </i>and
what is said is suitable to sacrifices, they being not able to atone for sin;
and then <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpikei&gt;mena</font><i> is
</i>of the same gender with
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dw~ra&gt;</font>, and what is said of
them is also suitable, that they were imposed or required only, together with
meats, etc., which were rituals referring to the flesh or body, and not to the
conscience or the soul, until the time of reforming or rectifying all things
came.<br></div>
<div><i>Doddridge </i>rightly states the efficacy of the Jewish sacrifices when
he says, that they averted &#8220;temporal evils,&#8221; but did expiate
offenses in the court above; they removed offenses against the government under
which the Jews lived, and restored them to the privileges of eternal communion
with the Church; and thus they were types and symbols of the efficacy of the
true sacrifices by which we are restored to the favor of God, and to a spiritual
communion with him.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX H 2</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 9:16, 17.</b> Much has been written on the meaning of the word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diaqh&gt;kh</font><i> </i>in this
passage. It is rendered &#8220;covenant&#8221; throughout by <i>Doddridge,
Macknight, Scholefield, etc.; </i>and <i>Scott </i>is disposed to take the same
view. <i>Mac</i>k<i>night&#8217;s </i>version is this, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>16. </b></font>&#8220;For where a covenant is, there
is a necessity that the<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>17.</b></font> death of the appointed sacrifice be
brought in; for a covenant is firm over dead sacrifices, since it never hath
force whilst the appointed sacrifice liveth.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>The difficulty here is as to the word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diaqe&gt;menov,</font><i> </i>rendered
above, &#8220;the appointed sacrifice,&#8221; &#8212; by <i>Doddridge,</i>
&#8220;he by whom the covenant is confirmed, &#8216;&#8212; and by
<i>Scholefield,</i> &#8220;the mediating sacrifice.&#8221; But the word is never
found to have such meanings in the New Testament, in the <i>Sept., </i>or in the
classics. It is therefore impossible to accede to such a view of the
passage.<br></div>
<div>It is then said, on the other hand, that
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diaqh&gt;kh</font><i> </i>does not mean a
testament or a will in the New Testament nor in the <i>Sept. </i>This is not
true; for it clearly means a testament or a will in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480315&gt;</font></sup>Galatians 3:15, and in
connection, too, with its common meaning, a covenant, see verse 17. Besides it
has commonly, if not always, this meaning in the classics.<br></div>
<div>These two verses are to be viewed as an illustration, and may be regarded
as parenthetic; and were
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ga&lt;r</font><i> </i>rendered &#8220;in
fact,&#8221; or indeed, this would appear more evident, &#8220;Where indeed a
testament is,&#8221; etc. As an illustration, a reference to a testament is
exceedingly suitable; for with regard to Christ, his death was really the
ratification of the covenant; as by death a Will attains its validity, so by
Christ&#8217;s death the covenant of which he is the Mediator. Death in both
instances has a similar effect. And this, and no more than this, seems to have
been the intention of the Apostle. The different meaning of the same word in the
same passage is to be found out by words connected with it; in the present
instance <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diaqe&gt;menov</font> is
sufficient, independently of the 17th verse, which can be rightly applied to
nothing but to a will or a testament.<br></div>
<div>Many agree with <i>Calvin </i>on these verses, such as <i>Erasmus, Beza,
Schleusner, Stuart, Bloomfield, etc.</i><br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX   I 2</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 10:5</b><i>. </i><font color="Maroon"><i>But a body hast thou
prepared me</i></font><i>. </i>The words in the Psalm are, &#8220;Mine ears hast
thou opened,&#8221; 40:6; or more literally, &#8220;Ears hast thou opened for
me.&#8221; <i>Calvin </i>seems to have discarded the idea of an allusion to the
boring of the ear in sign of servitude. The two verbs are certainly different.
He evidently refers to Isaiah 50:5<i>,</i> &#8220;The Lord hath opened mine ear,
and I was not rebellious;&#8221; which clearly applies to Christ. He therefore
makes the meaning of the phrase to be, &#8220;Thou hast made me teachable and
obedient.&#8221; This view has been adopted by <i>Merrick, Bishop Horne, </i>and
<i>Stuart. </i>But how to make the words, &#8220;a body hast thou prepared for
me,&#8221; to bear an analogous meaning, does not very clearly appear.
<i>Bishop</i> <i>Horne </i>gives this version, &#8220;Thou hast prepared&#8221;
or fitted &#8220;my body,&#8221; that is, to be obedient and to do thy
will.<br></div>
<div><i>Mede </i>conceived that the allusion is to the practice of boring the
ear in token of servitude, mentioned in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022106&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 21:6; and that as
that practice was unknown to the Greeks, the <i>Seventy </i>rendered the words
in conformity with what they did as to their slaves; which was, to set a mark on
the body; &#8220;Thou hast fitted (or adapted) a body for me;&#8221; that is,
that I might be thy servant. That Christ assumed &#8220;the form of a
servant,&#8221; is expressly declared in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 2:7. There is
in this case an agreement as to meaning; but the difficulty is: as to the verb
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hrk</font> which does not mean to bore
or to perforate, but to dig, to hollow out, and in a secondary sense, to form or
to make a thing, such as a well, a pit, a grave, or a cave. As to
&#8220;ears&#8221; instead of an &#8220;ear,&#8221; as in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022106&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 21:6, that might be
accounted for by saying, that the object was to shew the <i>entire
</i>willingness of Christ to become a servant.<br></div>
<div>These have been the two ways proposed to reconcile the passages as they now
stand. There are no different readings in Hebrew, nor in the <i>Sept., </i>nor
in this Epistle. Proposals have therefore been made as to a change in the texts
on the supposition of typographical mistakes.<br></div>
<div>Some, as <i>Grotius, Hammond, </i>and <i>Dr. Owen, </i>have proposed
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">wjti&gt;a</font>, ears, instead of
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sw~ma</font>, body, in the <i>Sept.
</i>When did this change take place? Before or after the Apostle&#8217;s time?
If before, then the Apostle adopted a false reading; if after, then the same
mistake must have been made in the <i>Sept. </i>and in this Epistle; which is
not credible.<br></div>
<div>Others have supposed a mistake in the Hebrew text; and this conjecture has
been approved by <i>Kennicott, Doddridge, </i>Bishop <i>lowth, </i>Adam
<i>Clarke, </i>and Pye <i>Smith. </i>It is no objection to say that the <i>Syr.,
Vulg., </i>and the <i>Targ., </i>confirm the present reading; for the mistake
might have been made long before any of these were in existence. Such a change
might indeed have been made in the first ages of Christianity, and might have
been made intentionally, through a wish to obscure the testimony of Scripture
respecting Christ.<br></div>
<div>The words are supposed to have been
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwg za</font> instead of
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ynza</font>, as the text now is.
There would in this case be a literal agreement; the passage in the Psalm might
then be thus rendered, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>6.</b></font> &#8220;Sacrifice and offering thou hast
not delighted in, Then a body hast thou formed for me; Burnt-offering and
sin-offering thou hast not required,<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>7.</b></font> Then I said, Behold, I am
coming.&#8221; &#8212;<br></div>
<div>There is here a consistency throughout. &#8220;Behold, I am coming,&#8221;
that is, in the body designed for him. And then the Apostle says, &#8220;When
coming into the world, he saith,&#8221; etc., clearly referring to our Saviors
incarnation. And this &#8220;body&#8221; is afterwards expressly mentioned in
verse 10, in opposition to sacrifices. It is true that in his argument in verse
9, he dwells on the words, &#8220;I come;&#8221; but then his coming was in the
body prepared for him.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX K 2</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 10:14<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>He hath
perfected, etc</i></font><i>. </i>The word simply means to complete, to finish,
to perfect; and it depends on the context what that completion or perfection
means. To perfect the sanctified or the expiated, or those atoned for, was
completely to free them from the imputation of sin, to make them fully clear
from guilt, or in other words, fully to take away their sins, which was never
done by the sacrifices of the law, verse 11. This is the point here handled.
<i>Stuart </i>gives the real meaning by the following free translation, &#8212;
&#8220;By one offering, then, he hath fully accomplished for ever what was
needed by those for whom expiation is (was) made.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>The perfecting &#8220;for ever&#8221; by one offering in this verse, proves
that &#8220;for ever,&#8221; <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv to&lt;
dihneke&lt;v,</font><i> </i>in verse 12, is to be connected with the offering of
one sacrifice, and not with the sitting on God&#8217;s right hand; the verse may
be thus rendered, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>12. </b></font>&#8220;But he, having offered one
sacrifice for sins for perpetuity, (or, according to <i>Beza </i>and <i>Stuart,
&#8216;</i>one perpetual sacrifice for sins,&#8217;) sat down on the right hand
of God, henceforth waiting until his enemies be made his
footstool.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>Some copies have <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aujto&lt;v</font>;
&#8212; &#8220;he;&#8221; and some,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ou=tov</font>; &#8212;
&#8220;this.&#8221; If the latter be adopted, it ought not to be rendered
&#8220;this man,&#8221; but &#8220;this priest,&#8221; such being the word used
before. As <i>one </i>sacrifice is opposed to <i>many </i>sacrifices, so a
<i>perpetual </i>sacrifice, that is, a sacrifice perpetually efficacious, is
opposed to those sacrifices which were <i>often </i>made.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX L 2</font><br></div>

<div><font color="Navy"><b>21.</b></font> veil, that is, his flesh, &#8212; and
having a great priest over the house of God, let us approach,&#8221;
etc.<br></div>
<div>It is rather &#8220;liberty&#8221; or freedom than &#8220;boldness,&#8221;
and so it is rendered by <i>Beza, Doddridge, </i>and <i>Stuart. </i>The
<i>Vulgate </i>has &#8220;confidence.&#8221; The word for
&#8220;consecrated&#8221; is literally &#8220;initiated:&#8221; Christ first
opened the way, and opened it for his people. The &#8220;way&#8221; is in
apposition with &#8220;entrance.&#8221; It was &#8220;new,&#8221; in contrast
with the old under the Law, and living or &#8220;leading to life:&#8221; so
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">zw~san</font> evidently means here. It
has often a causative sense. The &#8220;living bread&#8221; in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430651&gt;</font></sup>John 6:51, is said in verse
33 to be the bread that &#8220;giveth life.&#8221; So here the living way may be
said to be that which leads to life.<br></div>
<div>There is a division of opinion as to the &#8220;veil.&#8221; <i>Calvin,
Doddridge, Stuart, </i>and others, take the veil as a figurative expression for
the human nature of Christ; and they ground their opinion on the following
texts, <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430114&gt;</font></sup>John 1:14;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540316&gt;</font></sup>1 Timothy 3:16;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;501706&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 2:6. Others
give this explanation, &#8220;As the veil was removed for the entrance of the
high priest, so Christ s body was removed by death, in order to open an entrance
into heaven.&#8221; But the easiest and the most natural way is to consider it
an allusion to what took place at our Saviors death, the rending asunder of the
veil of the temple,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402751&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 27:51,) which was
a significant intimation and a striking symbol of what was done by Christ when
he died on the cross. It was by his flesh or body being torn and rent, when
suffering for us, that a way to the holiest was opened to us, and the same is
ascribed to his blood in the former verse, so that one part corresponds with the
other. The way was opened through the veil being rent, which symbolized his rent
or torn flesh.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX M 2</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 10:22.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>With</i> <i>pure

because the Apostle is instructing the Hebrews, who had been baptized, how they
were daily to draw nigh to God.<br></div>
<div>The words &#8220;pure water&#8221; are not found elsewhere in the New
Testament, nor in the <i>Sept. </i>but once, Ezekiel. 36:25, where our version
is &#8220;purifying water,&#8221; and no doubt correctly, though the early
versions have &#8220;pure water.&#8221; It was a command as to Aaron, &#8220;He
shall wash <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">(lou&gt;setai)</font><i>
</i>with water his whole body (<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pa&gt;n

is &#8220;his flesh,&#8221;

Samaritan text has &#8220;all,&#8221;
(<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">lk</font>) before it,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031604&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus 16:4. See also
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031624&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus 16:24. The terms
here used are sacerdotal or Levitical. The &#8220;sprinkled&#8221; with blood
were the priests at their consecration, and not those who brought their
offerings. See <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;030830&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus
8:30. In no other case were any sprinkled with blood except the lepers, and the
people when the covenant was made. Washing with water was also done by the
priests at their consecration, (see
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;030806&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus 8:6,) and
whenever they ministered.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;023020&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 30:20,
21.)<br></div>
<div>The reason of this allusion especially to what was done as to the priests,
seems to have been this, to shew that all who now draw nigh to God through
Christ are priests, for they all serve God as it were in the sanctuary, and like
the high priest, enter as it were into the holiest, not once a year, but daily
and constantly, whenever they hold communion with God.<br></div>
<div>As sprinkling in the case of Christians is continually needed, so is
washing, as the daily washing of the priests before they engaged in their
duties. (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;024032&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 40:32.) The
sprinkling betokens forgiveness, and washing, sanctification or cleansing. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600102&gt;</font></sup>1 Peter 1:2; and 2
Corinthians 7:1; <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520523&gt;</font></sup>1

<div>It may be added that as
(<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">zw~san</font>, living, seems to have
been used in verse 20 in a causative sense, so
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kaqaro&lt;n</font> in this passage; and
it may be rendered, as in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;263625&gt;</font></sup>Ezekiel 36:25,
&#8220;purifying.&#8221; The priests after washing were said to be clean, and
were deemed to have been thereby purified, which proves that washing was nothing
more than a symbol. Pure or purifying water signifies the sanctifying effect of
divine grace.<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 10:26.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Willfully, etc</i></font>. It

by <i>Beza,</i> &#8220;ultro &#8212; of one&#8217;s own accord;&#8221; by
<i>Doddridge </i>and <i>Macknight, </i>as in our version, and by <i>Stuart,</i>
&#8220;voluntarily.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>It occurs in one other place,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600502&gt;</font></sup>1 Peter 5:2,) and is
rendered &#8220;willingly;&#8221; it is found as an adjective in Philemon 14,
and is rendered willingly; and in both instances in opposition to
&#8220;constraint.&#8221; So that <i>Schleusner&#8217;s </i>explanation seems
right, &#8220;with no compelling force &#8212; nulla vi cogente.&#8221; It is
used in the <i>Sept. </i>for a Hebrew word which means freely, with free will,
spontaneously. We may therefore thus render the words, &#8220;For if we sin of
our own free will, (that is, renounce the faith, which is clearly the sin
intended,) after having received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no
more a sacrifice for sins.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>According to this verse the case of the persecuted is not here
contemplated, for they are under constraint; but such are spoken of here as
renounced the faith willingly, freely, by their own free choice; so that
&#8220;willfully&#8221; is not what is meant, but spontaneously, without any
outward constraining force or influence.<br></div>
<div>The fathers, such as <i>Chrysostom, Theophylact, </i>and <i>Augustine,
</i>sadly blundered on this passage, because they did not understand the sin
that is here intended, though it be evidently that of apostasy according to the
drift of the whole context; and hence they said some strange things about sin
after baptism, though baptism is neither mentioned nor alluded to in the whole
passage. How many errors and absurdities have been introduced by the fathers
into the world!<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 10:30</b><font color="Maroon"><b><i>.</i></b><i> The Lord shall
judge</i></font><i>. </i>The same meaning is given to &#8220;judge&#8221; here
by <i>Beza </i>as by <i>Calvin; </i>but <i>Doddridge, Grotius, </i>and
<i>Macknight </i>think it means to avenge, to vindicate, or defend. The argument
is considered to be this, &#8212; &#8220;If God would avenge the injury done to
his people, much more the injury or reproach done to his Son and the Holy
Spirit.&#8221; <i>Stuart </i>and <i>Bloomfield </i>give the verb the sense of
condemning or punishing; that is, his apostatizing people, &#8212; &#8220;The
Lord will condemn (or punish) his people.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>The two quotations are connected in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053235&gt;</font></sup>Deuteronomy 32:35, 36.<i>
</i>&#8220;Vengeance&#8221; refers to idolaters; and lest an advantage should
have been taken of this, he added, as it seems, these words, &#8220;The Lord
will judge his people;&#8221; that is, he will call his people to an account, so
as to reward some, and to punish others. The apostates might have said,
&#8220;Though we leave the Christian, and turn to the Jewish religion, we shall
not be idolaters; therefore the vengeance you threaten will not belong to us. To
prevent this kind of evasion, the Apostle adds, &#8220;The Lord will summon to
judgment his own people, and give to each according to their works. The fact,
that God is a judge, who will reward some and punish others, is what is meant;
and this view accords with the passage in Deuteronomy, and also with the design
of the Apostle here.<br></div>
<div>The two verbs also, the Hebrew
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#710;ydy</font>, and the Greek
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">krinei~</font>, will admit of this
meaning. The first, indeed, though not the second, often means to vindicate, to
defend; but the context in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053236&gt;</font></sup>Deuteronomy 32:36<i>,
</i>requires its sense to be that of executing what is right and just to all.

<div><b>CHAPTER 12:1.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Which doth so easily beset us,
etc</i></font><i>. Calvin </i>follows the <i>Vulg</i>., &#8220;which surrounds
us, or stands around us. It is rendered by <i>Chrysostom,</i> &#8220;which
easily surrounds us; <i>by Beza,</i> &#8220;which is ready to encompass
us;&#8221; by <i>Doddridge, </i>&#8220;which in present circumstances hath the
greatest advantage against us;&#8221; <i>by Macknight,</i> &#8220;easily
committed.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>The word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujperi&gt;staton</font><i>
</i>means literally, &#8220;well-standing-around.&#8221; But
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">euj</font><i> </i>in composition often
means readily, easily, aptly. Then we may render it, &#8220;the readily
surrounding sin,&#8221; that <i>is, </i>the sin which readily surrounds us, and
thereby entangle us, so as to prevent as, like long garments, to run our course.
The runners threw aside every weight or burden, and also their long garments.
These two things seem to have been alluded to. Therefore the second clause is
not explanatory of the preceding, as some consider it, but is wholly a distinct
thing; there was the burden and the readily entangling sin. The burden was
probably worldly cares, or as <i>Theophylact says,</i> &#8220;the baggage of
earthly concerns;&#8221; and the easily encircling sin seems to have been the
fear of persecution as <i>Doddridge </i>suggests; which, if allowed to prevail,
would lead them to apostasy.<br></div>
<div>If the word be taken in an active sense, then what is meant is the
deceptive power of sin, it being that which readily surrounds and allures us;
but if it be taken passively, then what <i>is </i>specifically meant <i>is,
</i>that the sin referred to is that which stands fairly and plausibly around
us; for &#8220;well-standing-around&#8221; is what presents on every side a fair
and plausible appearance. And apostasy might have been so represented; for the
Jews could produce many plausible arguments. <i>Scapula </i>says that
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajperi&gt;statov</font> is applied by the
Greek rhetoricians to a question barely or briefly stated, unaccompanied with
any circumstances; then, if instead of the negative,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eu</font><i>, </i>well, be prefixed to
it, the meaning would be that it is something well stated and plausibly
represented. The version in this case would be, &#8220;the sin that plausibly
presents itself&#8221; If this meaning be received, then there seems to be a
striking contrast in the passage; we are surrounded by a throng of witnesses,
and also by sin with its plausible pretenses. It <i>is </i>usual with Paul to
personify sin.<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 12:2.</b><font color="Maroon"> <i>Who for the joy</i></font><i>,
</i><font color="Maroon"><i>etc</i></font>. Hardly any agree with <i>Calvin
</i>in the view he takes of this clause. The preposition is, indeed, used in
both senses; but the words, &#8220;set before him,&#8221; and the argument,
evidently favor the other view. The subject handled is, that the prospect of
future glory ought to sustain us under the evils of the present life; and Christ
is referred to as an example; and the Apostle says, that he for the sake of the
joy set before him endured the cross. The same word is here used and rendered,
&#8220;set before him,&#8221; as in chapter 6:18.<br></div>
<div>The first clause of the verse is rendered by <i>Calvin,</i> &#8220;the
prince and perfecter of the faith;&#8221; by <i>Beza</i>, &#8220;the leader and
consummator of the faith;&#8221; by <i>Doddridge,</i> &#8220;the leader and
finisher of <i>our </i>faith;&#8221; by <i>Macknight,</i> &#8220;the captain and
perfecter of the faith,&#8221; and by <i>Stuart,</i> &#8220;the author and
perfecter of <i>our </i>faith.&#8221; The first word is rendered
&#8220;author&#8221; by the <i>Vulg</i>., and &#8220;the beginner&#8221; by
<i>Erazmus. </i>Following this meaning we may render thus, &#8220;the beginner
and perfecter of the faith,&#8221; that is, of the Gospel, or of the religion we
profess. Christ being the author or originator, and also the complete revealer
of the faith, of what we profess to believe, may fitly be set forth as our
example. This is the view of <i>Stuart.</i><br></div>
<div><i>Doddridge </i>takes faith as a principle, that is, subjective faith,
faith in us; so <i>Theophylact </i>did, &#8220;He at first gives us faith, and
afterwards brings it to perfection.&#8221; <i>Scott </i>mentions this view, and
then adds, &#8220;From him as the great Prophet, the <i>doctrine </i>of faith
had been delivered from the beginning, and perfected in the revelation made in
the Gospel; and this none would ever be authorized to change, add to, or deduct
from.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>But the reference here seems to be to what Christ did in his own person, as
it appears from what follows; he endured the cross, which seems to refer to the
first word, &#8220;leader;&#8221; and his sitting down at God&#8217;s right hand
appears to be explanatory of his being the consummator of the faith. The
Apostle&#8217;s subject is the race, that is, the race of faith, or in behalf of
the faith we profess. Christ is the captain or leader in this race of faith; and
though he had the cross to endure, he yet completed it, and is now at
God&#8217;s right hand. This is the example that is presented to us.
<i>Schleusner </i>explains
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">teleiwth&lt;n</font> as one who brings
anything to an end, a finisher, a completer. Christ is the captain or leader in
the contest of faith, and the completer of it, having brought it to a triumphant
issue.<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 12:6<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>For whom the
Lord loveth, etc</i></font><i>. </i>The quotation is from
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;200311&gt;</font></sup>Proverbs 3:11, 12, made
from the <i>Sept., </i>consistently with the Hebrew, except in the last clause;
which in Hebrew is, &#8220;As a father, the Son in whom he delights.&#8221; Some
have unwisely attempted to amend one of the words in Hebrew, while there are
<i>three </i>words which must be altered if we attach importance to verbal
identity; and even the amended word can hardly answer the purpose, a sense being
given to it, which it has nowhere else.<br></div>
<div>If we make <font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bak</font>: a verb, it
will not be suitable, for its meaning is to be sore, to be sad, to be sorrowful,
and is ever used intransitively; and if like <i>Schleusner, </i>we make it a
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">byaky</font>, it will hardly bear the
meaning here required; it is used in the sense of making sore, sad, or
sorrowful. This, indeed, approaches to a verbal identity; but then there is
&#8220;every&#8221; to be put in, and &#8220;delights in&#8221; is to be changed
into &#8220;receiveth.&#8221; To be over-scrupulous about words, when the
general meaning is the same, is neither wise nor reasonable, but wholly puerile;
it is a disposition clearly discountenanced by the usage of Scripture, there
being many passages in which the meaning <i>is </i>given but not the words. Even
in this Epistle the same passage <i>is </i>quoted twice, but in different words.
See chapter 8:12; 10:17.<br></div>
<div>The <i>Vulg</i>., the <i>Syr., </i>and the <i>Targ., </i>materially agree
with the Hebrew text as it <i>is. </i>The <i>Arab. </i>alone favors the <i>Sept.
Macknight</i> quotes <i>Hallet </i>as saying, that the <i>Syr. </i>and the
<i>Targ., </i>as well as the <i>Arab., </i>coincide with the <i>Sept.; </i>which
is quite a mistake. The <i>Syr.</i> is, &#8220;For whom the Lord loveth he
correcteth, like a father who correcteth his own son;&#8221; and the
<i>Targ</i>. is<i> </i>nearly the same, the word &#8220;father&#8221; being
retained. And then what this author says as to the meaning of the verb
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">bak</font>: is not true; there is no
instance in which it is used in the sense of scourging. We must not pervert the
meaning of words, or invent a new meaning, to gratify a fond desire for verbal
agreement.<br></div>
<div>But there is in this quotation what deserves special notice.
&#8220;Correction&#8221; was by the rod; so we find the rod and correction
joined together in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;202215&gt;</font></sup>Proverbs
22:15. In Hebrew it is &#8220;the rod of correction
(<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rswm</font>),&#8221; and in the
<i>Sept.,</i> &#8220;rod and correction
(<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">paidei&gt;a</font>.)&#8221; In
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;202313&gt;</font></sup>Proverbs 23:13, correction
and beating with the rod are represented as the same thing. Bearing this in
mind, we shall understand the connection and meaning of this passage,
&#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>11. </b></font>The correction of the Lord, my Son,
despise not, &#8212; And fret not at his chastisement;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>12. </b></font>For whom the Lord loveth he
chastiseth, And <i>corrects </i>as a father the Son he graciously
accepts.<br></div>
<div>The middle lines are <i>evidently </i>connected; chastisement is the
subject of both, the noun and the verb are from the same root. Then the first
and the fourth are also connected; the &#8220;Son&#8221; is mentioned in both;
and the verb in the last line must be borrowed from the subject of the first
line, and that is correction. We hence see the reason why
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mastigoi~</font> is introduced, it being
nothing more than to supply what is left to be understood in Hebrew.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX S 2</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 12:11.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>Peaceable fruit of
righteousness, etc</i></font><i>. </i>This is a phrase which is commonly
understood as to its general import, and yet it is difficult to explain it
satisfactorily. Some take &#8220;of righteousness&#8221; as the exegetic
genitive case, &#8220;the peaceable fruit,&#8221; that is, as <i>Macknight
</i>explains it, &#8220;which is righteousness;&#8221; and he adds,
&#8220;Righteousness is denominated <i>peaceful, </i>because it is productive of
inward peace to the afflicted person himself, and of outward peace to them with
whom he lives; also it is called the fruit of God&#8217;s chastisements, because
afflictions have a natural tendency to produce virtues in the chastised, which
are the occasion of joy far greater than the pain arising from the
chastisement.&#8221; <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B967&gt;</font></sup>Psalm
119:67, 71, 75.<br></div>
<div><i>Doddridge </i>also seems to have understood the phrase in the same
sense, for he says, that chastisement &#8220;produces and improves those virtues
which afford joy and peace to the mind.&#8221; To the same effect are the
remarks of <i>Scott, </i>and <i>Calvin&#8217;s </i>view seems to be
similar.<br></div>
<div>The phrase admits of another meaning: &#8220;The fruit of
righteousness,&#8221; according to the more frequent usage of Scripture, means
the fruit which belongs to righteousness, or in the words of <i>Stuart,
</i>&#8220;such as righteousness produces,&#8221; or in the words of an author
quoted by <i>Poole,</i> &#8220;which proceeds from righteousness.&#8221;
Righteousness seems to mean here what is just and right, or what ought to be
done according to the will of God, as when our Savior says, &#8220;For thus it
becometh us to fulfill all righteousness,&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400315&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 3:15. What may be
deemed as especially referred to here, is submission or subjection to the divine
will mentioned in verse 9. This subjection was righteousness; it was right
according to the statement in verse 7. It was said before that the object of
correction is to make us partakers of God&#8217;s holiness; now he mentions
righteousness; they are connected. We must be made holy, we must be cleansed
from pride, worldliness, and self-will, in order that we may do what is right
and just, that is, submit to God&#8217;s will when he chastises us; and when
this submission or righteousness takes place, then correction produces a
peaceable or a blessed fruit, that is, such an effect, or such a blessing, as
peace or happiness. Peace and happiness are both signified by the word; but
&#8220;blessed&#8221; or happy is more suitably applied to &#8220;fruit&#8221;
than &#8220;peaceable&#8221; or peaceful.<br></div>
<div>Then the meaning may be thus conveyed, &#8220;but it afterwards yields to
those who are exercised (or trained, that is, unto holiness) by it, a blessed
fruit, such as righteousness (that is, subjection to our Father&#8217;s will)
brings forth.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX T 2</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 12:13.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>And make stra</i>i<i>ght
paths, etc.</i></font><i> </i>If this be a quotation, and not an appropriation
of certain words, it is taken from
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;200426&gt;</font></sup>Proverbs 4:26, where the
Hebrew <i>is, </i>&#8220;Make direct the path of thy feet;&#8221; and the
<i>Sept., </i>&#8220;Make<i> </i>straight the paths for thy feet,&#8221; the
very words of this passage. That the verb in Hebrew means to &#8220;make
direct,&#8221; and not to &#8220;ponder,&#8221; as in our version, is evident
from a similar phrase in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;197850&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 78:50, &#8220;He made
(or made direct) a way to his anger.&#8221; The verb is the same as in Proverbs.
The noun means a balance, or rather the beam of a balance, (see Proverbs 16:11,)
which is straight, and is used to equalize what is weighed. The verb may
therefore include the idea of making straight or of making even. The verse that
follows in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;200426&gt;</font></sup>Proverbs 4:26,
favors this idea of a straight path, &#8220;Turn not to the right hand nor to
the left,&#8221; which implies that it is a straight course that is to be taken.
See verse 25.<br></div>
<div>&#8220;Make direct the path of thy feet,&#8221; or &#8220;Make straight the
paths for thy feet,&#8221; evidently means, &#8220;Let the path or paths along
which you go, be direct or straight.&#8221; The ways of error and sin are called
crooked paths: see <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;200215&gt;</font></sup>Proverbs
2:15; <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235908&gt;</font></sup>Isaiah 59:8. So the
way of truth and holiness is compared to a straight line, from which we are not
to deviate either to the right hand or to the left.<br></div>
<div>It is remarkable what the Apostle says in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480214&gt;</font></sup>Galatians 2:14, of Peter
and those who dissembled with him, that they &#8220;did not walk uprightly (or
literally, did not foot straightly, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oujk
ojrqopodou~si</font>) according to the truth of the Gospel;&#8221; they deviated
from the straight line prescribed by the Gospel. The idea, therefore, of
removing impediments, of making their paths plain or smooth, as <i>Macknight
</i>and others render it, seems not to be here intended; nor does it comport
with what follows, &#8220;that the lame,&#8221; or the feeble, &#8220;may not
turn aside, but rather be healed,&#8221; that is, of his lameness, or his
weakness. For were those reputed strong in the faith not to walk straightly, but
to turn into the crooked ways of dissimulation, like Peter and others at
Antioch, the lame, the weak in faith, would be tempted to do the same, instead
of having their lameness healed, or their weakness strengthened by the example
of others walking in a straight course.<br></div>
<div>The idea of dislocation given to
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejktraph~|</font><i> </i>by
<i>Schleusner, Macknight, </i>and others, is one invented for the purpose of
suiting what they conceived to be the meaning of this passage, which is by no
means necessary, and is indeed inappropriate to the context when rightly
understood. &#8220;That which is lame,&#8221;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt; cwlo&lt;n</font>, is a neuter
instead of a masculine, an idiom we often meet with in the New
Testament.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX U 2</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 12:15</b><font color="Maroon"><b><i>.</i></b><i> Lest any root,
etc</i></font><i>. </i>This quotation, made from
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052918&gt;</font></sup>Deuteronomy 29:18, seems to
be an adoption of some words, and nothing more; for it is neither literally the
Hebrew nor the <i>Sept.</i> &#8220;Root&#8221; refers not to a principle in
Deuteronomy, but to an individual, to a person given to idolatry. A person also
seems to be intended here. The clause in Hebrew is, &#8220;Lest there be among
you a fruit-bearing root, hemlock or wormwood;&#8221; and in the <i>Sept.,</i>
&#8220;Lest there be among you a root springing up in gall and
bitterness.&#8221; As the idea only of a growing bitter or poisonous root is
borrowed, it is not necessary to suppose that the application here is the same
as in Deuteronomy. What is there applied to an idolater, is here applied to a
person disturbing the peace of the Church.<br></div>
<div>Some understand this passage as referring to defection or apostasy; and
therefore render the first clause, &#8220;Lest any one recede (or depart) from
the grace of God,&#8221; that is, the Gospel, or Christian faith. But the words
can hardly admit of this meaning. Hence most give this version, &#8220;Lest any
one fall short of the grace of God.&#8221; But what is this &#8220;grace of
God?&#8221; Various answers have been given, &#8212; God&#8217;s favor to those
who cultivate holiness; God&#8217;s mercy offered in the Gospel; the promised
rest; eternal life. But taking this verse, as we certainly ought, in connection
with the preceding, we may justly say, that it is<i> </i>God&#8217;s sanctifying
grace, or &#8220;the holiness &#8220;mentioned before; and then, according to
the inverted order which we often find in Scripture, the next clause refers to
&#8220;peace,&#8221; &#8220;lest any root of bitterness, growing up, should
disturb you, and many by it (or by this) be polluted (or
infected.)&#8221;<br></div>
<div>Then follow examples of these two evils in the same order: the first,
&#8220;the fornicator,&#8221; is the violator of &#8220;holiness,&#8221; or is
deficient as to this grace of God; and the second, &#8220;the profane,&#8221; is
a disturber of the peace of the Church, as Esau was, of the peace of his own
family, being &#8220;a root of bitterness.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>But observe, &#8220;peace&#8221; was to be with &#8220;<i>all
</i>men;&#8221; yet the example as to the disturber of it refers to the peace of
the Church; so with respect to &#8220;holiness,&#8221; what is universal is
inculcated; but the example as to the violator of it is particular. For want of
seeing this, no doubt some of the fathers regarded &#8220;holiness&#8221; in the
former verse us meaning chastity.<br></div>
<div>Esau became &#8220;a root of bitterness&#8221; by being profane; and to be
profane in this instance was to despise holy things, to regard them of no value,
so as to prefer to them the gratification of the flesh. This was Esau&#8217;s
profaneness, which led eventually to a dreadful discord in his family; and to
shew the evil which follows such profaneness, the Apostle points out the loss he
sustained as a warning to others.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX X 2</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 12:18-24.</b> In this comparison between the Law and the Gospel,
it would no doubt be more consonant to what is said in Exodus and also to the
comparison here made, to regard
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mh&lt;</font> as a part of the text,
though omitted in all the copies already examined. Very seldom indeed is there
any sufficient ground for a conjecture of this kind; nor can it be said that
there is here an indispensable necessity for it, only that the comparison would
be more complete, &#8212; &#8220;Ye are not come to a mount not to be touched
under the peril of destruction; but to a mount to which you have a free
access.&#8221; So terrible was the delivery of the Law, that to touch the
mountain was instant death; to approach Sion is what we are graciously invited
to do, it being the city of God, who giveth life.&#8221; The participle
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">zw~n</font> seems to have this meaning
here, as there appears no other reason why the word is here applied to
God.<br></div>
<div>In describing the superiority of the Gospel to the Law, the Apostle borrows
expressions from the former dispensation; and though Mount Sion and Jerusalem
seemed to belong to the Law, yet they are taken here in contrast with Sinai,
where the Law was proclaimed. Sion is, indeed, an evangelical term, and the
whole ceremonial Law, though added to the Law proclaimed on Mount Sinai, was yet
the Gospel typically, and existed in part before the Law was given.<br></div>
<div>The contrast here is very striking: terror and death were to the Israelites
at Sinai; but a free approach and life are to those who come to Sion: there were
on Sinai angels, surrounded with fire, darkness, and tempest; but myriads of
them, an innumerable host, are now ministering spirits to the inhabitants of
Sion: the whole assembly at the foot of Sinai were only the children of Israel;
but the assembly in Sion is the general assembly and Church of the firstborn,
the saints of God gathered from all nations: God appeared on Sinai as the judge,
ruler, and governor of one people; but the God of Sion is the judge and governor
of all who come there from all the various nations of the earth: to those at
Sinai the state of departed saints was imperfectly known; but to those who are
come to Sion their condition is well known, they being a part of that body
&#8212; the Church &#8212; of which Christ is the head: the mediator at Sinai
was Moses, a faithful servant, and no more; but the Mediator of the New
Covenant, which belongs to Sion, <i>is </i>Jesus, by virtue of whose blood all
sins are forgiven, and all pollutions removed &#8212; a blood which pleads for
mercy and not for vengeance as the blood of Abel. All the parts of the first
contrast are not mentioned, but they may easily be gathered from the
second.<br></div>
<div>That the Church on earth is here meant by Sion, seems very clear. The
Church is often called the kingdom of heaven, and its subjects are called the
citizens of heaven. That angels and saints departed are mentioned as those to
whom we are come, is no objection, because everything that belongs to Sion is
seen only by faith. Our connection with distant believers, living on the earth,
is maintained only by faith, exactly in the same manner as our connection with
angels or departed spirits. Whether the angels mentioned here are ministering
spirits, or the hosts above who serve God in heaven, it makes no difference, as
they are fellow-servants and fellow-citizens as it were with all the family on
earth. See <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510116&gt;</font></sup>Colossians 1:16,
17. It is the same company, though one is now on earth and the other in heaven;
they will finally be more closely united.<br></div>
<div>To the notion that some, as <i>Macknight </i>and others, have entertained,
that Sion here means the Church in its glorified state after the resurrection,
there are insuperable objections: the contrast in that case would not be
suitable; for the object of the Apostle is evidently to set forth the excellency
of the Gospel dispensation in comparison with that of the Law; no satisfactory
difference on such a supposition could be made between the Church of the
firstborn and the spirits of just men made perfect; the expression, &#8220;the
enrolled in heaven,&#8221; is more suitably applied to those on earth than to
those in glory; and there would be no propriety in that case in mentioning
Christ as the Mediator, or that his blood speaks a language different from that
of Abel.<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 12:27</b>. <font color="Maroon"><i>As</i> <i>of th</i>i<i>ngs

<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">wJv pepoihme&gt;nwn</font><i>, </i>as
given by <i>Doddridge, Scott, </i>and <i>Stuart, is, </i>that they were things
created, and therefore perishable, appointed only for a time. <i>Macknight
</i>considered the expression elliptical for things &#8220;made with
hands;&#8221; which denotes what is of an imperfect nature. But the explanation
of <i>Schleusner </i>is the most natural and most suitable to the passage. He
says that <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">poie&gt;w</font><i> </i>means
sometimes to accomplish, to finish, to bring to an end.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450421&gt;</font></sup>Romans 4:21; 9:28;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490311&gt;</font></sup>Ephesians 3:11;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520524&gt;</font></sup>1 Thessalonians 5:24.) Then
the rendering would be, &#8220;as of things to be completed,&#8221; or brought
to an end. They were things to be shaken or changed, as things to be finished or
terminated. The corresponding verb in Hebrew,
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h&ccedil;[</font>, has evidently this
meaning, &#8220;all his works which he had made,&#8221;
(<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h&ccedil;[</font>,) or completed, or
finished. (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010202&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 2:2; see
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234104&gt;</font></sup>Isaiah 41:4.)<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 12:28.</b><font color="Maroon"> <i>let us have grace,
etc</i></font><i>. </i>So<i> Beza, Grotius, Doddridge, </i>and <i>Scott. </i>The
<i>Vulg. </i>and <i>Calvin </i>are no doubt wrong. The authority as to MSS. is
altogether in favor of the verb being in the imperative mood. <i>Macknight
</i>gives this singular rendering, &#8220;Let us hold fast a gift whereby we can
worship God,&#8221; etc. He explains the &#8220;gift&#8221; as denoting the
dispensation of religion. No less unsuitable is the version of <i>Stuart,
</i>though countenanced by some of the fathers, &#8220;Let us manifest gratitude
(by which we may serve God acceptably) with reverence and godly fear.&#8221;
When &#8220;<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ca&gt;riv</font>&#8221;<i>
</i>means gratitude, it is ever followed by a dative case, which is not the case
here. To have faith, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e]cein
pi&gt;stin</font><i> </i>is to possess it,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401720&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 17:20;) to have
eternal life is to possess it, (Matthew 19:16;) to have hope is to enjoy or
possess it, (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451504&gt;</font></sup>Romans 15:4;)
and so to have grace is to possess it. And this alone comports with what
follows; it is the possession of that by which we may &#8220;serve God
acceptably.&#8221; By &#8220;grace&#8221; we are to understand the gracious help
and assistance which God promises to all who seek it.<br></div>
<div>To receive a kingdom is to obtain a right or a title to it; and having the
promise of this kingdom we ought to seek, attain, and possess that grace, that
divine help, by which we may in the meantime serve God acceptably. This is the
obvious meaning of the passage.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX A 3</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 12:28.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>With reverence and godly
fear</i></font><i>. </i>The first word,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aijdwv,</font><i> </i>means
&#8220;modesty,&#8221; as rendered in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540209&gt;</font></sup>1 Timothy 2:9, and it is
not found elsewhere in the New Testament. It has in the classics the meaning of
respect and reverence. The second word,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujlaqei&gt;a</font>, properly means
caution, circumspection, awfulness, and hence dread and fear. It is found only
here, and chapter 5:7. It occurs as a passive participle twice, in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442310&gt;</font></sup>Acts 23:10, and in chapter
11:7, and means to be influenced or moved with fear. Neither &#8220;godly&#8221;
nor &#8220;religious&#8221; ought to be added to it.<br></div>
<div>It may seem difficult to reconcile this &#8220;fear&#8221; or dread with
that love, and confidence, and delight with which God is to be served according
to the evident testimony of Scripture, especially of the New Testament. But were
we to take the first word as meaning &#8220;modesty,&#8221; (or humility,) as
rendered by <i>Beza, </i>we might regard the words as describing what we ought
to feel in considering what we are in ourselves, and what the danger is to which
we are exposed. The meaning then would be, that we are to serve God under a deep
consciousness of our own weakness, and under a fear or dread of the danger of
apostasy, though that dread may arise in part from an apprehension of what God
will be to apostates, according to what is said in the following verse. Without
these two feelings it is indeed impossible for us in our present state to serve
God acceptably; for without humility arising from a sense of unworthiness and
weakness, we shall not be capable of appreciating his mercy; and without the
dread of sin, and especially of apostasy, we shall never depend as we ought on
God&#8217;s power to preserve us.<br></div>
<div>These feelings do not in the least degree interfere with the exercise of
love, gratitude, or confidence, but on the contrary strengthen them. The weak
shall be supported, but he must feel his weakness; and those who dread sin (not
God) shall be kept and preserved; but they must feel this dread. And the more
our weakness is felt, the stronger we shall be, as Paul says, &#8220;When I am
weak, then am I strong;&#8221; and the more we fear and dread sin, the safer we
shall be. But, like Peter, we shall stumble and fall if we become self-confident
and exempt from the dread of sin.<br></div>
<div>No other meaning but that of fear or dread belongs to
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujlaqei&gt;a</font>, wherever found,
either as a noun or a participle. It is the fear of evil and not the fear of
God. See the <i>Sept., </i>in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;062224&gt;</font></sup>Joshua 22:24; and 1 Macc.
3:30; 12:42. There is no place found where it denotes the fear of God.<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 13:5</b><font color="Maroon"><b><i>.</i></b><i> I will never
leave thee, etc</i>.</font> There are three places where these words with some
variety are found,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053106&gt;</font></sup>Deuteronomy 31:6;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;060105&gt;</font></sup>Joshua 1:5;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;132820&gt;</font></sup>1 Chronicles 28:20. In the
first, they are the words of Moses to the people of Israel; in the second, the
words of God to Joshua; and in the third the words of David to Solomon. The
Hebrew in the three places is exactly the same, excepting the change of person;
but in none is the version of the <i>Sept. </i>the same. The words, as here
given, is literally the Hebrew in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;060105&gt;</font></sup>Joshua 1:5, where the Greek
version is wholly different; only the Apostle introduces the treble negatives as
found in that version in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053106&gt;</font></sup>Deuteronomy 31:6, but not
given in that version in either of the two other instances. Then the quotation
is from <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;060105&gt;</font></sup>Joshua 1:5, except
that the Apostle follows the <i>Sept. </i>in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053106&gt;</font></sup>Deuteronomy 31:6, as to the
three negatives.<br></div>
<div>The Hebrew could not be rendered as to the verbs more correctly than what
is done by the Apostle, which are the same in the <i>Sept., </i>except in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;060105&gt;</font></sup>Joshua 1:5. The first verb
means to relax, and in a transitive sense, to let go, to dismiss, to give up, to
surrender; and the second verb means to leave, to forsake, to desert. The verbs
in Greek bear a similar meaning. To give a distinct sense to each, we may render
the clause thus, &#8212;<br></div>
<div align="center"><font color="Navy"><b><i>&#8220;I will not dismiss
thee,</i></b></font><br><font color="Navy"><b><i>Nor will I by any means desert
thee.&#8221;</i></b></font><br></div>
<div>That is, I will not give thee up so as to separate myself from thee; nor
will desert thee, no, by no means, when thou art in difficulties and
trials.<br></div>
<div>The three negatives with the last verb are remarkable. There is in Hebrew
what somewhat corresponds with them. The
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">w</font> when preceded by a negative may
often be rendered <i>and not, nor, neither. </i>Then the version would be this,
&#8220;I will not dismiss thee, nor will I, no, forsake thee.&#8221; It is
indeed a promise, that God will continue to be our God, so as not to give us up,
and that he will by no means forsake us in time of need.<br></div>
<div>The quotation in the next verse is from
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B806&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 118:6, and is
literally the <i>Sept. </i>The Hebrew is somewhat different, &#8220;The Lord is
mine, and I will not fear; what can man do to me?&#8221; Then the next verse
shews that the Lord who was his was also a help to him, &#8220;The Lord, mine,
is my help, (literally, for my help;) and I shall look on my haters;&#8221; a
phrase which signifies that he should gain the victory over them. The word
&#8220;help&#8221; is borrowed by the <i>Sept. </i>from the seventh verse; and
as it was evidently the Apostle&#8217;s design to confirm the last clause of the
previous citation, &#8220;I will not forsake thee,&#8221; he deemed it
sufficient to quote the words of the <i>Sept.</i><br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 13:7<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>Rule over you,

<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">hJgoume&gt;noi</font><i> </i>means
properly leaders, conductors, guides, such as lead the way, and according to its
secondary meaning, presidents, chiefs, governors, rulers. It is rendered
&#8220;prefects &#8212; praefectorum,&#8221; by the <i>Vulg</i>.; &#8220;leaders
&#8212; ductorum,&#8221; by <i>Beza </i>and <i>Stuart; </i>and
&#8220;rulers&#8221; by <i>Macknight; Doddridge </i>paraphrases it, &#8220;Who
have presided over you.&#8221; The version most suitable to the context is
&#8220;your leaders;&#8221; for they are spoken of as persons to be followed;
they were such as took the lead in religion and were examples to others. But in
verse 17<i> </i>the idea of a ruler is most suitable, for they were to be
obeyed. The specific meaning of a word which has various senses is ever to be
ascertained from the context. The leaders here referred to were those who had
finished their course; for they were <i>to remember </i>them, and not to observe
their conduct then as though they were living; and contemplating the end or
conclusion of their life, they were to follow their faith.<br></div>
<div>The word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e]cqasiv</font>; means an
outlet, a way of escape, also the end, conclusion, or termination of a thing, or
the issue; and <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnastrofh&lt;</font><i>
</i>signifies manner of life, intercourse, behavior, conduct, the way in which
one lives. There is no English word that can suitably express it. It may be
rendered here &#8220;life,&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;and contemplating the end of
their life, follow their faith;&#8221; that <i>is, </i>what they believed. They
ended their life in peace, and were enabled to triumph over all evils by means
of the faith which they professed and possessed.<br></div>

<div><b>CHAPTER 13:8<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>Jesus Christ the
same, etc</i></font><i>. </i>The connection of this verse is differently viewed,
and also its meaning. Some connect it with the preceding verse thus, &#8212;
&#8220;Jesus Christ is even the same in power, grace, and faithfulness; he
supported your leaders and guides, who have completed their trials victoriously;
he being still the same will support you.&#8221; Such is the view taken by
<i>Grotius, Doddridge, Macknight, Scott, </i>and <i>Stuart. </i>Others, as
<i>Scholefield, Bloomfield, </i>and some German divines, connect the verse with
what follows in this sense, &#8212; &#8220;Jesus Christ is the same, therefore
be ye the same, and be not carried about by divers and strange
doctrines.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>But there is no need of this exclusive connection, as the verse appears
connected with the preceding and the following verse. Those who adopt the first
view seem to be wrong as to the main subject of the passage. What the Apostle
exhorted the Hebrews to do was to follow the <i>faith </i>of their leaders who
were gone to rest, and the contemplation of their happy and victorious end was
introduced for the purpose of encouragement in following their faith. And that
this is the particular and the chief point handled here is evident from the
ninth verse, where this doctrine is as it were applied, &#8220;Be ye not carried
about,&#8221; etc. Then the meaning of the whole passage may be given thus,
&#8212; &#8220;Follow the faith of your departed guides; there is no change in
it, Christ is ever the same in his mind, will, and purpose as to the faith:
suffer not, therefore, yourselves to be led astray by various and strange
doctrines, different from the faith of those who taught you and have attained a
happy end.&#8221; Thus the passage appears consistent throughout and suitably
connected, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>7.</b></font> Remember your leaders, who have spoken
to you the word of God, and contemplating the end of their life, follow
their<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>8.</b></font> faith: Jesus Christ, yesterday and
today, <i>is </i>the same, and<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>9.</b></font><i> will be </i>for ever: Be not carried
about by various and strange (new) doctrines; for it is good that the heart
should be made firm by grace, not by meats, by which they have not profited who
have been so occupied.<br></div>
<div>If the auxiliary verb be put in at all in the eighth verse, it ought to be
put in twice. But the words may be rendered as a nominative case absolute,
&#8220;Jesus Christ <i>being </i>the same yesterday, and today, and for
ever;&#8221; as though he had said, &#8220;I exhort you to follow their faith,
inasmuch as Jesus Christ, our teacher, mediator, and Savior never changes, but
is ever the same.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>The MSS. are more in favor <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mh&lt;
parafe&gt;resqe,</font> &#8220;Be ye not carried away,&#8221; than of
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mh&lt; perife&gt;resqe</font>, &#8220;Be
ye not carried about;&#8221; but as the latter verb is used on the same subject
in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490414&gt;</font></sup>Ephesians 4:14, it is
better to adopt it here: the difference indeed is very trifling.<br></div>
<div>The passage, as thus explained, bears strongly against every innovation in
the faith, in the doctrine of the Gospel, Christ its teacher being ever the
same. There are to be no strange or new doctrines; for such is the meaning of
strange here, that is, what is alien to the Gospel, and therefore new. And what
are all the additions which have been made by the fathers, and especially by the
Church of Rome, but various doctrines, foreign to the Gospel, which ever
continues the same? Their variety is as great as their novelty. Christ was, is,
and will ever be the same as teacher, mediator, and Savior; hence the faith,
once delivered to the saints, must continue unchangeably the same.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX F 3</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 13:9.</b> <font color="Maroon"><i>For it is a good thing,
etc</i></font><i>. </i>There seems to be some obscurity in the latter part of
this verse, and in the following verses. There appears, however, to be an
intimation of what the Apostle means in the term &#8220;strange&#8221; or new,
as applied to the doctrines here referred to. There was probably an attempt made
to unite some parts of the ceremonial law, especially the feasts, with the
Gospel. The distinction of meats was not new, but this kind of mixture might
have been so termed, that is, a participation in those sacrifices, part of which
was allowed to be eaten by those who presented them,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;030711&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus 7:11-21. This was
probably one of the strange or new doctrines. Such a compliance must have been
made for the sake of avoiding reproach and persecution.<br></div>
<div>The Apostle says in verse 10, that those who did eat of the sacrifices
could not be partakers of what Christians feed on. Then in verse 11, he mentions
the sacrifice made annually by the high priest, no part of which was eaten, but
the whole was burnt without the camp, (referring to the state of things when the
tabernacle was erected in the wilderness,) intimating that the <i>chief
</i>sacrifice was not partaken of either by the priests or by the people. Taking
this fact as an intimation, and a symbol of what was to be, he says that Christ
had offered the great and the real sacrifice without the gate, (alluding now to
the temple at Jerusalem,) where we are to follow him, bearing the reproach to
which he was subjected; and we are not to return as it were to the tabernacle,
and to partake of such sacrifices as were there eaten.<br></div>
<div>As an inducement to bear reproach, he reminds them that life is but short,
and that Christians expect their home in another country; and at last he states
what sacrifices they were still to offer to God, not the sacrifices of
peace-offerings, but those of praise and thanksgiving, and also of good
works.<br></div>
<div>The &#8220;meats&#8221; according to this view, mentioned in verse 9, must
have been the meats eaten when free-will-offerings were presented. Admitting
that the great sacrifice for sin had been offered by Christ, some might have
still supposed and taught that such offerings as these were still allowed; and
to eat of such offerings might have been thought a very profitable thing,
calculated to produce a great benefit. In opposition to such a sentiment, the
Apostle may be supposed to have said, that it was good that the heart should be
strengthened by grace, not by meats, which did not prove profitable to those who
usually partook of them.<br></div>
<div>The &#8220;altar&#8221; is to be taken for the sacrifices offered on it. He
declares that it was not possible to partake of the Christian&#8217;s food, and
of the offerings made on the altar. The literal rendering of the 11th and 12th
verses is as follows, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>11.</b></font>  &#8220;Moreover, of the animals whose
blood for sin is brought into the holiest by the high priest, the bodies of
these are<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>12. </b></font>burnt without the camp. Therefore
Jesus also, that he might make expiation for the people by his own blood,
suffered without the gate.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>The purpose for which these words seem to have been added, was to shew that
no eating, no meats, were connected with the sacrifice for sin; and by saying in
the following verse that we are to follow Christ without the camp, bearing his
reproach, the Apostle intimates that this reproach ought not to be avoided by
joining those in the tabernacle, engaged in offering peace-offerings on which
they feasted.<br></div>
<div>The import of the whole passage, 9-16, may be thus stated: &#8212;
&#8220;Be not led away by various kinds of doctrines, and such as are new;
grace, and not eating of offerings, strengthens the heart to enable it to
maintain the faith and to endure trials; and this grace, the meat that belongs
to our altar, cannot be partaken of by those who are still wedded to the altar
of the earthly tabernacle. And as to the annual sacrifice for sin, it is not
eaten, but all burnt, not in the tabernacle, but without the camp, &#8212; an
intimation of what Christ did when he suffered without the gate. Thither we must
follow him, and not return again to the tabernacle in order to avoid reproach;
and this reproach will not be long, for we are hastening to another world; and
instead of presenting free-will offerings and eating of them, what we are to
offer now are the sacrifices of praise, of thanksgiving, and of good
works.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX G 3</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 13:17<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>That they may
do it with joy, etc.</i></font> There is a difference of opinion as to this
sentence. Some, as <i>Theophylact, Grotius, </i>and <i>Doddridge </i>refer
&#8220;it,&#8221; or &#8220;this,&#8221; to watching; others, as <i>Macknight,
Scott, </i>and <i>Stuart, </i>apply &#8220;it&#8221; to the account that is to
be given by ministers. The first view, which <i>Calvin </i>evidently takes, is
alone consistent with the rest of the passage. The concluding words of the verse
are wholly inappropriate, if the account at the day of judgment be considered as
intended, but in every way suitable when we regard watching as referred to. To
say that an unfavorable account at the last day would be
&#8220;unprofitable&#8221; to the people, would be to use an expression in no
way congruous; but to represent the watching of ministers, when rendered
&#8220;grievous&#8221; by the perverseness and refractory conduct of the people,
as unprofitable to the people themselves, is altogether appropriate; and it is a
very important consideration, and affords a strong argument in favor of
obedience. The people by insubordination, not only grieve those who watch over
them, but also injure themselves, prevent their own improvement, and render the
watching care of their ministers useless. Reference is made by <i>Macknight
</i>to <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520219&gt;</font></sup>1 Thessalonians
2:19; but &#8220;joy&#8221; only is mentioned there; and <i>Doddridge </i>justly
observes, &#8220;It is not possible for any perverseness of the people to
prevent a faithful minister from giving up his account with joy; nor can any
<i>groans</i> be mingled with the triumphant songs which God will put into the
mouths of all his people.&#8221; No doubt the &#8220;grief&#8221; here mentioned
shews clearly the meaning of the passage.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">APPENDIX H 3</font><br></div>
<div><b>CHAPTER 13:20<i>.</i></b><i> </i><font color="Maroon"><i>Through the
blood of the covenant, etc</i></font><i>. </i>The <i>Vul</i>g<i>., </i>our
version, <i>Calvin, </i>and <i>Scott, </i>connect the words with &#8220;bringing
again from the dead;&#8221; only the <i>Vulg</i>. and <i>Calvin </i>render the
preposition <i>in, </i>and our version and <i>Scott, through. </i>The idea
conveyed by <i>in </i>is explained by <i>Calvin, </i>and the same is given by
<i>Theodoret, </i>and what is meant by <i>through </i>is thus explained by
<i>Scott, </i>&#8212; &#8220;In order to shew that his ransom was accepted, and
that he might perform his gracious work as the great Shepherd of the sheep, God
the Father had raised him from the dead &#8216;through the blood of the
everlasting covenant.&#8217;&#8221;<br></div>
<div>Others, as <i>Beza, Doddridge </i>and <i>Stuart, </i>connect the words with
&#8220;the great Shepherd,&#8221; that is, that Christ became the great Shepherd
of the sheep through the blood of an everlasting covenant; and
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442028&gt;</font></sup>Acts 20:28<i>, </i>and
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431011&gt;</font></sup>John 10:11-19, have been
referred to as favorable to this view. <i>Stuart&#8217;s </i>version is the
following, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>20. </b></font> &#8220;Now may the God of peace, that
raised from the dead our Lord Jesus, (who by the blood of an everlasting
covenant<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>21</b></font>. has become the great Shepherd of the
sheep,) prepare you for every good work, that ye may do his will; working in you
that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory
for ever and ever.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>But a more literal rendering may be given thus, &#8212;<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>20. </b></font>&#8220;Now the God of peace, who has
restored from the dead the Shepherd of the sheep (the chief through the blood
of<br></div>
<div><font color="Navy"><b>21.</b></font> the everlasting covenant) our Lord
Jesus, &#8212; may he fit you for every good work to do his will, forming in you
what is well-pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for
ever and ever.&#8221;<br></div>
<div>The word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">me&gt;gav</font> great,
means sometimes &#8220;chief,&#8221; <i>summus, </i>as given by <i>Schleusner;
</i>and it has this meaning in chapter 4:14. In
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431011&gt;</font></sup>John 10:11, etc., our
Savior refers to his death, the shedding of his blood, as an evidence that he
was <i>the </i>good Shepherd. It may then be rightly said, that he became the
chief by or through the blood of the everlasting covenant, that is, through the
blood that sealed and rendered effectual a covenant that is permanent, and not
temporary like that of Moses.<br></div>
<div>His prayer was that God would fit, adapt, or prepare them for every good
work; and this he afterwards explains, &#8220;forming,&#8221; producing, or
creating &#8220;in you,&#8221; etc.; for the verb,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">poie&gt;w</font>, to make, is often used
in this sense. He means an internal influence or operation, as expressed more
fully in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;503813&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 2:13,
&#8220;For it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do (literally, to
work) of his good pleasure.&#8221; And this forming or creating in them what was
pleasing in his sight was to be done through Jesus Christ, through him as a
Mediator, he having become the chief Shepherd of the sheep by shedding his blood
for them.<br></div>

<div><font color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font>GOD having formerly spoken many times
and in many ways to the fathers by the prophets,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font>Has in these last days spoken to us by
the Son, whom he has constituted the heir of all things, by whom also he made
the worlds;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font>Who being the effulgence of his glory,
and the impress of his person, and sustaining all things by his powerful word,
having by himself effected the purgation of our sins, sat down on the right hand
of Majesty on high;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font>Being so much superior to the angels,
as he has inherited a name more excellent than they.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font>For to whom of the angels has he ever
said, &#8220;My Son art thou, I have this day begotten thee?&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font>And again, &#8220;I will be to him a
Father, and he shall be to me a Son?&#8221; and again, when he introduces the
first-begotten into the world, he says, &#8220;And adore him let all the angels
of God.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font>And of the angels he saith, &#8220;Who
makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire:&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font>But of the Son, &#8220;Thy throne, O
God, is for ever and ever; a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy
kingdom:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font>Thou hast loved righteousness and
hated iniquity; therefore God hath anointed thee, <i>even </i>thy God, with the
oil of joy above thy companions:&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font>And, &#8220;Thou art from the
beginning, O Lord, thou hast founded the earth, and the works of thine hands are
the heavens;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font>They shall perish, but thou
continuest; and all as a garment shall become old,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font>And as a vesture shalt thou roll them
up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not
fail.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font>But to whom of the angels has he ever
said, &#8220;Sit at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy
footstool?&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font>Are they not all administrative
spirits, who are sent forth to minister for those who are to inherit
salvation?<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">CHAPTER 2</font><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font>Wherefore we ought to attend more to
those things which we hear, lest at any time we let <i>them flow
</i>away.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font>For if the word which had been
declared by angels, was sure, and every transgression and disobedience received
a just recompense of reward;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font>How shall we escape, if we neglect so
great a salvation? which, having first been begun to be declared by the Lord,
has been confirmed to as by those who had heard him;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font>While God was at the same time bearing
a testimony by signs and wonders and various miracles, and gift distributed by
the Holy Spirit, according to his will.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font>For to the angels has he not subjected
the future world of  which we speak:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font>But one has in a certain place
testified, saying, &#8220;What is man, that thou art mindful of him&#8221; or
the son of man, that thou visitest him?<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font>Thou hast made him a little inferior
to the angels; with glory and honor hast thou crowned him, and hast set him over
the works of thine hands:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font>All things hast thou made subject
under his feet.&#8221; Doubtless in making subject all things to him, he left
nothing that is not made subject: notwithstanding we do not as yet see all
things made subject to him;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font>But we behold Jesus, who was made a
little inferior to the angels, (crowned with glory and honor for having suffered
death,) that he might by the grace of God taste death for all.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font>For it became him, for whom <i>are
</i>all things, and through whom <i>are </i>all things, in leading many sons to
glory, to consecrate the leader of their salvation by sufferings:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font>For he who sanctifies and they who
are sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them
brethren;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font>Saying, &#8220;I will declare thy
name to my brethren; in the midst of the Church will I sing to thee:&#8221; and
again, &#8220;I will trust in him;&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font>And again, &#8220;Behold I and the
children whom God has given me.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font>Since then the children partake of
flesh and blood, he also in like manner was partaker of the same, that by death
he might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font>And might deliver them who through
fear of death were all their life subject to bondage.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font>For he nowhere takes hold on angels;
but on the seed of Abraham does he take hold.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font>It hence behooved him to become in
all things like his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high
priest in things respecting God, in order to atone for the sins of the
people:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>18	</b></font>For as it happened to him to be
tried, he is able to succor them who are tried.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">CHAPTER 3</font><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font>Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of
the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and the High Priest of our
profession, Christ Jesus:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font>Who was faithful to him who had
appointed him, as Moses also was in his whole house.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font>For of greater glory was he counted
worthy than Moses, as the builder has greater honor than the house
itself<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font>Every house is indeed built by some
one; but he who has built all things is God.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font>And Moses was indeed faithful in his
whole house as a minister, for a testimony to those things which were afterwards
to be declared;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font>But Christ as a Son over his own
house; whose house we are, if we hold firm the confidence and the glorying of
our hope to the end.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font>Therefore (as the Holy Spirit saith,
&#8220;Today, if ye will hear his voice,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font>Harden not your hearts, as in the
provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font>When your fathers tempted me, proved
me, and saw my works forty years:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font>I was therefore offended with that
generation, and said, They always err in heart, and they have not known my
ways;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font>So I swore in my wrath, They shall
not enter into my rest&#8221;)<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font>See, brethren, that there be not at
any time in any of you the wicked heart of unbelief, by departing from the
living God:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font>But exhort one another daily, while
it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through the deception of
sin.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font>For we are become partakers of
Christ, if indeed we hold firm the beginning of our confidence to the
end,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font>since it is said, &#8220;Today, if ye
will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the
provocation:&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font>For some, when they had heard, did
provoke; but not all who had come out of Egypt by Moses.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font>With whom then was he offended for
forty years? was it not with them who had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the
wilderness<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>18	</b></font>And to whom did he swear that they
should not enter into his rest, except to the unbelieving?<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>19	</b></font>We then see that they could not enter
in on account of unbelief.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">CHAPTER 4</font><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font>Let us then fear, lest, when a promise
of entering into his rest remains, any of us should seem to be disappointed of
it;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font>For to us has the promise been
announced as well as to them; but the word heard did not profit them, for it was
not connected with faith in those who heard <i>it.</i><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font>For we enter into his rest when we
believe; as he has said, &#8220;As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter
into my rest;&#8221; though the works were done at the creation of the
world;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font>For he has said thus in a certain
place of the seventh day, &#8220;And God rested on the seventh day from all his
works:&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font>And here again, &#8220;If they shall
enter into my rest.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font>Seeing then it remains that some do
enter into it, but they to whom it was first preached did not enter in on
account of unbelief.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font>Again he defines a certain day, saying
by David, &#8220;Today,&#8221; after so long a time, (as it is said,)
&#8220;Today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
hearts.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font>For if Joshua had given them rest, he
would not have spoken of another after those days.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font>Then there remains a Sabbath-rest for
the people of God;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font>For he who is entered into his rest,
has also himself rested from his own works, as God from his.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font>Let us then strive to enter into that
rest, lest no one fail according to the same example of unbelief.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font>For living is the word of God and
efficacious, and more penetrating than any two-edged sword, reaching even to the
dividing of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and <i>is </i>a
discerner of the thoughts and intentions of the heart:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font>For there is no creature which does
not appear before him; nay, all things are naked and open to the eyes of him
with whom we have to do.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font>Having then a great high priest, who
has entered into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our
profession:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font>For we have not a high priest who
cannot sympathize with our infirmities; but <i>was in </i>all things tempted
like as we are, yet without sin.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font>Let us then come with confidence to
the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace for a seasonable
help.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">CHAPTER 5</font><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font>For every high priest, taken from men,
is appointed for men as to things pertaining to God, that he may offer gifts and
sacrifices for sins;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font>Who can render himself gentle to the
ignorant and the erring, since he himself is also surrounded with
infirmity:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font>And on this account he ought, as for
the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font>And no one takes to himself this
honor, but he, who is called by God, as Aaron also <i>was.</i><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font><i>So </i>also Christ glorified not
himself that he became a high priest, but he who said to him, &#8220;My Son art
thou, I have this day begotten thee;&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font>As also he says in another place,
&#8220;Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of
Melchisedec:&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font>Who in the days of his flesh, when he
offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, to him who
was able to save him from death, and was heard in what he feared;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font>Though he was a Son, yet learned
obedience from those things which he suffered;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font>And being sanctified, he became to all
who obey him the author of eternal salvation;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font>Having been called by God a priest
according to the order of Melchisedec:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font>If whom we have much to say to you,
and difficult to be explained, since ye are dull of hearing.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font>For when ye ought for the time to be
teachers, ye have again need that one should teach you the elements of the
beginning of God&#8217;s words, and are become such as have need of milk, And
not of strong meat:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font>For every one who partakes of milk is
inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is an infant;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font>But strong meat is for the perfect,
who through practice have their senses exercised so as to distinguish between
good and evil.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">CHAPTER 6</font><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font>Therefore, passing by the first
doctrine of Christ, let us be born onward to perfection, not laying again the
foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font>(of the doctrine of baptisms and of
the imposition of hands,) and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal
judgment;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font>And this we shall do, if God will
permit.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font>For it is impossible that those who
have been once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been
made partakers of the Holy Spirit,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font>And have tasted the good word of God,
and the powers of the world to come,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font>And have fallen away, should be
renewed again into repentance, they having again crucified to themselves the Son
of God, and exposed him to open shame.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font>For the earth, which drinketh the rain
which often cometh upon it, and bringeth forth a blade meet for them by whom it
is cultivated, receiveth a blessing from God:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font>But that which beareth thorns and
briers is worthless and nigh a curse, the end of which is to be
burned.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font>But we are persuaded, beloved, of
better things respecting you, and those connected with salvation, though we thus
speak:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font>For God is not unjust, that he should
forget your work, and the labor of that love which yon have shewed towards his
name, since ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font>But we desire that every one of you
should shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the
end;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font>So that ye may not become slothful,
but be followers of those who by faith and patience have inherited the
promises.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font>For when God made a promise to
Abraham, since he bad none greater by whom he could swear, he swore by
himself,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font>Saying, &#8220;Blessing I will bless
thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee:&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font>And so after having patiently waited,
he obtained the promise.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font>For men indeed swear by one who is
greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all
dispute:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font>Therefore God, willing more
abundantly to shew to the heirs of salvation the immutability of his counsel,
interposed an oath;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>18	</b></font>That by two immutable things, in
which it was impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong consolation,
who have fled to lay hold on the hope set before us:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>19	</b></font>Which we have as an anchor of the
soul, safe and firm, and entering into what is within the veil;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>20	</b></font>Where our forerunner, Jesus, has
entered, having been made a high priest for ever, according to the order of
Melchisedec.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">CHAPTER 7</font><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font>For this Melchisedec, the king of
Salem, <i>was a </i>priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from
the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font>To whom also Abraham divided the tenth
of all; who is first indeed, by interpretation, called the King of
righteousness, and then also the King of Salem, that is, the King of
peace;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font>Without father, without mother,
without kindred, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but being
made like to the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font>Now consider how great is he, to whom
the patriarch Abraham gave even the tenth of the spoils.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font>And they indeed who receive the
priesthood, even those who are of the sons of Levi, have a command to take the
tenth, according to the law from the people, that is, from their brethren,
though they have come forth from the loins of Abraham:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font>But he whose kindred is not counted
from them, took the tenth from Abraham, and blessed him who had the
promises:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font>And without all controversy, the less
is blessed by the greater.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font>And here indeed men who die receive
the tenth; but there he, of whom it is testified that he liveth;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font>And as I may so say, Levi who is wont
to receive the tenth, paid the tenth in Abraham;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font>For he was as yet in the loins of his
father when Melchisedec met him.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font>If then there was perfection by the
Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what need
there was still, that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec,
and should not be called after the order of Aaron?<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font>For when the priesthood is changed,
there is also necessarily <i>a </i>change of the law.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font>Doubtless he of whom these things are
said, was from another tribe, from which no one attended at the altar:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font>For it is clear that our Lord
descended from the tribe of Judah, of which tribe Moses has said nothing as to
the priesthood;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font>And it is still more clear, since
another priest was to rise according to the order of Melchisedec;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font>Who was not made according to the law
of a carnal command, but according to the power of a permanent life;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font>For he thus testifies, &#8220;Thou
art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>18	</b></font>For there is an abrogation of the
former command, on account of its weakness and uselessness;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>19	</b></font>For the law perfected nothing, but
<i>was </i>an introduction to a better hope, by which we draw nigh to
God;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>20	</b></font>And this <i>is</i> better, because it
was not done without an oath:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>21	</b></font>For they indeed are made priests
without an oath; but he with an oath by him who said to him, &#8220;Thou art a
priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>22	</b></font>Of so much a better covenant is Jesus
made the surety.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>23	</b></font>And they indeed being many were made
priests, for they were not suffered by death to continue:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>24	</b></font>But he, as he remains perpetually,
has an unchangeable priesthood.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>25	</b></font>Hence he is able also to save for
ever those who through him come to God, always living, that he may intercede for
them.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>26	</b></font>For such a high priest became us,
being holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and higher than the
heavens;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>27	</b></font>Who has no need, as the priests,
daily to offer sacrifices, first for their own sins, and then for <i>the sins
</i>of the people; for this he did once when he offered up himself.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>28	</b></font>The law indeed makes men priests who
have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the Law, the Son, made
perfect for ever.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">CHAPTER 8</font><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font>Now of the things which have been said
the sum is, &#8212; Such an high priest have we, that hath sat down on the right
hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font>A minister of the sanctuary, even of
the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched and not man.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font>For every high priest is appointed to
offer gifts and sacrifices: it is hence necessary that he also should have that
which he might offer.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font>If indeed he were on earth, he could
not be a priest, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the
law;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font>Who minister in [that which
<i>is</i>]<i> </i>the exemplar and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was
warned by the oracle, when he was about to make the tabernacle,
&#8220;See,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that thou make all things according to the
pattern which was shewn to thee in the mount.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font>But now he has obtained a more
excellent ministry, inasmuch as he is the Mediator of a better covenant, which
has been established on better promises.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font>For if the first had been faultless,
there would have been no place sought for the second.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font>For finding fault with them, he says,
&#8220;Behold, the days are coming, saith the Lord, when I shall make with the
house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font>Not according to the covenant I made
with their fathers in the day when I laid hold on their hand to lead them up
from the land of Egypt; because they have not continued in my covenant and I
disregarded them, saith the Lord:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font>For this is the covenant which I will
make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my
laws in their mind, and in their hearts will I write them; and I will be to them
a God, and they shall be to me a people;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font>And they shall not teach every one
his neighbor, and every one his brother, saying, Know thou the Lord; for all
shall know me, from the least among them to the greatest;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font>For I will be merciful to their
unrighteousness, and their sins and iniquities will I no more remember.&#8221;
By calling it new, he hath made old the first; and that which is old and aged is
on the eve of vanishing.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">CHAPTER 9</font><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font>The first then had indeed ordinances
of worship and a worldly sanctuary:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font>For there was made the first
tabernacle in which <i>were </i>the candlestick, and the table, and the
shew-bread, which is called the sanctuary;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font>And after the second vail, the
tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies, which has the golden censer, and
the ark<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font>Of the covenant covered around with
gold, in which is the golden pot which has manna, and Aaron&#8217;s rod which
had budded, and the tables of the covenant;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font>And over it the cherubim of glory
overshadowing the mercy-seat: of which it is not for us now to speak
particularly.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font>Now these things being thus set in
order, into the first tabernacle the priests always enter who perform the
service;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font>But into the second, the high priest
alone once a year, not without blood, which he offers for the ignorances of
himself and of the people;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font>The Holy Spirit intimating this,
&#8212; That the way to the holiest was not yet made manifest while the first
tabernacle was yet standing;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font>Which was a likeness for the time
present, in which gifts and sacrifices are offered, which cannot as to
conscience sanctify the worshipper,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font>Being imposed only with meats and
drinks, and divers washings and sanctifications of the flesh, until the time of
emendation.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font>But Christ, having afterwards come a
high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle,
not made with hands, that is, not of this creation,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font>Nor by the blood of goats and calves,
but by his own blood, entered once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
redemption.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font>For if the blood of bulls and of
goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkled on the unclean, sanctifies to the
purifying of the flesh;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font>How much more shall the blood of
Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself, <i>being </i>faultless, to
God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font>And for this reason he is the
Mediator of a new testament, that by means of death for the redemption of
transgressions under the first testament, they who were called might receive the
promise of the eternal inheritance<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font>For where a testament is, there must
necessarily be the death of the testator:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font>For a testament is of force as to the
dead, for it is never valid as long as the testator is living.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>18	</b></font>Hence the first was not dedicated
without blood:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>19	</b></font>For when every command according to
the law had been spoken by Moses to the whole people, taking the blood of calves
and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled the book
and all the people,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>20	</b></font>Saying, &#8220;This is the blood of
the testament which God hath commanded you.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>21	</b></font>And he sprinkled also in a like
manner with blood the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>22	</b></font>And nearly all things are cleansed by
blood according to the law: and without shedding of blood there is no
remission.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>23	</b></font>It is then necessary that the
exemplars of those things which are in heaven should be cleansed with these, but
the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>24	</b></font>For Christ has not entered into holy
places made with hands, the exemplars of the true, but into heaven itself, that
he may now appear before God for us;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>25	</b></font>Not indeed that he may often offer
himself, as the high priest <i>who </i>enters into the holiest every year with
another&#8217;s blood,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>26	</b></font>(for then he must have often suffered
since the creation of the world;) but now at the end of the ages hath he once
appeared for the destruction of sin by the sacrifice of himself.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>27	</b></font>And as it is appointed to men once to
die, and after this the judgment;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>28	</b></font>So Christ, having been once offered,
that he might take away the sins of many, will appear the second time without
sin unto salvation, to those who wait for him.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">CHAPTER 10</font><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font>For the law, having the shadow of good
things to come, not the very living image of things, can never by the sacrifices
which are offered continually every year, sanctify those who come;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font>Would they not have otherwise ceased
to be offered? because the worshippers, once cleansed, would have no more
conscience of sins<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font>But in these there is a remembrance of
sins every year;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font>For it is impossible that the blood of
bulls and goats should take away sins.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font>Therefore when coming into the world,
he saith, &#8220;Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou
prepared for me;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font>Burnt-offerings and <i>sacrifices
</i>for sin thou hast not approved;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font>Then said I, Lo, I am coming (in the
volume of the book it is written of me) that I may do, O God, thy
will.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font>After having said above,
&#8220;Sacrifice and offering, burnt-offering and <i>sacrifices </i>for sin thou
wouldest not, nor hast thou approved,&#8221; which are offered according to the
law;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font>Then he said, &#8220;Lo, I am coming
that I may do, O God, thy will,&#8221; &#8212;he takes away the first, that he
may establish the second;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font>By which will we are sanctified
through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once <i>made.</i><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font>And every priest stands, indeed,
daily to minister and to offer often the same sacrifices which can never take
away sins;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font>But he, having offered one sacrifice
for sins, sits down perpetually at the right hand of God,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font>Henceforth waiting until his enemies
be made his footstool:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font>For by one offering he hath
consecrated for ever those who are sanctified.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>15.	</b></font>Now the Holy Spirit also bears
witness to us; for after having previously said,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font>&#8220;This is the covenant which I
will make with them after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws in
their hearts, and in their minds will I write them,&#8221; [he adds,]<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font>&#8220;And their sins and their
iniquities will I remember no more.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>18	</b></font>Now, where there is remission of
these, there is no more offering for sin.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>19	</b></font>Having then, brethren, confidence to
enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>20	</b></font>By a new and living way which he hath
consecrated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>21	</b></font>And having a great priest over the
house of God,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>22	</b></font>Let us draw near with a sincere
heart, in a full assurance of faith, sprinkled in our hearts from an evil
conscience, and washed in our body with pure water;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>23	</b></font>Let us hold the confession of our
hope with out wavering, for faithful is he who has promised;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>24	</b></font>And let us consider one another for
the purpose of emulation in love and in good works;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>25	</b></font>Nor let us neglect the assembling of
ourselves together, as the custom with some is; but let us exhort <i>one
</i>another, and so much the more as ye see the day approaching.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>26	</b></font>For to those who willingly sin, after
having received the knowledge of the truth, there is no more left a sacrifice
for sins,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>27	</b></font>But a dreadful expectation of
judgment, and a fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>28	</b></font>He who cast aside the law of Moses
died without mercy under two or three witnesses: of how much heavier
punishment,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>29	</b></font>Think ye, shall he be deemed worthy,
who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and counted unholy the blood of the
testament by which he has been sanctified, and has treated scornfully the Spirit
of grace?<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>30	</b></font>For we know who says, &#8220;Mine is
vengeance, I will repay,&#8221; saith the Lord; and again, &#8220;The Lord will
judge his people.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>31	</b></font>It is a dreadful thing to fall into
the hands of the living God.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>32	</b></font>But remember the former days, in
which, after being illuminated, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;
partly when ye were exposed to public shame by reproaches and
distresses,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>33	</b></font>And partly when ye became the
companions of those who were thus treated:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>34	</b></font>For ye sympathized with me in my
bonds, and took the plunder of your goods with joy, knowing that ye have a
better and an enduring substance in heaven.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>35	</b></font>Cast not then away your confidence
which has a great recompense of reward.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>36	</b></font>Ye have truly need of patience, so
that having done the will of God, ye may obtain the promise:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>37	</b></font>For it will yet be a little while,
when he who is coming will come, and will not delay.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>38	</b></font>But the just, by faith shall he live;
and if he draws back, my soul shall have no delight in him.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>39	</b></font>But we are not of those who draw back
to perdition, but of those who believe to the salvation of the soul.<br></div>
<div><font size="5" color="Green">CHAPTER 11</font><br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>1	</b></font>Now faith is the substance of things
hoped for, the demonstration of things not seen:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>2	</b></font>For by it the elders obtained a
testimony.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>3	</b></font>By faith we understand that the worlds
were set in order by the Word of God, so that of things not visible they became
visible.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>4	</b></font>By faith Abel offered to God a more
excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained a testimony that he was
righteous, God bearing a testimony to his gifts; and by it, he being dead, yet
speaketh.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font>By faith Enoch was translated, so as
not to see death; nor was he found, because God had translated him; for before
his translation he had received a testimony that he pleased God.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font>But without faith it is impossible to
please him; for he who comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is the
rewarder of those who seek him.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font>By faith Noah, having been warned by
God of things which did not as yet appear, being moved with fear, prepared an
ark for the preservation of his house; by which he condemned the world, and
became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font>By faith Abraham, when he was called,
obeyed, so that he went out into the place which he was to receive for an
inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font>By faith he sojourned in the promised
land, as though it was a foreign country, dwelling in tents together with Isaac
and Jacob, co-heirs to the same promise;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font>For he expected a city having
foundations, whose master-builder and maker is God.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font>By faith also Sarah herself received
power to conceive seed; and beyond the time of age she brought forth, because
she counted him faithful who had promised.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>12	</b></font>Therefore there have been begotten
even of one, and him indeed dead, <i>those </i>in multitude as the stars of
heaven, and as the numberless sand which is on the sea-shore.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>13	</b></font>All these died in faith, not having
received the promises, but having afar off seen, and believed, and embraced
them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
earth:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>14	</b></font>Verily they who say such things shew
that they seek a country.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>15	</b></font>And if indeed they had remembered
that from which they had come out, they had time to return:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>16	</b></font>But they now desire a better, even
that which is heavenly: hence God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he
has prepared for them a city.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>17	</b></font>By faith Abraham offered up Isaac,
when he was tried; and he offered up the only-begotten after having received the
promises,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>18	</b></font>Respecting whom it had been said,
&#8220;In Isaac shall thy seed be called;&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>19	</b></font>Accounting that God was able to raise
him even from the dead; whence also he received him in a type.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>20	</b></font>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
concerning things to come. By faith Jacob, when dying,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>21	</b></font>Blessed both the sons of Joseph, and
worshipped on the head of his couch.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>22	</b></font>By faith Joseph, when dying, made
mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave an order respecting
his bones.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>23	</b></font>By faith Moses, when born, was hid
three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and
feared not the decree of the king.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>24	</b></font>By faith Moses, when grown up,
refused to be called the son of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter,<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>25	</b></font>Choosing rather to suffer evils with
the people of God than to have the temporary pleasures of sin;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>26	</b></font>Esteeming the reproach of Christ
greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked on the recompense of
reward.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>27	</b></font>By faith he left Egypt, having not
feared the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is
invisible.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>28	</b></font>By faith he appointed the passover,
and the sprinkling of blood, that he who destroyed the first-born should not
touch them.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>29	</b></font>By faith they passed through the Red
Sea as through a dry land; which when the Egyptians attempted, they were
drowned.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>30	</b></font>By faith the walls of Jericho fell,
having been surrounded seven days.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>31	</b></font>By faith Rahab the harlot perished
not with the unbelieving, after having received the explorers in
peace.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>32	</b></font>And what more shall I say? for the
time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak, of Samson and Jephthae; of
David, and of Samuel, and the Prophets;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>33	</b></font>Who by faith subdued kingdoms,

against sin.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>5	</b></font>And ye have forgotten the exhortation
which speaks to you as to children, &#8220;My son, despise not the chastening of
the Lord, nor be faint when thou art reproved by him:<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>6	</b></font>For whom the Lord loveth he
chasteneth; and he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.&#8221;<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>7	</b></font>If ye endure chastening, God dealeth
with you as with sons: for what son is he whom the father chasteneth
not?<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>8	</b></font>But if ye be without chastisement, of
which all [sons] are partakers, then ye are bastards, and not sons.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>9	</b></font>Since we had the fathers of our flesh
as our chastisers, and we reverenced them, shall we not much more be subject to
the Father of spirits, and live?<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>10	</b></font>For they indeed for a few days
chastised us according to their own will: but he for our benefit, that he may
impart to us his holiness.<br></div>
<div><font color="Maroon"><b>11	</b></font>But no chastening seems indeed for
the present to be joyful, but grievous; yet afterwards it renders the peaceful
fruit of righteousness to those who are by it exercised.<br></div>

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">FT1</font></sup> To say that it has not the
unusual introductory form of an Epistle, is no valid objection; for we find the
case to be the same with regard to the First Epistle of John. It begins in a way
very similar to this, while in the two following the usual mode is
adopted.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT2</font></sup>  The following account
seems sufficiently satisfactory on this point: &#8212; &#8220;Clement of
Alexandria, Jerome, Euthalius [Epiphanius?], Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact
and others, were of opinion that the Epistle to the Hebrews was sent to the Jews
living in Judea, who in the Apostle&#8217;s time were called <i>Hebrews</i> to
distinguish them from the jews in the Gentile countries, who were called
<i>Hellenists </i>or Grecians,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440601&gt;</font></sup>Acts 6:1; 9:29; 11:20. In
that opinion these ancient authors were well founded, because as Lardner
observes, this letter appears to have been written to persons dwelling in one
place, <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581319&gt;</font></sup>Hebrews 13:19, 23,
24, namely, to the inhabitants of Judea, and to those of them especially who
lived in Jerusalem.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Macknight</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT3</font></sup>  It is indeed
thought, as stated by <i>Horne </i>in his Introduction, that the <i>Syriac</i>
version was made at the end of the <i>first</i>, or at the beginning of the
<i>second</i> century. In that case, it was made less than 40 years after the
Epistle was written.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT4</font></sup>  The
arguments in favor of Paul being the author of this Epistle are briefly found in
Horne&#8217;s Introduction to the Critical Study of the Scriptures; but those
who wish to see the subject fully handled, and that with great discrimination
and judgment, must read Stuart&#8217;s Introduction to his Commentary on this
epistle. Dr. Bloomfield uses no exaggerated language when he says, that is
&#8220;very elaborate and
invaluable.&#8221;<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT5</font></sup>  There is an
elaborate analysis of the subject from chapter 4:14, to chapter 10:19, by Stuart
at the commencement of his notes on Chapter 5; but it is not satisfactory. He
seems to have overlooked that there are two sections to this part, the one
referring mainly to the appointment of Christ as a priest, which stands
connected with this sufferings, and His capability of sympathy, chapter 4:14 to
7:25; and the other referring to the expiation he made as Mediator of the new
covenant, chapter 7:26 to chapter 10:9. The text which is the ground of the
first section is <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B004&gt;</font></sup>Psalm
110:4; the passage on which the second section is built is
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243131&gt;</font></sup>Jeremiah 31:31-34, in
connection with <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;194006&gt;</font></sup>Psalm
40:6.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT6</font></sup>  <i>Novatus</i> was a priest
in Carthage about the middle of the third century, and came to Rome as an
advocate on <i>Novation</i>, who was the leader in this opinion. What gave the
first occasion to this sentiment was the case of some who fell away from the
faith during the Decian persecution. <i>Novatian </i>resisted their restoration,
and afterwards extended the same denied repentance to all such, and regarded
them as forever unfit to be received into the Church. He opposed the election of
<i>Cornelius </i>to the see of Rome, who differed from his jurisdiction, and
formed a sect of his own. He was consequently excommunicated, together with his
party, (of which Novatus seems to have been one,) by a council assembled by
Cornelius in the year 251. He was then made a bishop by his own party, and was
followed by many; and his sect continued to flourish till the fifth century. But
Novation, a Roman priest, rather than Novatus, a priest from Carthage, was its
founder. &#8212; See Mosheim&#8217;s Eccl. Hist., volume. 1 page 249. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT7</font></sup>  The absence of the
definite article before <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJiw~|</font> is
not unusual in the New Testament, it being often omitted before all sorts of
nouns. In many instances it is Hebrewism, and so here; for Chrysostom in his
comment supplies it, and mentions that
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn</font> here is
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dia&lt;</font>, which is another
Hebrewism. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT8</font></sup> 
Some of the fathers, such as Chrysostom, regarded the two words as meaning the
same thing; but there is no reason for this. On the contrary, each word has a
distinct meaning; one expresses a variety as to parts or portions, and the other
variety as to the mode or manner. The &#8220;parts&#8221; clearly refer to the
different portions of revelation communicated to &#8220;holy men&#8221; in
different ages of the world. Hence the meaning, though not the literal
rendering, is given in our version, &#8220;at sundry time;&#8221; or
&#8220;often&#8221;, as by Stuart; or &#8220;at many times&#8221;, as by
Doddridge. A more literal version is given by Macknight, &#8220;in sundry
parts&#8221;.	<br>Most agree as to the second word, that it designates the
various modes of communication, &#8212; by visions, dreams, interposition of
angels, and speaking face to face, as the case was with Moses; see
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;041206&gt;</font></sup>Numbers 12:6-8. And there
was another variety in the manner, sometimes in plain language, and at another
time in similitudes and parables. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT9</font></sup>  It is said that the
MSS, are in favor of <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejsca&gt;tou</font>
&#8220;in the last of these days.&#8221; Were it not for &#8220;these&#8221;,
this might be allowed, as the literal rendering of these Hebrew words often
used, <font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;ymh tyrjab</font>, &#8220;at
the extremity of the days&#8221;, (see
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230202&gt;</font></sup>Isaiah 2:2;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;280305&gt;</font></sup>Hosea 3:5, etc.) but the
sentence, as changed by Griesbach and others, makes no sense, and is
inconsistent with the words as elsewhere used by Paul; see
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550301&gt;</font></sup>2 Timothy 3:1. A mere
majority of MSS, is no sufficient authority for a reading. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT10</font></sup>  That is, heirship and
creation.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT11</font></sup>  The fathers and some
modern divines have held that these words express the eternal relation between
the Father and the Son. But Calvin, with others, such as Beza, Dr. Owen, Scott
and Stuart, have regarded the words as referring to Christ as the Messiah, as
the Son of God in human nature, or as Mediator, consistently with such passages
as these, &#8212; &#8220;He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431409&gt;</font></sup>John 14:9; &#8220;He that
hath seen me hath seen him that sent me.&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431245&gt;</font></sup>John 12:45). By this view
we avoid altogether the difficulty that arises from the expressions, &#8220;the
impress of his substance,&#8221; or essence, he being so, not as to his eternal
divinity, but as a Mediator. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT12</font></sup>  The remarkable wisdom
of the preceding remarks must be approved by every enlightened Christian. There
is an &#8220;Excursus&#8221; in Professor Stuart&#8217;s Commentary on this
Epistle, on the same subject, which is very valuable, distinguished for caution,
acuteness, and sound judgment. Well would it be were all divines to show the
same humility on a subject so remote from human comprehension. The bold and
unhallowed speculations of some of the fathers, and of the schoolmen, and
divines after them, have produced infinite mischief, having occasioned
hindrances to the reception of the truth respecting our Savior&#8217;s divinity,
which would have otherwise never existed. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT13</font></sup>  See Appendix
A<font face="Palatino">.</font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT14</font></sup> 
Stuart following Chrysostom, renders the words
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">fe&gt;ran</font>,
&#8220;controlling&#8221; or governing, and so does Schleusner; but the sense of
&#8220;upholding&#8221; or sustaining, or supporting, is more suitable to the
words which follow &#8212; &#8220;by the word of his power,&#8221; or by his
powerful word. Had it been &#8220;by the word of his wisdom,&#8221; then
controlling or governing would be compatible; but as it is &#8220;power&#8221;,
doubtless sustension or preservation is the most congruous idea. Besides, this
is the most obvious and common meaning of the word, and so rendered by most
expositors; among others by Beza, Doddridge, Macknight and
Bloomfield.<br>Doddridge gives this paraphrase, &#8212; &#8220;Upholding the
universe which he hath made by the efficacious word of his Father&#8217;s power,
which is ever resident in him as his own, by virtue of that intimate but
incomparable union which renders them one.&#8221; This view is consistent with
the whole passage: &#8220;his substance&#8221; and &#8220;his power&#8221;
corresponds; and it is said, &#8220;by whom he made the world,&#8221; so it is
suitable to say that he sustains the world by the Father&#8217;s power. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT15</font></sup>  The word here used
means properly &#8220;purification,&#8221; but is used for expiation by the
Sept.; see <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;023010&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 30:10.
The same truth is meant as when in chapter 10:12, that Christ, &#8220;after he
had offered on sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right hand of
God.&#8221; The reference here cannot be to the actual purification of his
people; for what was done by Christ when he died is what is spoken of, even when
he &#8220;put away sin&#8221; as it is said in chapter 9:26, &#8220;by the
sacrifice for himself.&#8221; The word then, may be forgiveness proceeds from
the atonement: see <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620109&gt;</font></sup>1 John
1:9.<br>Dr. Owen gives three reasons for considering the word in the sense of
expiation or atonement, &#8212; It is so rendered in some instances by the
Septuagint; the act spoken is past, while cleansing or purification is what is
effected now; and &#8220;himself&#8221; shows that it is not properly
sanctification as that is effected by means of the word,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490526&gt;</font></sup>Ephesians 5:26,) and by
the regenerating Spirit.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;560305&gt;</font></sup>Titus 3:5)<br>The version
of Stuart is, &#8220;made expiation for our sins,&#8221; which is no doubt the
meaning. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT16</font></sup>  It
has been observed by some that in these verses the three offices of Christ are
to be found: the Father spoke by him as a prophet; he made expiation for our
sins as a priest; and he sits at God&#8217;s right hand as a king. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT17</font></sup>  Some by
&#8220;name&#8221; understand dignity, but not correctly, as it appears from
what follows; for the name, by which he is proved here to be superior to angels,
was that of a Son, as Calvin here states. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT18</font></sup>  &#8220;If it be
objected,&#8221; says Stuart, &#8220;that angels are also called sons, and men
too, the answered is easy: No one individual, except Jesus, is ever called by
way of eminence, the Son of God, i.e., the Messiah or the King of Israel,&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430149&gt;</font></sup>John 1:49. By &#8220;The
Son of God&#8221; is to be understood here His kingly office: He was a Son as
one endowed with superior power and authority; and angels are not sons in this
respect. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT19</font></sup>  The
foregoing is a sufficient answer to Doddridge, Stuart, and others, who hold that
the texts quoted must refer exclusively to Christ, else the argument of the
Apostle would be inconclusive. David is no doubt called a son in the
2<sup>nd</sup> Psalm, but as a king, and in that capacity as a type of Christ;
and what is said of him as a king, and what is promised to him, partly refers to
himself and to his successors, and partly to Christ whom he represented. How to
distinguish these things is now easy, as the character of Christ is fully
developed in the New Testament. We now see the reason why David was called a
son, and why Solomon, as in the next quotation, was called a son; they as kings
of Israel, that is, of God&#8217;s people, were representatives of him who is
alone really or in a peculiar sense the Son of God, the true king of Israel, an
honor never allotted to angels.(See Appendix B) &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT20</font></sup>  Many have interpreted
to-day as meaning eternity; but there is nothing to countenance such a view. As
to the type, David, his &#8220;to-day&#8221; was his exaltation to the throne;
the &#8220;to-day&#8221; of Christ, the antitype, is something of a
corresponding character; it was his resurrection and exaltation to God&#8217;s
right hand, where he sits, as it were, on the throne of David. See Acts 2:30;
5:30, 31; 13:33. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT21</font></sup>  See Appendix
C.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT22</font></sup>  Many have been the
explanations of this sentence; but this is the most suitable to the passage as
it occurs in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A404&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 104:4,
and to the design of the Apostle; it is the one adopted by Doddridge, Stuart,
and Bloomfield.<br>The meaning would be thus more apparent, &#8212; &#8220;Who
maketh like his angels the winds, and like his ministers the flaming
fire,&#8221; that is, the winds are subject to him as the angels are, and also
the flaming fire as his ministers or attendants. The particle
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font> is sometimes omitted in Hebrew.
&#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT23</font></sup>  It is
generally admitted to be a kind of epithalamium, but not on the occasion here
specified, as there was nothing in that marriage that in any degree correspond
with the contents of the Psalm. Such was the opinion of Beza, Dr. Owen, Scott,
and Horsley. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT24</font></sup> 
The Hebrew will admit of no other construction than that given in our version
and by Calvin. The Greek version, the Sept., which the Apostle adopts, seems at
first view to be different, as &#8220;God&#8221; is in the nominative case,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oJ Qeo&lt;v</font>; but the Sept. used in
commonly instead of the vocative case. We meet with two instances in the seventh
Psalm, verses 1 and 3, and in connection with &#8220;Lord,&#8221;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ku&gt;rie</font> in the vocative case.
See also Psalm 10:12; 41:1, etc.<br>The Vulgate, following literally the Sept.,
without regarding the preceding peculiarity, has rendered &#8220;God&#8221; in
the nominative, &#8220;Deus,&#8221; and not &#8220;O Deus.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT25</font></sup>  He is evidently
throughout spoken of in his mediatorial character. To keep this in view will
enable us more fully to understand the chapter. It is more agreeable to this
passage, to regard &#8220;the anointing,&#8221; not that of consecration, but
that of refreshment to guests according to a prevailing custom, see
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420746&gt;</font></sup>Luke 7:46. The word
&#8220;gladness&#8221; favors this, and also the previous words of the passage;
Christ is addressed as already on his throne, and his administration is referred
to; and it is on account of his just administration, that he is said to have
been anointed with the perfuming oil of gladness, see
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441038&gt;</font></sup>Acts 10:38.<br>The words,
&#8220;above thy fellows,&#8221; are rendered by Calvin, &#8220;above thy
partners,&#8221; and by Doddridge and Macknight, &#8220;above thine
associates.&#8221; Christ is spoken of as king, and his associates are those in
the same office; but he is so much above them that he is the &#8220;king of
kings;&#8221; and yet his superior excellencies are here represented as
entitling him to higher honors. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT26</font></sup>  See Appendix
D.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT27</font></sup>  There is no doubt a
distinction between the two words here used, but not exactly that which is
intimated; the first,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">leitourgika&lt;</font> refers to an
official appointment; and the other,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diakoni&gt;an</font>, to the work which
was to be done. Angels are said to be officially appointed, and they are thus
appointed for the purpose of doing service to the heirs of salvation; &#8220;Are
they not all ministrant (or ministerial) spirits, sent forth for service, on
account <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dia&lt;</font> of those who are
to inherit salvation?&#8221; Then they are spirits, having a special office
allotted them, being sent forth to do service in behalf of those who are heirs
of salvation. It hence appears that they have a special appointment for this
purpose See Acts 5:19, and 12:7. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT28</font></sup>  See Appendix
E.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT28a</font></sup>  See Appendix
F.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT29</font></sup>  To &#8220;neglect,&#8221; is
literally, not to care for; not to care for our salvation is to neglect it. It
is rendered, to &#8220;make light of,&#8221; in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402205&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 22:5; and
&#8220;not to regard,&#8221; in chapter 8:9. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT30</font></sup>  So great, observes
Dr. Owen is this salvation, that is a deliverance from Satan, from sin, and from
eternal sin, and from eternal death. The means also by which it has been
procured, and is now effected, and its endless results, prove in a wonderful
manner its greatness. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT31</font></sup>  The same objection
has been advanced by Grotius and others, but it has no weight in it; for the
Apostle here distinctly refers to the facts in connection with the twelve
Apostles, as this alone was necessary for his purpose here; and the same reason
for concealing his name accounts for no reference being made here to his own
ministry. And &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; as employed by the Apostle,
often refer to things which belong to all in common as Christians. See chapter
4:1, 11; 11:40, etc. And he uses them sometimes when he himself personally is
not included. See <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461551&gt;</font></sup>1
Corinthians 15:51. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT32</font></sup>  These three words
occur twice together in other places,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440222&gt;</font></sup>Acts 2:22, and
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;530209&gt;</font></sup>2 Thessalonians 2:9; only
they are found in Acts in a different order &#8212; miracles wonders and signs.
Signs and wonders are often found together both in the Old Testament, and in
this order except in three places, Acts 2:19, 43; and 7:36. The same things, as
Calvin says, are no doubt meant by three words under different views. They are
called &#8220;signs&#8221; or as tokens as evidence of a divine interposition;
&#8220;wonders&#8221; or prodigies, as being not natural, but supernatural, and
as having the effect of filling men with terror,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440243&gt;</font></sup>Acts 2:43; and
&#8220;miracles&#8221; or powers, as being the effects of a divine power. So
that &#8220;signs&#8221; betoken their intention; &#8220;wonders&#8221; their
characters; and &#8220;miracles&#8221; their origin, or the power which produces
them. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT33</font></sup>  By
referring to <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461204&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians
12:4-11, we shall be able to see the meaning of &#8220;distributions of the
Spirit,&#8221; which seems to have been different from signs and wonders, for in
that passage there are several gifts mentioned distinct from signs and wonders,
such as the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, the gift of prophecy, and the
discerning of spirits. These were the distributions, or the portions, which the
Spirit divined to every one &#8220;according to his will;&#8221; for the
&#8220;will&#8221; here, as in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461211&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 12:11, is the
will of the Spirit. The most suitable rendering of the last clause would be
&#8220;and by the gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his
will.&#8221; There is an evident metonymy in the word
&#8220;distributions;&#8221; it is used abstractly for things distributed or
divided. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT34</font></sup>  See
Appendix G.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT35</font></sup>  There is no doubt
but that the expression is capable of being understood as &#8220;little&#8221;
in degree, or as &#8220;little&#8221; in time; but in the Psalm the former is
evidently the meaning, and there is no reason for a different meaning here:
Christ, in becoming man, assumed a nature inferior to that of angels. Many of
the fathers, indeed, and some moderns, have thought that time is what is
intended &#8220;for a little while;&#8221; but this is not true, for Christ
continues in the nature which has assumed, though it be now refined and
perfected. The inferiority of nature is admitted, but that inferiority is as it
were compensated by a superiority of honor and glory. Our version is the
Vulgate, which Doddridge has also adopted, and also Stuart and Bloomfield.
&#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT36</font></sup>  See Appendix
H.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT37</font></sup>  There is no doubt but that is
a fanciful refinement. To taste food, according to the language of Scripture, is
to eat it. See <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441011&gt;</font></sup>Acts 10:11;
20:11; 23:14. To taste death is to die, to undergo death, and nothing else. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401628&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 16:28;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420927&gt;</font></sup>Luke 9:27. Stuart observes
that the word for taste in Hebrew is taken in the same sense, and also in
classic Greek authors. &#8220;For every man,&#8221;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpe&lt;r pa&gt;ntov</font>, that is
&#8220;man,&#8221; mentioned in verse 6; and the &#8220;man&#8221; there means
all the faithful, to whom God in Noah restored the dominion lost in Adam; but
this dominion was not renewed to man as a fallen being, but as made righteous by
faith. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT38</font></sup>  Having
vindicated Christ&#8217;s superiority over angels, he being &#8220;crowned with
glory and honor,&#8221; notwithstanding his assumption of human nature, and for
his sufferings, the Apostle now, as it were, goes back, and proves the necessity
of what has been done; showing how needful it was for him to become man, and to
suffer as he did; and we find he states two especial reasons &#8212; that he
might reconcile us to God and be able to sympathize with his people. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT39</font></sup>  Our version seems
more intelligible &#8212; &#8220;to make perfect.&#8221; As it appears
afterwards his perfection consisted in his having made an atonement for sin, and
in being capable of sympathy with his people. God made him perfectly qualified
to be the Captain or leader in our salvation, that is, in the work of saving us,
even through sufferings, as thereby he procured our salvation and became
experimentally acquainted with the temptations and trials of humanity.<br>The
sense given by Stuart and some others, borrowed from the use of the word in the
classics, which is that of crowning or rewarding the victor at the games is not
suitable here; for what follows clearly shows that its meaning is what has been
stated.<br>Both Scott and Stuart connect &#8220;the bringing many sons unto
glory&#8221; with &#8220;the captain of their salvation.&#8221; One thing is
indeed thus gained, the cases seem to suit better; but then the sense is
violated. When the sentence is thus rendered, there is no antecedent to
&#8220;their&#8221; connected with &#8220;salvation;&#8221; and the faithful are
not called the &#8220;sons&#8221; of Christ, but his brethren. As to the case of
the participle for &#8220;bringing,&#8221; an accusative for a dative, it is an
anomaly, says Bloomfield, that sometimes occurs in Paul&#8217;s writings and
also in the classics. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT40</font></sup>  Though many, ancient
and modern, such as Chrysostom, Beza, Grotius and Bloomfield, regard
&#8220;God&#8221; as meant here by &#8220;one&#8221;, yet the context is in
favor of the view taken by Calvin, which is also adopted by Dr. Owen and Stuart.
The 14<sup>th</sup> verse seems to decide the question.<br>The word to sanctify
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aJgia&gt;zw</font>, means &#8212; 1. To
consecrate, to set apart to a holy use or to an office,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402319&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 23:19; John 17:19;
&#8212; 2. To purify from pollution, either ceremonially, Hebrew 9:13, or
morally and spiritually, <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520523&gt;</font></sup>1
Thessalonians 5:23; &#8212; 3. To purify from the guilt of sin by a free
remission, <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581010&gt;</font></sup>Hebrews 10:10,
compared with verses 14 and 18. Now, which of these meanings are we to take
here? Calvin takes the second, that is to purify from pollution, or to make
spiritually holy; others, such as Stuart and Bloomfield, take the last meaning,
and the latter gives the rendering, &#8220;the expiator and the expiated,&#8221;
This is more consistent with the general tenor of the passage. The subject is
not sanctification properly so called, but expiation or atonement. See verses 9
and 17. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT41</font></sup> 
&#8220;If Christ was merely a man and nothing more, where (we may ask with
Abresch) would be either the great condescension, or particular kindness
manifested in calling men his brethren? If however, he possessed a higher
nature, if <font face="Koine" color="Blue">eJauto&lt;n ejke&gt;nwsen morfh&lt;n
dou&gt;lou labw&gt;n</font>,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 2:7, if
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejke&gt;nwse eJauto&lt;n morfh&lt;n
dou&gt;lou labw&lt;n</font>,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502308&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 2:8; then was
it an act of particular kindness and condescension in him to call men his
brethren?&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Stuart</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT42</font></sup>  This quotation is
made from <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;192222&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 22:22, and
from the Sept., except that the Apostle changes
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dihgh&gt;somai</font> into
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpaggelw~</font>. The words are often
used synonymously , only the latter includes the idea of a message, as it
literally means to declare something from another. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT43</font></sup>  The words are found
literally, according to the Sept., in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;102203&gt;</font></sup>2 Samuel 22:3; which
chapter is materially the same with Psalm 18, and also in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230817&gt;</font></sup>Isaiah 8:17. The words are
somewhat different in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191802&gt;</font></sup>Psalm
18:2, though the Hebrew is the same as in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;102203&gt;</font></sup>2 Samuel 22:3,
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">wb hsja</font>, &#8220;I will trust in
him.&#8221; The words in Hebrew are wholly different in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230817&gt;</font></sup>Isaiah 8:17, rendered
literally, from Isaiah, because they see nothing in the 18<sup>th</sup> Psalm
respecting the Messiah; but the whole Psalm is respecting him who was eminently
a type of the Messiah; and in that sense no doubt the Messiah is found there. As
God was to David his trust in all trials, so he was to the Son of David. See
chapter 5:7. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT44</font></sup> 
Stuart suggests that these texts are applicable to Christ as the antitype of
those to whom they most immediately refer. &#8220;As the type,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;put his confidence in God, so did the antitype: as the type had children
who were pledges for the deliverance of Judah, so has the antitype &#8216;many
sons and daughters,&#8217; the pledges of his powerful grace, and sureties that
his promises in regard to future blessings will be
accomplished.&#8221;<br>Christ was promised as the Son of David in his office as
king: he was therefore to be like David: and the trials and support of David as
a king were typical of his trials and support. Hence the Apostle applies to him
the language of David. Christ was also promised as a Prophet; and is applied to
the antitype. This must have been admitted as a valid reasoning by the Jews who
regarded the Messiah both as king and as a prophet. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT45</font></sup>  Be it observed that
throughout the whole of this passage, from 5 to 14 inclusive, the representation
is, that God had a people prior to the coming of Christ, first called
&#8220;man,&#8221; afterwards &#8220;sons&#8221; and &#8220;children,&#8221; and
Christ&#8217;s &#8220;brethren,&#8221; &#8212; that those were promised
&#8220;dominion,&#8221; glory and honor,&#8221; &#8212; and that the Son of God
assumed their nature became lower than the angels, in order to obtain for them
this dominion, glory and honor.<br>This statement bears a similarity to what the
Apostle says in the 4<sup>th</sup> chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, and in
the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> to the Galatians: only he seems to go back
here to Noah, to whom was restored the dominion and the glory lost in Adam,
while in the chapters referred to, he begins with Abraham: and there seems to
have been a reason for this; for the posterity of Noah soon departed from the
faith; and Abraham became alone the father of the faithful, and through faith
&#8220;the heir of the world,&#8221; and had the land of Canaan as a special
pledge of a &#8220;better country.&#8221; And the Apostle here also comes to
Abraham, verse 16. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT46</font></sup>  See Appendix
I<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT47</font></sup>  The same seem to be meant here
as before, &#8212; &#8220;the sons, the children.&#8221; Before Christ came,
though heirs, yet they were in a state of bondage; so the Apostle represents
them in Galatians 4:1-3. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450815&gt;</font></sup>Romans 8:15. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT48</font></sup>  See Appendix
K<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT49</font></sup>  Here is, as I conceive, an
instance of an arrangement similar to what is often found in the prophets, and
to what occurs in verse 9; this would be seen were a part of this verse and the
following verse put in lines, &#8212;<br>That compassionate he might be<br>And a
faithful high priest in the things of God<br>To make an atonement for the sins
of the people;<br>For as he suffered, being himself tempted, he can help the
tempted.<br>The first and last line correspond, and the second and the third. He
is compassionate, because he can sympathize with the tempted, having been
himself tempted; and he is a true and faithful high priest, because he really
expiated the sins of the people: and that he might be all this, he became like
his brethren that is, by taking their nature. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT50 </font></sup>Non ignara mali,
miseris succurrere disco.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT51 </font></sup>This
paragraph, which begins at verse 5, commences with what belongs to the kingly
office &#8212; dominion, and what accompanies it, glory and honor; but it ends
with the priestly office; and it is shown that it was necessary for the Savior
to be a priest in order that he might be a king, and might make his people kings
as well as priests to God. The dominion and glory promised to the faithful from
the beginning intimated even in the first promise made to fallen man, and more
fully developed afterwards, was what they had no power to attain of themselves:
Hence it became necessary for the Son of God to become the son of man, that he
might obtain for his people the dominion and glory. This seems to be the view
presented to us in this passage. The children of God, before Christ came into
the world, were like heirs under age, though lords of all. He came, took their
flesh and effected whatever was necessary to put them in full possession of the
privileges promised them. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480401&gt;</font></sup>Galatians 4:1-6. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT52</font></sup>  He calls them
&#8220;holy brethren.&#8221; Stuart takes holy as meaning &#8220;consecrated,
devoted, i.e. to Christ, set apart as Christians.&#8221; The people of Israel
were called holy in the same sense, not because they were spiritually holy, but
because they were set apart and adopted as God&#8217;s people. The word saints,
at the commencement of Paul&#8217;s Epistles, means the same thing. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT53</font></sup>  The word heavenly,
may also mean a call from heaven. See chapter 12:25. It is no doubt both, it is
a call to the enjoyment of heavenly things, as well as a call that comes from
heaven. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT54</font></sup>  This
is the only place in which Christ is called an Apostle, the design no doubt was
to institute a comparison between him and Moses, who is often said to have been
sent by God, as Christ is said to have been sent by the Father: they might both
therefore be rightly called Apostles, i.e., messengers sent by God. And then he
adds, high priest, that he might afterwards make a comparison between him and
Aaron.<br>He had before exalted Christ as a teacher above all the prophets,
including no doubt Moses among the rest; but here refers to Moses as the leader
of the people, as one sent especially by God to conduct them from Egypt through
the wilderness to the land of Canaan. But as our call is from heaven and to
heaven, Christ is sent as a messenger to lead us to the heavenly country. We
hence see that in this connection the &#8220;heavenly calling&#8221; is to be
taken most suitably as a call to heaven. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT55</font></sup>  The simpler meaning
of this phrase is to view it as sort of Hebraism, when a noun is put for an
adjective or a participle; and it is so rendered by Schleusner and Stuart,
&#8220;professed by us,&#8221; or, &#8220;whom we profess.&#8221; See similar
instances in chapter 10:23, and in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470913&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 9:13. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT56</font></sup>  This testimony as to
Moses is found in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;041207&gt;</font></sup>Numbers
12:7. God says there &#8220;in all mine house;&#8221; we ought therefore to
consider &#8220;his&#8221; here as referring to God or to Christ, and not to
Moses.<br>&#8220;For this man,&#8221;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ou+tov</font>; it is better to render it
here he, as it is sometimes rendered, and is so rendered in this place by
Doddridge, Macknight and Stuart. The connection is with &#8220;consider,&#8221;
in the first verse; &#8220;for,&#8221; a reason is given for the exhortation;
&#8220;for he,&#8221; i.e., the apostle and high priest before mentioned, etc.
&#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT57</font></sup>  See Appendix
L<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT58</font></sup>  It is better for
&#8220;hope&#8221; here to be retained in its proper meaning; for in verse 12
the defect of it is traced to unbelief. Were the words &#8220;confidence&#8221;
and &#8220;rejoicing&#8221; rendered adjectivally, the meaning would be more
evident, &#8212; &#8220;If we hold firm our confident and joyful hope to the
end.&#8221; So we may render a similar form of expression in verse 13,
&#8220;through deceitful sin,&#8221; as &#8220;newness of life&#8221; in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450604&gt;</font></sup>Romans 6:4, means
&#8220;new life.&#8221; The most common practice is to render the genitive in
such instances as an adjective, but this is not always the case.<br>Hope is
&#8220;confident&#8221; or assured, while it rests on the word of God, and is
&#8220;joyful&#8221; while it anticipates the glory and happiness of the
heavenly kingdom.<br>But Beza and Doddridge take words apart, &#8220;freedom of
profession and boasting of hope,&#8221; or according to Beza, &#8220;the hope of
which we boast.&#8221; Macknight renders them &#8220;the boldness and the
glorifying of the hope.&#8221; The secondary meaning of the word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">parrhsi&gt;a</font> is confidence, and of
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kau&gt;chma</font>, joy or rejoicing, and
the most suitable here, as it comports better with holding fast, or firm.
&#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT59</font></sup>  There is the
same parenthesis in our version; but Beza, Doddridge, Macknight, and Stuart, do
not use it, but connect &#8220;therefore&#8221; or wherefore with &#8220;harden
not,&#8221; which seems more suitable. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT60</font></sup>  See Appendix
M.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT61</font></sup>  The word connected with
&#8220;heart&#8221; is <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn tw~</font>,
which properly means diseased and hence corrupted, depraved, wicked. Depraved or
wicked would perhaps be the best rendering of it here. &#8220;Unbelief&#8221; is
a genitive used for an adjective or a participle, &#8212; &#8220;a wicked
unbelieving heart.&#8221; It is unbelieving owing to its wickedness or
depravity. Grotius says, that there are two kinds of unbelief, &#8212; The first
the rejection of the truth when first offered, &#8212; and the second the
renouncing of it after having once professed it. The latter is the more heinous
sin.<br>&#8220;The departing,&#8221; etc.;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn tw~</font> is rendered
&#8220;by&#8221; by Macknight: it is considered by Grotius to be for
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv to&lt;</font>, which word makes the
meaning more evident, &#8220;so as to depart,&#8221; etc. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT62</font></sup>  &#8220;Deceitfulness
of sin&#8221; is rendered by Stuart &#8220;sinful delusion.&#8221; It ought
rather to be &#8220;deceitful (or seductive) sin&#8221; as &#8220;deceitfulness
of riches&#8221; in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401322&gt;</font></sup>Matthew
13:22, means &#8220;deceitful riches.&#8221; The &#8220;sin&#8221; was evidently
that of apostasy: and it was deceitful, because there was a present prospect of
relief from troubles and persecutions. The power of any sin to deceive and
seduce, consists in some present gratification or interest. See note on verse 6.
&#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT63</font></sup>  What is
implied here is that we may professedly be partakers of Christ: that is of his
blessings as a Savior, and yet be not really so: the proof of the reality is
perseverance. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT64</font></sup> 
Here is another instance of the genitive being the main subject, &#8220;the
beginning of our confidence,&#8221; i.e., our first confidence, which the
Apostle calls &#8220;first faith&#8221; in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540512&gt;</font></sup>1 Timothy 5:12. Macknight
renders it &#8220;the begun confidence.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT65</font></sup>  Most connect this
verse with the preceding, as in our version, and as Doddridge thus
&#8220;forasmuch as it is said;&#8221; and Macknight thus &#8220;as ye may know
by the saying.&#8221; So does Beza; and Calvin seems to do the same; but some
connect it with the 13<sup>th</sup> and others with the 14<sup>th</sup> verse.
Modern authors, such as Stuart and Blooomfield, regard it as the commencement of
a paragraph, and connect it with what follows. Stuart&#8217;s version is &#8212;
<br>15. With regard to the saying, &#8220;today while ye hear his voice,
harden<br>16. Not your hearts as in the provocation;&#8221; who now were they
that when they heard did provoke? Nay, did not all who came out of Egypt under
Moses? Etc.<br>Bloomfield approves of this version, only he considers the
quotation is confined to the words, &#8220;Today, while ye hear his
voice,&#8221; and regards what follows, &#8220;harden not,&#8221; etc., as said
by the writer: See Appendix N. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT66</font></sup>  Calvin renders the
last verb &#8220;be disappointed,&#8221; (frustratus,) though the verb means
properly to be behind in time, to be too late; yet it is commonly used in the
sense of falling short of a thing, of being destitute; of being without. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450323&gt;</font></sup>Romans 3:23;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460107&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 1:7; chapter
12:15. To &#8220;come short&#8221; of our version fitly expresses its meaning
here, as adopted by Doddridge and Stuart; or &#8220;to fall short,&#8221; as
rendered by Macknight.<br>&#8220;Seem&#8221; is considered by some to be
pleonastic. The verb <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">doke&gt;w</font> is
so no doubt sometimes, but not always; but here appears to have a special
meaning, as the Apostle would have no one to present even the appearance of
neglecting to secure the rest promised. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT67</font></sup>  See Appendix
O<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT68</font></sup>  The general drift of the
passage is evident, yet the construction has been found difficult. Without
repeating the various solutions which have been offered, I shall give what
appears to me the easiest construction, &#8212; <br><b>3.</b> We indeed are
entering into the rest who believe: as he hath said, &#8220;So that I sware in
my wrath, They shall by no means enter into my rest,&#8221; when yet the works
were finished since the foundation of <br><b>4.</b> the world; (for he hath said
thus in a certain place of the seventh day, &#8220;And God rested on the seventh
day from all his works,&#8221;<br><b>5.</b> and again in this place, &#8220;They
shall by no means enter into my<br><b>6.</b> rest;&#8221;) it then remains
therefore that some do enter in because of unbelief.<br>The particle
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpei~</font> has created the difficulty,
which I render in the sense of
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e]peita</font>, then consequently the
argument is simply this: Inasmuch as God had sworn that the unbelieving should
not enter into his rest long after the rest of the sabbath was appointed; it
follows as a necessary consequence that some do enter into it, though the
unbelieving did not enter. The argument turns on the word &#8220;rest;&#8221; It
was to show that it was not the rest of the Sabbath. The argument in the next
verses turns on the word &#8220;today,&#8221; in order to show that it was not
the rest of Canaan.<br>The fourth and fifth verses are only explanatory of the
concluding sentence of the preceding, and therefore ought to be regarded as
parenthetic. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT69</font></sup> 
Many, like Calvin, have made remarks of this kind, but they are out of place
here; for the rest here mentioned is clearly the rest in heaven. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT70</font></sup>  It has been a matter
of dispute whether the &#8220;word&#8221; here is Christ, or the Scripture. The
fathers as well as later divines are divided. The former is the opinion of
Augustin, Ambrose, and also of Dr. Owen and Doddridge: and the latter is held by
Chrysostom, Theophylact, and also by Calvin, Beza, Macknight, Scott, Stuart and
Bloomfield. The latter is clearly the most suitable to the words of the passage.
The only difficulty is in verse 13; but there a transition is evidently made
from the word of God to God himself; and thus both are in remarkable manner
connected together. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT71</font></sup>  See Appendix
P.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT72</font></sup>  See Appendix
Q.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT73</font></sup>  The metaphor of a sword is
evidently carried on; the word is like the sword which &#8220;penetrates so as
to separate the soul (the animal life) and the spirit, (the immortal part,) the
joints also and the marrows, being even a strict judge of the thoughts and
purposes of the heart.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT74</font></sup>  See Appendix
R.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT75</font></sup>  That is, in the latter part
of chapter 2. In the beginning of chapter 3 he exhorted us to
&#8220;consider&#8221; the apostle and high priest of our profession, and then
proceeded to speak of him as an apostle. He now returns to the high priesthood,
and says that as we have a great high priest, we ought to hold fast our
profession. Such, according to Calvin, is the connection, and is adopted by
Stuart and Bloomfield. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT76</font></sup>  In the
Apostle&#8217;s time there were many called high priests, such as the heads of
the Levitical courses; but &#8220;the great high priest&#8221; meant him who
alone had the privilege of entering into the holy of holies, that is, the high
priest, as distinguished from all the rest. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT77</font></sup>  Calvin has followed
the Vulg. In rendering this clause, &#8220;who cannot sympathize (compati) with
our infirmities.&#8221; Our version is that of Eramus and Beza. The meaning may
thus be given, &#8220;Who cannot feel for us in our infirmities.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT78</font></sup>  The word
&#8220;infirmities&#8221; is often used metonymically for things which we are
too weak to bear, even trials and temptations. Christ, our high priest, feels
for us in all those straits and difficulties, whatever they be, which meet us in
our course, and make us feel and know our weaknesses. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT79</font></sup>  The common idea of
what is here said is, that Christ though tried and tempted, was not yet guilty
of sin, or did not fall into sin. That he had no sin, that he was without sin,
is what we plainly learn from
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470521&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 5:21;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620305&gt;</font></sup>1 John 3:5, etc.; but is
this what is taught here? The clause, I conceive, may be thus rendered,
&#8212;<br>&#8220;But was in all things tried in like manner except
sin;&#8221;<br>that is, with the exception that he had no innate sin to contend
with. The last words are literally, &#8220;in likeness with the exclusion of
sin,&#8221; which seems to import that it was a likeness with the exclusion of
sin. But if the words &#8220;except (or without) sin&#8221; do not qualify
&#8220;likeness,&#8221; they must be connected with &#8220;tried&#8221; or
tempted, and thus rendered, &#8212;<br>&#8220;But was in like manner tried in
all things without sin;&#8221;<br>that is, without sinning, or falling into sin.
The difference is, that in the one sense Christ had no inward sin to contend
with, and that in the other he withstood temptation without falling into sin.
Both senses are true, and either of them will suit this passage. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT80</font></sup> 
&#8220;Confidence,&#8221; that is , of being heard. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT81</font></sup>  The &#8220;throne of
grace&#8221; is evidently in opposition to the throne of judgment, which
especially belongs to a king. Some of the Greek fathers regarded this as the
throne of Christ; but most commentators consider it to be God&#8217;s throne, as
Christ is here represented as a priest and as access to God is ever described as
being through Christ. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490218&gt;</font></sup>Ephesians 2:18. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT82</font></sup>  Calvin&#8217;s
version is, &#8220;and find grace for a seasonable help;&#8221; which according
to his explanation, means a help during the season or period of
&#8220;today.&#8221; Doddridge has, &#8220;for our seasonable assistance,&#8221;
&#8212; Macknight, &#8220;for the purpose of seasonable help,&#8221; &#8212; and
Stuart, &#8220;and find favor so as to be assisted in time of need.&#8221; Our
version seems the best, :and find grace to help in the time of need.&#8221; The
address is to those exposed to trials and persecutions; and the seasonable or
opportune help was such as their peculiar circumstances and wants required. The
word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eu]kairon</font>, is in the Sept.
put for &#8220;due season,&#8221; or in its time, in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A427&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 104:27. The idea of
Calvin is that some of the fathers, but is not suitable to this
passage.<br>&#8220;Mercy&#8221; is compassion, and &#8220;grace&#8221; is favor
or benefit received; it means sometimes favor entertained, but here the effect
of favor &#8212; a benefit, and this benefit was to be a help in time of need.
&#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT83</font></sup>  The former
view is what is commonly taken, &#8220;is appointed;&#8221; and it comports with
the subject in hand &#8212; the appointment of the priest, as it appears evident
from what follows in verses 5 and 6. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT84</font></sup>  &#8220;The classic or
philosophic use of the word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">metriopaqei~n</font>, may be briefly
explained. The Stoics maintained that a man should be
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpaqh&lt;v</font>, i.e., not subject to
passions, such as anger, fear, hope, joy, etc. The Platonists on the other hand
averred that a wise man should
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">metriopaqh&lt;v</font>, moderate in his
affections, and not <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpaqh&lt;v</font>.
The leading sense, then, or the word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">metriopaqei~n</font>, is to be moderate
in our feelings or passions.&#8221; &#8212; Stuart.<br>But this is not exactly
its meaning here. Schleusner, quoting the Greek Lexicographers, shows that it
was used in the sense of being indulgent, or of acting kindly and forgivingly,
or forebearingly; and this seems to be its meaning in this passage. The sentence
is rendered by Macknight, &#8220;Being able to have a right measure of
compassion on the ignorant and erring.&#8221; It may be rendered, &#8220;Being
capable of duly feeling for the ignorant and the erring,&#8221; or the deceived,
that is by sin. See as to the ignorant
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;030517&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus 5:17-19; and as
to the deceived by passions or interest, see
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;030601&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus 6:1-7 &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT85</font></sup>  This passage,
&#8220;Thou art my Son,&#8221; etc., in this place, is only adduced to show that
Christ was the Son of God: Christ did not honor or magnify or exalt himself,
(for so <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">doxa&gt;zw</font> means here,)
but he who said to him, &#8220;Thou art my son,&#8221; etc., did honor or exalt
him. This is the meaning of the sentence. The verse may thus be rendered,
&#8212; <br><b>5.</b> So also Christ, himself he did not exalt to be a high
priest, but he who had said to him, &#8220;My son art thou, I have this day
begotten thee.&#8221;<br>It is the same as though he had said, &#8220;Christ did
not make himself a high priest but God.&#8221; And the reason why he speaks of
God as having said &#8220;My Son,&#8221; etc., seems to be this, &#8212; to show
that he who made him king (for the reference in Psalm 2 is to his appointment as
a king) made him also a high priest. And this is confirmed by the next quotation
from Psalm 110; for in the first verse he is spoken of as a king, and then in
verse 4 his priesthood is mentioned. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT86</font></sup>  &#8220;Prayers and
supplications&#8221; are nearly of the same meaning; the first word means a
request, a petition, strictly a prayer; and the last an earnest or humble
entreaty. The last word is found only here in the New Testament; once in the
Septuagint, in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;184103&gt;</font></sup>Job 41:3;
and once in the Apocrypha, 2 Macc. 9:18. Hesychius, as quoted by Schleusner,
gives <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">para&gt;klhsiv</font>, request,
entreaty, as its meaning: it comes from
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">iJke&gt;thv</font>, a suppliant. The word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">iJkethri&gt;a</font>, which is here used
means first an olive branch wrapped in wool, carried by suppliants as a symbol
of entreaty and hence used often in the sense of entreaty and supplication.
&#8212; <i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT87</font></sup>  Stuart on
this passage very justly observes, &#8220;If Jesus died as a common virtuous
suffered, and merely as a martyr to the truth, without any vicarious suffering
laid upon him, then is his death a most unaccountable event in respect to the
manner of his behavior while suffering it; and it must be admitted that
multitudes of humble, sinful, meek and very imperfect disciples of Christianity
have surpassed their Master in the fortitude, and collected firmness and calm
complacency which are requisite to triumph over the pangs of a dying hour. But
who can well believe this? Or who can regard Jesus as a simple sufferer in the
ordinary way upon the cross, and explain the mysteries of his dreadful horror
before and during the hours of crucifixion?&#8221;<br>What is referred to is
certainly inexplicable, except we admit what is often and in various ways
plainly taught us in God&#8217;s word, that Christ died for our sins. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT88</font></sup>  The idea of the
effect of hearing, that is deliverance, is no doubt included in
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijsakousqei&lt;v</font>, &#8220;having
been heard,&#8221; as it is sometimes in the corresponding word in Hebrew; so
that Stuart is justified in the rendering it delivered, &#8212; &#8220;and being
delivered from that which he feared.&#8221; It is rendered the same by
Macknight, &#8220;and being delivered from fear.&#8221; Both Beza and Grotius
render the last word fear; and this is its meaning as used in the Septuagint.
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT89</font></sup>  The word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">teleiwqei&lt;v</font>, means here the
same as in chapter 2:10. Stuart gives it the same meaning here as in the former
passage, &#8220;Then when exalted to glory,&#8221; etc.; but this does not
comport with what follows, for it was not his exaltation to glory that qualified
him to be &#8220;the author (or the causer or effecter) of eternal
salvation,&#8221; but his perfect or complete work in suffering, by his having
completely and perfectly performed the work of atonement. And that his suffering
in obedience to God&#8217;s will, even his vicarious suffering, is meant here,
appears also from the following reference to his being a priest after the order
of Melchisedec. The meaning then seems to be, that Christ having fully completed
his work as a priest, and that by suffering, became thereby the author of
eternal salvation. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT90</font></sup>  The literal rendering
is &#8220;Of whom we have many a word to say, and hardly explainable,&#8221; or
hard to be explained. This hardness of explanation was however owing to their
dullness of comprehension, as Calvin justly observes. &#8220;Hard to be
uttered&#8221; of our version is not correct; nor is &#8220;hard to be
understood&#8221; of Doddridge right. Macknight gives the true meaning,
&#8220;difficult to be explained.&#8221; Beza&#8217;s is the same. The reason is
added &#8220;Since dull (or sluggish) ye are become in ears,&#8221; or in
hearings. To be dull in ears is to be inattentive; but to be sluggish in ears
seems to mean stupidity, slowness of comprehension. The latter is evidently
meant here; that is, a tardiness or slowness in understanding. To hear with the
ear is in the language of Scripture to understand.
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401115&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 11:15;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430843&gt;</font></sup>John 8:43;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461402&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 14:2.) Hence
to be sluggish in ears is to be slow or tardy in understanding the Word of God.
Stuart therefore gives the sense, &#8220;Since ye are dull of
apprehension.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT91</font></sup>  Our version of this
clause is very literal and compact, and sufficiently plain, &#8220;For when for
the time ye ought to be teachers.&#8221; Its elegance and conciseness are not
retained either by Macknight or by Stuart. What is implied in the words,
&#8220;for the time,&#8221; is sufficiently evident without being expressed. As
to the following sentence, &#8220;Ye have need,&#8221; etc., some difficulty has
been found in the construction. I render it as follows, &#8220;Ye have again
need of this &#8212; that some one should teach you the first principles of the
oracles of God.&#8221; I take
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ti&gt;na</font> to be accusative before
&#8220;teach.&#8221; The word &#8220;oracles&#8221; is used by Peter in the same
sense, as designating the doctrines of the Gospels,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600411&gt;</font></sup>1 Peter 4:11. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT92</font></sup>  This is the view of
Grotius and others, but some regard &#8220;the word of righteousness&#8221; as a
paraphrasis for the Gospel; and Stuart renders it, &#8220;the word of
salvation.&#8221; Dr. Owen says that the Gospel is called &#8220;the word of
righteousness,&#8221; because it reveals the righteousness of God,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450117&gt;</font></sup>Romans 1:17. It may also be
so called, because it reveals and contains the truth, the full truth, partly
revealed previously. The word &#8220;righteousness&#8221; has this meaning both
in the Old and New Testaments. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;190304&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 3:4;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234519&gt;</font></sup>Isaiah 45:19, 23; and
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402123&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 21:23,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471115&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 11:15.
&#8220;The ministers of righteousness&#8221; in the last text are opposed to
false ministers. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT93</font></sup>  The word for
&#8220;senses&#8221; means literally the organs of the senses, such as the eyes,
the ears, etc., but here as signifying the senses themselves, as seeing,
hearing, tasting, and smelling, by means of which those grown up are enabled by
long experience to know what is good and wholesome for them, and also what is
bad and injurious. By this comparison, which is here carried out fully, he
intimates that the grown up in Christian truth attain by the habit of exercising
all the senses or faculties of their minds, a capacity to distinguish between
good and evil, between truth and error, in religion.<br>The doctrine of reserve
cannot be drawn from this passage; for though the Apostle says that they were
not capable, owing to their sloth, or taking strong food, he yet lays it before
them. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT94</font></sup>  See
Appendix S.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT95</font></sup>  Calvin has followed
some of the fathers in his exposition of these two clauses, who refer to a state
of things which did not exist in the Church for a considerable time after the
Apostolic age.<br>What is here said comports with the time of the Apostles, and
with that only more particularly. &#8220;Baptisms,&#8221; being in the plural
number, have been a knotty point to many; but there is an especial reason for
this in an Epistle to the Hebrews; some of them had no doubt been baptized by
John, such were afterwards baptized only in the name of Christ,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441905&gt;</font></sup>Acts 19:5, but those who
not so baptized, were doubtless baptized in the name of Trinity. &#8220;The
laying on of hands&#8221; on the baptized was an Apostolic practice, by which
the miraculous gift of tongues was bestowed.
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440815&gt;</font></sup>Acts 8:15-17; 19:6.<br>To
understand the different things mentioned in the first two verses, we must
consider the particulars stated in the 4<sup>th</sup> and the 5<sup>th</sup>
verses; they are explanatory of each other. The penitent were &#8220;the
enlightened;&#8221; &#8220;faith towards God&#8221; was &#8220;the heavenly
gift;&#8221; the baptized, who had hands laid on them, were those who were
&#8220;made partakers of the Holy Ghost;&#8221; the prospect and promise of a
&#8220;resurrection,&#8221; was &#8220;the good word of God;&#8221; and
&#8220;eternal judgment,&#8221; when believed made them to feel &#8220;the
powers (or the powerful influences) of the word to come.&#8221; Thus the two
passages illustrate one another. Such is the meaning which Schleusner gives
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">duna&gt;meiv</font> in this passage,
which Scott and Bloomfield have adopted. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT96</font></sup>  See Appendix
T.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT97</font></sup>  See Appendix
U.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT98</font></sup>  Some render the verb
&#8220;renew&#8221; actively, in this way, &#8212; &#8220;For it is impossible
as to those who have been once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly
gift, and have been made partakers of holy spirit, and have tasted the good word
of God and the powers of the world to come, and have fallen away, to renew them
again unto repentance, since they crucify again as to themselves to Son of God,
and expose him to open shame.&#8221;<br>This is more consistent with the
foregoing, for the Apostle speaks of teaching. It is as though he had said
&#8220;It is impossible for us as teachers;&#8221; as they had no commission. To
&#8220;renew&#8221; may be rendered to &#8220;restore.&#8221; It is only found
here, but is used by the Sept. for a verb which means renewing in the sense of
restoring. See <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A305&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 103:5;
104:30; <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;250521&gt;</font></sup>Lamentations 5:21.
Josephus applies it to the renovation or restoration of the temple. The
&#8220;crucifying&#8221; was what they did by falling away; for they thereby
professed that he deserved to be crucified as an imposter, and thus counted his
blood, as it is said in chapter 10:29, &#8220;unholy,&#8221; as the blood of a
malefactor; and they thus also exhibited him as an object of public contempt.
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT99</font></sup>  The word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">bota&gt;nh</font> here means everything
the earth produces service for food. It only occurs here in the New Testament,
but is commonly used by the Sept. for
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b&ccedil;[</font>, which has the same
extensive meaning: fruit or fruits would be its best rendering here. The word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eu]qetov</font> is also found in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420962&gt;</font></sup>Luke 9:62; 14:34; and it
means fit, meet, suitable, or useful; and the last is the meaning given it here
by Grotius, Schleusner, Stuart, Bloomfield, and others. It is indeed true that
it is used in the Sept. in the sense of seasonable. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193206&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 32:6 &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT100</font></sup>  Nothing can exceed
the clearness and the truth of the preceding remarks.<br>The word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">a]dikov</font>, unrighteousness, is
rendered by many, unmerciful or unkind. But the reason for such a meaning is
this: There are three kinds, we may say, of righteousness &#8212; that of the
law, of love, and of promise. To act according to the law is to be righteous; to
comply with what love requires, that is, to be kind and charitable, is to be
righteous, and hence almsgiving is called righteousness has often the meaning of
faithfulness or mercy. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620109&gt;</font></sup>1 John 1:9. Therefore the
meaning here is, that God is not so unrighteous as not to fulfill his promise.
Hence the notion of merit is at once shown to be groundless. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT101</font></sup>  See Appendix
X.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT102</font></sup>  This noun and the verb from
which it comes, are peculiar to the new testament, but the latter is once used
in the Sept., <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;210811&gt;</font></sup>Ecclesiastes
8:11. The metaphor is taken from a ship in full sail, or from a tree fully laden
with fruit. Fullness or perfection is the general idea. It is applied to
knowledge in Colossians 2:2, and to faith in Hebrew 10:22. It is also found once
more in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520105&gt;</font></sup>1 Thessalonians
1:5, and is applied to the assurance with which the gospel was preached. It may
be rendered certainly, or assurance, or full assurance. As a passive participle
it means to be fully persuaded in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450421&gt;</font></sup>Romans 4:21, and in 14:5.
See Appendix Y. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT103</font></sup> The word for
&#8220;patience&#8221; is properly long-suffering, or forbearance,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450204&gt;</font></sup>Romans 2:4; but it is used
here in the same sense of patient expectation, as the participle clearly means
in verse 15.<br>As to &#8220;inherit,&#8221; the present, as Grotius says, is
used for the past tense &#8212; &#8220;who inherited,&#8221; or rather,
&#8220;became heirs to the promises.&#8221; They did not really possess them, as
we find in chapter 11:13, but heired them, as we may say; they died in faith and
became entitled to them. The word &#8220;promises&#8221; is used here as well as
in chapter 11; for many things were included in what God had promised to the
fathers, but chiefly the Messiah and the heavenly inheritance. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT104</font></sup> It is said, that
having &#8220;patiently endured&#8221; or rather waited, &#8220;he obtained the
promise,&#8221; that is, of a numerous posterity, the particular thing
previously referred to. After having waited for twenty-five years, (see
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011201&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 12:1-4, and
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011701&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 17:1-16,) a son was
given him; and this beginning of the fulfilled promise was a pledge of its full
accomplishment. This case is brought forward as an example of waiting faith.
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT105</font></sup> The
&#8220;two immutable things,&#8221; says most, are the promise and the oath. But
some of late, such as Stuart, have disputed this interpretation; and they hold
that they are two oaths, &#8212; the first was made to Abraham respecting a Son
(the Messiah) in whom all nations should be blessed; and the second refers to
Christ&#8217;s priesthood, recorded in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B004&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 110:4. This is the
clearly to go out of the passage for its interpretation. The case of the
fathers, and especially Abraham, in verses 12, 13, 14 and 15, was introduced for
the sake of illustration. And having mentioned God&#8217;s oath with regard to
Abraham, he proceeds in verse 16 to state the use of an oath among men, and
evidently reverting to the promise of eternal life implied in &#8220;the
hope&#8221; mentioned in verse 11, he says that God confirmed that promise,
called here God&#8217;s &#8220;counsel,&#8221; by an oath; and the oath
specially referred to seems to have been that respecting the priesthood of his
Son, more than once mentioned before and at the end of this chapter; for upon
his priesthood in an especial manner depended the promise of eternal life. The
&#8220;counsel&#8221; of God means his revealed counsel or gracious purpose, his
promise of eternal life to those who believe. In establishing a priesthood by an
oath, he confirmed this promise, for its accomplishment depended on that
priesthood. To call two oaths two immutable things is nothing so apposite as to
call so the promise and the oath by which the priesthood was established.
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT106</font></sup> The
&#8220;strong consolation&#8221; is rendered by Theophylact &#8220;strong
encouragement;&#8221; nor is it unsuitable here. The influence of the &#8220;two
immutable things&#8221; was no other than to give strong encouragement to those
who believed: the tendency was to confirm them in the faith. Stuart gives it the
meaning of &#8220;persuasion,&#8221; and renders the passage thus, &#8220;So
that by two immutable things, concerning which is impossible for God to lie, we,
who have sought for refuge, might be strongly persuaded to hold fast the hope
that is set before us.&#8221; The great objection to this is the separation of
&#8220;fleeing&#8221; from the latter part of the sentence, which I find is done
by none; and to seek for refuge, or to flee for refuge, is not the meaning of
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">katafugo&gt;ntev</font>, but merely to
flee; and to construe it by itself gives no meaning. We are hence under the
necessity of construing it with what follows, &#8220;That we might have a strong
consolation (or encouragement) who have fled to lay hold on the hope set before
us.&#8221; So Beza substantially, and Doddridge, and Macknight. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT107</font></sup> &#8220;Safe,&#8221;
that is safely fixed; and &#8220;firm,&#8221; that is strong, so as not to be
bent nor broken, as Parens says. Stuart seems to have inverted the proper
meaning of the words, as he applies
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajsfalh~</font> to the anchor as having
been made of good materials, and
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">qebai&gt;an</font> as signifying that it
is firmly fixed. The first word means what cannot fall, be subverted, or
overthrown, and must therefore refer to what is safely fixed; and the other
means firm, stable, constant, enduring. So Schleusner renders the words,
&#8220;tutam ac firmam,&#8221; safe and firm; and he quotes Phavorinus as giving
the meaning of the first word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e[draiov</font>, steadfast. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT108</font></sup> Calvin&#8217;s
version is &#8220;Where our precursor Jesus has entered.&#8221; The
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pro&gt;dromov</font> is one who goes
before to prepare the way for those who follow him. It is used in the Sept. to
designate the first ripe grapes and the first ripe figs.
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;041320&gt;</font></sup>Numbers 13:20;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232804&gt;</font></sup>Isaiah 28:4. These were the
precursors for us (or, in our behalf) Jesus has entered.&#8221; He has not only
gone to prepare a place for his people; but he is also their leader whom they
are to follow; and where he has entered they shall also enter. His entrance is a
pledge of their entrance. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT109</font></sup> The passage reads
better, and the meaning appears more evident, when we consider
<font color="Maroon"><i>was</i></font> as understood in the first verse, as
Calvin does. The first part refers to what he did as to Abraham: and the second,
to what he was as a type of Christ.<br>Now this Melchisedec, king of Salem, was
a priest of the most high God; who met Abraham returning from the overthrow of
the kings, and blessed him; to whom Abraham also divided the tenth of all: being
first indeed, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of
Salem, which is, King of Peace; without father, without mother, without decent,
having no beginning of days or end of life, but <br>By saying that he
&#8220;blessed&#8221; Abraham, we are to render that he prayed God to bless him,
as we find it explained in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011419&gt;</font></sup>Genesis
14:19.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT110</font></sup> It is not as a king, but
as a priest that Christ is our righteousness. Therefore strictly speaking, as a
king, he administers righteousness, or acts righteously. &#8220;The king of
righteousness,&#8221; may be rendered, as Stuart does, a righteous king. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;194507&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 45:7 &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT111</font></sup> Some regard what is
said of Melchisedec being without father, etc., as meaning that he was so in his
office as a king and priest, there being no account of a predecessor or of a
successor to him; but this view cannot be taken on account of these words,
&#8220;without mother, without descent,&#8221; etc., Calvin gives the
explanation commonly received. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT112</font></sup> Our version
&#8220;made like,&#8221; etc., is objected to by Stuart; and he renders it,
&#8220;being like,&#8221; alleging that the Apostle&#8217;s object is to show,
not that Melchisedec was &#8220;made like&#8221; to Christ as a priest, but the
contrary, according to
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B004&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 110:4. But the object
here seems to be different: he shows why it is that there is no record of
Melchisedec&#8217;s office as to its beginning or end; it was that he might be
made a fit type to represent the Son of God. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT113</font></sup> The words are in the
neuter gender, &#8220;what is less blessed by the greater.&#8221; This is an
idiom; the neuter is put for the masculine, as
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pa~n</font> is used for all men in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430637&gt;</font></sup>John 6:37, and
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pa~n mwra&lt;</font> for foolish men in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460127&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 1:27. The
meaning is, &#8220;the inferior is blessed by his superior.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT114</font></sup> There are three kinds
of blessing mentioned in Scripture, &#8212; prayer for a blessing,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400544&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 5:44; prophetic
blessing, as in the case of the patriarchs, chapter 11:20, 21; and sacerdotal
blessing, as recorded in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;040623&gt;</font></sup>Numbers 6:23-27. The latter
is what is meant here. It was a blessing announced in the name of the Lord, or a
prayer offered in his name, and by his authority. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT115</font></sup> Critics often make a
difficulty where is none. The obvious meaning of this verse is given by Calvin,
&#8212; continual succession, owing to death, betokened the unenduring character
of the Levitical priesthood; but the perpetuity of that Melchisedec is proved by
this, that he lives. To live often means to be perpetual; and to die intimates
what is evanescent. The Levites were dying men, which showed the character of
their office, Melchisedec is represented as not dying, which betokens that his
office as a priest is perpetual. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT116</font></sup> Our version is
&#8220;For he was yet,&#8221; etc.,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e]pi</font>, here is not yet, but even,
as in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420115&gt;</font></sup>Luke 1:15, or then,
as rendered by Stuart; &#8220;For he was even (or then) in the loins of his
father when Melchisedec met him.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT117</font></sup> The particles
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Eij me&lt;n ou+n</font>, are rendered by
Elsner, &#8220;but if,&#8221; &#8212; by Doddridge, &#8220;now if,&#8221;
&#8212; by Stuart, &#8220;moreover if,&#8221; and by Macknight, &#8220;moreover,
if indeed;&#8221; and all these consider that there is here a commencement from
what has preceded. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT118</font></sup>
&#8220;Perfection,&#8221; or completion, rather than consummation is no doubt
the best word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">telei&gt;wsiv</font>. To
render it &#8220;perfect expiation,&#8221; as Schleusner does, is not to render
the word, but to explain it. The imperfection of the Levitical priesthood was
doubtless its capacity really to make an atonement for sin, as its work was
ceremonial and typical: but it was enough for the present purpose merely to say
that it was not perfect, as it failed to answer the great end of establishing a
priesthood. And the Apostle grounds its deficiency, or imperfect character, on
the fact that a priest of another order had been promised. This was an argument
which the Jews could not resist, as it was founded on the Scriptures, which they
themselves acknowledged as divine. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT119</font></sup> See Appendix
Z.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT120</font></sup> Calvin renders
&#8220;for&#8221;, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ga&lt;r</font>,
&#8220;doubtless &#8212; certe,&#8221; and Stuart, &#8220;now;&#8221; but it may
better be rendered here, &#8220;for,&#8221; as a reason is given for a change in
&#8220;the law&#8221; respecting the priesthood. The
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ga&lt;r</font> in the former verse may be
rendered &#8220;indeed,&#8221; or &#8220;wherefore&#8221; as by Macknight. In
the 11<sup>th</sup> verse, the Apostle proves the imperfection or defectiveness
of the Levitical priesthood, by the promise of another priest after the order of
Melchisedec for Christ was not of the tribe specified by the Law. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT121</font></sup> This paragraph
extends from the 11<sup>th</sup> verse to the end of the 17<sup>th</sup>. The
&#8220;law&#8221; parenthetically referred to in the 11<sup>th</sup>, seems not
to be the Mosaic Law generally, as too commonly supposed, but the law respecting
the Levitical priesthood, as it appears evident from the 12<sup>th</sup> and the
following verses, for what is spoken of is Christ as being a priest not in
succession from Aaron, but according to the order of Melchisedec. See Appendix A
2. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT122</font></sup> Calvin is
peculiar in his view of this verse. He considered the Law to be &#8220;an
introduction to a better hope.&#8221; Many agree with our version, such as Beza,
Doddridge, Macknight, Stuart, etc. But there are those who render
&#8220;introduction&#8221; in connection with &#8220;disannulling.&#8221; See
Appendix B 2. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT123</font></sup>
Calvin&#8217;s version of the former part of the verse is, &#8220;Hence he is
also able to save for ever those who through him draw nigh to God.&#8221;
Instead of &#8220;to the uttermost&#8221; of our version, we have here
&#8220;forever,&#8221; according to the Vulg. Macknight renders the phrase the
same and Stuart &#8220;always.&#8221; But the original,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv to&lt; pantele&lt;v</font>, do not
refer to time, but to what is fully or perfectly done. It is so taken by
Erasmus, Beza, Capellus and Schleusner. There is another difference, whether to
connect the words with &#8220;able&#8221; or with &#8220;save.&#8221; Most join
them with &#8220;save,&#8221; &#8220;he is able also fully (or, for ever) able
to save.&#8221; When we consider what the subject is &#8212; the perfection of
Christ as a priest, and not the character of his salvation. We must see that the
latter is the right view, and that the passage ought to have been thus rendered,
&#8212; &#8220;And hence he is fully (or perfectly) able to save those who
through him come to God.&#8221; And the words which follow may be deemed as
affording a reason for this, &#8220;always living in order to intercede for
them,&#8221; or, &#8220;to interpose in their behalf.&#8221; <br>However, there
is not much difference in the meaning, whether the word &#8220;fully&#8221; or
perfectly be connected with &#8220;able&#8221; or with &#8220;save;&#8221; the
same truth is essentially conveyed. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT124</font></sup> Christ as a priest
was &#8220;holy&#8221; with regard to God; &#8220;harmless,&#8221; or innocent,
or guileless, according to Chrysostom, with respect to men;
&#8220;undefiled&#8221; as to himself, morally so, as the priests under the law
were so ceremonially; &#8220;separate,&#8221; or separated &#8220;from
sinners&#8221; removed from their society to another place, and &#8220;exalted
higher than the heavens.&#8221; There is an allusion to the Levitical high
priest, especially in the three last words, and a contrast in the two last; the
Levitical high priest continued among sinners, Christ is removed from them; the
former entered into the holy of holies, the latter has entered into a place
higher that the heavens, even the heavens of heavens. How immeasurable is the
superiority of our high priest! &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT125</font></sup> See Appendix C
2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT126</font></sup> See Appendix D
2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT127</font></sup> It is better to take
&#8220;holy things&#8221; as designating the holy duties of the priest,
afterwards specified when the offering of gifts and sacrifices is mentioned,
than as signifying &#8220;the sanctuary.&#8221; Christ is a priest and a
minister in sacred things, and a minister in the true tabernacle. He has holy
things to do, and he does them, not in the shadowy and typical tabernacle, but
in that which is real and celestial.<br>We find, that the word in the next
chapter means the holiest place, accompanied as here with the article, chapter
9: 8-12, and without the article, the holy place or the sanctuary, chapter 9:2.
So then if this meaning be taken, the rendering here ought to be, &#8220;the
minister of the holiest;&#8221; and then &#8220;tabernacle&#8221; is used as
including the whole building, as in chapter 9:2. But the context here seems to
favor the former meaning. The version of Doddridge is, &#8220;A minister of holy
things.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT128</font></sup> &#8220;This
man&#8221; of our version, in the latter clause of the verse, should be either
&#8220;he,&#8221; or &#8220;this high priest,&#8221; in contrast with the high
priest at the beginning of the verse. Such is the rendering of Macknight and
Stuart. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT129</font></sup> Our
version of this clause is hardly intelligible. Calvin&#8217;s rendering with a
little addition would convey a clear meaning. &#8220;Who do service in that
which is the exemplar and shadow of celestial things.&#8221; Stuart considers
&#8220;tabernacle&#8221; as being understood. We have the words, &#8220;who
serve the tabernacle,&#8221; in chapter 13:10, that is, &#8220;who do the
service belonging to the tabernacle,&#8221; or, &#8220;who attend on the
tabernacle.&#8221; So the literal rendering here is, &#8220;who serve the model
and shadow of celestial things,&#8221; which means, &#8220;who do the service
belonging to the model and shadows of celestial things.&#8221; The tabernacle no
doubt is what is meant; and it is called a &#8220;model,&#8221; or likeness,
because it emblematically represented, or exhibited things heavenly, and a
&#8220;shadow,&#8221; because it was not the substance or the reality. Stuart
seems to have unwisely combined the two words, &#8220;a mere copy;&#8221; for
the two ideas they convey are not thus so clearly seen.<br>But to
&#8220;serve,&#8221; or to do service, includes what was done by the people as
well as by the priests. Those who offered the sacrifices, as well as the priests
through whom they offered the sacrifices, or performed the services belonging to
the tabernacle; the latter are meant here, and the former or both in chapter
10:2; 13:10. To serve the Lord, and to offer sacrifices to him, are in Exodus
represented as the same; see chapter 8:1; 10:7, 26. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT130</font></sup> Instead of
&#8220;proclaimed,&#8221; it is &#8220;established&#8221; in our version, and in
that of Doddridge, and Macknight, and of Stuart, &#8220;sanctioned.&#8221; The
verb means what is set as a law; that is, firmly and irrevocably fixed. It was a
covenant firmly set or founded on more excellent promises. What these are, we
learn in the following verses.<br>This verse is connected with the fourth; and
the fifth is to be put in a parenthesis. The reasoning is, &#8212; Though he is
no priest on earth, yet he has a higher ministry, inasmuch as the covenant of
which he is the Mediator is far superior to that of priests on earth; that is,
the Levitical priests. Then he proceeds to the end of the chapter with the
covenant, and shows its superiority. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT131</font></sup> This apparent
inconsistency is avoided by some by rendering the 8<sup>th</sup> verse
differently, &#8220;But finding fault,&#8221; that is, with the first covenant,
&#8220;he&#8221; Chrysostom, Beza, Doddridge, our own version, as well as Calvin
and the Vulgate, connect &#8220;them&#8221; with &#8220;finding fault
with,&#8221; and more correctly too; for the Israelites are blamed in the very
passage that is quoted. There was a double fault or defect, which is explained
in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450803&gt;</font></sup>Romans 8:3, &#8220;For
what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,&#8221; etc.
This double fault or weakness more fully sets forth the excellency of the new
covenant. &#8212;<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT132</font></sup> See
Appendix E 2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT133</font></sup> The Apostle adopts
here the Septuagint version. The Hebrew is &#8220;I will put my law in their
inmost part, and on their heart will I write (or engrave) it.&#8221; The word
&#8220;law&#8221; and &#8220;heart&#8221;, are put here in the plural number,
and the &#8220;inmost part&#8221; is rendered &#8220;mind.&#8221; These changes
are according to the peculiar character of the two languages. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT134</font></sup> It is a sufficient
answer to the fanatics here alluded to, that their conclusion from his text
militates against the practice of the apostolic Church as established by Christ
himself, he having sent apostles, evangelists, pastors and teachers. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT135</font></sup> The 12<sup>th</sup>
verse is passed over. It differs in words, though not in substance, both from
the Hebrew and the Sept. It is indeed the latter version with the addition of
these words, &#8220;and their iniquities.&#8221; The nouns are in the singular
number in Hebrew, &#8220;unrighteousness&#8221; and &#8220;sin.&#8221; When the
Apostle quotes again the passage in chapter 10:17, he leaves out
&#8220;unrighteousness,&#8221; and mentions only &#8220;sins and
iniquities.&#8221; There is also a shade of difference as to the first verb. In
Hebrew remission or forgiveness is its meaning, but here the idea is mercy. The
Apostle no doubt considered that the truth was essentially conveyed in the Greek
version. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT136</font></sup> This
verse may be thus rendered, &#8212; <br>&#8220;By saying, &#8216;a new
covenant,&#8217; he has made ancient the first: now what is ancient and becomes
old is nigh a dissolution (or disappearing.)&#8221;<br>It is said to be ancient
in contrast with the new; and old or aged is afterwards added to be ancient in
order to show its weak and feeble character, being like an old man tottering on
the brink of the grave, who, when buried, disappears from among the living. It
is supposed that there is here an intimation of the dissolution of the whole
Jewish polity, which soon afterwards took place. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT137</font></sup> Rather, &#8220;Yet
even the first,&#8221; etc. It is connected with the last verse of the preceding
chapter; as though he had said, &#8212; &#8220;Though the covenant is become
antiquated, yet it had many things divinely appointed connected with it.&#8221;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Me&lt;n ou+n</font> mean
&#8220;yet,&#8221; or however. See Art. 8:4. Macknight has &#8220;Now
verily;&#8221; and Stuart, &#8220;Moreover.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT138</font></sup> It has since been
discovered that it is not found in many of the best MSS., and is dismissed from
the text by Griesbach and all modern critics. The noun understood is evidently
&#8220;covenant,&#8221; spoken of in the preceding chapter. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT139</font></sup> Many, such as
Grotius, Beza, etc., consider that &#8220;ordinances&#8221; and
&#8220;services&#8221; (not service) are distinct, and both in the objective
case, and render the words &#8220;rituals, services, and a wordly
sanctuary.&#8221; And if the sequel is duly examined, it will be found that this
is the right construction. The Apostle, according to the manner of the prophet,
reverses the order, and speaks distinctly of these three particulars, &#8212;
first, &#8220;the wordly sanctuary&#8221; &#8212; the tabernacle in verses 2, 3,
4, and 5; secondly, &#8220;the services&#8221; in verses 6 and 7; and thirdly,
&#8220;the rituals&#8221; in verse 10, where the word &#8220;ordinances&#8221;
again occur. There can therefore be hardly a doubt as to the construction of the
first verse. The sanctuary is called worldly in contrast with what is heavenly
or divine, not made with hands: see verse 11. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT140</font></sup> See Appendix F
2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT141</font></sup> This is evidently a mistake,
for the altar of incense was in the sanctuary &#8212; the first tabernacle. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;023001&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 30:1-6. The word is
used in the Sept., for &#8220;censer,&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;142619&gt;</font></sup>2 Chronicles 26:19. There
were many censors made, as it is supposed, of brass; for they were daily used in
the sanctuary for incense; but this golden censor was probably used only on the
day of expiation, when the chief priest entered the holiest place; and the
probability is, though there is no account of this in the Old Testament, that it
was laid up or deposited, as Stuart suggests, in the holy of holies. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT142</font></sup> Stuart observes,
&#8220;Our author is speaking of the tabernacle, and not of the temple; still
less of the second temple, which must have lacked even the tables of testimony.
The probability is, that the ark, during its many removals, and in particular
during its captivity by the Philistines, was deprived of those sacred deposits;
for we hear no more concerning them.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT143</font></sup> It is said that the
high priest entered the holiest place &#8220;once every year,&#8221; that is, on
one day, the day of expiation, every year; but on that day he went in at least
three times. See <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031612&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus
16:12-15; and probably four times, according to the Jewish tradition; and one of
the times, as supposed by Stuart, was for the purpose of bringing out the golden
censer.<br>The word rendered &#8220;errors,&#8221; literally means
&#8220;ignorances,&#8221; and so some render it &#8220;sins of ignorance;&#8221;
but it is used in the Apocrypha as designating sins in general; and Grotius
refers to Tob. 3:3; Judith 5:20; Sirach 23:2, 1 Macc. 13:39. And that it means
sins of all kinds is evident from the account given in Leviticus 16 of the
atonement made on the annual man, says Estius, &#8220;is ignorant; and all sins
proceed from error in judgement.&#8221; Hence it seems, sins were called
ignorances. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT143a</font></sup>
Although the original text in the book refers to Jer 31:37, which warns of an
ultimate rejection of Israel; it would seem that Jer 31:31 is more appropriate
in the current context of reformation.
<i>&#8211;fj</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT144</font></sup> See Appendix G
2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT144a</font></sup> See commentary on Chapter
7.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT145</font></sup> &#8220;Good things (or
blessings) to come,&#8221; may have a reference to the blessings promised in the
Old Testament as the blessings of the kingdom of Christ, included in &#8220;the
eternal redemption&#8221; mentioned in the next verse. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT146</font></sup> There is no other
view that is satisfactory. The idea that has been by some suggested, that the
&#8220;better tabernacle&#8221; is the visible heaven through which he entered
into the heaven of heavens, has no evidence in its support. Some of the
Ancients, such as Ambrose, and also Doddridge and Scott consider heaven as
intended, as in chapter 8:2, (but &#8220;tabernacle&#8221; in that passage means
the whole structure, especially the holy of holies.) According to this view
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dia&lt;</font> is rendered in &#8212;
&#8220;in a greater and more perfect tabernacle.&#8221; But Chrysostom,
Theophylact, Grotius, Beza, etc., agree with Calvin in regarding Christ&#8217;s
human nature as signified by the &#8220;tabernacle;&#8221; and what confirms
this exposition is what we find in chapter 10:5, 10, and 20. &#8220;Not made
with hands,&#8221; and &#8220;not of this creation,&#8221; for no objection; for
Christ&#8217;s body was supernaturally formed; and the contrast is with the
material tabernacle, a human structure, made by men and made of earthly
materials. It is, however, better to connect &#8220;tabernacle&#8221; with the
preceding than with the following words, &#8212; <br>But Christ, having come the
high priest of the good things to come by means of a better and more perfect
tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this creation, has entered once
for all into the holiest, not indeed with (or by) the blood of goats and calves
but (or by) his own blood, having obtained an eternal
redemption.<br>&#8220;Creation&#8221; here means the world; it was not made of
worldy materials. See verse 1. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT147</font></sup> Some as Grotius and
Schleusner, take &#8220;the eternal Spirit&#8221; as meaning the same thing as
&#8220;endless life&#8221; in chapter 7:16, &#8212; &#8220;who having (or in) an
eternal spirit,&#8221; or life, etc.; they give the sense of &#8220;in&#8221; to
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dia&lt;</font>. The comparison they
represent to be between perishable victims and the sacrifice of Christ, who
possesses a spirit or life that is eternal.<br>Others, as Junius and Beza,
consider Christ&#8217;s divine nature as signified by &#8220;the eternal
Spirit.&#8221; Beza says, that it was the Deity united to humanity that
consecrated the whole sacrifice and endued it with vivifying power. The view of
Stuart can hardly be comprehended.<br>But the explanation most commonly adopted
is that given here by Calvin that the Holy Spirit is meant, whose aid and
influence are often mentioned in connection with Christ; see
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401228&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 12:28;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440102&gt;</font></sup>Acts 1:2; 10:38. Some MSS
and fathers have &#8220;holy&#8221; instead of &#8220;eternal,&#8221; but the
greatest number and the best have the last word. Dr. Owen, Doddridge and Scott
take this view. Why the Spirit is called &#8220;eternal&#8221; is not very
evident. It may have been for the purpose of showing that the Spirit mentioned
before in verse 8 is the same Spirit, he being eternal, and thus in order to
prove that the offering of Christ was according to the divine will. God is said
to be eternal in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451626&gt;</font></sup>Romans
16:26, where a reference is made to the past and the present dispensation, with
the view, as it seems, to show that he is the author of both. But perhaps the
explanation of Calvin is the most suitable. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT148</font></sup> Here begins a new
subject, that the covenant, or it may be viewed as the resumption of what is
found in chapter 8:6, 7. &#8220;For this cause,&#8221; or for this reason,
refers, as it seems , to what follows, &#8220;in order that,&#8221;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">o[pwv</font>, etc. &#8212; <br>And for
this reason is he the Mediator of a new covenant, in order that death being
undergone for the redemption of transgressions under the first covenant, they
who were called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.<br>As in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450325&gt;</font></sup>Romans 3:25, 26, the
reference is to the retrospective effect of Christ&#8217;s expiatory sacrifice.
Hence &#8220;are called&#8221; is not correct; and the participle is in the past
tense. To &#8220;receive the promise,&#8221; means to enjoy its fulfillment.
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT149</font></sup> See Appendix
H 2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT150</font></sup> It is worthy of notice that
the Apostle mentions here several things which are not particularly by Moses in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022403&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 24:3-8, where the
account is given; and yet what is there stated sufficiently warrants the
particulars mentioned here. The blood of &#8220;goats&#8221; is not mentioned,
and yet burnt offerings are said to have been offered, and goats were so
offered; see <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;030110&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus
1:10. Moses says nothing of &#8220;scarlet wool and hyssop;&#8221; but he
mentions &#8220;sprinkling,&#8221; and this was commonly done thereby; see
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031451&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus 14:51.
&#8220;Blood&#8221; only is mentioned by Moses; but we find that when sprinkled,
&#8220;water&#8221; was often connected with it. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031452&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus 14:52;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;041918&gt;</font></sup>Numbers 19:18 The main
difficulty is respecting &#8220;the book&#8221; being sprinkled, which is not
stated by Moses. But as the altar was sprinkled, there was the same reason for
sprinkling the book, though that is not expressly mentioned. However, it is
evident that this was the general opinion among the Jews, for otherwise the
Apostle would not have mentioned it in an Epistle especially addressed to
them.<br>Then the &#8220;tabernacle,&#8221; it was not expressly mentioned that
it was sprinkled with blood when consecrated; and this was some time after the
covenant was made. The setting up of the tabernacle is mentioned in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;024017&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 40:17-33. In the
previous verses, 9 and 10, there is a direction given to anoint the tabernacle,
and all its vessels, and also to hallow them and to anoint the alter, and to
sanctify it. The hallowing or sanctifying was no doubt done by sprinkling them
with blood. See as a proof of this
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022921&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 29:21. We hence
perceive how well acquainted the writer must have been with the Jewish rituals.
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT151</font></sup> Both Calvin
and our verse retain the word &#8220;testament&#8221; as derived from verse 17;
but as that verse and the preceding are to be viewed as parenthetic, the word
&#8220;covenant&#8221; is the term used by Moses. The latter is the word adopted
by Beza, Doddridge, Macknight, and Stuart, &#8220;This is the blood of the
covenant,&#8221; etc. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT152</font></sup> The Apostle here
follows neither the Hebrew nor the Septuagint. The Hebrew is &#8220;which the
Lord (Jehovah) hath made with you;&#8221; and the Septuagint, &#8220;Which the
Lord hath covenanted (<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">die&gt;qeto</font>)
with you.&#8221; And instead of &#8220;Behold the blood of the covenant,&#8221;
(the same in both) we have here, &#8220;This is the blood of the
covenant.&#8221; But though the words are different, yet the meaning is
essentially the same, &#8212; the main things regarded by the Apostles in their
quotations. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT153</font></sup>
Metals were purified by fire, and clothes by being washed in water,
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;043122&gt;</font></sup>Numbers 31:22-24;) but
these were purifications not accompanied with remission of sins. So that what is
said here is literally true. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT154</font></sup> By making
&#8220;heavenly things&#8221; to mean things in heaven above, and not in the
kingdom of heaven on earth, commentators have been under the necessity of
altering the sense of the word &#8220;purified.&#8221; The tabernacle
represented the whole kingdom of Christ, both on earth and in heaven. The
sanctuary and the court, where the alter of burnt offering was, represented what
Christ has done and is doing on earth; and the holy of holies was a
representation of Christ&#8217;s kingdom in heaven. The victims were slain in
the court without the vail; the shedding of blood was the atonement, but its
sprinkling was its purifying and sanctifying effects. All the heavenly things in
the Church on earth require purifying by the sprinkling of the blood of the
atoning sacrifice once offered by Christ; and it is to this the reference is
made here. And having provided means for purification, he as the high priest, by
virtue of his sacrifice, entered into the holiest, heavenly things on earth, for
the Church here below, in order to prepare it for the holiest above. &#8220;In
the heavens&#8221; may probably refer to two parts of Christ&#8217;s kingdom,
the one in heaven and the other on earth; and latter, as things which require a
sacrifice; and then in the following verse the former part is alluded to, the
kingdom above, even heaven, represented by the holy of holies. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT155</font></sup> This sentence is not
to be taken strictly in its literal meaning; for the world was founded and all
things were set in due order before sin entered into it. The phrase is used in a
similar way in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421150&gt;</font></sup>Luke 11:50.
It is a popular mode of speaking intelligible to common readers though not
suitable to over-nice and hair-splitting critics.<br>The truth implied, as Beza
observes, is, that sins since the beginning of the world have alone have been
expiated by the blood of Christ, the virtue of which extends to all sins, past
and future. The effects of his sufferings being perpetual and the same as to all
ages, from the beginning to the end of the world, there was no necessity of
having them repeated. As to their retrospective influence, see verse 15, and
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450325&gt;</font></sup>Romans 3:25, 26 &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT156</font></sup> Literally it is
&#8220;for the abolishing of sin,&#8221; as Doddridge renders it. The word
occurs only in one other place, chapter 7:18, and is rendered
&#8220;disannulling;&#8221; and Macknight gives it that meaning here, taking
&#8220;sin&#8221; in the sense of sin-offering, &#8220;He hath been manifested
to abolish sin-offering by the sacrifice of himself.&#8221; But this is
inconsistent with the drift of the passage. To remove or abolish sin is
doubtless what is meant. To &#8220;take away sin,&#8221; is the version of Beza;
and &#8220;to remove the punishment due to sin,&#8221; is that of Stuart.
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT157</font></sup> &#8220;Was
once offered,&#8221;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">prosenecqei&lt;v</font>, &#8212; Grotius
regarded this participle as having a reflective sense, &#8220;having once for
all offered up himself;&#8221; and so does Stuart. The first aorist passive has
often this sense. &#8220;By whom was he offered?&#8221; asks Theophylact; he
answers, &#8220;by himself, he being a high priest.&#8221; This amounts to the
same thing. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT158</font></sup>
&#8220;We are told that <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oiJ
polloi&lt;</font> is often equivalent to
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pa&gt;ntev</font>. It is not however
quite certain that the Apostle here meant to express
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pa&gt;ntwn</font>; the verse concludes
with the mention of those who &#8216;wait for him&#8217; i.e., who wait for
Christ&#8217;s second coming in humble hope of receiving their reward; and these
manifestly are not the whole human race.&#8221; &#8212; Bp. Middleton, quoted by
Bloomfield. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT159</font></sup>
Schleusner and Stuart consider &#8220;without sin&#8221; to mean &#8220;without
sin-offering&#8221; without any sacrifice for sin. Doddridge and Scott take its
meaning to be &#8220;without being in the likeness of sinful flesh,&#8221; or,
without that humiliating form in which he atoned for sin. Some have said,
&#8220;without sin&#8221; being imputed to him. The construction which the
passage seems to afford is this, &#8220;without bearing sin.&#8221; The previous
clause is that, to bear or to suffer for, he having made the first time a full
and complete expiation.<br>To &#8220;bear sins,&#8221; is not, as some say, to
take them away, in allusion to the scape goat, but to endure the punishment due
to them, to make an atonement for them. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600224&gt;</font></sup>1 Peter 2:24; where the
same word to &#8220;bear,&#8221; in connection with &#8220;sins,&#8221; is used;
and where it clearly means to bear the penalty of sin; the end of the verse is,
&#8220;with whose stripes we are healed.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT160</font></sup> Most commentators
adopt the same view, as conveyed in our version, connecting
&#8220;salvation&#8221; with appearing, such as Beza, Grotius, Doddridge, Scott
and Stuart. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT161</font></sup>
No remark is made on the second verse. Doddridge and Beza read the first clause
without negative <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oujk</font> and not as a
question, according to the Vulg. And the Syr. Versions, &#8220;Otherwise they
would have ceased to be offered.&#8221; Most MSS. favor our present reading.
There is no real difference in the meaning.<br>The words, &#8220;no more
conscience of sins,&#8221; are rendered by Beza, &#8220;no more conscious of
sins;&#8221; by Doddridge, &#8220;no more consciousness of sins;&#8221; and by
Stuart, &#8220;no longer conscious of sins.&#8221; The true meaning is no doubt
thus conveyed. We meet with two other instances of conscience,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">suneidh&gt;shv</font>, being followed by
what may be called the genitive case of the object, &#8220;conscience of the
idol,&#8221; i.e., as to the idol,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460807&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 8:7, &#8212;
&#8220;conscience of God,&#8221; i.e., as to God, or towards God,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600219&gt;</font></sup>1 Peter 2:19. And here,
&#8220;conscience of sins,&#8221; must mean conscience with reference to sins,
i.e., conviction of sins, a conscience apprehensive of what sins deserve. It is
a word, says Parkhurst, which &#8220;is rarely found in the ancient heathen
writers;&#8221; but it occurs often in the New Testament, though not but once in
the Sept., <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;211020&gt;</font></sup>Ecclesiastes
10:20. Its common meaning is conscience, and not consciousness, though it may be
so rendered here, consistently with the real meaning of the passage. Michaelis
in his Introduction to the New Testament, is referred to by Parkhurst, as having
produced two instances, one from Philo, and the other from Diod. Siculus, in
which it means &#8220;consciousness.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT162</font></sup> This is no doubt
true; but here the identity of meaning is difficult to be made out. See Appendix
I 2. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT163</font></sup>
&#8220;Sanctified,&#8221; here, as in chapter 2:11, includes the idea of
expiation; it is to be sanctified, or cleansed from guilt, rather than from
pollution, because it is said to be by the offering of the body of Christ, which
was especially an expiation for sins, as it appears from what follows; and the
main object of the quotation afterwards made was to show that by his death
remission of sins is obtained.<br>&#8220;By the which will,&#8221; or, by which
will, is commonly taken to mean, &#8220;By the accomplishing of which
will;&#8221; or <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn&lt;</font> may be
taken as in chapter 4:11, in the sense of
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kata&lt;</font>, &#8220;according to
which will we are cleansed (that is, from guilt) through the offering of the
body of Christ once made.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Will&#8221; here does not mean the
act of willing, but the object of the will, that which God wills, approves and
is pleased with, and is set in opposition to the legal sacrifices. And as there
is a <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oiJ</font> in many good copies after
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejsme&lt;n</font>, some have rendered the
verse thus, &#8220;By which will we are cleansed who are cleansed by the
offering of the body of Christ once made.&#8221; Thus &#8220;the will,&#8221; or
what pleased God, is first opposed to the sacrifices, and then identified with
the offering of Christ&#8217;s body. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT164</font></sup> See Appendix K
2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT165</font></sup> &#8220;Now testify to us does
also the Holy Spirit;&#8221; such may be the rendering of the words. The
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">de&lt;</font> is translated
&#8220;And,&#8221; by Macknight, and &#8220;Morever,&#8221; by Stuart, but
&#8220;Now&#8221; seems the most suitable. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT166</font></sup> The quotation as made
here affords a remarkable instance of what Calvin has previously said, that the
Apostles were not very scrupulous in the use of words, but attended to the
meaning. The words have been before quoted in chapter 8:10-12. There we have
&#8220;into their mind &#8212;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kardi&gt;av</font>,&#8221; here,
&#8220;into their minds &#8212;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dianoiw~n</font>;&#8221; and in the
12<sup>th</sup> verse in chapter 8, and the 17<sup>th</sup> in this chapter, are
in words wholly different, though in meaning essentially the same. We need not
wonder then that there is sometimes a variety in quotations made from the Old
Testament, since the Apostle varies in a quotation when given the second time by
himself. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT167</font></sup> This
quotation clearly shows the meaning of the word &#8220;sanctified.&#8221; The
sanctified, or those atoned for, or expiated, were made perfect by having their
sins perfectly and completely forgiven them. The sufficiently of Christ&#8217;s
sacrifice for taking away sins, for a full and complete remission, is the
subject throughout, and not the effect of that sacrifice in the work of
sanctification. The chapter begins with sins as to the conscience; and here the
words of Jeremiah are referred to, not for the purpose of showing that the new
covenant provides for the renovation of the heart, (though it includes that
too.) but of proving that it secures the free and full remission of sins,
procured, as stated before, by the one sacrifice of Christ, once offered and
perpetually efficacious. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT168</font></sup> Macknight makes this
&#8220;entrance&#8221; to be death! As though the Apostle was speaking of what
was future, while in verse 22, with which the contents of this verse and the
following are connected, he says, &#8220;let us draw near;&#8221; that is, we
who have this entrance, even &#8220;the new and living way.&#8221; Possessing
such a privilege, they were to draw nigh. It is clearly an entrance and a way
which believers now possess. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT169</font></sup> See Appendix L
2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT170</font></sup> This true, sincere, or
upright heart, freed from vice and pollution, was symbolized by the washing at
the end of the verse. Without washing the priests were not allowed to minister,
and were threatened with death,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;023019&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 30:19-21; and when
any of them touched an unclean thing, he was not allowed to eat of holy things
until he washed himself, see <font face="Palatino">Le
22:6</font><sup><font color="Maroon">{*}</font></sup>. Washing the body was a
most important thing, as it symbolized the inward washing of the heart, which
alone makes us true, or sincere, or faithful to God.<br>We have here two things
&#8212; a sincere heart, and assurance of faith: the last is then set forth by
sprinkling, a word borrowed for Levitical rites; and the first by the washing of
the body as under the law. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon"> {*}
</font></sup>the text read 12:6, but this appears to be a typesetting
error.<i>-fj.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT171</font></sup>
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Ponhro&lt;v</font> means
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[r</font> in Hebrew, the evil of sin
wicked, and also the effect of sin, miserable It seems to be in the latter sense
here; a miserable conscience is one oppressed with guilt. So Grotius and Stuart
regard the meaning. It is the same as &#8220;consciousness of sin&#8221; in
verse 2. What seems to be meant is an accusing or guilty conscience, laboring
under the pressure of conscious sin. But Doddridge and Scott, like Calvin,
combine the two ideas of guilt and pollution; though washing, afterwards
mentioned, appears more appropriately to refer to the latter; and forgiveness is
what is most commonly connected with the blood of Christ. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT172</font></sup> See Appendix M
2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT173</font></sup> Our version has
&#8220;faith,&#8221; but it should be &#8220;hope,&#8221; as found in almost all
copies. &#8220;Profession of hope&#8221; is a Hebraism for professed hope, or
the hope we profess. He mentioned &#8220;faith&#8221; in the preceding verse,
and now &#8220;hope&#8221; as being its daughter, and as that which especially
sustained them under their trials. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT174</font></sup> The words literally
are, &#8220;And let us observe (or take notice of) one another for the
instigation of love and of good works;&#8221; that is, &#8220;Let us notice the
state and circumstances of each other for the purpose of stimulating love and
acts of kindness and benevolence, its proper fruits.&#8221; Love is the
principle, and good or benevolent works are what it produces.<br>&#8220;And let
us attentively consider one another in order<br>to the quickening of love and
good works.&#8221; &#8212; Macknight.<br>&#8220;Let us moreover attentively
regard one another for the sake<br>of exciting to love and good works.&#8221;
&#8212; Stuart.<br>The idea of emulation seems not to be included in the words.
The meaning of the exhortation is, to take opportunity which circumstances
afforded, to promote love and the exercise of benevolence. As an instance of the
want of love, he notices in the next verse their neglect of meeting together for
divine worship; and by not meeting together they had no opportunity of doing the
good work admonishing and exhorting one another. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT175</font></sup> Another view is
commonly given of the cause of this neglect; it was the dread of persecution,
according to Doddridge; and Scott says, that it was either &#8220;timidity or
lukewarmness.&#8221; As the Apostle had previously mentioned &#8220;love&#8221;
the probability is that the main cause was coldness and indifference; and the
cause of such a neglect is still for the most part the same. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT176</font></sup> &#8220;As ye see
drawing nigh the day;&#8221; so are the words literally. The day of judgment,
say some; the day of Jerusalem&#8217;s destruction, say other. Doddridge
introduces both in his paraphrase; and Scott and Bloomfield regard the day of
judgment as intended; but Stuart is in favor of the opinion that the destruction
of Jerusalem is what is referred to, and so Hammond and Mede.<br>The word
&#8220;day&#8221; is applied to both. The day of judgment is called &#8220;that
day,&#8221; (Jude 6;) and the destruction of Jerusalem is called the Son of
man&#8217;s day, &#8220;his day,&#8221;
(<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421724&gt;</font></sup>Luke 17:24) And both these
days must have been well known to the Hebrews to whom Paul was writing. The
reference, then, might have been well thus made to either without any addition.
But the sentence itself seems to favor the opinion that the day of Jerusalem is
intended; &#8220;as ye see,&#8221; he says; which denotes that there were things
in the circumstances of the times which clearly betokened the approaching ruin
of that city and nation. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT177</font></sup> See Appendix N
2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT178</font></sup> It is
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">puro&lt;v zh~lov</font>, &#8220;heat of
fire;&#8221; which means hot or burning fire; the genitive here, as in some
other instances, is the main subject. See chapter 3:13, note. The language is
still borrowed from the Old Testament: God often destroyed the rebellious among
the Israelites with fire &#8212; a symbol of the dreadful punishment of the
wicked hereafter. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031002&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus 10:2;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;041634&gt;</font></sup>Numbers 16:35. The word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">zh~lov</font> is properly heat, but is
used in a variety of senses; heat of emulation &#8212; &#8220;envy,&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441345&gt;</font></sup>Acts 13:45; &#8212; of
wrath &#8212; &#8220;indignation&#8221; Acts 5:17; &#8212; of concern, good and
bad &#8212; &#8220;zeal,&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451002&gt;</font></sup>Romans 10:2, and
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500306&gt;</font></sup>Philippians 3:6; &#8212; of
suspicion as to love &#8212; &#8220;jealousy,&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471102&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 11:2; &#8212;
and of affection &#8212; &#8220;love,&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471102&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 11:2. It is
the context that determines the character of this heat. Here is has evidently
its literal meaning, as being connected with fire, only the noun is used for the
adjective. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT179</font></sup>
&#8220;Despised&#8221; of our version ought to have been &#8220;rejected,&#8221;
as Calvin renders the word, for the renouncing of the Law is what is meant.
Followed by &#8220;commandment&#8221; in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;410709&gt;</font></sup>Mark 7:9, it is rendered
&#8220;reject,&#8221; and &#8220;cast off&#8221; when followed by
&#8220;faith&#8221; in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540512&gt;</font></sup>1
Timothy 5:12; and &#8220;cast off&#8221; would be very suitable here. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT180</font></sup> Both Doddridge and
Stuart refer to <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;041530&gt;</font></sup>Numbers
15:30, 31, but incorrectly, as there the specific sin of apostasy is not
mentioned, nor is there mention made of witnesses. Besides, it is not the
presumptuous or willful sin there referred to, that is here intended, but the
sin of apostasy, when it is the result of a free choice, without any outward
constraining power as under violent persecution. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT181</font></sup> &#8220;Neither the
king nor the Senate,&#8221; says Grotius, &#8220;had the power to pardon.&#8221;
It is to be observed that God delegated the power to execute apostates to the
rulers of Israel: but we find here that he has under the Gospel resumed that
power and holds it in his own hands; the execution of the vengeance belongs
alone to him, and the punishment will be everlasting perdition. Then to assume
such a power now is a most impious presumption, whether done by civil or
ecclesiastical rulers. To put apostates or heretics to death, receives no
sanction from the Gospel, and is wholly alien to its spirit. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT182</font></sup> The words
&#8220;covenant,&#8221; and &#8220;sanctified,&#8221; and &#8220;unclean&#8221;
or &#8220;unholy,&#8221; are derived from the old dispensation. &#8220;The blood
of the covenant&#8221; was the blood shed on the cross; and the reference to it
is not as sprinkled for the ratifying of the covenant, but as the blood of
atonement, as &#8220;the blood of the New Testament , or rather covenant,
&#8220;shed for many for the remission of sins,&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402628&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 26:28. Then
&#8220;sanctified&#8221; has the same meaning here as in verse 10 and in chapter
2:11, expiated or atoned for; &#8220;by which he has expiated.&#8221; He who
professes the Christian faith, professes to believe in the atoning sacrifice of
Christ, that Christ shed his blood for many for the remission of sins. As to
&#8220;unholy,&#8221; or rather unclean, such was the blood of a malefactor or
impostor, and as such Christ was counted by the Jews and by every Jew who
returned to Judaism. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT183</font></sup> Most strangely does
Schleusner paraphrase this clause, &#8220;contumaciously repudiating the divine
favor.&#8221; The case here contemplated is the same with that in chapter 6:
4-6. The Holy Spirit is there so distinctly mentioned that it is impossible to
turn or change the plain meaning of the passage; and to be &#8220;partakers of
the Holy Spirit&#8221; was no doubt to be in that age. Here he is mentioned only
as the holy Spirit of grace, i.e., the bestower of grace, or it may be taken as
meaning &#8220;the gracious&#8221; or benevolent &#8220;Spirit;&#8221; as
&#8220;God of all grace&#8221; in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600510&gt;</font></sup>1 Peter 5:10, may mean
either the author and giver of every grace, or the most gracious God, though the
former meaning is most consistent with the
context<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT184</font></sup> The quotation is
literally neither from the Hebrew nor from the Sept., but is the same as quoted
in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451219&gt;</font></sup>Romans 12:19; which
seems to show that Paul is the Author of both epistles. The Hebrew is,
&#8220;Mine is vengeance and recompense;&#8221; and the Sept., &#8220;In the day
vengeance will I recompense.&#8221; The sense is the same, though the words are
different. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT184a</font></sup>
The original text referred to Ps 125:3, which seems to be directed more at the
fact that the wicked will not persevere over the righteous, whereas Ps 125:5
refers to the wicked joining the &#8220;workers of iniquity,&#8221; and that
&#8220;peace will be upon Israel&#8221;; neither are quite as explicit as the
commentary in terms of the final destruction of the wicked, but in my humble
opinion, verse 5 has more
relevance.<i>-fj.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT185</font></sup> See
Appendix O 2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT185a</font></sup>  The original
text had Ps 18:27, but because the quote comes partly from the first half of
verse 25, and partly from the last half of verse 26, and is emphasized by verse
27, I decided that all three verses should be referenced.<i>-fj.
</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT186</font></sup> &#8220;A great fight of
affliction,&#8221; is rendered by Doddridge, &#8220;a great contest of
sufferings;&#8221; by Macknight. &#8220;a great combat of afflictions;&#8221;
and by Stuart, &#8220;a great contest with sufferings.&#8221; The last word may
be deemed as the genitive case of the object, &#8220;a great contest as to
sufferings;&#8221; or the word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pollh&lt;n</font>, may be rendered,
&#8220;long contest as to sufferings .&#8221; Doddridge remarks that contest
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpome&gt;w</font> is used to show the
courage displayed. But &#8220;endure,&#8221; is in the case not the proper word,
but &#8220;sustain,&#8221; If &#8220;endure&#8221; be retained, then we must
give its secondary sense to
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">a]qlhsin</font>, toil, labor, struggle;
and so Schleusner does, &#8220;Ye endured the great toil of sufferings,&#8221;
or, a great struggle with sufferings. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT187</font></sup> The words may be
rendered, &#8220;When ye were publicly exposed to reproaches and
afflictions,&#8221; or, to revilings and persecutions. They were reproached with
bad names, or reviled, and also oppressed and persecuted. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT188</font></sup> The latter clause of
this verse is rendered the same as in our version by Beza and Macknight, while
Grotius, Doddridge, Stuart and Bloomfield, give in effect this rendering,
&#8220;when ye became partakers (i.e., in sympathy, and in their losses) with
those who were so treated.&#8221; It signifies, says Grotius, that they
sympathized with their brethren in their calamities, and also succored them as
far as they could by praying for them, and administering to their wants. In
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402330&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 23:30,
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">koinwnoi&lt; aujtw~n</font> is rendered,
&#8220;partakers with them,&#8221; or sharers with them; and so it might be
rendered here, &#8220;sharers with those who were so treated,&#8221; i.e.,
sharers in reproach and suffering. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT189</font></sup> The preceding clause
is literally &#8220;For ye sympathized with my bonds.&#8221; There is a
different reading, &#8220;For ye sympathized with the prisoners &#8212;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">desmi&gt;oiv</font>. The authority as to
MSS. is nearly equal; and there is nothing decisive in the context. A similar
phrase is in chapter 4:15. &#8220;who cannot sympathize with our
infirmities.&#8221; Grotius, Hammond and Stuart, are in the text as it is, and
also Bishop Jebb, and Bloomfield.<br>There is here a clear instance of an
inverted order as to the subjects previously mentioned which often occur in the
Prophets, and in other parts of Scripture. The last subject in the previous
verse is here first referred to, and then the first. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT190</font></sup> Calvin leaves out
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn eJautoi~v</font>, as the Vulg. does.
The <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn</font> is deemed by most
spurious, but most retain
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eJautoi~v</font>, though they do not
connect it as in our version, with &#8220;knowing,&#8221; and render the clause
thus, &#8220;knowing that you have for yourselves in heaven a better and an
enduring substance,&#8221; or property or possession. The word for
&#8220;substance&#8221; occurs only here, except in the plural number in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440245&gt;</font></sup>Acts 2:45. It occurs often
in the Sept., and stands for words in Hebrew, which signify substance, wealth,
riches, possessions. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT191</font></sup> Or, &#8220;patient
waiting,&#8221; as rendered by Erasmus and Stuart, and not
&#8220;perseverance,&#8221; as rendered by Macknight. They were to suffer
patiently their trials, looking forward to their termination; and in order to
encourage them patiently to endure, he reminds them in the next verse that it
will only be for a very short time. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT192</font></sup> It is evident from
the manner in which the quotation is made, that the Apostle meant only to adapt
to his own purpose the passage in Habakkuk; he does not quote it in the order in
which it is found there, nor literally from the Hebrew, nor wholly so from the
Sept. What is said in Habakkuk of the vision, he applies here to the Lord.
Surely, such a use of a passage is legitimate.<br>The coming of Christ mentioned
here, according to Mede, was his coming to destroy Jerusalem, and to put an end
to the Jewish polity. If &#8220;the approaching day,&#8221; in verse 25, be
considered to be that event then the same event is most probably referred to
here. Besides, he speaks here of the enmity of the unbelieving Jews; and as our
Savior represented the destruction of Jerusalem as a blessing to his people, it
becomes still more probable that Christ&#8217;s coming to destroy that nation is
intended. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT192a</font></sup>
The Book has Ro 1:7, &#8212; an obvious typesetting
error.<i>-fj.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT193</font></sup> This verse,
with the exception of the two clauses being inverted, and of my being not added
to &#8220;faith,&#8221; is literally the same with the Sept. But the last clause
here and the first in Habakkuk, differs in words materially from the Hebrew,
according to the received text. There are two MSS. which give
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hpl[</font> instead of
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hlp[</font>, a transposition of two
letters. If not exactly in words. The Hebrew, then, would be as follows &#8212;
<br>Behold the fainting! Not right is his soul within him;<br>But the
righteousness by his faith shall he live.<br>The fainting i.e., as to faith and
he who &#8220;draws back,&#8221; or withdraws through fear, as the verb means,
are descriptive of the same character. To persevere in expecting the fulfillment
of a promise, is the subject in Habakkuk and also in this passage. And then,
that the soul of the fainting is not right, is the same as to say that such a
soul is not what God approves.<br>A theological dispute has arisen, though
unnecessarily, from the construction of the last clause in this verse. The
introduction of &#8220;any one,&#8221; or any man, has been objected to, and
that it ought to be &#8220;but if he,&#8221; i.e., &#8220;the
righteousness&#8221; draw back, etc. The probability is, that as
&#8220;anyone&#8221; should not be ascribed to Beza, for Pagininus and others
had done so before him. However, the doctrine of perseverance is in no way
imperiled by leaving out &#8220;any one.&#8221; The Bible is full of this mode
of addressing Christians, and yet the Bible assures us that the sheep of Christ
shall never perish. Warnings and admonitions are the very means which God
employs to secure the final salvation of his people; and to conclude from such
warnings that they may finally fall away, is by no means a legitimate argument.

makes the division at the thirty-eighth verse of the last chapter, and this is
no doubt what the subject requires. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT195</font></sup> &#8220;Faith is here
generally described, not only as it justifies, but also as it acts towards God
and lays hold on his promises, works, and blessings revealed in his word, past,
present, and future." &#8212;
<i>Pareus.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT195a</font></sup> The two words
&#8220;substance&#8221; and &#8220;evidence&#8221; have been variously rendered,
though the meaning continues materially the same: &#8220;substinance&#8221; and
&#8220;demonstration&#8221; by Beza: &#8220;confident expectation&#8221; and
&#8220;conviction&#8221; by Grotius and Doddridge: &#8220;confidence&#8221; and
&#8220;evidence&#8221; by Macknight: &#8220;confidence&#8221; and
&#8220;convincing evidence&#8221; by Stuart. When the primary meaning of words
is suitable, there is no necessity of having recourse to what is secondary. The
first word means properly a foundation, a basis, a prop, a support: and what can
be more appropriate here? Faith is the basis or the prop (as Calvin renders it
in his exposition) of things hoped for; that is, faith is the foundation of
hope; it is the fulcrum on which hope rests. The other word is properly
&#8220;demonstration&#8221; a proof supported by reasons &#8212; what is made
clear and evident. Conviction is the result of demonstration. So, then, the
meaning is this &#8212; faith sustains hope, and exhibits to view things unseen:
it is the basis on which the objects of hope rest, and the demonstration or
manifestation of what is not seen.<br>The word &#8220;substance&#8221; is
derived from the Vulgate: though its etymological meaning corresponds with the
original, yet its received meaning is quite different. The original word occurs
five times in the New Testament, and is rendered &#8220; confidence&#8221; in 2
Corinthians 9:4, 11:17;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580314&gt;</font></sup>Hebrews 3:14, &#8212;
&#8220;person&#8221; in Hebrew 1:3, &#8212; and here &#8220;substance;&#8221;
but why not its more literal meaning, &#8220;foundation?&#8221;<br>The things
&#8220;hoped for&#8221; include the promises; but the things &#8220;not
seen,&#8221; all that is revealed as to what is past and is to come, &#8212; the
creation, the future destiny of man, etc. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT196</font></sup> Macknight and Stuart
render the word &#8220;ancients&#8221; and more suitably in our language. The
word &#8220;elders&#8221; most commonly refers to age, but
&#8220;ancients&#8221; to time: those meant here were such as lived before and
under the Law. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT197</font></sup> The verb rendered in
our version &#8220;obtained a good report,&#8221; is rendered by Calvin,
&#8220;obtained a testimony;&#8221; by Beza, &#8220;were approved;&#8221; by
Macknight &#8220;were born witness to;&#8221; and Stuart, &#8221;obtained
commendation&#8221;. It is better to retain the idea of a testimony, as a
reference is made either to the written testimony of Scripture, or to some
express testimony given by God, as in the case of Abel. As the verb is
everywhere used in a good sense, as referring to a good testimony, &#8220;the
good report&#8221; of our version, or &#8220;the honorable testimony&#8221; of
Doddridge, seems to convey the right meaning. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT198</font></sup> That is &#8220;We, by
faith in God&#8217;s word which gives the record, understand, or know how the
world was made.&#8221; This the heathens did not know by the light of reason,
and yet they might have known this, as the Apostle declares in
<font face="Palatino">Romans 1:20</font>. The reference here, according to this
view, is to the fact, to the case as it was, but in the Romans to what ought to
have been the case.<br>Why &#8220;worlds?&#8221; the same word, though in the
plural number is rendered &#8220;world&#8221; in <font face="Palatino">verse
36</font> and <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461011&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians
10:11, and so here by Beza and others. The universe, the whole visible creation,
is what is meant, as it appears from &#8220;seen&#8221; in the next clause: and
the word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aijw&lt;n</font>, in the
singular number, says Stuart, is not employed to designate the
&#8220;world&#8221; that is the universe. It is said to be used plurally to
express the various parts of which the world is composed. But the term
&#8220;world&#8221; in our language comprehends the whole: it means the whole
visible creation.<br>The verb &#8220;framed,&#8221; is rendered
&#8220;compacted&#8221; by Beza &#8212; &#8220;adjusted&#8221; by Doddridge
&#8212; &#8220;produced&#8221; by Macknight &#8212; and &#8220;formed&#8221; by
Stuart. Calvin has &#8220;fitted&#8221; or joined together, aptata, the word
used by the Vulgate. It is justly said by Leigh, that the verb properly means to
compact or knit together disjointed parts, either of a body or a building. But
it is used also in the sense of adjusting, fitting, preparing, setting in order,
and perfecting, or completing. It is most commonly used in the sense of making
perfect or complete. But we may render the words &#8220;the world was set in
order by the word of God.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT199</font></sup> Moderns no less than
the ancients differ from Calvin as to this clause; and yet his explanation is
more suited to the passage, and especially to
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv to&lt;</font> which means properly,
to the end that, or, in order to, denoting the object or final cause. But there
is no authority for making <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejk</font> and
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">fainome&gt;nwn</font> one word as he
proposes: yet if the transposition of
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mh&lt;</font> be admitted, which both
ancient and modern critics allow, the meaning advocated by Calvin may still be
defended: &#8220;in order that of things not apparent there might be things
visible;&#8221; the things not apparent or visible being the power, wisdom and
goodness of God, in exact harmony with
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450120&gt;</font></sup>Romans 1:20, where
God&#8217;s power and divinity are said to be &#8220;invisible things&#8221;
&#8212; <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ta&lt; ajo&gt;rata</font>: they
are things not apparent.<br>Again, the verb
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kathrti&gt;sqai</font> denotes not
creation, but the fitting or adjusting, or setting in order of things previously
created: it seems to designate the work done, not as described in the first
verse of Genesis, but in the following verses: so that the object or design of
this adjustment or arrangement is what is expressed in this clause; it was, that
there might be visible things as evidence or manifestations of things
invisible.<br>It may be further said, that the world is said to have been set in
order by the word of God: and so it is recorded in Genesis: but this word or
fiat is not mentioned in the first verse of that book, in which the heavens and
the earth are said to have been created. It hence appears that the reference
here is to the setting in order of this world, and not to the first creation of
its materials; and if so, the second clause cannot refer to the creation of the
world out of nothing, as it is necessarily connected with what the first clause
contains.<br>&#8220;Faith&#8221; then refers here, if this view must be taken,
not to the fact that the world was made by God, which even heathens admitted,
but to the design of God in creation, the manifestation of his own glory.
&#8220;The heavens,&#8221; says the Psalmist &#8220;declare the glory of
God,&#8221; etc. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT200</font></sup> &#8220;Abel&#8217;s
offering was more acceptable than that of Cain, because he had faith.&#8221;
&#8212; Grotius.<br>The word &#8220;sacrifice,&#8221;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">qusi&gt;a</font>, means properly an
offered victim, but sometimes anything offered to God. Indeed Abel&#8217;s
sacrifice is called in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010404&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 4:4, an offering.
The word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">plei&gt;wn</font> is literally
more, but is used in the sense of more in number, quantity or excellency . The
last is evidently the meaning here; for Abel&#8217;s offering, according to the
account given, was not in the number or quantity, but in quality. Then a better
or a more excellent sacrifice, and not a fuller, as some have rendered it, is
the right version. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT201</font></sup> What the Apostle
evidently refers to are these words, &#8220;the Lord had respect to Abel and to
his offering.&#8221; He calls this &#8220;testifying.&#8221; How this was done,
we are not told. The divine approbation was in some way conveyed; there was
respect had to Abel and to his offering, but not to Cain nor to his offering.
The Apostle says here first, that Abel &#8220;obtained a testimony that he was
righteous,&#8221; and then he adds by way of explanation: God testifying of his
gifts. It seems then that the approbation of his gifts was the testimony he
received that he was righteous, this was evidently the meaning of the Apostle.
Now the question is, how was this testimony as to that sacrifice. What was it?
Such, we may reasonably conclude as was given in other recorded instances; it
was by fire sent from heaven to consume the sacrifice. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;030924&gt;</font></sup>Leviticus 9:24;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;111838&gt;</font></sup>1 Kings 18:38;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;140701&gt;</font></sup>2 Chronicles
7:1.<br>&#8220;By which,&#8221; and &#8220;by it,&#8221; are commonly referred
to faith, but the passage would be plainer, by referring them to &#8220;the
sacrifice.&#8221; It was by the means or medium of the sacrifice, that the
testimony was given, and it was on the account of it that Abel was put to death;
&#8220;and through it, having died, he yet speaketh;&#8221; that is, though he
died, owing to his sacrifice being approved , he yet speaketh, that is, by his
example as a believer, say some, in the atonement; as a sufferer in behalf of
the truth, say others. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT202</font></sup> Though this view has
been taken by Grotius and many others, yet the one suggested above is what has
been mostly adopted. It is Abel himself who here speaks as a man of faith; it is
the voice of his blood that is referred to in chapter 12:24. Instead of the
received reading, the preponderance of copies is in favor of
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">lalei~</font> &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT203</font></sup> &#8220;He reasons
thus: &#8212; He who pleases God is endued with faith; Enoch pleased God; then
Enoch was endued with faith.&#8221; &#8212; J.
Capellus.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT204</font></sup> It is the Sept. that
is followed by the Apostle. Instead of &#8220;he walked with God,&#8221; we have
here, &#8220;he pleased God;&#8221; and for, &#8220;he was not,&#8221; the
phrase is &#8220;he was not found.&#8221; One part of the verse is nearly a
literal quotation, &#8220;and he was not found, because God had translated
him;&#8221; and this ought to be put parenthetically, for what follows is
connected with the first clause, as it contains a reason for what is there
asserted; Enoch was through faith translated, for he had a testimony that he
pleased God; and to please God is an evidence of faith, as proved by the
following verse.<br>Strange are the vagaries of learned men! Some of the German
divines have attempted to prove that Enoch was not translated without dying.
Though no words can express the event more clearly than those of the Apostle.
This is an instance of what men will do to support a false system, when once
fully imbibed. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT205</font></sup> To &#8220;come to
God,&#8221; is very expressive, and is literally the word. To &#8220;approach
to&#8221; by Doddridge, and &#8220;to worship,&#8221; by Macknight, are no
improvements, but otherwise. God is represented as sitting on the throne of
grace; hence the idea of coming to him. Enoch walked with God, as though God was
a friend and a companion; hence to come to him is the appropriate expression.
Stuart says, that it is a metaphor derived from the practice of coming to the
temple to worship, God being represented as there present. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT206</font></sup> &#8220;Certainly
there is no true faith in the doctrine of salvation, unless it be attended with
this magnetic force, by which it draws the soul to God.&#8221; &#8212; Archb.
Leighton<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT207</font></sup> Calvin does not connect
&#8220;diligently&#8221; with seeking, as in our version. Merely to seek, is
what the verb means. It is rendered in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441517&gt;</font></sup>Acts 15:17, &#8220;to seek
after,&#8221; and so in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450311&gt;</font></sup>Romans 3:11, and carefully
is added to it on chapter 12:17. It is found often in the Sept. in the sense of
seeking, and stands for a verb in Hebrew, which means simply to seek. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;050429&gt;</font></sup>Deuteronomy 4:29;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191402&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 14:2;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242913&gt;</font></sup>Jeremiah 29:13.
Stuart&#8217;s version is, &#8220;Who seek him?&#8221; and so is Beza&#8217;s
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT208</font></sup> This is a
very clear statement of the case of Noah. Many learned critics have given a
different view, among moderns, Stuart and Dr. Bloomfield. The word rendered very
correctly in our version, &#8220;being moved with fear,&#8221; they have
rendered &#8220;with reverence&#8221; connecting it with &#8220;prepared.&#8221;
The only other instance in which it occurs, it has the meaning of fear or dread,
as to the consequences : see
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442310&gt;</font></sup>Acts 23:10. Besides, the
whole tenor of the passage comports with this meaning: what was the warning? It
was that of a dreadful judgment; and how is judgment to be regarded, but with
fear? Faith, as Calvin will tell us presently, regards judgments as well as
promises. Men are exhorted to flee from the wrath to come: when they believe
that there is a wrath to come, do not they fear? Doddridge and Scott coincide
with Calvin.<br>The other difference is, as to
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dij h+v</font>, &#8220;by which,&#8221;
before &#8220;condemned.&#8221; This is not so manifestly wrong as the other,
yet the meaning which Calvin gives is the most obvious, and the most suitable.
Stuart refers &#8220;which&#8221; to faith, while it ought evidently to be
referred to the ark; Noah by building the ark which he did by faith, condemned
the conduct of others in neglecting to provide for the coming destruction. His
preparation, done by faith, condemned their neglect, which was owing to
unbelief.<br>As to the word &#8220;heir,&#8221; it means an heir in prospect,
and an heir in possession, as in chapter 1:2. So it is evidently to be
understood here. Noah became heir or possessor of the righteousness, which is by
faith. The rendering of Stuart is nothing so expressive as the literal,
&#8220;and obtained the justification which is by faith.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT209</font></sup> This is differently
connected by Calvin, his version is &#8220;by faith Abraham, when he was called,
obeyed, so that he went forth,&#8221; etc. Bloomfield by supposing
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">wste</font> understood before
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejxelqei~n</font>, seems to be of the
same opinion. Beza renders the verb by a gerund, &#8220;abiendo,&#8221; by
departing. This construction is more agreeable to the location of the words; the
other introduces an unnatural transposition. Besides, the idea is somewhat
different. There are thus two things in the verse stated more directly, as
evidences and proofs of faith, &#8212; his departure from his own country, and
his ignorance as to the country where he was going. His faith was such that he
obeyed, so as to leave his own country, and also to go to a country, of which he
knew nothing. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT210</font></sup>
The preposition <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">meta&lt;</font> may often
be rendered &#8220;as well as.&#8221; See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400203&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 2:3;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421107&gt;</font></sup>Luke 11:7,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461611&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 16:11;
&#8220;dwelling in tents, as well as Isaac and Jacob, co-heirs to the same
promise.&#8221; It means not here the same time, says Grotius, but parity as to
what is stated. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT211</font></sup> The words,
&#8220;builder and maker,&#8221; are rendered by Calvin, &#8220;master builder
and maker.&#8221; The terms seem reversed. The first word means the maker or
worker; and the second, the master-builder or planner. Beza&#8217;s version is,
&#8220;the maker, (artifex) and the founder, (conditor).&#8221; The order is,
according to what is very common in Scripture, the effect mentioned first, then
the cause, of the maker first, then the contriver. The last word, no doubt used
in the sense of a worker or maker, but also in the sense of an architect or
planner; but the former word means a skillful worker or artificer, but not a
master-builder. In order, therefore, to give a sistant meaning to each, the
sentence is to be thus rendered, &#8212; &#8220;Whose maker and planner is
God;&#8221; he not only made it, but also planned and contrived it. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT212</font></sup> &#8220;The same thing
is affirmed of Abraham,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011717&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 17:17. The truth is
the first annunciation, that a child would spring from them, occasioned both in
his and Sarah&#8217;s mind a feeling of incongruity, of impossibility, that the
course of nature should be so reversed. Subsequent consideration brought both to
a full belief in the reality of the promised blessing.&#8221; &#8212;
Stuart.<br>It is remarkable, that at the first announcement Abraham laughed, as
Sarah did afterward; and not only so, but he also said, &#8220;O that Ishmael
might live before thee!&#8221; evidently showing that he did not then believe
the promise which had been made to him. In the following chapter, the
18<sup>th</sup>, the promise is repeated, when Sarah laughed. And in order to
confirm them both, they were reminded of God&#8217;s power, verse 14. Then faith
overcame unbelief. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT213</font></sup> Calvin renders
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tau~ta</font> adverbially
&#8220;quidem,&#8221; &#8220;and indeed dead;&#8221; Doddridge &#8220;in his
repeat;&#8221; Macknight, &#8220;to these matters;&#8221; Stuart &#8220;as to
these things.&#8221; But the word is rendered in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420623&gt;</font></sup>Luke 6:23, &#8220;in the
like manner;&#8221; and this would be the best rendering here. Abraham was like
Sarah, &#8220;dead&#8221; as to the power of begetting children, &#8212;
&#8220;Therefore even from one, and him in a like manner dead, there sprang so
many as the stars,&#8221; etc. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT214</font></sup> Griesbach and most
critics consider <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kai&lt;
peisqe&gt;ntev</font> as not genuine, and therefore exclude it from the text.
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT215</font></sup> &#8220;These
all&#8221; must be limited to Abraham, and those mentioned after him, for to
them the promises had been made; and he speaks only of such. So Beza and Stuart.
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT216</font></sup> Mention is
made of &#8220;promises;&#8221; and then &#8220;heavenly country&#8221; is the
only thing afterwards specified. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob had received many
promises which were not fulfilled to them &#8212; a numerous seed, the land of
Canaan, the Messiah, the resurrection (implied in the promise of being their
God) and the heavenly country. There is no reason why all these should not form
the &#8220;promises&#8221; which they saw afar and embraced, though the promise
of the heavenly country is alone afterwards, expressly mentioned, it being as it
were the completion of all the other promises, and suitably referred to after
the acknowledgment they made of being strangers and sojourners on the earth.
Their faith embraced all the promises, while it had a especial reference to the
eternal inheritance, which though they entered into rest, as to their spirits,
they have not yet attained, and which shall not be attained either by them, or
by us, until Christ&#8217;s second coming, when we shall together be introduced
into the heavenly country. See a Note on the 39<sup>th</sup> and 40<sup>th</sup>
verses. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT217</font></sup>
&#8220;But now they desire,&#8221; etc. The historical present is used here
instead of the past tense &#8212; &#8220;But now they desired, etc.&#8221; So
Beza, Grotius, and others. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT218</font></sup> The words literally
are &#8220;In Isaac shall be called to thee a seed.&#8221; But the Hebrew
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font> and the Greek
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn</font>, mean often by or through, or
by the means of: and the Hebrew verb, to be called, as well as the Greek, may
sometimes be rendered to be. Hence Macknight seems to have been right in his
version of the clause, &#8220;By Isaac a seed shall be thee;&#8221; which is
better than that of Stuart, &#8220;After Isaac shall thy seed be named,&#8221;
for this is less literal, and the meaning is not conveyed. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT219</font></sup> The meaning given by
Stuart and some others is very far fetched, though said to be natural, that
&#8220;Abraham believed that God could raise Isaac from the dead, because he
had, as it were, obtained him from the dead, i.e., he was born of those who were
dead as to these things.&#8221; Hence the rendering given is
&#8220;comparatively.&#8221; Abraham had, as to his purpose, sacrificed him, so
that he considered him as dead; and he received him back from the dead, not
really, but in a way bearing a likeness to such a miracle. This sense is alone
compatible with the former clause, which mentions Abraham&#8217;s faith in
God&#8217;s power to raise his son from the dead; he believed that God was able
to do this; and then it is added that Abraham had received back his son as
though he had sacrificed him, and as though God had raised him from the dead.
What actually took place bore a likeness to the way which he had anticipated.
Costallio gives the meaning, &#8220;it was the same as though he had sacrificed
him, and received him also in a manner he received him.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT220</font></sup> Various have been the
opinions on this clause. It is clear that the words here refer to a time
different from that mentioned in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;014731&gt;</font></sup>Genesis 47:31. They are
connected in Genesis with the oath which Joseph made to his father to bury him
in Canaan; but here with the blessing of his sons recorded in the following
chapter, 48:15, 16. These were two separate transactions, and the words only
occur in the first; and it seems from the words of the Apostle, that the act and
position of Jacob were also the same in the second instance.	<br>The points are
of no authority; and the Apostle adopted the Septuagint version, and thus
sanctioned it: and there is no reason to dispute that sanction. David is said to
worship upon his bed, (<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;110147&gt;</font></sup>1
Kings 1:47;) but the word for bed there is different. All the difficulty here
vanishes, if we throw aside as we ought to do, the points. The word for worship
in Hebrew means to prostrate one&#8217;s self on the ground, the humblest mode
of adoration; but it is used also to designate merely an act of worship. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;090103&gt;</font></sup>1 Samuel 1:3;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;120505&gt;</font></sup>2 Kings 5:5, 18. The reason
why Jacob is said to have worshipped unable to adopt the usual posture. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT221</font></sup> Literally it is
&#8220;when he became great,&#8221; that is, in age or in years: he was, as it
appears from <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440723&gt;</font></sup>Acts 7:23,
about forty years of age. The word &#8220;great,&#8221; both in Hebrew and
Greek, has sometimes this meaning. &#8220;When arrived at mature age,&#8221; by
Stuart, is better than &#8220;when he was grown up,&#8221; by Doddridge and
Macknight.<br>It is said that he refused, that is by his conduct. He acted in
such a way as to show that he rejected the honor of being adopted son of
Pharoah&#8217;s daughter. The verb means to deny, to renounce, to disown. He
renounced the privilege offered to him. Others are said to &#8220;deny the
power&#8221; of godliness, that is by their works.
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550305&gt;</font></sup>2 Timothy 3:5. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT222</font></sup> This clause is
rendered by Doddridge, &#8220;than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of
sin:&#8221; by Macknight, &#8220;than to have the temporary fruition of
sin,&#8221; which is literal rendering; so Beza. Schleusner thinks the
&#8220;sin&#8221; to have been that of idolatry: but the words seem rather to
refer to the sin of indulgence in vain and demoralizing pursuits, too commonly
prevalent in royal courts.&#8212;
<i>Ed</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT223</font></sup> The &#8220;The
reproach of Christ&#8221; is differently understood: &#8212;<br>The reproach of
the anointed, that is the people of Israel, called God&#8217;s anointed,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A515&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 105:15;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580313&gt;</font></sup>Hebrews 3:13. &#8212;
Grotius.<br>The reproach like that of Christ: as Christ, though rich, became
poor to redeem mankind, so Moses despised the treasures of Egypt, for the
purpose of delivering Israel from bondage. A similar construction is found in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470105&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 1:5.
&#8220;The sufferings of Christ,&#8221; that is, like those of Christ. &#8212;
Stuart.<br>The reproach for Christ, that is, for avowing his expectation of him
in common with the distressed people. Macknight, Scott, Bloomfield. For this
opinion there is not a particle of evidence from the account we have in Exodus.
The Egyptians knew nothing of the redeemer; they therefore could not have
reproached the Israelites on his account.<br>The reproach of Christ&#8217;s
people, the word Christ being sometimes taken for his Church,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461212&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 12:12; and
this seems to be the view of Calvin.<br>The second view is the most
satisfactory, and is confirmed by chapter 13:13, &#8220;bearing his
reproach,&#8221; that is, a reproach like his. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT224</font></sup> The words are very
striking, &#8220;For he looked away,&#8221; that is, from difficulties or
present trials, &#8220;unto the retribution,&#8221; the rendering of the
recompose. What was the retribution? It was what corresponded with what he did
by faith: he engaged by faith in the work of delivering his brethren from
bondage. His retribution in this work was, no doubt, then undertaking for his
own nation. What his faith in God&#8217;s promise enabled him to look to, was
the deliverance of his people, which was to be his retribution. In this respect
he acted, though in a business infinitely inferior, on the same principle with
the Savior, &#8220;who for the joy (of redeeming mankind) that was set before
him, endured the cross,&#8221; etc. Chapter 12:2 &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT225</font></sup> It is said that he
&#8220;endured,&#8221; rather persevered; for the reference is not to
sufferings, but to trials and difficulties: he was made strong by faith in an
invisible God to resist and surmount them all. &#8220;He was
strengthened,&#8221; Doddridge; &#8220;he courageously persevered,&#8221;
Macknight; &#8220;he continued steadfast,&#8221; Stuart. The word is only found
here. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT226</font></sup> Some
render the words, &#8220;by faith he instituted the Passover.&#8221; The verb is
properly to make, but like
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h&ccedil;[</font> in Hebrew, it is used
in a variety of senses. Doddridge has &#8220;celebrated;&#8221; Macknight,
&#8220;appointed;&#8221; and Stuart, &#8220;observed.&#8221; To make the
Passover is, no doubt, to keep or observe it; for such is the meaning of the
phrase, as it appears from Numbers 9: 10, 11. The word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pa&gt;sca</font> is doubtless a Syriac
term, and derived originally from the Hebrew
<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hsp</font> which means to pass over;
though several of the Greek fathers derived it from
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pa&gt;scein</font>, to suffer. It
sometimes means the paschal feast,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422211&gt;</font></sup>Luke 22:11, and sometimes
the paschal Lamb, <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;411412&gt;</font></sup>Mark
14:12; <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460507&gt;</font></sup>1 Corinthians 5:7
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT227</font></sup> And it has
been adopted by many of the German divines, who seem in many instances to follow
any vagary, Rabbinical or heathen, rather than the word of God. There is nothing
in Scripture that countenances this notion. The word is never used in the sense
of a hostess: and the ancient versions ever render the Hebrew word by
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">po&gt;rnh</font>, a harlot. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT228</font></sup> The history of Gideon
we have in Judges 6:11, to the end of the 8<sup>th</sup> chapter: of Barak, in
Judges 4:6, to the end of the 5<sup>th</sup>: of Samson, in Judges 13:24, to the
end of the 16<sup>th</sup>: and of Jephthah, in Judges 11:1, to the end of the
12<sup>th</sup> chapter. Thus we see that the order of time in which they lived
is not here observed, it being not necessary for the object of the Apostle.
Barak was before Gideon, Jephthah before Samson, and Samuel before David.
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT229</font></sup> The previous
sentence, &#8220;wrought righteousness,&#8221; is differently understood. Some
refer it to a righteous and upright course of life, and others to the conduct of
rulers and judges. The latter is the most suitable meaning here; and the words
may be rendered &#8220;executed justice.&#8221; Samuel was an example of
this.<br>To &#8220;obtain promises&#8221; is to receive the things promised.
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT230</font></sup> The
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tu&gt;mpanon</font> was, according to
Schleusner, a machine on which the body was stretched; and then cudgels or rods,
and whips were used. This appears from the account given in 2 Macc. 6: 19, 30.
It is said that Eleasar, rather than transgress the Law, went of his own accord
&#8220;to the torment&#8221; &#8212;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpi&lt; to&lt; tu&gt;mpanon</font>, and
in the 30<sup>th</sup> verse mention is made of stripes or strokes &#8212;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">plhgai~v</font>, and of being lashed or
whipped &#8212; <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mastigou&gt;menov</font>.
This was to be tympanized or tortured. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT231</font></sup> This conjecture not
countenanced by any MSS. that are considered to have much weight. What has led
to this conjecture has evidently been a misunderstanding as to the import of the
word in this connection. Being a word of general import, it has been viewed as
inappropriate here among words of specified meaning: it refers to the temptation
or trial to which those who were condemned for their religion were commonly
exposed &#8212; the offer of life and of favors and recantation: that seems to
have been the special temptation here intended. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT232</font></sup> The verse concludes
with these words &#8220;that they might obtain a better resurrection,&#8221;
&#8212; better than what? Better than the resurrection referred to at the
beginning of the verse, when it is said that &#8220;women received their dead
raised to life again;&#8221; or better than the life promised by persecutors to
those doomed to die, in case they renounced their religion. The former is the
view taken by Scott and Stuart, and the latter by Doddridge: but as deliverance
and no deliverance are facts in contrast, the first is the most obvious
meaning.&#8212;<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT233</font></sup> The
conclusion of the 37<sup>th</sup> verse is, &#8220;being destitute, afflicted,
tormented:&#8221; this is said of those who &#8220;wandered about in sheep skins
and goat skins.&#8221; They were destitute, they had been oppressed or
persecuted and unjustly dealt with. Wrong treatment and oppression or
persecution drove them from there homes and destitution followed. This is the
way in which things are often stated in Scripture; the effect or the present
state first, and then the cause or what led to it. The words are rendered
&#8220;destitute, afflicted, maltreated,&#8221; by Macknight, &#8212; and
&#8220;suffering want, afflicted, injuriously treated,&#8221; by Stuart. The
second word often means oppression or persecution. The third word is found only
here and chapter 13:2 where it is rendered &#8220;suffer adversity.&#8221; It is
found in the Sept., in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;110226&gt;</font></sup>1
Kings 2:26, twice and 11:39. It is used by Aqula in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022222&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 22:22, and in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;183723&gt;</font></sup>Job 37:23. Its meaning
properly is, to be ill or wrongfully treated. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT235</font></sup> This is materially
the view taken by Beza, Doddridge, Scott and Stuart. The &#8220;promise&#8221;
is deemed to be especially that of Christ. The ancients heard of him, believed
in his coming, but did not witness it. The &#8220;some better thing&#8221; is
considered to be the same with the promise, or to be the Gospel as revealed, or
in the words of Stuart, &#8220;the actual fulfillment of the promise respecting
the Messiah.&#8221;<br>Still there is something unsatisfactory in this view as
to &#8220;the promise,&#8221; as Stuart seems to intimate. There are two verses,
chapter 10:36, and 9:15, which seem to throw light on this subject: by the first
we find that &#8220;the promise&#8221; is future to us as well as to the ancient
saints; and by the second, that &#8220;the better thing&#8221; is the atoning
death of Christ, which was to the ancient saints an unfulfilled event, but to us
fulfilled and clearly revealed, and yet its benefits extended to them as well as
to us.<br>The &#8220;promise&#8221; throughout this Epistle is that of
&#8220;the eternal inheritance&#8221; and &#8220;the promises&#8221; in verse 13
include this and others, and especially &#8220;the better things,&#8221; that is
the Gospel, or fulfillment of what was necessary to attain the inheritance, even
the death and resurrection of Christ; or we may say that it is &#8220;the better
hope,&#8221; (chapter 7:19) or the &#8220;better covenant, which was established
on better promises,&#8221; (chapter 8:6.) The verses may be thus rendered
&#8212; <br>&#8220;And all these, having obtained a good report through faith,
have not received the promise: 40. God having foreordained as to us something
more excellent, so that they without us might not be perfected;&#8221; that is,
in body as well as in soul.<br>The sentiment seems to be this, &#8212;
&#8220;the ancient saints believed God&#8217;s promise, respecting an eternal
inheritance after the resurrection: they died in hope of this , they have not
yet obtained it, and for this reason, because God had designed to fulfill to us
what he had also promised to them, even the coming of a Redeemer; it is
necessary that this more excellent thing than what had in this world been
vouchsafed to them, should take place, as on it depended everything connected
with the promise of the &#8216;heavenly city:&#8217; so that without the more
excellent thing fulfilled to us, their perfect state, in body as well as in
soul, was not to be attained.&#8221;<br>Their souls are perfect, for we as
Christians are said to have come &#8220;to the spirits of just men made
perfect,&#8221; (chapter 12:23;) they who die in the Lord are said to
&#8220;rest from their labors,&#8221; and are pronounced  blessed  or happy.
(Rev. 14:13.) But they are not in possession of the inheritance promised them,
neither the ancients nor those who now die in the Lord.The promise as to both
will not be fulfilled until the glorious day of the resurrection. Then all the
saints, whether before or after the coming of Christ, will at the same time,
with pure and immortal bodies, united to pure spirits, be together introduced
into their eternal inheritance which he promised to Abraham and his seed, when
he said that he would be their God. Christ referred to that declaration as an
evidence of the resurrection. (Luke 20:37.) Then the Patriarchs believed that
there would be a resurrection. &#8212;
<i>Ed.</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT236</font></sup> A cloud for a large

sin,&#8221; or contending or fighting against sin, &#8212; the sin of apostasy,
says Grotius, &#8212; the sin of their persecutors, say Macknight and Stuart,
sin being considered here as standing for sinners, the abstract for the
concrete. The Apostle says, that they had not yet resisted &#8212; resisted
what? This he seems to explain by saying, &#8220;contending against sin.&#8221;
It was then, the assault of sin that they had not yet resisted unto blood; and
that sin was evidently apostasy, the sin plausibly presented to them, or ready
to encompass and entangle them, mentioned in the first verse.<br>The phraseology
here is similar to what is in the preceding verse; a participle ends the
sentence, and that qualifies the foregoing verb &#8212; &#8220;that ye may not
become wearied, being faint in your souls.&#8221; Faintness or despondency in
mind would inevitably be accompanied with weariness. Faith or strength of mind
is necessary to prevent fatigue or weariness while engaged in contests and great
trials; and as a preventive of despondency, we are directed attentively to
consider how our savior bore the extreme trials which he had to endure. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT240</font></sup>
&#8220;Correction&#8221; is the best word for

<font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rswm</font> and not
&#8220;chastening&#8221; or chastisement. &#8220;Despise&#8221; in Hebrew is to
regard a thing as trifling or with contempt, and so in Greek it means to regard
a thing as little; the meaning is, not stoical; and then the meaning of the next
clause is, be not depending. &#8220;Fret not,&#8221; or &#8220;be not
faint&#8221; or despairing, &#8220;when reproved&#8221; or
&#8220;chastised.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT241</font></sup> Beza, Grotius,
Macknight and Stuart, agree with Calvin in reading the first words
interrogatively &#8212; &#8220;And have ye forgotten?&#8221; etc.<br>Ribera, the
Jesuit, in his comment on this verse said, &#8220;The Apostle indirectly
(tacite) reproves them, because they had no recourse to Scripture in their
afflictions; compare <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451504&gt;</font></sup>Romans
15:4.&#8221; Capellus, referring to this passage, observed, &#8220;I wish the
Jesuits were always to speak in this manner, but Ribera ought to have remembered
that Paul was addressing the flock rather than the pastors, and that therefore,
the Scriptures ought to be read by laymen.&#8221;<br>The clear intimation of the
passage no doubt is, that the Hebrews ought to have attended to the truths
contained in Scripture. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT242</font></sup> See Appendix R
2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT243</font></sup> There is in this verse the
word &#8220;sons,&#8221; to be understood after &#8220;all;&#8221; that is,
&#8220;all the sons are partakers:&#8221; so Macknight and Stuart. As
&#8220;sons&#8221; conclude the verse, the word is omitted here. Those who have
only the name of Christians are called &#8220;bastards,&#8221; or spurious or
illegitimate children, because they are not born of God, being only the children
of the flesh. They are not Isaac&#8217;s but Ishmael, whatever their professions
may be, and though baptized and partakers of all the outward privileges of the
gospel. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT244</font></sup> Here
is an instance, among many others, in which men&#8217;s ingenuity is allowed
unnecessarily to involve things in difficulties. The comparison here is founded
on two palpable facts: there are fathers of our flesh, i.e., the body, and they
have for a short time a duty to perform as such; but God, being the Father of
our Spirits, which are to continue forever, deals with us in a way corresponding
to our destiny. The question of instrumentality has nothing to do with the
subject. Nor can anything be fairly drawn from this passage as to the useless
question of the non-traduction of souls, as some have thought; and it may be
justly be called useless, as it is a question beyond the range of human inquiry.
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT245</font></sup> See Appendix
S 2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT246</font></sup> The words are neither from
the Hebrew nor from the Septuagint, but the order is more according to the
former than the latter. The Hebrew is &#8220;Brace ye up the relaxed hands, and
the tottering knees invigorate;&#8221; and the Sept., &#8220;Be strong, ye
relaxed hands and paralyzed knees.&#8221; The literal rendering of this passage
is, &#8220;Therefore the enfeebled (or relaxed) hands and the paralyzed knees
restore; i.e., to their former vigor, so that you may contend with your enemies
and your trials and run your race.&#8221; They had before acted nobly as it is
stated in chapter 10:32-34; he now exhorts them to recover their former vigor
and strength. It is rendered by Macknight, &#8220;Bring to their right
position.&#8221; The verb
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnorqo&gt;w</font> literally means no
doubt to make straight again, and is so used in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421313&gt;</font></sup>Luke 13:13; but it has also
the meaning of renewing or restoring to a former state, or of rebuilding. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441516&gt;</font></sup>Acts 15:16. And in this
sense Schleusner takes it in this passage. It is used in the Sept. in the sense
of establishing confirming, making firm or strong. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;241012&gt;</font></sup>Jeremiah 10:12. Hence
Stuart gives this version,&#8212; <br>&#8220;Strengthen the weak hands and the
feeble knees.&#8221;<br>But the idea of repairing, or restoring or
reinvigorating, gives the passage the most emphatic meaning. The Apostle in this
instance only borrows some of the words from Isaiah, and accommodates them to
his own purpose. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT247</font></sup> Having spoken of
strength, he now tells them how to use that strength. Be strong, and take a
right course; go along the straight way of duty. See Appendix T 2. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT248</font></sup> This interpretation
is given by Grotius, Macknight and Stuart; but Beza, Doddridge and Scott, take
the view given in our version regarding the lame or weak person as intended by
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt; cwlo&lt;n</font>. So is the
Vulgate, &#8220;that no one halting may go astray, but rather be healed.&#8221;
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT249</font></sup> It has been
justly observed that <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diw&gt;kw</font> is
to follow or pursue one fleeing away from us. It means not only to seek peace
but strive to maintain it. Psalm 34, we have pursuing after seeking, &#8220;Seek
peace and pursue it,&#8221; i.e., strive earnestly to secure and retain it.
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451218&gt;</font></sup>Romans 12:18, is an
explanation.<br>But this strenuous effort as to peace is to be extended to
holiness; not chastity, as Chrysostom and some other fathers have imagined, but
holiness in its widest sense, purity of heart and life, universal holiness. The
word <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aJgiasmo&lt;v</font> is indeed taken
in a limited sense, and rendered &#8220;sanctification&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520403&gt;</font></sup>1 Thessalonians 4:3, and it
may be so rendered here as it is in those places where it evidently means
holiness universally, <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460130&gt;</font></sup>1
Corinthians 1:30; <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;530213&gt;</font></sup>2
Thessalonians 2:13, <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600102&gt;</font></sup>1 Peter
1:2. The article is put before it in order to show its connection with what
follows, &#8220;and the (or that) holiness, without which no one shall see the
Lord.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed</i><br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT250</font></sup>
It means properly overseeing and is rendered &#8220;taking the oversight,&#8221;
in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600502&gt;</font></sup>1 Peter 5:2, where alone
it occurs elsewhere. The word bishop comes from it. It is rendered,
&#8220;taking heed,&#8221; by Erasmus; &#8220;Diligently attending,&#8221; by
Grotius; &#8220;Taking care,&#8221; by Beza; &#8220;Looking to it,&#8221; by
Doddridge; &#8220;carefully observing,&#8221; by Macknight; and &#8220;Seeing to
it.&#8221; By Stuart. Considering what follows, &#8220;Taking heed&#8221; would
be the best version. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT251</font></sup> See Appendix U
2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT252</font></sup> It is said that &#8220;for
one morsel of meat,&#8221; literally, &#8220;for one eating,&#8221; or,
&#8220;for one meal,&#8221; as rendered by Doddridge, &#8220;he sold his
birthright,&#8221; or according to Macknight, &#8220;he gave away his
birthrights.&#8221; In this reference the Apostle gives the substance without
regarding expressions, though he adopts those of the Septuagint in two
instances, &#8212; the verb, which means to give away, used in the sense of
selling, &#8212; and birthrights, or the rights of primogeniture. The word in
Hebrew means primogeniture, used evidently by metonymy for its rights and
privileges. Not only a double portion belonged to the first-born, but also the
paternal blessing, which included things temporal and spiritual. The notion that
the priesthood at that time and from the beginning of the world belonged to the
first-born, has nothing to support it. Abel was a priest as well as Cain, and a
better priest too. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT253</font></sup> Though many such as
Beza, Doddridge, Stuart etc. regard this &#8220;repentance&#8221; as that of
Isaac, yet the phrase seems to favor the views of Calvin, &#8220;he found not
the place of repentance,&#8221; that is the admission of repentance; it was
inadmissible, there was no place found for it. The word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&gt;pov</font> has this meaning in
chapter 8:7, &#8220;there should be no place (or admission) have been sought for
the second.&#8221; The same sense is given to the word in Ecclesiasticus 38:12,
&#8220;give place&#8221; (or admission) to the physician &#8212;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">iJatrw~| do&lt;v to&gt;pon</font>. We may
give this rendering, &#8220;for he found not room for repentance;&#8221; he
seemed to repent of his sin and folly, but his repentance availed nothing, for
it could not be admitted; there was in his case no repentance allowed, as the
account given in Genesis testifies.<br>The difficulty about &#8220;it&#8221; in
the following clause is removed, when we consider that here, as in some previous
instances, the Apostle arranges his sentences according to the law of
parallelism; there are here four clauses; the first and last are connected, and
also the middle clauses, &#8212; <br>&#8220;For ye know,<br>That even afterwards
wishing to inherit the blessing,<br>He was rejected,<br>For he found no room for
repentance,<br>Though with tears he sought it, (i.e., the
blessing.)&#8221;<br>Though Macknight gave the other explanation of
&#8220;repentance&#8221; yet he considered the blessing as the antecedent to
&#8220;it&#8221; in the last line. Though with the tears of repentance he sought
the blessing, yet he was rejected: the door to repentance was as it were closed
up, and it could not be opened &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT254</font></sup> The connection of
this part has been viewed by some to be the following: &#8212; Having exhorted
the Hebrews to peace and holiness, and warned them against apostasy and sinful
indulgences, the Apostle now enforces his exhortations and warnings by showing
the superiority of the Gospel over the Law. This is the view of Doddridge and
Stuart. It appears that Scott connected this part with chapter 10:28-31, and
that he considered that the object of the apostle was to bring forward an
instance, in addition to former ones, of the superiority of the Gospel, in order
to show that the neglect of it would involve a greater guilt than that of the
Law. And this appears to have been the view of Calvin, which seems to be favored
by the concluding part of the chapter. The word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ga&lt;r</font> may be rendered
&#8220;moreover.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT255</font></sup> It has been
conjectured that <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mh&lt;</font> has been
omitted before &#8220;touched;&#8221; for in that case the passage would more
exactly correspond with the account given in Exodus, for the people were
expressly forbidden to touch the mountain. An omission of this kind was surely
not impossible. The phrase as it is hardly admits of a grammatical construction:
it has been found necessary to give the sense of an adjective to the participle.
There would not be this necessity were the words rendered &#8220;To a mount not
to be touched and burning with fire, and to,&#8221; etc. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT256</font></sup> The words used here
are not taken literally from the Hebrew nor from the Sept. the four things
mentioned in this verse, and the two things mentioned in the following verse,
are found in the narrative in Exodus 19 and 20; but not consecutively as here;
nor are the same terms used. &#8220;Blackness&#8221;
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">gno&gt;fw|</font>, should be &#8220;a
dark or thick cloud,&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;021916&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 19:16.
&#8220;Tempest,&#8221; <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">que&gt;llh</font>,
is not mentioned in Exodus or in Deuteronomy; but it includes evidently
&#8220;the thunders and lightnings&#8221; mentioned twice at least in Exodus, 
[Ex 19:16,20:18] though not once in Deuteronomy. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT257</font></sup> &#8220;The
Hebrews,&#8221; says Grotius, &#8220;came in the body to a material mountain,
but we in spirit to that which is
spiritual.&#8221;<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT258</font></sup> The words at
the end of verse 20, &#8220;or thrust through with a dart,&#8221; are not deemed
genuine, being not found in the best MSS., and none of any authority containing
them. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT259</font></sup> It is
supposed by some that the reference here is to what is found in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;021916&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 19:16, 17. It is
said in the former verse that all the people in the camp trembled; and it is
concluded that Moses was at the time with them, for it is said in the next verse
that he brought them forth out of the camp. But the passage that seems most
evidently to intimate what is here said in the 19<sup>th</sup> verse, where we
are told, that when the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder.
&#8220;Moses spake&#8221; and that &#8220;God answered him by a voice.&#8221;
Now we are not told what he said, nor what the answer was which God gave. It is
however, natural to conclude, that under the circumstances mentioned, Moses
expressed his fears, and that God removed them.
&#8212;<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT260</font></sup> Calvin follows
the Vulg. And connects
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">panhgu&gt;rei</font> with
&#8220;angels.&#8221; It means a whole or a general assembly, and occurs in the
Sept., and stands for <font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">d[wm</font> often
rendered a solemn assembly: it was a solemnity observed by the whole people.
Both as to sense construction, it is better to adopt the arrangement of our
version. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT261</font></sup> To
keep this clause distinct from the next but one, &#8220;the spirits of just
men,&#8221; etc. has been difficult. The distinction which Calvin seems to make
as well as Doddridge, Scott and Stuart, is this, &#8212; that those mentioned
here, &#8220;the first-born,&#8221; were the most eminent of the ancients; but
that &#8220;the spirits of just men&#8221; include the godly generally. The
people of Israel were called &#8220;the first born,&#8221;
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;020422&gt;</font></sup>Exodus 4:22, because they
were God&#8217;s chosen people. Ephraim is also called, &#8220;the first
born,&#8221; <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243109&gt;</font></sup>Jeremiah 31:9,
because of the superiority granted to that tribe; and the Messiah is so called,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;198927&gt;</font></sup>Psalm 89:27, on account of
his eminence. The first born is one possessed of peculiar privileges. The word
here seems to designate the saints, believers, Christians, as they are
God&#8217;s chosen people and highly privileged. We hence see the propriety of
&#8220;the whole assembly,&#8221; or the whole number of the faithful, composed
of Jews or Gentiles. The Apostle says, &#8220;We are part of this whole
assembly,&#8221; and in order to point out his meaning more distinctly he calls
it &#8220;the Church.&#8221; The reference here seems to be the saints on earth,
and at the end of the verse to departed saints. And they are said to be
&#8220;made perfect,&#8221; because freed from guilt, sin, and every pollution,
having &#8220;washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT262</font></sup> See Appendix X
2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT263</font></sup> By &#8220;him that
speaketh,&#8221; is by some understood Christ, but more properly God, as his is
the leading subject in the foregoing and the following verses. The words which
follow are brief; and the first clause is explained more fully in chapter 10:28,
and the second in chapter 1:2. God spake &#8220;on earth&#8221; by Moses, but
&#8220;from heaven&#8221; by his son, who came from heaven, ascended into heaven
and sent his spirit down from heaven. The comparison here is between speaking on
earth and speaking from heaven; but included in this, as previously explained in
the Epistle, are the agents employed. God in delivering the Law fixed on a place
on earth, and then as it were descended and employed an earthly agent, a mere
man as his mediator; but in delivering the gospel, he did not descend from
heaven, but employed a heavenly agent, his own son; thus manifested the
superiority of the Gospel over the law. And that God is meant throughout this
verse is evident from the following verse, &#8220;Whose voice,&#8221; etc. The
passage may be thus rendered, &#8212;<br>&#8220;See that ye reject not him who
speaketh; for if they escaped not who rejected him when speaking on earth, how
much more shall not we, if we turn away from him when speaking from
heaven?&#8221;<br>We have no single word to express
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">crhmati&gt;zonta</font> &#8212;
oraculizing, rendered by Doddridge, &#8220;giving forth oracles;&#8221; by
Macknight, &#8220;delivering an oracle;&#8221; and by Stuart,
&#8220;warning.&#8221; But the best word we can adopt here is
&#8220;speaking.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT264</font></sup> The quotation is
literally neither from Hebrew nor from the Sept., but is substantially the same.
&#8220;The earth and the heaven&#8221; may be deemed a phrase used to designate
the whole state of things, as they include the whole of the visible creation.
The whole Jewish polity, civil and religious, is generally supposed to be
intended here. But as the shaking of the nations is mentioned in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;370206&gt;</font></sup>Haggai 2:6, 7, Macknight
thought that by &#8220;the earth&#8221; is meant heathen idolatry, and by
&#8220;heaven&#8221; the Jewish economy, so called because it was divinely
appointed. If this be allowed, then we see a reason for the change which the
Apostle has made in the words: the original is both in Hebrew and in the Sept.,
&#8220;I shake (or will shake) the heaven and the earth;&#8221; but the Apostle
says: &#8220;I shake not only the earth, but the heaven also.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT265</font></sup> See Appendix Y
2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT266</font></sup> See Appendix Z
2.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT267</font></sup> The Vulgate is, &#8220;with
fear and reverence;&#8221; Beza&#8217;s &#8220;with modesty and reverence and
religious fear;&#8221; Schleusner&#8217;s, &#8220;with reverence and
devotion.&#8221; Stuart has adopted our version. See Appendix A 3. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT268</font></sup> The conjunction
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kai&lt;</font> at the beginning of this
verse is commonly omitted by translators, but Macknight has retained it,
&#8220;For even our God,&#8221; etc. The intimation clearly is, that under the
Gospel no less than under the Law God is a consuming fire to apostates; and
apostasy or idolatry is the sin especially referred to in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;050424&gt;</font></sup>Deuteronomy 4:24, from
which this passage is taken. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT269</font></sup>
&#8220;Continue&#8221; or remain, implies that they had manifested this love,
chapter 6:10; as though he had said, &#8220;Let the love of the brethren be such
as it has been.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT270</font></sup> What Beza says of
this opinion is, &#8220;I by no means reject it, though I regard the other
(first mentioned here) as the most obvious.&#8221; It has been said that
whenever Paul mentions the mystical body, it is in connection with Christ,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451205&gt;</font></sup>Romans 12:5, and that
&#8220;in the body&#8221; is to be understood literally,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470506&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 5:6. It is so
taken here by Grotius, Doddridge, Scott, and Stuart. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT271</font></sup> If the whole verse be
rightly considered, the construction of the first part will become evident. Two
things are mentioned, &#8220;marriage&#8221; and &#8220;bed&#8221; &#8212; the
conjugal bed. Two characters are afterwards mentioned, &#8220;fornicators and
adulterers.&#8221; The first disregard marriage and the second defile the
conjugal bed. Then the first clause speaks of marriage as in itself honorable,
in opposition to the dishonor put on it by fornicators, who being unmarried,
indulge in illicit intercourse with women; and the second speaks of the conjugal
bed as being undefiled, when not contaminated with adultery. This being
evidently the meaning, the declarative form seems most suitable. Besides, the
particle <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">de&lt;</font>, &#8220;but&#8221;
in the second part, as Beza observes, required this construction.<br>But if
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ga&lt;r</font> be the reading, as found
in some copies, then the perceptive form seems necessary, though even then the
sense would be materially the same, &#8212; that marriage ought to be deemed
honorable in all, that is in all ranks and orders of men, as Grotius observes,
and that the conjugal bed ought to be undefiled. &#8212; <br>&#8220;Let marriage
be deemed honorable among all, and the marriage bed be undefiled; for God will
condemn fornicator and adulterer.&#8221;<br>Hammond, Macknight, and Stuart adopt
the perceptive form; but Beza, Doddridge and Scott, the declarative. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT272</font></sup> See Appendix B
3.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT273</font></sup> See Appendix C
3.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT274</font></sup> See Appendix D
3.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT275</font></sup> Stuart takes the same view
with Calvin in this point &#8212; that the eternal existence of Christ is not
what is here taught, but that he as a Mediator is unchangeably the same. See
Appendix E 3. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT276</font></sup>
&#8220;Doctrines&#8221; were said to be &#8220;various&#8221; because of their
number; there were then as now many false doctrines; and &#8220;strange&#8221;
because they were new or foreign to the truth, not consistent with the faith,
but derived from abroad as it were, borrowed from traditions, ceremonies, or
other foreign sources. Stuart gives another meaning to the first word, that is
&#8220;different&#8221; from Christian doctrine; but it has no such meaning.
Still less warranted is Macknight in saying that it means what is
&#8220;discordant.&#8221; What is meant by &#8220;diverse diseases&#8221; and
&#8220;diverse lusts&#8221; is that they were of various kinds, or that they
were many. The same author gives an unprecedented meaning to the second word.
&#8220;foreign,&#8221; that is, taught by unauthorized teachers! Stuart says,
that it means &#8220;foreign&#8221; to Christian doctrine. The word is indeed
used in <sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441718&gt;</font></sup>Acts 17:18, and in
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600412&gt;</font></sup>1 Peter 4:12, in the sense
of &#8220;new,&#8221; a thing unusual, not heard of before; nor is this meaning
unsuitable here. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490414&gt;</font></sup>Ephesians 4:14, where the
same subject is handled. See also
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401509&gt;</font></sup>Matthew 15:9. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT277</font></sup> See Appendix F
3.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT278</font></sup> The verb
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aJgia&gt;zw</font> means here expiation,
as in chapter 2:11, 10:10, and other places in this Epistle; and so it is taken
by Calvin and the rendering of Stuart is &#8220;that he might make
expiation,&#8221; etc. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT279</font></sup> The words in Hosea
are not regimen, but in apposition. &#8220;So will we render calves, our
lips.&#8221; Such is the meaning given by the Targum, though the Vulg. puts the
words in construction, &#8220;the calves of our lips.&#8221; Instead of the
calves offered in sacrifices, the promise made was to offer their lips, that is,
words which they were required to take, &#8220;Take with you words&#8221;. The
Sept., Syr., and Arab. Render the phrase as here given, &#8220;the fruit of our
lips,&#8221; only the Apostle leaves out &#8220;our&#8221;. There is the same
meaning, though not exactly the same words. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT280</font></sup> The words may be thus
rendered, &#8220;And forget not benevolence (or, literally, well-doing) and
liberality.&#8221; The <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">de&lt;</font> here
should be rendered &#8220;and,&#8221; for this is enjoined in addition to what
is stated in the previous verse. The word
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujpoii`&gt;a</font> means kindness,
benevolence, beneficence, the doing of good generally; but
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">koinwni&gt;a</font> refers to the
distribution of what is needful for the poor. See
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451526&gt;</font></sup>Romans 15:26,
<sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470913&gt;</font></sup>2 Corinthians 9:13. So that
Calvin in this instance has reserved their specific meaning. Stuart&#8217;s
version is &#8220;Forget not kindness also and liberality;&#8221; and he
explains the clause thus, &#8220;Beneficence or kindness toward the suffering
and liberality toward the needy.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT281</font></sup> Grotius renders the
second verb, <font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpei&gt;kete</font>,
&#8220;concede&#8221; to them, that is, the honor due to their office; Beza,
&#8220;be compliant,&#8221; (obsecundate;) and the directions of your guides and
submit to their admonitions.&#8221; Doddridge gives the sentiment of Calvin,
&#8220;Submit yourselves to them with becoming respect.&#8221;<br>The words may
be rendered, &#8220;Obey your rulers and be submissive;&#8221; that is cultivate
an obedient, compliant and submissive spirit. He speaks first of what they were
to do &#8212; to render obedience and then of the spirit with which that
obedience was to be rendered; it was not merely to be an outward act, but
proceeding from a submissive mind. Schleusner&#8217;s explanation is similar,
&#8220;Obey your rulers and promptly (or willingly) obey them.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT282</font></sup> &#8220;The Greek
interpreters,&#8221; says Estius, &#8220;teach that obedience is due to a
bishop, though he be immoral in his conduct; but not if he perverts the doctrine
of faith in his public preaching, for in that case he deprives himself of power,
as he declares himself to be an enemy to the church.&#8221; Poole, who quotes
this passage, adds, &#8220;Let the Papisticals note this, who vociferously claim
blind obedience in behalf of their pastors.&#8221; &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT283</font></sup> See Appendix G
3.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT284</font></sup> The Greek fathers connect it
with the preceding clause, &#8220;For we trust we have a good conscience towards
all,&#8221; that is towards Jews and Gentiles; but the Vulg. connects it with
the following, &#8220;willing in all things to live well;&#8221; that is
honorably. &#8220;Willing in all things to behave well&#8221; Macknight;
&#8220;determined in all things to behave honorable&#8221; Doddridge;
&#8220;being desirous in all things to conduct ourselves uprightly,&#8221;
Stuart. To keep the alliteration in the text, the words may be rendered thus
&#8212; &#8220;We trust that we have a good conscience, being desirous to
maintain a good conduct." A good conscience is a pure conscience, free from
guilt and sinister motives: and to behave or live goodly, as the words are
literally, is not to behave honorably or honestly, but to behave or live
uprightly according to the rule of God&#8217;s word; so that the best version
is, &#8220;Willing in all things to live uprightly.&#8221; &#8220;We
trust,&#8221; is rendered by Doddridge and Macknight, &#8220;we are
confident;&#8221; but our version is preferable. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT285</font></sup> This forms no part of
the Epistle; and the subscriptions to the other Epistles must be viewed the
same. Some of them are indeed manifestly erroneous, as the case with this. See
verse 23. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT286</font></sup> See
Appendix H 3.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT287</font></sup> The Vulgate Beza
and almost all expounders, render it as an imperative, &#8220;Know ye.&#8221;
&#8212; <i>Ed</i>.<br><sup><font color="Maroon">FT288</font></sup> The words
<font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpolelume&gt;non</font> in this verse,
has been rendered by Macknight and some others, &#8220;sent away.&#8221; It is
no doubt used in the sense of dismissing, dissolving, or sending away an
assembly or a multitude, but not of sending away a person on a message. The two
things are wholly distinct. The verb means to set loose, to loosen to release
and hence to dismiss, to set at liberty, to make free, and never in the sense of
sending a person to a place on business, or with an errand or message. The
objection that we do not read elsewhere of Timothy&#8217;s imprisonment is of no
weight for the history we have of those times is very brief; and if we judge
from the state of things at that period, there is nothing more probable than
that Timothy shared the lot of Paul and of others. It is also probable that he
was not imprisoned at Rome, where Paul was, but at some other place, for Paul
says he expected him soon; and he does not say &#8220;If he returns
quickly,&#8221; but &#8220;if he come quickly.&#8221;
