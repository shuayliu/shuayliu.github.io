<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus came to
Bethany.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We see that they judged too rashly who
thought that Christ <i>would not come to the feast</i>, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f331</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431156&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
11:56;) and this, reminds us that we ought not to be so hasty as not to wait
patiently and quietly, till the season arrive, which is unknown to us. Now
<i>Jesus came</i> first <i>to Bethany</i>, that thence he might go three days
afterwards to Jerusalem. Meanwhile, he intended to give Judas a fit time and
place for betraying him, that he might present himself, ready to be sacrificed,
at the appointed time; for he is not ignorant of what is to take place, but
willingly comes forward to be sacrificed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come to Bethany six days before
the passover</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he remained there four days;
which may easily be inferred from Matthew and Mark. On what day the banquet was
made for him, at which he was anointed by Mary, John does not state; but it
seems probable that it took place not long after he had arrived. There are some
who think that, the anointing mentioned by Matthew
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
26:7) and Mark
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
14:3) is different from what is mentioned here; but they are mistaken. They have
been led to adopt this view by a calculation of time, because the two
Evangelists,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
26:2;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
14:1,) before relating that Christ was anointed, speak of two days as having
elapsed. But the solution is easy, and may be given in two ways. For John does
not say that Christ was anointed on the first day after his arrival; so that
this might happen even when he was preparing to depart. Yet, as I have already
said, there is another conjecture which is more probable, that he was anointed
one day, at least, or two days, before his departure; for it is certain that
Judas had made a bargain with the priests, before Christ sent two of his
disciples to make ready the passover. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f332</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now, at the very least, one day must have intervened. The Evangelists add, that
he</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">sought a convenient
opportunity for betraying
Christ,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
26:16,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">after having received the bribe. When, therefore,
after mentioning <i>two days</i>, they add the history of the anointing, they
place last in the narrative what happened first. And the reason is, that after
having related the words of Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">You know that after two
days the Son of man shall be betrayed,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
26:2,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">they now add &#8212; what had been formerly omitted
&#8212; in what manner and on what occasion he was betrayed by his disciple.
There is thus a perfect agreement in the account of his having been anointed at
Bethany.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There therefore they made him
a banquet</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Matthew
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
26:7) and Mark,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
14:3) say that he then supped at the house of Simon the leper. John does not
mention the house, but shows plainly enough, that it was in some other place
than the house of Lazarus and Martha that he supped; for he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lazarus was one of those who sat
at table with him</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, one who had been
invited along with Christ. Nor does it involve any contradiction, that Matthew
and Mark relate that the <i>head</i> of Christ was anointed, while John relates
that his <i>feet</i> were anointed. The usual practice was the anointing of
<i>the head</i>, and on this account Pliny reckons it an instance of excessive
luxury, that some anointed the ankles. The three Evangelists agree in this; that
Mary did not anoint Christ sparingly, but poured on him a large quantity of
ointment. What John speaks, about <i>the feet</i>, amounts to this, that the
whole body of Christ, down to the feet, was anointed. There is an amplification
in the word <i>feet</i>, which appears more fully from what follows, when he
adds, that Mary </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wiped his feet
with her hair</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the house was filled with
the odor</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of the ointment. It was not a simple
liquor extracted from </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spikenard,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">but a compound of many odoriferous substances;
and therefore it is not wonderful that <i>the</i> whole
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>house was filled with the
odor</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One of his disciples,
therefore, saith.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Next follows the murmuring of
Judas, which Matthew
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
16:8) attributes to the disciples indiscriminately, and Mark
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
14:4) to <i>some</i> of them; but it is customary in Scripture to apply to many,
by way of synecdoche, what belongs to one or to a few. Yet I think it is
probable, that the murmuring proceeded from Judas alone, and that the rest were
induced to give him their assent, as murmurings, by fanning a flame, easily
kindle in us a variety of dispositions; and more especially, as we are too prone
to form unfavorable judgments, slanders are readily embraced by us. But the
credulity which the Spirit of God reproves in the Apostles is a warning to us
not to be too easy and credulous in listening to calumnious
statements.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why was not this ointment
sold for three hundred denarii?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> A pound of
ordinary ointment, Pliny tells us, cost not more than ten denarii; but the same
Pliny says, that the highest price of the best ointment was three hundred and
ten denarii. Now the Evangelists agree, that this was the most costly ointment,
and Therefore Judas is correct in valuing a pound of it at
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>three hundred
denarii</i></font><font face="Palatino">, &#8212; a sum which, according to the
computation of Budaeus, amounts to fifty <i>livres</i> of French money. And as
almost every kind of luxury involves excess and superfluity, the greater the
waste of money, the more plausible reason had Judas for murmuring; as if he had
said, &#8220;Had Mary spent little, there would have been some excuse for her;
but now, since, in a matter of no importance, she has wasted a vast sum of
money, has she not done an injury to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
poor</i></font><font face="Palatino">, who might have obtained from such a sum
great relief? What she has done, therefore, admits of no
apology.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because he was a
thief</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The rest of the Apostles, not from any
bad disposition, but thoughtlessly, condemn Mary. But Judas resorts to a
plausible pretext for his wickedness, when he brings forward
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
poor</i></font><font face="Palatino">, though he cared nothing about them. We
are taught by this instance what a frightful beast the desire of possessing is;
the loss which Judas thinks that he has sustained, by the loss of an opportunity
for stealing, excites him to such rage that he does not hesitate to betray
Christ. And probably, in what he said about
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
poor</i></font><font face="Palatino"> having been defrauded, he did not only
speak falsely to others, but likewise flattered himself inwardly, as hypocrites
are wont to do; as if the act of betraying Christ were a trivial fault, by which
he endeavored to obtain compensation for the loss which he had sustained. He had
but one reason, indeed, for betraying Christ; and that was, to regain in some
way the prey which had been snatched from his hands; for it was the indignation
excited in him, by the gain which he had lost, that drove him to the design of
betraying Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is wonderful that Christ should have chosen, as a
steward, a person of this description, whom he knew to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
thief</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For what else was it than to put into
his hands a rope for strangling himself? Mortal man can give no other reply than
this, that the judgments of God are a deep gulf. Yet the action of Christ ought
not to be viewed as an ordinary rule, that we should commit the care of the
poor, or any thing sacred, to a wicked and ungodly man. for God has laid down to
us a law, who they are that ought to be called to the government of the Church,
and to other offices; and this law we are not at liberty to violate. The case
was otherwise with Christ, who, being the eternal Wisdom of God, furnished an
opportunity for his secret predestination in the person of
Judas.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let her
alone.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When Christ bids them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">Mary
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>alone</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he shows that they act improperly and unjustly who disturb their neighbors
without a good reason, and raise a disturbance about nothing. Christ&#8217;s
reply, as given by the other Evangelists, is longer; but the meaning is the
same. The <i>anointing</i>, which Judas finds fault with, is defended on this
ground, that it will serve for his burial. Christ, therefore, does not approve
of! it as an ordinary service, or one which ought to be commonly used in the
Church; for if he had intended that an office of this sort should be performed
daily, he could have said something else instead of speaking of it as connected
with his burial. God certainly does not approve of outward display. Nay, more,
perceiving that the mind of man is too prone to carnal observances, He
frequently enjoins us to be sober and moderate in the use of them. Those
persons, therefore, are absurd interpreters, who infer from Christ&#8217;s
reply, that costly and magnificent worship is pleasing to God; for he rather
excuses Mary on the ground of her having rendered to him an extraordinary
service, which ought not to be regarded as a perpetual rule for the worship of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the day of my burial she hath
kept it</i></font><font face="Palatino">. When he says, that the ointment was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kept</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he means that it was not poured unseasonably, but with a due regard to the time
when it occurred; for a thing is said to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kept,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
which is reserved in store to be brought cut at a fit time and place. It is
certain that, if any person, at a former period, had burdened him with costly
delicacies, he would not have endured it. But he affirms that Mary did not do
this as a customary matter, but in order to discharge her last duty towards him.
Besides, the anointing of bodies was not at that time a useless ceremony, but
rather a spiritual symbol, to place before their eyes the hope of a
resurrection. The promises were still obscure; Christ had not risen, who is
justly designated <i>the first-fruits of them that rise</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:20.) Believers, therefore, needed such aids to direct them to
Christ, who was still absent; and, accordingly, the <i>anointing</i> of Christ
was not at that time superfluous, for he was soon to be buried, and he was
<i>anointed</i> as if he were to be laid in the tomb. The disciples were not yet
aware of this, and Mary unquestionably was suddenly moved to do, under the
direction of the Spirit of God, what she had not previously intended. But Christ
applies to the hope of his resurrection what they so greatly disapproved, in
order that the usefulness, which he pointed out to them in this action, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f333</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
might lead them to renounce the fretful and wicked opinion which they had formed
respecting it. As it was the will of God that the childhood of his ancient
people should be guided by such exercises, so, in the present day, it would be
foolish to attempt the same thing; nor could it be done without offering an
insult to Christ, who has driven away such shadows by the brightness of his
coming. But as his resurrection had not yet brought the fulfillment of the
shadows of the Law, it was proper that his burial should be adorned by an
outward ceremony. The odor of his resurrection has now sufficient efficacy,
without spikenard and costly ointments, to quicken the whole world. But let us
remember that, in judging of the actions of men, we ought to abide by the
decision of Christ alone, at whose tribunal we must one day
stand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the poor you have always
with you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We must observe what I have already
pointed out, that a distinction is here drawn expressly between the
extraordinary action of Mary, and the daily service which is due to Christ.
Those persons, therefore, are apes, and not imitators, who are desirous to serve
Christ by costly and splendid display; as if Christ approved of what was done
once, and did not rather forbid that it should be done
afterwards.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But me you have not
always.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When he says, that he will not always
be with his disciples, this ought to be referred to that kind of presence to
which carnal worship and costly honors are suitable. For as to his presence with
us by the grace and power of his Spirit, his dwelling in us, and also feeding us
with his flesh and blood, this has nothing to do with bodily observances. Of all
the pompous ceremonies which the Papists have contrived for the worship of
Christ, in vain do they tell us, that they have bestowed them upon him, for he
openly rejects them. When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the poor will always be with
us,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> though, by this saying, he reproves the
hypocrisy of the Jews, yet we may learn from it a profitable doctrine; namely,
that alms, by which the wants of the poor are relieved, are sacrifices
acceptable, and of sweet savor, to God, and that any other kind of expense in
the worship of God is improperly bestowed.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then a great multitude of the
Jews knew that he was there.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The more nearly
the time of the death of Christ approached, it became the more necessary that
his name should be universally celebrated, in order that it might be a
preparation for stronger faith after his death. More especially, the Evangelist
relates that the recent miracle of the resurrection of Lazarus had acquired
great celebrity: and as Christ showed in it a remarkable proof of his Divinity,
God intended that it should have many witnesses. When he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they came not on account of Jesus
only,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> but also for the sake of Lazarus, he does
not mean that they came out of regard to Lazarus, as if they bestowed this mark
of honor on him in particular, but that they might behold the astonishing
display of the power of Christ in Lazarus.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now the chief priests
consulted.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It certainly was worse than insane
fury to endeavor to put to death one who had manifestly been raised from the
dead by divine power. But such is the spirit of giddiness with which Satan
torments the wicked, so that there is no end of their madness, even though God
should bring heaven, and earth, and sea, to oppose them. For this wicked
consultation is thus described, for the purpose of informing us that the enemies
of Christ were led to so great obstinacy, not by mistake or folly, but by
furious wickedness, so that they did not even shrink from making war against
God; and also for the purpose of informing us that the power of God was not
dimly seen in the resurrection of Lazarus, since ungodliness could contrive no
other method of banishing it from remembrance than by perpetrating a base and
shocking murder on an innocent man. Besides, since Satan labors with his utmost
strength utterly to bury, or at least in some measure to obscure, the works of
God, it is our duty to devote ourselves diligently to continual meditation on
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The next day, a great
multitude.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This entrance of Christ is more
copiously related
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
21:1;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
11:1;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421929&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
19:29) by the other Evangelists; but John here embraces the leading points. In
the first place, we ought to remember Christ&#8217;s design, which was, that he
came to Jerusalem of his own accord, to. offer himself to die; for it was
necessary that his death should be voluntary, because the wrath of God could be
appeased only by a sacrifice of obedience. And, indeed, he well knew what would
be the result; but before he is dragged to the cross, he wishes to be solemnly
acknowledged by the people as their King; nay, he openly declares that he
commences his reign by advancing to death, but though his approach was
celebrated by a vast crowd of people, still he remained unknown to his enemies
until, by the fulfillment of prophecies, which we shall afterwards see in their
own place, he proved that he was the true Messiah; for he wished to omit nothing
that would contribute to the full confirmation of our faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A great multitude, which came to
the feast.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Thus strangers were more ready to
discharge the duty of paying respect to the Son of God than the citizens of
Jerusalem, who ought rather to have been all example to all others. For they had
sacrifices daily; the temple was always before their eyes, which ought to have:
kindled in their hearts the desire of seeking God; these too were the highest
teachers of the Church, and <i>there</i> was the sanctuary of the divine light.
It is therefore a manifestation of excessively base ingratitude in them that,
after they have been trained to such exercise from their earliest years, they
reject or despise the Redeemer who had been promised to them. But this fault has
prevailed in almost every age, that the more nearly and the more familiarly God
approached to men, the more daringly did men despise God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In other men who, having left their homes, assembled
to celebrate the feast, we observe much greater ardor, so that they eagerly
inquire about Christ; and when they hear that he is coming into the city, they
go out to meet and congratulate him. And yet it cannot be doubted that they were
aroused by a secret movement of the Spirit to meet him. We do not read that this
was done on any former occasion. But as earthly princes summon their subjects by
the sound of a trumpet or by the public crier, when they go to take possession
of their kingdom, so Christ, by a movement of his Spirit, assembled this people,
that they might hail him as their king. When the multitudes wished to make him a
king, while he was in the wilderness,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
6:15,) he withdrew secretly into the mountain; for at that time they dreamed of
no other kingdom than one under which they might be well fattened, in the same
manner as cattle. Christ could not therefore grant and comply with their foolish
and absurd wish, without denying himself, and renouncing the office which the
Father had bestowed upon him. But now he claims for himself such a kingdom as he
had received from the Father. I readily acknowledge that the people who went out
to meet him were not well acquainted with the nature of this kingdom; but Christ
looked to the future. Meanwhile, he permitted nothing to be done that was not
suitable to his spiritual kingdom.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>branches of
palm-trees,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> when they bestowed kingly power on

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shouted,
Hosanna.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this phrase they testified that
they acknowledged Jesus Christ to be the Messiah, who had anciently been
promised to the fathers, and from whom redemption and salvation were to be
expected. For the
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B825&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
118:25 from which that exclamation is taken was composed in reference to the
Messiah for this purpose, that all the saints might continually desire and
ardently long for his coming, and might receive him with the utmost reverence,
when he was manifested. It is therefore probable, or rather it may be inferred
with certainty, that this prayer was frequently used by the Jews, and,
consequently, was in every man&#8217;s mouth; so that the Spirit of God put
words into the mouths, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f334</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of those men, when they wished a prosperous arrival to the Lord Jesus; and they
were chosen by him as heralds to attest that Christ was come.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hosanna</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is composed of two Hebrew words, and means, <i>Save</i>,<i> I beseech you</i>.
The Hebrews, indeed, pronounce it differently,
(</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">anA[y&ccedil;wh</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>Hoshianna</i>; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f335</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but it usually happens that the pronunciation of words is corrupted, when they
are transferred to a foreign language. Yet the Evangelists, though they wrote in
Greek, purposely retained the Hebrew word, in order to express more fully that
the multitude employed the ordinary form of prayer, which was first employed by
David, and afterwards throughout an uninterrupted succession of ages, received
by the people of God, and peculiarly consecrated for the purpose of blessing the
kingdom of the Messiah. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f336</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
To the same purpose are the words which immediately follow,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed be the King of Israel,
who cometh in the name of the Lord;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for this is
also a joyful prayer for the happy and prosperous success of that kingdom, on
which the restoration and prosperity of the Church of God
depended.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as David appears to speak of himself rather than
of Christ in that psalm, we must first of all solve this difficulty; nor will
the task be hard. We know for what purpose the kingdom was established in the
hand of David and of his posterity; and that purpose was, that it might be a
sort of prelude of the everlasting kingdom which was to be manifested at the
proper time. And, indeed, it was not necessary that David should confine his
attention to himself; and the Lord, by the prophets, frequently commands all the
godly to turn their eyes to a different person from David. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f337</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
So then all that David sung about himself is justly referred to that king who,
according to the promise, was to arise from the seed of David to be the
redeemer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we ought to derive from it a profitable
admonition; for if we are members of the Church, the Lord calls upon us to
cherish the same desire which he wished believers to cherish under the Law; that
is, that we should wish with our whole heart that the kingdom of Christ should
flourish and prosper; and not only so, but that we should demonstrate this by
our prayers. In order To give us greater courage in prayer, we ought to observe
that he prescribes to us the words. Woe then to our slothfulness, if we
extinguish by our coldness, or quench by indifference, that ardor which God
excites. Yet let us know that the prayers which we offer by the direction and
authority of God will not be in vain. Provided that we be not indolent or grow
weary in praying, He will be a faithful guardian of his kingdom, to defend it by
his invincible power and protection. True, indeed, though we remain drowsy and
inactive, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f338</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the majesty of his kingdom will be firm and sure; but when &#8212; as is
frequently the ease &#8212; it is less prosperous than it ought to be, or rather
falls into decay, as we perceive it to be, at the present day, fearfully
scattered and wasted, this unquestionably arises through our fault. And when but
a small restoration, or almost none, is to be seen, or when at least it advances
slowly, let us ascribe it to our indifference. We daily ask from God <i>that his
kingdom may come</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
6:10,) but scarcely one man in a hundred earnestly desires it. Justly,
therefore, are we deprived of the blessing of God, which we are weary of
asking.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are also taught by this expression, that it is God
alone who preserves and defends the Church; for He does not claim for himself,
or command us to give him, anything but what is his own. Since, therefore, while
He guides our tongues, we pray that he may preserve the kingdom of Christ, we
acknowledge that, in order that this kingdom may remain in a proper state, God
himself is the only bestower of salvation. He employs, indeed, the labors of men
for this purpose, but of men whom his own hand has prepared for the work.
Besides, while he makes use of men for advancing, or maintaining the kingdom of
Christ, still every thing is begun and completed, through their agency, by God
alone through the power of his Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who cometh in the name of the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We must first understand what is meant by
this phrase,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> to come in the name
of the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He who does not rashly put himself
forward, or falsely assume the honor, but, being duly called, has the direction
and authority of God for his actions,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cometh in the name of
God</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"> This title belongs to all the true
servants of God. A Prophet who guided by the Holy Spirit, honestly delivers to
men the doctrine which he has received from heaven, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cometh in the name of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. A King, by whose hand God governs his
people <i>cometh in</i> the same <i>name</i>. But as the Spirit of the Lord
rested on Christ, and he is <i>the Head of all things</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:22,) and all who have ever been ordained to rule over the Church are subject
to his say, or rather, are streams flowing from him as the fountain, he is
justly said to have <i>come in the name of God</i>. Nor is it only by the high
rank of his authority that he surpasses others, but because God manifests
himself to us fully in him; for <i>in him dwelleth the fullness of the Godhead
bodily</i>, as Paul says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:9,) and he is <i>the lively image</i> of God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:3,) and, in short, is the true <i>lmmanuel</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
1:23.) It is therefore by a special right that he is said to have <i>come in the
name of the Lord</i>, because by him God has manifested himself fully, and not
partially, as he had formerly done by the Prophets. We ought therefore to begin
with him as the Head, when we wish to bless the servants of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now since the false prophets arrogantly boast of<i>
the name of God</i>, and shelter themselves under this false pretense, we ought
to supply an opposite clause in the prayer, that the Lord may scatter and
utterly destroy them. Thus we cannot bless Christ without cursing the Pope and
that sacrilegious tyranny which he has raised up against the Son of God. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f339</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He huffs his excommunications against us, indeed, with great violence, as if
they were thunderbolts, but they are mere air-bladders, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f340</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and therefore we ought boldly to despise them. On the contrary, the Holy Spirit
here dictates to us an awful curse, that it may sink the Pope to the lowest
hell, with all his pomp and splendor. Nor is it necessary that there should be
any Bishop or Pontiff 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f341</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to pronounce the curse against him, since Christ at one time bestowed this
authority on <i>children</i>, when he approved of their <i>crying in the
temple</i>,<i> and saying</i>,<i> Hosanna to the Son of David</i>, as the other
Evangelists relate,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
21:15, 16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jesus having found a
young ass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This part of the history is more
minutely related by the other Evangelists, who tell us, that Christ <i>sent two
of his disciples </i>to bring an ass,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
21:1;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
11:1;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421929&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
19:29.) John, who was the latest writer of all the Evangelists, reckoned it
enough to notice briefly the substance of what had been stated by the rest; and,
on this account, he leaves out many circumstances. An apparent contradiction, by
which many persons are perplexed, is very easily removed. When Matthew says,
that Christ sat upon a <i>she-ass and her colt</i>, we ought to view it as a
synecdoche. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f342</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some imagine that he sat first on the she-ass, and afterwards on her colt; and
out of this conjecture they frame an allegory, that he first sat on the Jewish
people, who had been long accustomed to bear the yoke of the Law, and
afterwards. subdued the Gentiles, like an untrained <i>young ass</i> which had
never carried a rider. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f343</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But the plain truth is, that Christ rode on an ass which had been brought along
with its mother; and to this agree the words of the Prophet, who, by a
repetition very frequent among the Hebrews, expresses the same thing twice by
different words. <i>On an ass</i>, he says, <i>and on the colt of an ass which
was under the yoke</i>,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpozugi&gt;ou</font><font face="Palatino">)
Our Evangelist, who studies brevity, leaves out the former clause, and quotes
only the latter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Jews themselves are constrained to expound the
prediction of
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;380909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
9:9, which was at that time fulfilled, as referring to the Messiah; but, at the
same time, they ridiculed us for being led astray by <i>the shadow of an
ass</i>, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f344</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
a so as to give the honor of the Messiah to the son of Mary. But far different
are the testimonies on which our faith rests. And, indeed, when we say that
Jesus is the Messiah, we do not begin by saying, that he entered into Jerusalem
sitting on an ass; for there was displayed in him a glory, such as belonged to
the Son of God, as we have seen under the first chapter of this Gospel; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f345</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and it was chiefly in his resurrection that his Divine power was illustriously
displayed. But we ought not to despise this confirmation, that God, by his
wonderful Providence, exhibited on that entrance, as on a public stage, the
fulfillment of that which Zechariah had foretold.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In these words of the Prophet, as the
Evangelist quotes them, we ought to observe, first, that never is tranquillity
restored to our minds, or fear and trembling banished from them, except by
knowing that Christ reigns amongst us. The words of the Prophet, indeed, are
different; for he exhorts believers to gladness and rejoicing. But the
Evangelist has here described the manner in which our hearts exult with true
joy. It is, when that fear is removed, with which all must be tormented, until,
being reconciled to God, they obtain that peace which springs from faith,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:1.) This benefit, therefore, comes to us through Christ, that, freed from the
tyranny of Satan, the yoke of sin being broken, guilt canceled, and death
abolished, we freely boast, relying on the protection of our King, since they
who are placed under his guardianship ought not to fear any danger. Not that we
are free From fear, so long as we live in the world, but because confidence,
founded on Christ, rises superior to all than. Though Christ was still at a
distance, yet the Prophet exhorted the godly men of that age to be glad and
joyful, because Christ was to come. <i>Behold</i>, said he, <i>thy King will
come</i>;<i> therefore fear not</i>. Now that he is come, in order that we may
enjoy his presence, we ought more vigorously to contend with fear, that, freed
from our enemies, we may peacefully and joyfully honor our
King.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Daughter of
Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Prophet addressed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zion</i></font><font face="Palatino">
in his own time, because that was the habitation and abode of the Church. God
has now, indeed, collected a Church for himself out of the whole world; but this
promise is peculiarly addressed to believers, who submit to Christ, that he may
reign in them. When he describes Christ as <i>riding on an ass</i>, the meaning
is, that his kingdom will have nothing in common with the pomp, splendor,
wealth, and power of the world; and it was proper that this should be made known
by an outward manifestation, that all might be fully assured that it is
spiritual.</font><br></div>

that the word of God shine on us, if the Spirit do not also enlighten our eyes,

or uncircumcised, because immediately afterwards it follows that they came
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
worship</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Now it was strictly prohibited by the
Roman laws, and severely punished by the Proconsuls and other magistrates, if
any person was discovered to have left the worship of his native country and
passed over to, the Jewish religion. But Jews, who were scattered throughout
Asia and Greece, were allowed to cross the sea for the purpose of offering
sacrifices in the temple. Besides, the Jews were not permitted to associate with
them in the solemn worship of God, because they thought that the temple, and the
sacrifices, and themselves, would in that way be polluted. But though they were
the descendants of Jews, yet as they resided at a great distance beyond the sea,
we need not wonder that the Evangelist introduces them as strangers and
unacquainted with the occurrences which took place at that time in Jerusalem and
in places adjacent. The meaning therefore is, that Christ was received as King,
not only by the inhabitants of Judea, who had come from villages and towns<i> to
the feast</i>, but that the report had also reached men who lived beyond the
sea, and who had come from distant countries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To

their own country; but John describes here solemn
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>worship,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
which was accompanied by sacrifices. For though religion and the fear of God
were not confined to the temple, yet in no other place were they permitted to
offer sacrifices to God, nor had they any where else the Ark of the Testimony,
which was the token of the presence of God. Every man worshipped God daily at
his own house in a spiritual manner; but the saints under the Law were likewise
bound to make profession of outward worship and obedience, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f347</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
such as was prescribed by Moses, by appearing in the temple in the presence of
God. Such was the design for which the feasts were appointed. And if those men
undertook so long a journey at great expense, with great inconvenience, and not
without personal risk, that they might not treat with indifference the external
profession of their piety, what apology can we now offer, if we do not testify,
in our own houses, that we worship the true God? The worship which belonged to
the Law has indeed come to an end; but the Lord has left to his Church Baptism,
the Lord&#8217;s Supper, and public prayer, that in those exercises believers
may be employed. If we despise them, therefore. it proves that our desire of
godliness is excessively cold.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.

this, that we ought to call on departed saints,

that the knowledge of him would soon be spread through every region of the
world. Thus he wished to meet the astonishment which his death might excite in
his disciples; for he shows that there is no reason why their courage should
fail, because the doctrine of the&#8217; gospel will nevertheless be proclaimed
throughout the whole world. Again, that this contemplation of his glow may not
soon afterwards vanish, when he shall be condemned to death, hung on the cross,
and finally buried. he gives them early information and warning that the
ignominy of his death is no obstruction to his glory. For this purpose he
employs a most appropriate comparison.</font><br></div>

having fallen into the ground, die, it remaineth
alone.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> If a grain of wheat do not die</i> or
putrefy, it continues to be dry and unfruitful; but the death of the seed has
the beneficial effect of quickening it, that it may yield fruit. In short,
Christ compares his death to sowing, which appears to tend to the destruction of
the

but yet is the cause of far more abundant increase. Though this admonition was
especially necessary at that time, yet it is of continual use in the Church.
And, first, we ought to begin with the Head. That dreadful appearance of
disgrace and cursing, which appears in the death of Christ, not only obscures
his glory, but removes it altogether from our view. We must not, therefore,
confine our attention to his death alone, but must likewise consider the fruit
which has been yielded by his glorious resurrection. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f350</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus there will be nothing to prevent his glory from being every where
displayed. From him we must next come to the members; for not only do we think
that we perish in death, but our life also is a sort of continual death,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians

<div><font face="Palatino">When, therefore, the godly are distressed by various
afflictions, when they are pressed hard by the difficulties of their situation,
when they suffer hunger, or nakedness, or disease, when they are assailed by
reproaches, when it appears as if they would every hour be almost overwhelmed by
death, let them unceasingly consider that this is a sowing which, in due time,
will yield fruit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who loveth his soul shall
destroy it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To doctrine Christ joins
exhortation; for if we must die in order that we may bring forth
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>frui</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>t</i>,
we ought patiently to permit God to mortify us. But as he draws a contrast
between the love of life and the hatred of lit, we ought to understand what it
is to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and <i>hate life</i>. He who, under the influence of immoderate desire of the
present life, cannot leave the world but by constraint, is said to <i>love
life</i>; but he who, despising <i>life</i>, advances courageously to death, is
said to <i>hate life</i>. Not that we ought absolutely to hate life, which is
justly reckoned to be one of the highest of God&#8217;s blessings; but because
believers ought cheerfully to lay it down, when it retards them from approaching
to Christ; just as a man, when he wishes to make haste in any matter, would
shake off from his shoulders a heavy and disagreeable burden. In short, to love
this life is not in itself wrong, provided that we only pass through it as
pilgrims, keeping our eyes always fixed on our object. For the true limit of
<i>loving life</i>, is, when we continue in it as long as it pleases God, and
when we are prepared to leave it as soon as he shall order us, or &#8212; to
express it in a single word &#8212; when we carry it, as it were, in our hands,
and offer it to God as a sacrifice. Whoever carries his attachment to the
present life beyond this limit, <i>destroys his life</i>; that is, he consigns
it to everlasting ruin. For the word <i>destroy</i>
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpole&gt;sei</font><font face="Palatino">)
does not signify<i> to lose</i>, or to sustain the loss of something valuable,
but to devote it to destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His
soul.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It frequently happens that the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">yuch&gt;</font><font face="Palatino">,
soul, is put for <i>life</i>. Some consider it as denoting, in this passage, the
seat of the affections; as if Christ had said, &#8220;tie who too much indulges
the (desires of his flesh destroys his soul.&#8221; But that is a forced
interpretation, and the other is more natural, that he who disregards his own
life takes the best method of enjoying it eternally.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In this
world.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To make the meaning still more clear,
the phrase <i>in this world</i>, which is but once expressed, ought to be twice
repeated, so that the meaning may be, &#8220;They do not take the proper method
of preserving their life who love it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in this
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but, on the other hand, they truly know
how to preserve their life who despise it <i>in this world</i>.&#8221; And,
indeed, whoever is attached to the world does, of his own accord, deprive
himself of the heavenly life, of which we cannot be heirs in any other way than
by being strangers and foreigners
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The consequence is, that the more
anxious any person is about his own safety, the farther does he remove himself
from the kingdom of God, that is, from the true life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who hateth his
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f351</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I have already suggested that this expression is used comparatively; because we
ought to despise
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
so far as it hinders us from living to God; for if meditation on the heavenly
life were the prevailing sentiment in our hearts:. the world would have no
influence in detaining us. Hence, too, we obtain a reply to an objection that
might be urged. &#8220;Many persons, through despair, or for other reasons, and
chiefly from weariness of life, kill themselves; and yet we will not say that
such persons provide for their own safety, while others are hurried to death by
ambition, who also rush down to ruin.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f352</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But here Christ speaks expressly of that hatred or contempt of this fading life,
which believers derive: from the contemplation of a better life. Consequently,
whoever does not look to heaven, has not yet learned in what way life must be
preserved. Besides, this latter clause was added by Christ, in order to strike
terror into those who are too desirous of the earthly life; for if we are
overwhelmed by the love of the world, so that we cannot easily forget it, it is
impossible for us to go to heaven. But since the Son of God 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f353</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
arouses us so violently, it would be the height of folly to sleep a mortal
sleep.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any, man serve
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That death may not be exceedingly bitter
and disagreeable to us, Christ invites us by his example to submit to it
cheerfully; and certainly we shall be ashamed to refuse the honor of being his
disciples. But on no other condition does he admit us into their number, except
that we follow the path which he points out. He leads the way to us to suffer
death. The bitterness of death is therefore mitigated, and is in some measure
rendered agreeable, when we have in common with the Son of God the condition of
submitting to it. So far is it from being proper that we should shrink from
Christ on account of the cross, that we ought rather to desire death for his
sake. To the same purpose. pose is the statement which immediately
follows:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And where I am, there shall also my
servant be.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For he demands that his servants
should not refuse to submit to death, to which they see him go before them as an
example; for it is not right that; the servant should have any thing separate
from his lord.. The future tense, <i>shall be</i>,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e]stai</font><font face="Palatino">)
is put for <i>let him be</i>, according to the custom of the Hebrew language.
Others regard it as a consolation, as if Christ promised to those who should not
be unwilling to die along with him, that they would be partakers of his
resurrection. But the former view, as I have said, is more probable; for he
afterwards adds the consolation, that the Father will not leave without reward
the servants of Christ who shall have been his companions both in life and in
death.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now is my soul
troubled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This statement appears at first to
differ widely from the preceding discourse. He had displayed extraordinary
courage and magnanimity by exhorting his disciples not only to suffer death, but
willingly and cheerfully to desire it, whenever it is necessary; and now, by
shrinking from death, he confesses his cowardice. Yet there is nothing in this
passage that is not in perfect harmony, as every believer knows by his own
experience. If scornful men laugh at it, we need not wonder; for it cannot be
understood but by practice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, it was highly useful, and even necessary for
our salvation, that the Son of God should have experience of such feelings, In
his death we ought chiefly to consider his atonement, by which he appeased the
wrath and curse of God, which he could not have done, without taking upon
himself our guilt. The death which he underwent must therefore have been full of
horror, because he could not render satisfaction for us, without feeling, in his
own experience, the dreadful judgment of God; and hence we come to know more
fully the enormity of sin, for which the Heavenly Father exacted so dreadful a
punishment from his only-begotten Son. Let us therefore know, that death was not
a sport and amusement to Christ, but that he endured the severest torments on
our account.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor was it unsuitable that the Son of God should be
troubled in this manner; for the Divine nature, being concealed, and not
exerting its force, may be said to have reposed, in order to give an opportunity
of making expiation. But Christ himself was clothed, not only with our flesh,
but with human feelings. In him, no doubt, those feelings were voluntary; for he
feared, not through constraint, but because he had, of his own accord, subjected
himself to fear. And yet we ought to believe, that it was not in pretense, but
in reality, that he feared; though he differed from other men in this respect,
that he had all his feelings regulated in obedience to the righteousness of God,
as we have said elsewhere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is also another advantage which it yields to
us. If the dread of death had occasioned no uneasiness to the Son of God, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f354</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which of us would have thought that his example was applicable to our case? For
it has not been given to us to die without, feeling of regret; but when we learn
that He had not within him a hardness like stone or iron, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f355</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
we summon courage to follow him, and the weakness of the flesh, which makes us
tremble at death, does not hinder us from becoming the companions of our General
in struggling with it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And what shall I,
say?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here we see, as it were, before our eyes,
how much our salvation cost the Son of God, when he was reduced to such
extremity of distress, that he found neither words to express the intensity of
his sorrow, nor yet resolution as man. He betakes himself to prayer, which is
his only remaining resource, and asks to be delivered from death. Again,
perceiving also that, by the eternal purpose of God, he has been appointed to be
a sacrifice for sins, he suddenly corrects that wish which his prodigious sorrow
had wrung from him, and puts forth his hand, as it were, to pull himself back,
that he may entirely acquiesce in the will of his Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this passage we ought to observe five steps. For,
first, there is the complaint, which breaks out from vehement sorrow. Secondly,
he feels that he needs a remedy, and, in order that he may not be overwhelmed
with fear, he puts the question to himself, what he ought to do. Thirdly, he
goes to the Father, and entreats him to deliver him. Fourthly, he recalls the
wish which he knows to be inconsistent with his calling, and chooses rather to
suffer anything than not to fulfill what his Father has enjoined upon him.
Lastly, he is satisfied with the glory of God alone, forgets all things else,
and reckons them of no value.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be thought, that it is unbecoming in the
Son of God rashly to utter a wish which he must immediately retract, in order to
obey his Father. I readily admit, that this is the folly of the cross, which
gives offense to proud men; but the more the Lord of glory humbled himself, so
much the more illustrious is the manifestation of his vast love to us. Besides,
we ought to recollect what I have already stated, that the human feelings, from
which Christ was not exempt, were in him pure and free from sin. The reason is,
that they were guided and regulated in obedience to God; for there is nothing to
prevent Christ from having a natural dread of death, and yet desiring to obey
God. This holds true in various respects: and hence he corrects himself by
saying,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this cause came I into this
hour.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For though he may lawfully entertain a
dread of death, yet, considering why he was sent, and what his office as
Redeemer demands from him, he presents to his Father the dread which arose out
of his natural disposition, in order that it may be subdued, or rather, having
subdued it, he prepares freely and willingly to execute the command of God. Now,
if the feelings of Christ, which were free from all sin, needed to be restrained
in this manner, how earnestly ought we to apply to this object, since the
numerous affections which spring from our flesh are so many enemies to God in
us! Let the godly, therefore, persevere in doing violence to themselves, until
they have denied themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must also be observed, that we ought to restrain
not only those affections which are directly contrary to the will of God, but
those which hinder the progress of our calling, though, in other respects, they
are not wicked or sinful. To make this more fully evident, we ought to place in
the first rank the will of God; in the second, the will of man pure and entire,
such as God gave to Adam, and such as was in Christ: and, lastly, our own, which
is infected by the contagion of sin. The will of God is the rule, to which every
thing that is inferior ought to be subjected. Now, the pure will of nature will
not of itself rebel against God; but man, though he were wholly formed to
righteousness, would meet with many obstructions, unless he subject his
affections to God. Christ, therefore, had but one battle to fight, which was, to
cease to fear what he naturally feared, as soon as he perceived that the
pleasure of God was otherwise. We, on the other hand, have a twofold battle; for
we must struggle with the obstinacy of the flesh. The consequence is, that the
most valiant combatants never vanquish without being wounded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father, save
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the order which ought to be
maintained, whenever we are either distressed by fear, or oppressed with grief.
Our hearts ought instantly to be raised up to God. For there is nothing worse,
or more injurious, than to nourish inwardly what torments us; as we see a great
part of the world consumed by hidden torments, and all who do not rise to God
are justly punished for their indolence by never receiving any
alleviation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father, glorify my
name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words he testifies, that he
prefers the <i>glory</i> of <i>the</i> <i>Father</i> to all things else, and
even neglects and disregards his own life. And the true regulation of all our
desires is, to seek the glory of God in such a manner that all other things
shall give way to it; for it ought to be reckoned by us an abundant recompense,
leading us to endure patiently all that is vexatious or
irksome.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have both glorified
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is as if he had said, I will finish what
I have begun;&#8221; for <i>God never leaveth the work of his hands
imperfect</i> as it is said,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
138:8. But as it is the purpose of God to prevent the offense of the cross, he
not only promises that the death of Christ will be glorious, but also mentions
with commendation the numerous ornaments with which he had already adorned
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That it
thundered.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It was truly monstrous, that the
assembled multitude were unmoved by so evident a miracle. Some are so deaf, that
they hear as a confused sound what God had distinctly pronounced. Others are
less dull of caring, but yet take away much from the majesty of the Divine
voice, by pretending that <i>it was an angel who spoke</i>. But the same thing
is practiced every day; for God speaks plainly enough in the Gospel, in which is
also displayed the power and energy of the Spirit, which ought to shake heaven
and earth; but many are as little affected by the doctrine, as if it only
proceeded from a mortal man, and others consider the word of God to be confused
and barbarous, as if it were nothing else than thunder.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a question arises: Did that voice sound from
heaven without any profit or advantage? I reply, what the Evangelist here
ascribes to the multitude belongs only to a part of them; for there were some
besides the Apostles who did not interpret it so badly. But the Evangelist
intended to point out briefly what is commonly done in the world; and that is,
that the greater part of men, while they hear God, do not hear him though he
speak plainly and distinctly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This voice came not for my
sake.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Had Christ no need of being strengthened,
or did the Father care less for him than for us? But we must attend to this
principle. As it was on our account that Christ clothed himself with flesh, so
all the blessings which he received from the Father were bestowed on our
account. Again, it is also true, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the voice came from heaven</i>
FOR THE SAKE</font><font face="Palatino"> of the people; for he had no need of
an outward miracle. Besides, there is here an indirect reproof, that the Jews
are deaf like stones to the voice of God; for since God speaks
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for their
sake</i></font><font face="Palatino">, there can be no excuse for their
ingratitude, when they do not lend their ears.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now is the judgment of this
world.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Lord now, as if he had already
succeeded in the contest, boasts of having obtained a victory not only over
fear, but over death; for he describes, in lofty terms, the advantage of his
death, which might have struck his disciples with consternation. Some view the
word,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgmen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>t</i>
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pri&gt;siv</font><font face="Palatino">)
as denoting <i>reformation</i>, and others, as denoting <i>condemnation</i>. I
rather agree with the former who explain it to mean, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino"> must be restored to a proper order; for
the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">fp&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>mishpat</i>, which is translated <i>judgment</i>, means a well-ordered state.
Now we know, that out of Christ there is nothing but confusion in <i>the</i>
<i>world</i>; and though Christ had already begun to erect the kingdom of God,
yet his death was the commencement of a well-regulated condition, and the full
restoration of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet it must also be observed, that this proper
arrangement cannot be established in <i>the world</i>, until the kingdom of
Satan be first destroyed, until the flesh, and every thing opposed to the
righteousness of God, be reduced to nothing. Lastly, the renovation of <i>the
world</i> must be preceded by mortification. Accordingly, Christ
declares:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now shall the prince of this world
be cast out;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for the confusion and deformity
arise from this, that while Satan usurps tyrannical dominion, iniquity
everywhere abounds. When Satan has
been</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> cast
out</i></font><font face="Palatino">, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is brought back from its revolt, and
placed under obedience to the government of God. It may be asked, how was Satan
<i>cast out</i> by the death of Christ, since he does not cease to make war
continually? I reply, this <i>casting out</i> must not be limited to any short
period of time, but is a description of that remarkable effect of the death of
Christ which is daily manifested.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I be lifted
up</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Next follows the method by which <i>the
judgment</i> shall be conducted; namely, Christ, being
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lifted
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"> on the cross, shall gather all men to
himself, in order that he may raise them from earth to heaven. The Evangelist
says, that Christ pointed out the manner of his death; and, therefore, the
meaning undoubtedly is, that the cross will be, as it were, a chariot, by which
he shall raise all men, along with himself, to his Father. It might have been
thought, that at that time he was carried away from the earth, so as no longer
to have any interests in common with men; but he declares, that he will go in a
very different manner, so as to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>draw</i></font><font face="Palatino">
upwards to himself those who were fixed on the earth. Now, though he alludes to
the form of his death, yet he means generally, that his death will not be a
division to separate him from men, but that it will be an additional means of
<i>drawing</i> earth upwards towards heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will draw all men to
myself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all,</i></font><font face="Palatino">

they seize on the second clause, and make it a ground of calumny. The origin of
their error was, that they judged of the splendor of Messiah&#8217;s kingdom
according to their carnal views; in consequence of which, they reject Christ
because he does not correspond to their foolish notion. Under the term

gently admonishes them, yet at the same time he reproves them sharply; for he
charges them with shutting their eyes against <i>the light</i>, and at the same
time threatens that ere long the light will be taken away from them. When he
says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yet a little

confirms what he had already said about his death; for though by

his Gospel, yet he alludes to his departure; as if he had said, When I shall
have gone away, I will not cease to be <i>the light</i>, and thus my glory will
not be diminished through your darkness. When he says that <i>the light is with
them</i>, he indirectly reproves them for closing their eyes and shutting out
the light; and thus he declares that they do not deserve an answer to their

too, is the reason why night so thick and dark sat down on the world for many
centuries. It was because there were few who deigned to walk in the brightness
of heavenly wisdom; for Christ enlightens us by his Gospel, in order that we may
follow the way of salvation, which he points out to us. For this reason, they
who do not avail themselves of the grace of God extinguish, as far as lies in

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And though he had done so
many signs.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That no man may be disturbed or
perplexed at seeing that Christ was despised by the Jews, the Evangelist removes
this offense, by showing that he was supported by clear and undoubted
testimonies, which proved that credit was due to him and to his doctrine; but
that the blind did not behold the glory and power of God, which were openly
displayed in his miracles. First, therefore, we ought to believe that it was not
owing to Christ that the Jews did not place confidence in him, because by many
miracles he abundantly testified who he was, and that it was therefore unjust
and highly unreasonable that their unbelief should diminish his authority. But
as this very circumstance might lead many persons to anxious and perplexing
inquiry how the Jews came to be so stupid, that the power of God, though
visible, produced no effect upon them, John proceeds further, and shows that
faith does not proceed from the ordinary faculties of men, but is an uncommon
and extraordinary gift of God, and that this was anciently predicted concerning
Christ, that very few would believe the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>38.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the saying of Isaiah the
prophet might be fulfilled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> John does not mean
that the prediction laid a necessity on the Jews; for Isaiah
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
53:1;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:16) uttered nothing but what the Lord revealed to him from the secret
treasures of his purpose. Indeed, it must have happened, though the prophet had
not spoken of it; but as men would not have known what should take place, if God
had not testified by the mouth of the prophet, the Evangelist places before our
eyes in the prediction, as in a mirror, what would otherwise have appeared to
men obscure and almost incredible.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord, who hath
believed?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This sentence contains two clauses.
In the former, Isaiah, having begun to speak of Christ, fore-seeing that all
that he proclaims concerning Christ, and all that shall afterwards be made known
by the Apostles, will be generally rejected by the Jews, exclaims, as if in
astonishment at something strange and monstrous,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord</i>,<i> who shall believe
our report</i>,</font><font face="Palatino"> or, <i>our speech</i>? 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f358</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To whom hath the arm of the Lord
been revealed?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this second clause he assigns
the reason why they are few; and that reason is, that men do not attain it by
their own strength, and God does not illuminate all without distinction, but
bestows the grace of his Holy Spirit on very few, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f359</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And if among the Jews the obstinate unbelief of many ought not to have been an
obstacle to believers, though they were few in number, the same argument ought
to persuade us, at the present day, not to be ashamed of the Gospel, though it
has few disciples. But we ought first to observe the reason which is added, that
what makes men believers is not their own sagacity, but the revelation of God.
The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>arm,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
it is well known, denotes <i>power</i>. The prophet declares that <i>the arm of
God</i>, which is contained in the doctrine of the Gospel, lies hid until it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>revealed,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and at the same time testifies that all are not indiscriminately partakers of
this <i>revelation</i>. Hence it follows, that many are left in their blindness
destitute of inward light, because <i>hearing they do not hear</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>39.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore they could not
believe.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is somewhat more harsh; because,
if the words be taken in their natural meaning, the way was shut up against the
Jews, and the power of believing was taken from them, because the prediction of
the prophet adjudged them to blindness, before they determined what choice they
should make. I reply, there is no absurdity in this, if nothing could happen
different from what God had foreseen. But it ought to be observed, that the mere
foreknowledge of God is not in itself the cause of events; though, in this
passage, we ought to consider not so much the foreknowledge of God as his
justice and vengeance. For God declares not what he beholds from heaven that men
will do, but what He himself will do; and that is, that he will strike wicked
men with giddiness and stupidity, and thus will take vengeance on their
obstinate wickedness. In this passage he points out the nearer and inferior
cause why God intends that his word, which is in its own nature salutary and
quickening, shall be destructive and deadly to the Jews. It is because they
deserved it by their obstinate wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This punishment it was impossible for them to escape,
because God had once decreed to give them over to a reprobate mind, and to
change the light of his word, so as to make it darkness to them. For this latter
prediction differs from the former in this respect, that in the former passage
the prophet testifies that none believe but those whom God, of his free grace,
enlightens for his own good pleasure, the reason of which does not appear; for
since all are equally ruined, God, of his mere good pleasure, distinguishes from
others those whom he thinks fit to distinguish. But, in the latter passage, he
speaks of the hardness by which God has punished the wickedness of an ungrateful
people. They who do not attend to these steps mistake and confound passages of
Scripture, which are quite different from each other.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>40.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath blinded their eyes,
and hardened their heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The passage is taken
from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
6:9, where the Lord forewarns the prophet, that the labor which he spends in
instructing will lead to no other result than to make the people worse. First
then he says, Go, and tell this people, <i>Hearing</i>,<i> hear and do not
hear</i>; as if he had said, &#8220;I send thee to speak to the deaf.&#8221; He
afterwards adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Harden the heart
of this people</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> &amp;c</i>. By these words
he means, that he intends to make his word a punishment to the reprobate, that
it may render them more thoroughly blind, and that their blindness may be
plunged in deeper darkness. It is indeed a dreadful judgment of God, when He
overwhelms men by the light of doctrine, in such a manner as to deprive them of
all understanding; and when, even by means of that which is their only light, he
brings darkness upon them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it ought to be observed, that it is accidental to
the word of God, that it <i>blinds</i> men; for nothing can be more inconsistent
than that there should be no difference between truth and falsehood, that the
bread of life should become a deadly poison, and that medicine should aggravate
a disease. But this must be ascribed to the wickedness of men, which turns life
into death. It ought also to be observed, that sometimes the Lord, by himself,
blinds the minds of men, by depriving them of judgment and understanding;
sometimes by Satan and false prophets, when he maddens them by their impostures;
sometimes. too by his ministers, when the doctrine of salvation is injurious and
deadly to them. But provided that prophets labor faithfully in the work of
instruction, and commit to the Lord the result of their labor, though they may
not succeed to their wish, they ought not to give way or despond. Let them
rather be satisfied with knowing that God approves of their labor, though it be
useless to men&#8217; and that even <i>the savor</i> of doctrine, which wicked
men render deadly to themselves elves, <i>is good and pleasant to God</i>, as
Paul testifies,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is sometimes in Scripture put for the
seat of the affections; but here, as in many other passages, it denotes what is
called the intellectual part of the soul. To the same purpose Moses
speaks:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">God hath not given you a
heart to understand,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(Deuteronomy
29:4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest they should see with their
eyes.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Let us remember that the prophet speaks
of unbelievers who had already rejected the grace of God. It is certain that all
would continue to be such by nature, if The Lord did not form to obedience to
him those whom he has elected. At first, therefore, the condition of men is
equal and alike, but when reprobate men have, of their own accord, and by their
own wickedness, rebelled against God, they subject themselves to this vengeance,
by which, being given up to a reprobate mind, they continually rush forward more
and more to their own destruction. It is their own fault, therefore, if God does
not choose to convert them, because they were the cause of their own despair. We
are briefly instructed also, by these words of the prophet, what is the
beginning of our conversion to God. It is when he enlightens the hearts, which
must have been turned away from him, so long as they were held by the darkness
of Satan; but, on the contrary, such is the power of Divine light, that it
attracts us to itself, and forms us to the image of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I should heal
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He next adds the fruit of conversion,
that is, <i>healing</i>. By this word the prophet means the blessing of God and
a prosperous condition, and likewise deliverance from all the miseries which
spring from the wrath of God. Now, if this happens to the reprobate, contrary to
the nature of the word, we ought to attend to the contrast implied in the,
opposite use of it; namely, that the purpose for which the word of God is
preached is, to enlighten us in the true knowledge of God, to turn us to God,
and reconcile us to him, that we may be happy and blessed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>41.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These things spoke
Jesus.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Lest readers should think that this
prediction was inappropriately quoted, John expressly states, that the prophet
was not sent as a teacher to a single age, but, on the contrary, that the glory
of Christ was exhibited to him, that he might be a witness of those things which
should take place under his reign. Now the Evangelist takes for granted, that
Isaiah saw the glory of Christ; and hence he infers, that Isaiah accommodates
his instruction to the future state of Christ&#8217;s kingdom.</font><br></div>

fierceness of the Jews, in rejecting Christ, having risen to such a height of
insolence, it might have been thought that all the people, without exception,
conspired against him. But the Evangelist says that, amidst the general madness
of the nation, there were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>many</i></font><font face="Palatino">
who were of a sound mind. A striking instance, truly, of the grace of God; for,
when ungodliness has once prevailed, it is a sort of universal plague, which
infects with its contagion every part of the body. It is therefore a remarkable
gift, and special grace of God, when, amidst a people so corrupt, there are some
who remain untainted. And yet we now perceive in the world the same grace of
God; for though ungodliness and contempt of God abound everywhere, and though a
vast multitude of men make furious attempts to exterminate utterly the doctrine
of the Gospel, yet it always finds some places of retreat; and thus faith has
&#8212; what may be called &#8212; its harbors or places of refuge, that it may
not be entirely banished from the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word <i>even</i> is emphatic; for in the order of
<i>the rulers</i>, there existed so deep and inveterate a hatred of the Gospel,
that it could scarcely be believed that a single believer could be found amongst
them. So much the greater admiration was due to the power of the Spirit of God,
which entered where no opening was made; though it was not a vice, peculiar to a
single age, that <i>rulers</i> were rebellious and disobedient to Christ; for
honor, and wealth, and high rank, are usually accompanied by pride. The
consequence is, that they who, swelled with arrogance, scarcely acknowledge
themselves to be men, are not easily subdued by voluntary humility. Whoever,
then, holds a high station in the world, will, if he is wise, look with
suspicion on his rank, that it may not stand in his way. When the Evangelist
says that there were <i>many</i>, this must not be understood as if they were
the majority or the half; for, as compared with others who were vastly numerous,
they were few, but yet they were <i>many</i>, when viewed in
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of the
Pharisees.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It may be thought that he speaks
incorrectly, when he separates faith from <i>confession</i>;
for</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">with the heart we believe
to righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451010&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
10:10)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and it is impossible that the faith, which has been
kindled in the heart, shall not put forth its flame. I reply, he points out here
how weak was the faith of those men who were so lukewarm, or rather cold. In
short, John means that they embraced the doctrine of Christ, because they knew
that it had come from God, but that they have not a lively faith, or a faith so
vigorous as it ought to have been; for Christ does not grant to his followers a
spirit of fear, but of firmness, that they may boldly and fearlessly confess
what they have learned from him. Yet I do not think that they were altogether
silent; but as their <i>confession</i> was not sufficiently open, the
Evangelist, in my opinion, simply declares that they did not make profession of
their faith; for the proper kind of profession was, openly to declare that they
were the disciples of Christ. Let no man, therefore, flatter himself who, in any
respect, conceals or dissembles his faith for fear of incurring the hatred of
men; for however hateful the name of Christ may be, that cowardice which compels
us to turn aside, in the smallest degree, from the confession of him, admits of
no excuse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must also be observed, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rulers</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">have less rigor and firmness, because ambition
almost always reigns in them, which is the most slavish of all dispositions;
and, to express it in a single word, earthly honors may be said to be golden
fetters, which bind a man, so that he cannot perform his duty with freedom. On
this account, persons who are placed in a low and mean condition ought to bear
their lot with the greater patience, for they are, at least, delivered from many
very bad snares. Yet the great and noble ought to struggle against their high
rank, that it may not hinder them from submitting to Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">John says that they were afraid of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Pharisees;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> not that the other scribes and
priests freely permitted any man to call himself a disciple of Christ, but
because, under the semblance of zeal, cruelty burned in them with greater
fierceness. Zeal, in defending religion, is, indeed, an excellent virtue; but if
hypocrisy be added to it, no plague can be more dangerous. So much the more
earnestly ought we to entreat the Lord to guide us by the unerring rule of his
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest they should be thrown out of
the synagogue. </i></font><font face="Palatino">This was what hindered them, the
fear of disgrace; for they would have been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thrown out of the
synagogue</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Hence we see how great is the
perversity of men, which not only corrupts and debases the best of God&#8217;s
ordinances, but turns them into destructive tyranny. Excommunication ought to
have been the sinew of holy discipline, that punishment might be ready to be
inflicted, if any person despised the Church. But matters had come to such a
pitch, that any one who confessed that he belonged to Christ was banished from
the society of believers. In like manner, at the present day, the Pope, in order
to exercise the same kind of tyranny, falsely pretends to a right of
excommunicating, and not only thunders with blind rage against all the godly,
but endeavors to cast down Christ from his heavenly throne; and yet he does not
hesitate impudently to hold out the right of sacred jurisdiction, with which
Christ has adorned his Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>43.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they loved the glory of
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Evangelist expressly states that those
men were not guided by any superstition, but only endeavored to avoid disgrace
among men; for if ambition had greater influence over them than the fear of God,
it follows, that it was no vain scruple of conscience that gave them uneasiness.
Now, let the reader observe how great ignominy is incurred before God, by the
cowardice of those who, from the fear of being hated, dissemble their faith
before men. Can any thing be more foolish, or rather, can any thing be more
beastly, than to prefer the silly applause of men to the judgment of God? But he
declares that all who shrink from the hatred of men, when the pure faith ought
to be confessed, are seized with this kind of madness. And justly; for the
apostle, in applauding the unshaken steadiness of Moses, says
that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">he remained firm, as if
he had seen him who is
invisible,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581127&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
11:27.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By these words he means that, when any person has
fixed his eyes on God, his heart will be invincible, and utterly incapable of
being moved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whence, therefore, comes the effeminacy 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f360</font></sup><font face="Palatino">,
which causes us to give way to treacherous hypocrisy, but because, at the sight
of the world, all our senses grow dull? For a true sight of God would instantly
chase away all the mists of wealth and honors. Away with those who look upon an
indirect denial of Christ as some trivial offense, or, as they call it, a venial
sin! For, on the contrary, the Holy Spirit declares that it is more base and
monstrous than if heaven and earth were mingled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To love the glory of
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"> means, in this passage, to desire to enjoy
reputation among men. The Evangelist, therefore, means, that those men were so
much devoted to the world, that they were more desirous to please men than to
please God. Besides, when he accuses of this crime those who denied Christ, he,
at the same time, shows that the excommunication, which the priests abused,
contrary to all that was right and lawful, had no value or efficacy. Let us
know, therefore, that all the excommunications which the Pope now mutters
against us are mere bugbears to frighten children, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f361</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
since we are fully convinced, in our own consciences, that he aims at nothing
else than to lead us away from Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>44.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jesus cried.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The object of Christ, in this statement, is to
encourage his followers to a proper and unshaken steadfastness of faith; but it
contains also an implied reproof, by which he intended to correct that perverse
fear. The <i>cry</i> is expressive of vehemence; for it is not a simple
doctrine, but an exhortation intended to excite them more powerfully. The
statement amounts to this, that faith in Christ does not rely on any mortal man,
but on God; for it finds in Christ nothing but what is divine, or rather, it
beholds God in his face. Hence he infers, that it is foolish and unreasonable
for faith to be wavering or doubtful; for it is impossible to offer a greater
insult to God, than not to rely on his truth. Who is it then that has duly
profited by the Gospel? It is he who, relying or this confidence, that he does
not believe men but God, quietly and steadily contends against all the
machinations of Satan. If, then, we would render to God the honor due to him, we
must learn to remain firm in faith, not only though the world were shaken, but
even though Satan should disturb and overturn all that is under
heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that believeth on me believeth
not on me, but on him that sent me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
Believers </i>are said<i> not to believe on Christ</i>, when they do not fix
their whole attention on his human countenance. Comparing himself with the
Father, he bids us look at the power of God; for the weakness of the flesh has
no firmness in</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">itself. When we shall, afterwards, find him exhorting
the disciples to <i>believe on him</i>, it will be in a different sense; for, in
that passage, God is not contrasted with man, but Christ is brought forward with
all his gifts and graces 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f362</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which ought to be sufficient for upholding our faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>45.

me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>see</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">is here taken for <i>knowledge</i>; for, in order
to give true and thorough tranquillity to our consciences, which would otherwise
have been constantly liable to various agitations, he sends us to the Father.
The reason why the stability of faith is firm and secure is, that it is stronger
than the world, and is above the world. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f363</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now, when Christ is truly known, the glory of God shines in him, that we may be
fully persuaded that the faith which we have in him does not depend on man, but
that it is founded on the eternal God; for it rises from the flesh of Christ to
his Divinity. And, if it be so, not only must it be fixed perpetually in our
hearts, but it must likewise show itself boldly in the tongue, when it is
necessary.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>46.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am come into the worm as a
light.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In order to render his disciples more
bold and persevering, he proceeds still farther in maintaining the certainty of
faith. And, first, he testifies that <i>he came into the world to be a
light</i>, by which men might be delivered from darkness and errors; and, at the
same time, he points out the means of obtaining so great a benefit, when he
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, that whosoever believeth in
me may not remain in darkness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Besides, he
accuses of ingratitude all who, after having been taught by the Gospel, do not
separate themselves from unbelievers; for the higher the excellence of this
benefit, of being called from darkness <i>to light</i>, the less excusable are
they who, through their indolence or carelessness, quench the light that had
been kindled in them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am come into the world as a
light,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> are highly emphatic; for though Christ
was <i>a light</i> from the beginning, yet there is a good reason why he adorns
himself with this title, that he has come to perform the part of <i>a light</i>.
That we may perceive distinctly the various steps, he shows, first, that he is
<i>a light</i> to others rather than to himself; secondly, that he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
light,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> not only to angels, but also to men;
thirdly, that he was manifested in the flesh, in order that he might shine with
full brightness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The term,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whosoever,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
appears to have been added on purpose, partly, that all believers, without
exception, may enjoy this benefit ill common, and partly, to show that the
reason why unbelievers perish in darkness is, that, of their own accord, they
forsake <i>the light</i>. Now, if the whole wisdom of the world were collected
into one mass, not a single ray of the true <i>light</i> would be found in that
vast heap; but, contrary, it will be a confused chaos; for it belongs to Christ
alone to deliver us from darkness.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any man hear my
words.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having spoken concerning his
grace, and exhorted his disciples to steady faith, he now begins to strike the
rebellious, though even here he mitigates the severity due to the wickedness of
those who deliberately &#8212; as it were &#8212; reject God; for he delays to
pronounce <i>judgment</i> on them, because, on the contrary, he has come for the
salvation of all. In the first place, we ought to understand that he does not
speak here of all unbelievers without distinction, but of those who, knowingly
and willingly, reject the doctrine of the Gospel which has been exhibited to
them. Why then does Christ not choose to condemn them? It is because he lays
aside for a time the office of a <i>judge</i>, and offers salvation to all
without reserve, and stretches out his arms to embrace all, that all may be the
more encouraged to repent. And yet there is a circumstance of no small moment,
by which he points out the aggravation of the crime, if they reject an
invitation so kind and gracious, for it is as if he had said, &#8220;Lo, I am
here to invite all, and, forgetting the character of a judge, I have this as my
single object, to persuade all, and to rescue from destruction those who are
already twice ruined.&#8221; No man, therefore, is condemned on account of
having despised the Gospel, except he who, disdaining the lovely message of
salvation, has chosen of his own accord to draw down destruction on
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judge,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
as is evident from the word save, which is contrasted with it, here signifies to
<i>condemn</i>. Now this ought to be understood as referring to the office which
properly and naturally belongs to Christ; for that unbelievers are not more
severely <i>condemned</i> on account of the Gospel is accidental, and does not
arise from its nature, as we have said on former occasions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>48.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
He who rejecteth me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That wicked men may not
flatter themselves as if their unbounded disobedience to Christ would pass
unpunished, he, adds here a dreadful threatening, that though he were to do
nothing in this matter, yet his doctrine alone would be sufficient to condemn
them, as he says elsewhere, that there would be no need of any other judge than
Moses, in whom they boasted,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430545&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
5:45.) The meaning, therefore, is: &#8220;Burning with ardent desire to promote
your salvation, I do indeed abstain from exercising my right to condemn you, and
am entirely employed in saving what is lost; but do not think that you have
escaped out of the hands of God; for though I should altogether hold my peace,
<i>the word</i> alone, which you have despised, is sufficient to <i>judge</i>
you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And receiveth not my
words.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This latter clause is an explanation of
the former; for since hypocrisy is natural to men, nothing is easier for them
than to boast in words that they are ready to receive Christ; and we see how
common this boasting is even amongst the most wicked men. We must therefore
attend to this definition, that Christ is <i>rejected</i> when we do not embrace
the pure doctrine of the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Loudly do the Papists, indeed, proclaim this word
which Christ uttered; but as soon as his pure truth is brought forward, nothing
is more hateful to them. Such persons kiss Christ in the same manner as Judas
kissed him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402649&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
26:49.) Let us therefore learn to receive him along with <i>his word</i>, and to
render to him that homage and obedience which he demands as his sole
right.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The word which I speak shall judge
you at the last day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is impossible to give a
nobler or more magnificent title to the Gospel than to, ascribe to it the power
of judging; for, according to these words, the last judgment shall be nothing
else than an approbation or ratification 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f365</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the doctrine of the Gospel. Christ himself will indeed ascend the tribunal,
but he declares that he will pronounce the sentence according to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"> which is now preached. This threatening
ought to strike deep? terror into the ungodly, since they cannot escape the
<i>judgment</i> of that doctrine which they now so haughtily
disdain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when Christ mentions the last judgment, he means
that they are now destitute of understanding; for he reminds them that the
punishment which they now treat with mockery will then be openly displayed. On
the other hand, it yields to the godly an invaluable consolation, that to
whatever extent. they may be now condemned by the world, still they do not doubt
that they are already acquitted in heaven; for, wherever the faith of the Gospel
has its seat, the tribunal of God is erected to save. Relying on this right, we
need not trouble ourselves about Papists or their absurd decisions; for our
faith rises even above angels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>49.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I do not speak from
myself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That the outward appearance of man may
not lessen the majesty of God, Christ frequently sends us to the Father. This is
the reason why he so often mentions the Father; and, indeed, since it would be
unlawful to transfer to another a single spark of the Divine glory,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
word,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to which <i>judgment</i> is ascribed,
must have proceeded from God. Now Christ here distinguishes himself from the
Father, not simply as to his Divine Person, but rather as to his flesh; lest the
doctrine should be judged after the manner of men, and, therefore, should have
less weight. But if consciences were subject to the laws and doctrine of men,
this argument of Christ would not apply, &#8220;My word (he says) will judge,
because it has not proceeded from man;&#8221; according to that
saying,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We may likewise infer from it, how monstrous, is the
sacrilege of the Pope in daring to bind souls by his inventions; for in this way

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before the feast of the

things which, he knew, had been related by Matthew and others. He undertakes to
explain those circumstances which they had left out, one of which was the
narrative of the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>washing of
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And though he will afterwards explain
more clearly for what purpose Christ
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>washed</i> <i>the
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of his disciples, yet, before doing so, he
states, in a single word, that the Lord testified, by this visible sign, that
the love with which he embraced them was firm and lasting; that, though they
were deprived of his presence, they might still be convinced that death itself
would not quench this love. This conviction ought now to be fixed also in our
hearts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The words are, that Christ
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>loved even to the end his own,
who were in the world.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Why does he employ this
circumlocution in describing the Apostles, but in order to inform us that, in
consequence of their being engaged, as we are, in a hazardous and difficult
warfare, Christ regarded them with so much the greater solicitude? And,
therefore, though we think that we are at a distance from Christ, yet we ought
to know that he is looking at us; for <i>he loveth his own</i>,<i> who are in
the world</i>; for we, have no reason to doubt that he still bears the same
affection which he retained at the very moment of his death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To remove from this world to the
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This phrase is worthy of notice; for it
refers to the knowledge of Christ, that he knew that his death was a
<i>passage</i> to the heavenly kingdom of God. And if, while he was hastening
thither, he did not cease to regard
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
own</i></font><font face="Palatino"> with his wonted love, there is no reason
why we should now think that his affection is changed. Now, since he is the
first-born from the dead, this definition of death applies to the whole body of
the Church, that it is an opening or passage to go to God, from whom believers
are now absent.

We shall afterwards take into consideration, at the proper place, the whole of
Christ&#8217;s design in </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>washing
the feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of his disciples, and the advantage to
be derived from this narrative. Let us now attend to the connection of the
words. The Evangelist says that this was done, while Judas already resolved to
betray Christ, not only to show the wonderful patience of Christ, who could
endure to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wash the
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of such a wicked and detestable traitor;
but also that he purposely selected the time when he was near death, for
performing what may be regarded as the last act of his life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The devil having already put it
into the heart of Judas.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When the Evangelist
says that Judas had been impelled by <i>the devil</i> to form the design of
<i>betraying</i> Christ, this tends to show the enormity of the crime; for it
was dreadful and most atrocious wickedness, in which the efficacy of Satan was
openly displayed. There is no wickedness, indeed, that is perpetrated by men, to
which Satan does not excite them, but the more hideous and execrable any crime
is, the more ought we to view in it the <i>rage of the devil</i>, who drives
about, in all possible directions, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f369</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
men who have been forsaken by God. But though the lust of men is kindled into a
fiercer flame by Satan&#8217;s fan, still it does not cease to be a furnace; it
contains the flame kindled within itself, it receives with avidity the agitation
of the fan, so that no excuse is left for wicked men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Jesus, knoweth that the Father had given all things into his
hands.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I am of opinion that this was added for
the purpose of informing us whence Christ obtained such a well-regulated
composure of mind. It was because, having already obtained a victory over death,
he raised his mind to the glorious triumph which was speedily to follow. It
usually happens, that men seized with fear are greatly agitated. The Evangelist
means, that no agitation of this sort was to be found in Christ, because, though
he was to be immediately betrayed by Judas, still he knew that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Father had given all things
into his hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It may be asked, How then was he
reduced to such a degree of sadness that he sweat blood? I reply, both were
necessary. It was necessary that he should have a dread of death, and it was
necessary that, notwithstanding of this, he should fearlessly discharge every
thing that belonged to the office of the Mediator.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And layeth aside his

his <i>upper garment</i>, not his <i>coat</i>; for we know that the inhabitants
of Eastern countries wore long <i>garments</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And began to wash the feet of his disciples.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
These words express the design of Christ, rather than the outward act; for the
Evangelist adds, that he began with Peter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord, dost thou wash my
feet?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This speech expresses strong dislike of
the action as foolish and unsuitable; for by asking what Christ is doing, he
puts out his hand, as it were, to push him back. The modesty would be worthy of
commendation, were it not that obedience is of greater value in the sight of God
than any kind of honor or service, or rather, if this were not the true and only
rule of humility, to yield ourselves in obedience to God, and to have all our
senses regulated by his good pleasure, so that every thing which he declares to
be agreeable to Him shall also be approved by us, without any scruple. We ought,
therefore, above all, to observe this rule of serving God, that we shall be
always ready to acquiesce, without delay, as soon as he issues any
command.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What I
do.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We are taught by these words, that we ought
simply to obey Christ, even though we should not perceive the reason why he
wishes this or that thing to be done. In a well-regulated house, one person, the
head of the family, has the sole fight to say what ought to be done; and the
servants are bound to employ their hands and feet in his service. That man,
therefore, is too haughty, who refuses to obey the command of God, because he
does not know the reason of it. But this admonition has a still more extensive
meaning, and that is, that we should not take it ill to be ignorant of those
things which God wishes to be hidden from us for a time; for this kind of
ignorance is more learned than any other kind of knowledge, when we permit God
to be wise above us.</font><br></div>

feet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hitherto Peter&#8217;s modesty was
excusable, though it was not free from blame; but now he errs more grievously,
when he has been corrected, and yet does not yield. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f371</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And, indeed, it is a common fault, that ignorance is closely followed by
obstinacy. It is a plausible excuse, no doubt, that the refusal springs from
reverence for Christ; but since he does not absolutely obey the injunction, the
very desire of showing his respect for Christ loses all its gracefulness. The
true wisdom of faith, therefore, is to approve and embrace with reverence
whatever proceeds from God, as done with propriety and in good order; nor is
there any other way, indeed, in which his name can be sanctified by us; for if
we do not believe that whatever he does is done for a very good reason:, our
flesh, being naturally stubborn, will continually murmur, and will not render to
God the honor due to him, unless by constraint. In short, until a man renounce
the liberty of judging as to the works of God, whatever exertions he may make to
honor God, still pride will always lurk under the garb of
humility.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I wash thee
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This reply of Christ does not yet explain
the reason why he resolved to <i>wash the feet of his disciples</i>; only by a
comparison drawn from the soul to the body, he shows that, in washing the feet
of his disciples, he does nothing that is unusual or inconsistent with his rank.
Meanwhile, the reply points out the folly of Peter&#8217;s wisdom. The same
thing will always happen to us, whenever the Lord begins to contend with us. So
long as he remains silent, men imagine that they have a good right to differ
from him: but nothing is easier far him than to refute, by a single word, all
the plausible arguments which they employ. As Christ is Lord and Master, Peter
thinks it inconsistent that Christ should wash his feet. But the evil is, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f372</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that, in refusing such a service, he rejects the principal part of his own
salvation. There is also a general doctrine contained in this statement, that we
are all filthy and abominable in the sight of God, until Christ <i>wash</i> away
our stains. Now, since he claims for himself the exclusive right of
<i>washing</i>, let every man present himself, o be cleansed from his pollution,
that he may obtain a place among the children of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But before proceeding farther, we must understand
what is the meaning of the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wash.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Some refer it to the free pardon of sins; others, to newness of life; while a
third class extends it to. both, and this last view I cheerfully admit. For
Christ <i>washes</i> us when he removes the guilt of our sins by his atoning
sacrifice, that they may not come into judgment before God; and, on the other
hand, he <i>washes</i> us when he takes away, by his Spirit, the wicked and
sinful desires of the flesh. But as it will shortly afterwards be evident from
what follows, that he speaks of the grace of regeneration, I do not absolutely
maintain the opinion that he included here the <i>washing</i> of
pardon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord, not my feet
only</i></font><font face="Palatino">. When Peter heard that he was ruined, if
he did not accept the cleansing which was offered to him by Christ, this
necessity proved, at length, to be a sufficient instructor to tame him. He
therefore lays aside opposition and yields, but wishes to be entirely washed,
and, indeed, acknowledges that, for his own part, he is altogether covered with
pollution, and, therefore, that it is doing nothing, if he be only <i>washed</i>
in one part. But here too he goes wrong through thoughtlessness, in treating, as
a thing of no value, the benefit which he had already received; for he speaks as
if he had not yet obtained any pardon of sins, or any sanctification by the Holy
Spirit. On this account, Christ justly reproves him, for he recalls to his
recollection what he had formerly bestowed on him; at the same time, reminding
all his disciples in the person of one man, that, while they remembered the
grace which they had received, they should consider what they still needed for
the future.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who is washed needeth not
to wash more than his feet, but is altogether
clean.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> First, he says that believers are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>altogether
clean;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> not that they are in every respect pure,
so that there no longer remains in them any stain, but because they are cleansed
in their chief part; that is, when sin is deprived of its kingly power, so that
the righteousness of God holds the superiority; just as if we were to say, that
a body was altogether healthy, Because it was not infected with any universal
disease. It is by newness of life, therefore, that we must testify ourselves to
be the disciples of Christ, for he declares that he is the Author of purity in
all his followers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again, the other comparison was also applied to the
case in hand, that Peter might not set aside the washing of <i>the feet</i> as
foolish; for, as Christ washes from the head to <i>the feet</i>, those whom he
receives as his disciples, so, in those whom he has cleansed, the lower part
remains to be daily cleansed. The children of God are not altogether regenerated
on the first day, so as to aim at nothing but the heavenly life; but, on the
contrary, the remains of the flesh continue to dwell in them, with which they
maintain a continued struggle throughout their whole life. The term <i>feet</i>,
therefore, is metaphorically applied to all the passions and cares by which we
are brought into contact with the world; for, if the Holy Spirit occupied every
part of us, we would no longer have anything to do with the pollutions of the
world; but now, by that part in which we are carnal, we creep on the ground, or
at least fix our feet ill the clay, and, therefor are to some extent unclean.
Thus Christ always finds in us something to cleanse. What is here spoken of is
not the forgiveness of sins, but the renewal, by which Christ, by gradual and
uninterrupted succession, delivers his followers entirely from the sinful
desires of the flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And you are
clean.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This proposition may be said to be the
minor in the syllogism, and hence it follows that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the washing of the
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"> applies to them with strict
propriety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But not
all.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This exception is added, that every one
may examine himself, if Judas may perhaps be moved by a feeling of repentance;
though he intended by it to take an early opportunity of fortifying the rest of
the disciples, that they might not be perplexed by the atrocity of the crime,
which was soon afterwards to be made known. Yet he purposely abstains from
naming him, that he may not shut against him the gate of repentance. As that
hardened hypocrite 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f373</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
was utterly desperate, the warning served only to aggravate his guilt; but it
was of great advantage to the other disciples, for by means of it the Divinity
of Christ was more fully made known to them, and they likewise perceived that
purity is no ordinary gift of the Holy Spirit.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When then he had washed their
feet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Christ at length explains what was his
intention in <i>washing the feet</i> of his disciples; for what he had said
about the spiritual washing was a sort of digression from his main design. Had
it not been for the opposition made by Peter, Christ would not have spoken on
that subject. Now, therefore, he discloses the reason of what he had done;
namely, that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who is the Master
and Lord of all gave an example</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to be followed
by all the godly, that none might grudge to descend to do a service to his
brethren and equals, however mean and low that service might be. For the reason
why the love of the brethren is despised is, that every man thinks more highly
of himself than he ought, and despises almost every other person. Nor did he
intend merely to inculcate modesty, but likewise to lay down this rule of
brotherly love, that they should serve one another; for there is no brotherly
love where there is not a voluntary subjection in assisting a
neighbor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Know you what I have
done?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We see that Christ, for a short time,
concealed his intention from his disciples, but that, after having tried their
obedience, he seasonably revealed to them that which it was not expedient for
them previously to know. Nor does he now wait till they ask, but of his own
accord anticipates them. The same thing will be experienced by us also, provided
that we suffer ourselves to be guided by his hand, even through unknown
ways.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If then I, who am your Lord
and Master.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is an argument from the
greater to the less. Pride hinders us from maintaining that equality which ought
to exist amongst us. But Christ, who is far exalted above all others, stoops
down, that he may make the proud men ashamed, who, forgetting their station and
rank, look upon themselves as not bound to hold intercourse with the brethren.
For what does a mortal man imagine himself to be, when he refuses to bear the
burdens of brethren, to accommodate himself to their customs, and, in short, to
perform those offices by which the unity of the Church is maintained? In short,
he means that the man who does not think of associating with weak brethren, on
the condition of submitting mildly and gently even to offices which appear to be
mean, claims more than he has a right to claim, and has too high an opinion of
himself. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f376</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I have given you an
example.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It deserves our attention that Christ
says that he <i>gave an example</i>; for we are not at liberty to take all his
actions, without reserve, as subjects of imitation. The Papists boast that, by
Christ&#8217;s example, they observe the forty days&#8217; fast, or Lent. But we
ought first to see whether or not he intended to lay down his fast as an example
that the disciples might conform to it as a rule. We read: nothing of this sort,
and, therefore, the imitation of it is not less wicked than if they attempted to
fly to heaven. Besides, when they ought to have followed Christ, they were not
imitators, but apes. Every year they have a fashion of washing some
people&#8217;s feet, as if it were a farce which they were playing on the stage;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f377</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and so, when they have performed this idle and unmeaning ceremony, they think
that they have fully discharged their duty, and reckon themselves at liberty to
despise their brethren during the rest of the year. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f378</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But &#8212; what is far worse 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f379</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; after having washed the feet of twelve men, they subject every member of
Christ to cruel torture, and thus spit in Christ&#8217;s face. This display of
buffoonery, therefore, is nothing else than a shameful mockery of Christ. At all
events, Christ does not here enjoin an annual ceremony, but bids us be ready,
throughout our whole life, to wash the feet of our brethren and neighbors.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.

admit of a far more extensive application, but which ought to be accommodated to
the case in hand. In my opinion, therefore, they are mistaken who suppose them
to have a general acceptation, as if Christ were now exhorting his disciples to
bear the cross; for it is more correct to say that he employed them to serve his
purpose.</font><br></div>

unless it produce such an effect on believers as to lead them to conform
themselves to their Head. On the contrary, it is a vain imagination, when we
look upon Christ, and the things which belong to Christ, as separate from
ourselves. We may infer from this that, until a man has learned to yield to his
brethren, he does not <i>know</i> if Christ be <i>the Master</i>. Since there is
no man who performs his duty to his brethren hi all respects, and since there
are many who are careless and sluggish in brotherly offices, this shows us that
we are still at a great distance from the full light of faith.</font><br></div>

the disciples who, in reality, is the very reverse of a disciple; and he does
so, partly for the sake of Judas, in order to render him the more inexcusable,
and partly for the sake of the others, &#8216;That they may not be overpowered
by the ruin of Judas. Not only does he encourage them still to persevere in
their calling when Judas falls away; but as the happiness which he speaks of is
not common to all, he exhorts them to desire it with so much the greater
eagerness, and to adhere to it the more firmly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I know whom I have
chosen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This very circumstance &#8212; that
they will persevere &#8212; he ascribes to their <i>election</i>; for the virtue
of men, being frail, would tremble at every breeze, and would be laid down by
the feeblest stroke, if the Lord did not uphold it by his hand. But as he
governs those whom he has <i>elected</i>, all the engines which Satan can employ
will not prevent them from persevering to the end with unshaken firmness. And
not only does he ascribe to election their perseverance, but likewise the
commencement of their piety. Whence does it arise that one man, rather than
another, devotes himself to the word of God? It is, because he was elected.
Again, whence does it arise that this man makes progress, and continues to lead
a good and holy life, but because the purpose of God is unchangeable, to
complete the work which was begun by his hand? In short, this is the source of
the distinction between the children of God and unbelievers, that the former are
drown to salvation by the Spirit of adoption, while the latter are hurried to
destruction by their flesh, which is under no restraint. Otherwise Christ might
have said, &#8220;know what kind of person each of you will be;&#8221; but that
they may not claim anything for themselves, but, on the contrary, may
acknowledge that, by the grace of God alone, and not by their own virtue, they
differ from Judas, he places before them that election by free grace on which
they are founded. Let us, therefore, learn that every part of our salvation
depends on election.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In another passage he includes Judas in the number of
the <i>elect</i>.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Have not I chosen (or,
elected) you twelve,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and one of you
is a devil?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430670&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
6:70.)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f382</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But in that passage the mode of expression, though
different, is not opposite&#8217;, for there the word denotes a temporal
<i>election</i>, by which God appoints us to any particular work; in the same
manner as Saul, who was <i>elected</i> to be a king, and yet was a reprobate.
But here Christ speaks of the eternal <i>election</i>, by which we become the
children of God, and by which God predestinated us to life before the creation
of the world. And, indeed, the reprobate are sometime, endued by God with the
gifts of the Spirit, to execute the office with which he invests them. Thus, in
Saul, we perceive, for a time, the splendor of royal virtues, and thus Judas
also was distinguished by eminent gifts, and such as were adapted to an apostle
of Christ. But this is widely different from the sanctification of the Holy
Spirit, which the Lord bestows on none but his own children; for he renews them
in understanding and heart, that they may be holy and unblameable in his sight.
Besides, that sanctification has a deep root in them, which cannot be removed;
because the adoption of God is without repentance. Meanwhile, let us regard it
as a settled point, that it results from the election of God, when, having
embraced by faith the doctrine of Christ, we also follow it during our life; and
that this is the only cause of our happiness, by which we are distinguished from
the reprobate; for they, being destitute of the grace of the Spirit, miserably
perish, while we have Christ for our guardian, who guides us by his hand, and
upholds us by his power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, Christ gives here a clear proof of his
Divinity; first, when he declares that he does not judge after the manner of
men; and, secondly, when he pronounces himself to be the Author of
<i>election</i>. For when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
know</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the <i>knowledge</i>, of which he speaks,
belongs peculiarly to God; but the second proof &#8212; contained in the words,
<i>whom I have</i> <i>chosen</i> &#8212; is far more powerful, for he testifies
that they who were <i>elected</i> before the creation of the world were
<i>elected</i> by himself. So remarkable a demonstration of his Divine power
ought to affect us more deeply, than if the Scripture had called him God a
hundred times.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the Scripture may be
fulfilled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It might have been thought improper
that one should have been <i>elected</i> to so honorable a rank, who yet did not
possess true piety; for it might readily have been objected, Why did not Christ
<i>elect</i> one whom he intended to admit into the number of the Apostles? or
rather Why did he appoint a man to be an Apostle, who, he well knew, would
become so wicked? He explains that this must have happened, because it was
foretold; of at least, that it was no new occurrence, for David had experienced
the same thing. For some think that it is a prediction quoted, which properly
applies to Christ; while others think that it is merely a comparison, that, as
David was basely betrayed by a private enemy, so a similar condition awaits the
children of God. According to the latter, the meaning would be: That one of my
disciples wickedly betrays his Master, is not the first instance of treachery
that has taken place in the world; but, on the contrary, we now experience what
Scripture declares to have happened in ancient times.&#8221; But, as in David
there was shadowed out what was afterwards to be seen more fully in Christ, I
readily agree with the former expositors, who think that this was strictly the
fulfillment of that which David, by the Spirit of prophecy, had foretold,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;194109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
41:9.) Besides, some are of opinion that the clause under consideration does not
contain a complete sense, and needs to have the principal verb supplied. But if
we read it continuously, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the
Scripture may be fulfilled</i>,<i> he who eateth bread with me lifteth up his
heel against me</i>,</font><font face="Palatino"> there will be nothing
wanting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To lift up the
heel</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is a metaphorical expression, and means,
to attack a person in an unperceived manner, under the pretense of friendship,
so as to gain an advantage over him, when he is not on his guard. Now what
Christ suffered, who is our Head and our Pattern, we, who are his members, ought
to endure patiently. And, indeed, it has usually happened in the Church in
almost every age, that it has had no enemies more inveterate than the members of
the Church; and, therefore, that believers may not have their minds disturbed by
such atrocious wickedness, let them accustom themselves early to endure the
attacks of traitors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I tell you this now, before
it happen. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By this statement he reminds his
disciples that, when one of their number becomes a reprobate, this is so far
from being a good reason for their being discouraged, that it ought to be a more
full confirmation of their faith. For if we did not see before our eyes, in the
Church, what has been foretold about her distresses and struggles, a doubt might
justly arise in our minds, Where are the prophecies? But when the truth of
Scripture agrees with our daily experience,<sup>17</sup> then do we perceive
more clearly, that God takes care of us, and that we are governed by his
providence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That you may believe that I
am.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f383</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By the phrase,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that I
am,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means that he is that Messiah who had
been promised; not that the conduct of Judas, as a traitor, was the first event
that led the disciples to the exercise of faith, but because their faith made
greater progress, when they arrived at the experience of those things which they
had formerly heard from the mouth of Christ. Now this may be explained in two
ways; either that Christ says that they will believe after the event has
happened, because there was nothing which was hidden from him, or that nothing
will be wanting in him of all that the Scripture testifies concerning Christ. As
the two interpretations agree well enough together, I leave my readers at
liberty to choose which of them they will prefer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Verily, verily, I tell
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In these words either the Evangelist
relates a discourse on a different subject, and in a broken and imperfect state,
or, Christ intended to meet the offense which was likely to arise from the crime
of Judas; for the Evangelists do not always exhibit the discourses of Christ in
unbroken succession, but sometimes throw together, in heaps, a variety of
statements. It is more probable, however, that Christ intended to provide
against this scandal. There is too good evidence that we are very ready to be
wounded by bad examples; for, in consequence of this, the revolt of one man
inflicts a deadly wound on two hundred others, while the steadiness of ten or
twenty pious men hardly edifies a single individual. On this account, while
Christ was placing such a monster before the eyes of his disciples, it was also
necessary that he should stretch out his hand to them, lest, struck by the
novelty, they should fall back. Nor was it only on their account that he said
this, but he also consulted the advantage of those who should come after; for,
otherwise, the remembrance of Judas might, even at the present day:, do us
grievous injury. When the devil cannot estrange us from Christ by hatred of his
doctrine, he excites either dislike or contempt of the ministers
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this admonition of Christ shows that it is
unreasonable that the impiety of any whose conduct is wicked or unbecoming their
office, should at all diminish the apostolical authority. The reason is, we
ought to contemplate God, the Author of the ministry, in whom, certainly, we
find nothing which we have a right to despise; and next, we ought to contemplate
Christ, who, having been appointed by the Father to be the only Teacher, speaks
by his apostles. Whoever, then, does not deign to receive the ministers of the
Gospel, rejects Christ in them, and rejects God in Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Papists act a foolish and ridiculous part, when
they endeavor to obtain this applause for themselves, in order exhibit their
tyranny. For, in the first place, they adorn themselves with begged and borrowed
feathers, having no resemblance to the apostles of Christ; and, secondly,
granting that they are apostles, nothing was farther from Christ&#8217;s
intention, in this passage, than to transfer his own right to men; for what else
is it to receive those whom Christ sends, but to give place to them, that they
may fulfill the office which has been committed to them?</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When Jesus had said these
words.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The more sacred the apostolic office is,
and the higher its dignity, the more base and detestable was the treachery of
Judas. A crime so monstrous and detestable struck Christ himself with horror,
when he saw how the incredible wickedness of one man had polluted that sacred
order in which the majesty of God ought to have shone with brightness. To the
same purpose is what the Evangelist adds, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>testified.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
His meaning is, the action was so monstrous that the bare mention of it could
not be immediately believed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He was troubled in
spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Evangelist says that Christ
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was troubled in
spirit,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> in order to inform us that he did not
merely, in countenance and language, assume the appearance of a man who was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>troubled,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
but that he was deeply moved in his
mind.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"> here denotes the understanding, or, the
soul; for I do not assent to the opinion of some who explain it, as if Christ
had been driven by a violent impulse of the Holy <i>Spirit</i> to break out into
these words. I readily acknowledge. that all the affections of Christ were
guided by the Holy <i>Spirit</i>; but the meaning of the Evangelist is
different, namely, that this suffering of Christ was inward, and was not
feigned; and it is of great importance for us to know this, because his. zeal is
held out for our imitation, that we may be moved with deep horror by those
monsters which overturn the sacred order of God and of his
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The disciples, therefore,
looked on one another.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> They who are not
conscious of any crime are rendered uneasy by what Christ has said: Judas alone
is so stupid amidst his malice, that he remains unmoved. The authority of Christ
was held in so great estimation by the disciples, that they were fully convinced
that he said nothing without a good reason; but Satan had expelled from the
heart of Judas all reverence, so that it was harder than a rock to reject every
admonition. And though Christ appears to be somewhat unkind in inflicting this
torture, for a time, on those who were innocent, yet as anxiety of this kind was
profitable to them, Christ did them no injury. It is proper that, when the
children of God have heard the sentence of the ungodly, they should themselves
feel uneasiness, that they may sift themselves, and guard against hypocrisy; for
this gives them an opportunity of examining themselves and their
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage shows that we ought sometimes to reprove
the ungodly in such a manner as not instantly to point the finger to them, until
God, by his own hand, drag them forth to the light. For it frequently happens
that there are secret diseases in the Church, which we are not at liberty to
disguise; and yet the wickedness of men is not so ripe as to be capable of being
laid open. In such cases we ought to take this middle path.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom Jesus
loved</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The peculiar <i>love</i> with which
Christ <i>loved</i> John plainly testifies that, if we <i>love</i> some more
than others, this is not always inconsistent with brotherly love; but all lies
in this, that our love shall be directed towards God, and that every man, in
proportion as he excels in the gifts of God, shall share in it the more largely.
From this end Christ never turned aside in the smallest degree; but with us the
case is widely different, for such is the vanity of our mind, that there are few
who, in loving men, approach more nearly to God. And yet the love of men towards
each other will never be properly regulated, unless it be directed to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lay at table in Jesus&#8217;
bosom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What is here related by John might be
regarded in the present day as indecorous; but such was, at that time, the
manner of being placed at table; for they did not <i>sit</i>, as we do, <i>at
table</i>, but, after having put off their shoes, <i>lay</i> half-stretched out,
<i>reclining</i> on small cushions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To whom I shall give the
dipped sop.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It may be asked, what purpose did
it serve to give </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a dipped
sop,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for discovering the traitor, when Christ
might have openly pointed him out by name, if he wished to make him known? I
answer, the sign was of such a nature, that it discovered Judas to one person
only, and did not immediately bring him forward to the view of all. But it was
advantageous that John should be witness of this fact, in order that he might
afterwards reveal it to others at the proper time; and Christ intentionally
delayed to make Judas publicly known, that, when hypocrites are concealed, we
may more patiently bear, till they are dragged forth to the light. We see Judas
sitting amongst the others, and yet condemned by the mouth of the Judge. In no
respect better is the condition of those who hold a place among the children of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Satan entered into him.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">As it is certain that it was only at the
instigation of Satan that Judas formed the design of committing so heinous a
crime, why is it now said, for the first time, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Satan entered into
him,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> who had already held the throne in his
heart? But as they who are more fully confirmed in The faith which they formerly
possessed are often said to<i> believe</i>, and thus an increase of their faith
is called <i>faith</i>, so now that Judas is utterly given up to Satan, so as to
be hurried on, by vehement impetuosity, to every extremity of evil,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Satan</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is said to have </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>entered into
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For as the saints make gradual progress,
and in proportion to the new gifts by which they are continually enlarged, they
are said to be filled with the Holy Spirit; so, in proportion as wicked men
provoke the anger of God against themselves by their ingratitude, The Lord
deprives them of his Spirit, of all light of reason, and, indeed, of all human
feeling, and delivers them unreservedly to <i>Satan</i>. This is a dreadful
vengeance of God, when men are <i>given up to a reprobate mind</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28,) so that they scarcely differ at all from the brutes, and &#8212; what is
worse &#8212; fall into horrid crimes from which the brutes themselves would
shrink. We ought, therefore, to walk diligently in the fear of the Lord, lest,
if we overpower his goodness by our wickedness, he at length give us up to the
rage of, Satan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By giving
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
sop</i></font><font face="Palatino">, Christ did not give an opportunity to
Satan, but rather Judas, <i>having received the sop</i>, gave himself up
entirely to Satan. It was, indeed, the occasion, but not the cause. His heart,
which was harder than iron, ought to have been softened by so great kindness
showed to him by Christ; and now his desperate and incurable obstinacy deserves
that God, by his just judgment, should harden his heart still more by Satan.
Thus, when, by acts of kindness to enemies, <i>we heap coals of fire on their
heads</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451220&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:20,) if they are utterly incurable, they are the more enraged and inflamed 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f384</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to their destruction. And yet no blame is due, on this account, to our kindness,
by which their hearts ought to have been inflamed to love us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Augustine</i> was wrong in thinking that this sop
was an emblem of the body of Christ, since it was not during the Lord&#8217;s
Supper that it was given to Judas. It is also a very foolish dream to imagine
that the devil entered essentially &#8212; as the phrase is &#8212; into Judas;
for the Evangelist speaks only of the power and efficacy of Satan. This example
reminds us what a dreadful punishment awaits all those who profane the gifts of
the Lord by abusing them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What thou doest, do
quickly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The exhortation addressed by Christ to
Judas is not of such a nature that he can be regarded as exciting him to do the
action: it is rather the language of one who views the crime with horror and
detestation. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f385</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hitherto he had endeavored, by various methods, to bring him back, but to no
purpose. Now he addresses him as a desperate man, &#8220;Go to destruction,
since you have resolved to go to destruction;&#8221; and, in doing so, he
performs the office of a, judge, who condemns to death not those whom he, of his
own accord, desires to ruin, but those who have already ruined themselves by
their own fault. In short, Christ does not lay Judas under the necessity of
perishing, but declares him to be what he had formerly been.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not one of those who were at

others what Christ had told him, or they were so much struck by it, that they
lost their presence of mind; and, indeed, ill is probable, that John himself was
almost out of his senses. But what then happened to the disciples, we frequently
see: taking place in the Church, that few of the believers discern the
hypocrites whom the Lord loudly condemns.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now is the Son of man
glorified.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The last hour was at hand; Christ
knew that the minds of his disciples were very weak, and, therefore, he
endeavored, by every possible method, to support them, that they might not give
way. Even at the present day, the remembrance of the cross of Christ is
sufficient to make us tremble, were we not instantly met by the consolation,
that he triumphed in the cross, having obtained a victory over Satan, sin, and
death. What, then, might have happened to the Apostles, when they saw the Lord
soon dragged to the cross, loaded with every kind of reproaches? Might not an
exhibition so melancholy and revolting have overwhelmed them a hundred times?
Christ, therefore, provides against this danger, and withdraws them from the
outward aspect of death to its spiritual fruit. Whatever ignominy, then, may be
seen in the cross, fitted to confound believers, yet Christ testifies that the
same cross brings glory and honor to him. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f386</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God is glorified in
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This clause, which immediately follows the
other, is added for confirmation; for it was a paradoxical statement, that
<i>the glory of the Son of man</i> arose from a death which was reckoned
ignominious among men, and was even accursed before God. He shows, therefore, in
what manner he would obtain glory to himself from such a death. It is, because
by it 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f387</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he glorifies God the Father; for in the cross of Christ:, as in a magnificent
theater, the inestimable goodness of God is displayed before the whole world. In
all the creatures, indeed, both high and low, the glory of God shines, but
nowhere has it shone more brightly than in the cross, in which there has been an
astonishing change of things, the condemnation of all men has been manifested,
sin has been blotted out, salvation has been restored to men; and, in short, the
whole world has been renewed, and every thing restored to good
order.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Though the preposition
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>in</i> is often used instead of the Hebrew
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
and, in such eases, is equivalent to <i>by</i>, yet I have preferred translating
it simply, that <i>God is glorified</i> IN <i>the Son of man</i>; because I
considered that phrase to be more emphatic. When he says, AND <i>God is
glorified</i>, the meaning, I apprehend, is, FOR <i>God is
glorified</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If God be
glorified.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Christ concludes that he will obtain
a <i>glorious</i> triumph by his death; because his sole design in it is, to
<i>glorify</i> his Father; for the Father did not seek his <i>glory</i> from the
death of his Son in such a manner as not to make the Son a partaker of that
<i>glory</i>. He promises, therefore, that when the ignominy which he shall
endure for a short time has been effaced, illustrious honor will be displayed in
his death. And this too was accomplished; for the death of the cross, which
Christ suffered, is so far from obscuring his high rank, that in that death his
high rank is chiefly displayed, since there his amazing love to mankind, his
infinite righteousness in atoning for sin and appeasing the wrath of God, his
wonderful power in conquering death, subduing Satan, and, at length, opening
heaven, blazed with full brightness. This doctrine is now extended also to all
of us; for though the whole world should conspire to cover us with infamy, yet
if we sincerely and honestly endeavor to promote the glory of God, we ought not
to doubt that God will also glorify us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will immediately glorify
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Christ heightens the consolation by
arguments drawn from the shortness of the time, when he promises that it will
take place
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>immediately</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
And though this glory began at the day of his resurrection, yet what is chiefly
described here is the extension of it, which followed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>immediately</i></font><font face="Palatino">
afterwards, when, raising the dead by the power of the Gospel and of his Spirit,
he created a new people for himself; for the honor which peculiarly belongs to
the death of Christ, is the fruit which sprung from it for the salvation of
men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>33.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Little children, yet a little
while am I with you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As it was impossible that
the disciples should not be deeply grieved at their Master&#8217;s departure, so
he gives them early warning that he will no longer be with them, and, at the
same time, exhorts them to patience. Lastly, to remove unseasonable eagerness of
desire, he declares that they cannot immediately follow him. In calling them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>little
children,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he shows, by that gentle appellation,
that his reason for departing from them is not that he cares little about their
welfare, for he loves them very tenderly. True, the object which he had in view
in clothing himself with our flesh was, that he might be our brother, but by
that other name he expresses more strongly the ardor of his
love.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As I said to the

what he had formerly </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>said to the
Jews,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> this is true as to the words, but there
is a wide difference in the meaning; for he declares that they cannot follow
him, in order that they may endure patiently his temporary absence, and &#8212;
so to speak &#8212; bridles them in, that; they may remain in their office, till
they have finished their warfare on earth; so that he does not perpetually
exclude them, as Jews, from the kingdom of God, but only bids them wait
patiently, till he bring them, along with himself, into the heavenly
kingdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>34.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A new commandment I give
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To the consolation he adds an
exhortation,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that they should
love one another;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as if he had said, &#8220;Yet
while I am absent from you in body, testify, by mutual love, that I have not
taught you in vain; let this be your constant study, your chief
meditation.&#8221; Why does he call it <i>a new commandment</i>? All are not
agreed on this point. There are some who suppose the reason to be, that, while
the injunction formerly contained in the Law about brotherly love was literal
and external, Christ wrote it anew by his Spirit on the hearts of believers.
Thus, according to them, the Law is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>new,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
because he publishes it in a <i>new</i> manner, that it may have full vigor. But
that is, in my opinion, far-fetched, and at variance with Christ&#8217;s
meaning. The exposition given by others is, that, though the Law directs us to
the exercise of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
still, because in it the doctrine of brotherly love is encumbered by many
ceremonies and appendages, it is not so clearly exhibited; but, on the other
hand, that perfection in <i>love</i> is laid down in the Gospel without any
shadows. For my own part, though I do not absolutely reject this interpretation,
I consider what Christ said to be more simple; for we know that laws are more
carefully observed at the commencement, but they gradually slip out of the
remembrance of men, till at length they become obsolete. In order to impress
more deeply, therefore, on the minds of his disciples the doctrine of brotherly
love, Christ recommends it on the ground of novelty; as if he had said, &#8220;I
wish you continually to remember this commandment, as if it had been a law but
lately made.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, we see that it was the design of Christ, in
this passage, to exhort his disciples to brotherly love, that they might never
permit themselves to be withdrawn from the pursuit of it, or the doctrine of it
to slip out of their minds. And how necessary this admonition was, we learn by
daily experience; for, since it is difficult to maintain brotherly love, men lay
it aside, and contrive, for themselves, new methods of worshipping God, and
Satan suggests many things for the purpose of occupying their attention. Thus,
by idle employments, they in vain attempt to mock God, but they deceive
themselves. Let this title of novelty, therefore, excite us to the continual
exercise of brotherly love. Meanwhile, let us know that it is called <i>new</i>,
not because it now began, for the first time, to please God, since it is
elsewhere called <i>the fulfilling of the law</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That you love one
another.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Brotherly <i>love</i> is, indeed,
extended to strangers, for we are all of the same flesh, and are all created
after the image of God; but because the image of God shines more brightly in
those who have been regenerated, it is proper that the bond of love, among the
disciples of Christ, should be far more close. In God brotherly love seeks its
cause, from him it has its root, and to him it is directed. Thus, in proportion
as it perceives any man to be a child of God, it embraces him with the greater
warmth and affection. Besides, the mutual exercise of love cannot exist but in
those who are guided by the same Spirit. It is the highest degree of brotherly
love, therefore, that is here described by Christ; but we ought to believe, on
the other hand, that, as the goodness of God extends to the whole world, so we
ought to love all, even those who hate us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As I have loved
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He holds out his own example, not because
we can reach it, for we are at a vast distance behind him, but that we may, at
least, aim at the same end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>35.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By this all men will
know.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Christ again confirms what he had
formerly said, that they who mutually love one another have not been in vain
taught in his school; as if he had said, Not only will you know that you are my
disciples, but your profession will also be acknowledged by others to be
sincere.&#8221; Since Christ lays down this mark for distinguishing between his
disciples and strangers, they who lay aside brotherly love, and adopt new and
invented modes of worship, labor in vain; and folly of this kind prevails at
this day in Popery. Nor is it superfluous that Christ dwells so largely on this
subject. There is no greater agreement between the love of ourselves, and the
love of our neighbor, than there is between fire and water. Self love keeps all
our senses bound in such a manner that brotherly love is altogether banished;
and yet we think that we fully discharge our duty, because Satan has many
enticements to deceive us, that we may not perceive our faults. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f388</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Whoever, then, desires to be truly a disciple of Christ, and to be acknowledged
by God, let him form and direct his whole life to love the brethren, and let him
pursue this object with diligence.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>36.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord, whither goest
thou?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This question is founded on that saying
of Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">I said to the Jews, that
whither I go you cannot come, so now I say to you,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431333&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
13:33.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From this it is evident how ignorant Peter was, who,
after having been so frequently warned about; Christ&#8217;s departure, was as
greatly perplexed as if he had heard something new. Yet in this respect we are
too like him; for we hear daily from the mouth of Christ all that is fitted for
usefulness in life, and all that is necessary to be known, and, when we come to
practice, we are as much astonished as apprentices to whom not a word had ever
been spoken. Besides, Peter shows that he is under the influence of an
immoderate desire of Christ&#8217;s bodily presence; for he reckons it absurd
that, while he remains, Christ shall go elsewhere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whither I
go.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words Christ restrains
Peter&#8217;s excessive desire. His language is concise, as becomes a Master,
but immediately softens the hardness of his statement. He shows that it will
only be for a time that he shall be separated from his disciples. We are taught
by this passage to subject all our desires to God, that they may not go beyond
their proper bounds; and if at any time they become extravagant and foolish, let
us at least submit to be held in by this bridle. That we may not lose courage,
let us avail ourselves of the consolation which is immediately added, when
Christ promises that we shall one day be gathered to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But thou shalt follow me
afterwards.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means that Peter is not yet ripe
for bearing the cross, but, like corn still in the blade, must be formed and
strengthened by the progress of time, that he may
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>follow.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
We ought therefore to pray to God to carry forward to a higher degree of
excellence what he has begun in us. In the meantime, we must creep, till we are
able to run more swiftly. Now as Christ bears with us, while we are tender and
delicate, so let us learn not to reject weak brethren, who are still very far
from the goal. It is desirable, indeed, that all should run with the greatest
eagerness, and we ought to encourage all to quicken their pace; but if there are
any who walk more slowly, we ought to hope well concerning them, provided that
they keep the road.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>37.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why cannot I follow thee
now?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words Peter declares that he was
dissatisfied with Christ&#8217;s answer. He is aware that he has been warned of
his own weakness, from which he concludes that it is his own fault that hinders
him from following Christ immediately; but he is not at all convinced of it, for
mankind are naturally puffed up with confidence in their own value. This
expression of Peter shows the opinion which we entertain from our very birth,
which is, that we attribute more to our own strength than we ought to do. The
consequence is, that they who can do nothing venture to attempt every thing,
without imploring the assistance of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>38.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wilt thou lay down thy life
for me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Christ did not choose to debate with
Peter, but wished that he should grow wise by his own experience, like fools,
who never grow wise till they have received a stroke. Peter promises unshaken
firmness, and indeed expresses the sincere conviction of his mind; but his
confidence is full of rashness, for he does not consider what strength has been
given to him. Now since this example belongs to us, let each of us examine his
own defects, that he may not be swelled with vain confidence. We cannot indeed
make too large promises about the grace of God; but what is here reproved is the
arrogant presumption of the flesh, for faith rather produces fear and
anxiety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The cock will not
crow.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As presumption and rashness proceed from
ignorance of ourselves, Peter is blamed for pretending to be a valiant soldier.
while he is beyond arrow-shot; for he has not yet made trial of his strength,
and imagines that he could do any thing. He was afterwards punished, as he
deserved, for his arrogance. Let us learn to distrust our own strength, and to
betake ourselves early to the Lord, that he may support us by his
power.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let not your heart be
troubled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Not without good reason does Christ
confirm his disciples by so many words, since a contest so arduous and so
terrible awaited them; for it was no ordinary temptation, that soon afterwards
they would see him hanging on the cross; a spectacle in which nothing was to be
seen but ground for the lowest despair. The season of so great distress being at
hand, he points out the remedy, that they may not be vanquished and overwhelmed;
for he does not simply exhort and encourage them to be steadfast, but likewise
informs them where they must go to obtain courage; that is, by faith, when he is
acknowledged to be the Son of God, who has in himself a sufficiency of strength
for maintaining the safety of his followers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought always to attend to the time when these
words were spoken, that Christ wished his disciples to remain brave and
courageous, when they might think that every thing was in the greatest
confusion; and therefore we ought to employ the same shield for warding off such
assaults. It is impossible for us, indeed, to avoid feeling various emotions,
but though we are shaken, we must not fall down. Thus it is said of believers,
that they <i>are not troubled</i>, because, relying on the word of God, though
very great difficulties press hard upon them, still they remain steadfast and
upright.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You believe in
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It might also be read in the imperative
mood, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Believe in God</i>,<i> and
believe in me</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but the former reading agrees
better, and has been more generally received. Here he points out the method of
remaining steadfast, as I have already said; that is, if our faith rest on
Christ, and view him in no other light than as being present and stretching out
his hand to assist us. But it is wonderful that faith in the Father is here
placed first in order, for he ought rather to have told his disciples that they
ought to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>believe in
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, since they had <i>believed in Christ</i>;
because, as Christ is the lively image of the Father, so we ought first to cast
our eyes on him; and for this reason, too, he descends to us, that our faith,
beginning with him, may rise to God. But Christ had a different object in view,
for all acknowledge that we ought to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>believe in
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and this is an admitted principle to which
all assent without contradiction; and yet there is scarce one in a hundred who
actually believes it, not only because the naked majesty of God is at too great
a distance from us, but also because Satan interposes clouds of every
description to hinder us from contemplating God. The consequence is, that our
faith, seeking God in his heavenly glory and inaccessible light, vanishes away;
and even the flesh, of its own accord, suggests a thousand imaginations, to turn
away our eyes from beholding God in a proper manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Son of God, then, who is Jesus Christ, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f390</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
holds out himself as the object to which our faith ought to be directed, and by
means of which it will easily find that on which it can rest; for he is the true
Immanuel, who answers us within, as soon as we seek him by faith. It is one of
the leading articles of our faith, that our faith ought to be directed to Christ
alone, that it may not wander through long windings; and that it ought to be
fixed on him, that it may not waver in the midst of temptations. And this is the
true proof of faith, when we never suffer ourselves to be torn away from Christ,
and from the promises which have been made to us in him. When Popish divines
dispute, or, I should rather say, chatter, about the object of faith, they
mention God only, and pay no attention to Christ. They who derive their
instruction from the notions of such men, must be shaken by the slightest gale
of wind that blows. Proud men are ashamed of Christ&#8217;s humiliation, and,
therefore, they fly to God&#8217;s incomprehensible Divinity. But faith will
never reach heaven unless it submit to Christ, who appears to be a low and
contemptible God, and will never be firm if it do not seek a foundation in the
weakness of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In my Father&#8217;s house
are many dwellings.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As the absence of Christ
was a cause of grief, he declares that he does not, go away in such a. manner as
to remain separate from them, since there is room for them also in the heavenly
kingdom. For it was proper that he should remove the suspicion from their minds,
that, when Christ ascended to the Father, he left his disciples on earth without
taking any farther notice of them. This passage has been erroneously interpreted
in another sense, as if Christ taught that&#8217; there are various degrees of
honor in the heavenly kingdom; for he says, that the <i>mansions</i> are
<i>many</i>, not that they are different or unlike, but that there are enough of
them for a great number of persons; as if he had said, that there is room not
only for himself, but also for all his disciples.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if it were not so, I would have
told you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here commentators differ. Some read
these words as closely connected with what goes before: &#8220;If the dwellings
had not been already prepared, I would have said that I go before you to prepare
them.&#8221; But I rather agree with those who render it thus: &#8220;If the
heavenly glory had awaited me only, I would not have deceived you. I would have
told you that there was no room for any one but myself in my Father&#8217;s
house. But the case is widely different; for I go before, to prepare a place for
you.&#8221; The context, in my opinion, demands that we read it in this manner;
for it follows immediately afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I go to prepare a place for
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words Christ intimates that the
design of his departure is, to prepare a place for his disciples. In a word,
Christ did not ascend to heaven in a private capacity, to dwell there alone, but
rather that it might be the common inheritance of all the godly, and that in
this way the Head might be united to his members.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a question arises, What was the condition of the
fathers after death, before Christ ascended to heaven? For the conclusion
usually drawn is, that believing souls were shut up in an intermediate state or
prison, because Christ says that, by his ascension into heaven, <i>the place
will be prepared</i>. But the answer is easy. This
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>place</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">is said to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prepared</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">for the day of the resurrection; for by nature
mankind are banished from the kingdom of God, but the Son, who is the only heir
of heaven, took possession of it in their name, that through him we may be
permitted to enter; for in his person we already possess heaven by hope, as Paul
informs us,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:3.) Still we will not enjoy this great blessing, until he come from heaven the
second time. The condition of the fathers after death, therefore, is not here
distinguished from ours; because Christ has
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prepared</i></font><font face="Palatino">
both for them and for us a place, into which he will receive us all at the last
day. Before reconciliation had been made, believing souls were, as it were,
placed on a watch-tower, looking for the promised redemption, and now they enjoy
a blessed rest, until the redemption be finished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if I go
away.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The conditional term, <i>if</i>, ought to
be interpreted as an adverb of time; as if it had been said, &#8220;AFTER THAT
<i>I have gone away</i>,<i> I will return to you again</i>.&#8221; This
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>return</i></font><font face="Palatino">
must not be understood as referring to the Holy Spirit, as if Christ had
manifested to the disciples some new presence of himself by the Spirit. It is
unquestionably true, that Christ dwells with us and in us by his Spirit; but
here he speaks of the last day of judgment, when he will, at length, come to
assemble his followers. And, indeed, if we consider the whole body of the
Church, he every day <i>prepares a place</i> for us; whence it follows, that the
proper time for our entrance into heaven is not yet come.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And whither I go you
know.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As we need no ordinary fortitude, that we
may patiently endure to be so long separated from Christ, he adds another
confirmation, that the disciples
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know</i></font><font face="Palatino">
that his death is not a destruction, but a passage to the Father; and next, that
they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know the
way</i></font><font face="Palatino"> which they must <i>follow</i>, that they
may arrive at the participation of the same glory. Both clauses ought to be
carefully observed. First, we must see Christ, by the eyes of faith, in the
heavenly glory and a blessed immortality; and, secondly, we ought to know that
he is the first-fruits of our life, and that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the way</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">Which was closed against us has been opened by
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thomas saith to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though, at first sight, the reply of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thomas</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">appears to contradict what Christ had said, yet he
did not intend to give the lie to his Master. But it may be asked, In what sense
does he deny what Christ asserted? I reply, the knowledge possessed by the
saints is sometimes confused, because they do not understand the manner or the
reason of those things which are certain, and which have been explained to them.
For example, the Prophets foretold the calling of the Gentiles with a true
perception of faith, and yet Paul declares that it was a <i>mystery hidden</i>
from them,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:2, 4.) In like manner, when the Apostles believed that Christ was departing to
the Father, and yet <i>did not know</i> in what way he would obtain the kingdom,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thomas</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">justly replies, that they do<i> not know whither he
is going</i>. Hence he concludes that they <i>know</i> still less about the way;
for before we enter into a road, we must know where we intend to
go.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am the
way.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Though Christ does not give a direct reply
to the question put to him, yet he passes by nothing that is useful to be known.
It was proper that Thomas&#8217; curiosity should be checked; and, therefore,
Christ does not explain what would be his condition when he should have departed
out of this world to go to the Father, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f391</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but dwells on a subject far more necessary. Thomas would gladly have heard what
Christ intended to do in heaven, as we never become weary of those intricate
speculations; but it is of greater importance to us to employ our study and
labor in another inquiry, how we may become partakers of the blessed
resurrection. The statement amounts to this, that whoever obtains Christ is ill
want of nothing; and, therefore, that whoever is not satisfied with Christ
alone, strives after something beyond absolute perfection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The way, the truth, and the
life.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He lays down three degrees, as if he had
said, that he is the beginning, and the middle, and the end; and hence it
follows that we ought to begin with him, to continue in him, and to end in him.
We certainly ought not to seek for higher wisdom than that which leads us to
eternal
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and he testifies that this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is to be found in him. Now the method of obtaining <i>life</i> is, to become new
creatures. He declares, that we ought not to seek it anywhere else, and, at the
same time, reminds us, that <i>he is the way</i>, by which alone we can arrive
at it. That he may not fail us in any respect, he stretches out the hand to
those who are going astray, and stoops so low as to guide sucking infants.
Presenting himself as a leader, he does not leave his people in the middle of
the course, but makes them partakers of <i>the truth</i>. At length he makes
them enjoy the fruit of it, which is the most excellent and delightful thing
that can be imagined.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As Christ is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
way</i></font><font face="Palatino">, the weak and ignorant have no reason to
complain that they are forsaken by him; and as he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the truth and the
life,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he has in himself also what is fitted to
satisfy the most perfect. In short, Christ now affirms, concerning happiness,
what I have lately said concerning the object of faith. All believe and
acknowledge that the happiness of man lies in God alone: but they afterwards go
wrong in this respect, that, seeking God elsewhere than in Christ, they tear him
&#8212; so to speak &#8212; from his true and solid Dignity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is supposed by some to denote here the
saving light of heavenly wisdom, and by others to denote the substance of
<i>life</i> and of all spiritual blessings, which is contrasted with shadows and
figures; as it is said, <i>grace and truth came by Jesus Christ</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:17.) My opinion is, that <i>the truth</i> means here the perfection of faith
as </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
way</i></font><font face="Palatino"> means its beginning and first elements. The
whole may be summed up thus: &#8220;If any man turn aside from Christ, he will
do nothing but go astray; if any man do not rest on him, he will feed elsewhere
on nothing but wind and vanity; if any man, not satisfied with him alone, wishes
to go farther, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f392</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he will find death instead of life.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No man cometh to the
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is an explanation of the former
statement&#8217;, for he is <i>the way</i>, because he leads us
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and he is <i>the truth </i>and<i> the
life</i>, because in him we perceive <i>the Father</i>. As to calling on God, it
may indeed be said, with truth, that no prayers are heard but through the
intercession of Christ; but as Christ does not now speak about prayer, we ought
simply to understand the meaning to be, that men contrive for themselves true
labyrinths, whenever, after having forsaken Christ, they attempt <i>to come to
God</i>. For Christ proves that he is <i>the life</i>, because God, <i>with whom
is the fountain of life</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;193609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
36:9,) cannot be enjoyed in any other way than in Christ. Wherefore all
theology, when separated from Christ, is not only vain and confused, but is also
mad, deceitful, and spurious; for, though the philosophers sometimes utter
excellent sayings, yet they have nothing but what is short-lived, and even mixed
up with wicked and erroneous sentiments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If you had known
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He confirms what we have just now said,
that it is a foolish and pernicious curiosity, when men, not satisfied with him,
attempt to go to God by indirect and crooked paths. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f393</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
They admit that there is nothing better than the knowledge of God; but when he
is near them, and speaks to them familiarly, they wander through their own
speculations, and seek above the clouds him whom they do not deign to
acknowledge as present. Christ, therefore, blames the disciples for not
acknowledging that the fullness of the Godhead was manifested in him. &#8220;I
see,&#8221; (says he,) &#8220;that hitherto you have not known me in a right and
proper manner, because you do not yet acknowledge the lively image of the Father
which is exhibited in me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And henceforth you know him, and
have seen him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He adds this, not only to soften
the severity of the reproof, but likewise to accuse them of ingratitude and
slothfulness, if they do not consider and inquire what has been given to them;
for he said this rather for the purpose of commending his doctrine than of
extolling their faith. The meaning therefore is, that God is now plainly
exhibited to them if they would but open their eyes. The word <i>see</i>
expresses the certainty of faith.</font><br></div>

writers do not take an erroneous view of this passage, when they quote it as a
proof for defending Christ&#8217;s Divinity; but as Christ does not simply
inquire what he is in himself, but what we ought to acknowledge him to be, this
description applies to his power rather than to his essence.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The

not to seek God anywhere else than in him; for he maintains that his doctrine,
being heavenly and truly Divine, is a proof and bright mirror of the presence of
God. If it be objected, that all the Prophets ought to be accounted sons of God,
because they speak divinely from the inspiration of the Spirit, and because God
was the Author of their doctrine, the answer is easy. We ought to consider what
their doctrine contains; for the Prophets send their disciples to another
person, but Christ attaches them to himself. Besides, we ought to remember what
the apostle declares, that now <i>God speaketh from heaven
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581225&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:25)<i> </i>by the mouth of his Son, and that, when he spoke by Moses, he

</i>that is, as a man only, or after the manner of men; because <i>the
Father</i>,<i> </i>exhibiting the power of his Spirit in Christ&#8217;s
doctrine, wishes his Divinity to be recognized in him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This must not be confined to miracles; for it is
rather a continuation of the former statement, that the majesty of God is
clearly exhibited in Christ&#8217;s doctrine; as if he had said, that his
doctrine is truly a work of God, from which it may be known with certainty that
God dwelleth in him. By <i>the works</i>,<i> </i>therefore, I understand a proof
of the power of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Believe me that I am in the Father,
and the Father in me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He first demands
from the disciples to give credit to his testimony, when he asserts that he is
the Son of God; but as they had hitherto been too lazy, he indirectly reproves
their indolence. &#8220;If<i> </i>my assertion,&#8221; says he, &#8220;does<i>
</i>not produce conviction, and if you have so mean an opinion of me, that you
do not think that you ought to believe my words, consider, at least, that power
which is a visible image of the presence of God.&#8221; It is very absurd in
them, indeed, not to believe, entirely, the words which proceed from the mouth
of the Lord Jesus, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f395</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
since they ought to have embraced, without any hesitation, every thing that he
expressed, even by a single word. But here Christ reproves his disciples for
having made so little progress, though they had received so many admonitions on
the same subject. He does not explain what is the nature of faith, but declares
that he has what is even sufficient for convicting unbelievers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The repetition of the
words,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I am in the Father, and
the Father in me,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is not superfluous;
for we know too well, by experience, how our nature prompts us to foolish
curiosity. As soon as we have gone out of Christ, we shall have nothing else
than the idols which we have formed, but <i>in Christ</i>,<i> </i>there is
nothing but what is divine, and what keeps us <i>in God</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Verily, verily, I, tell
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>All that he had hitherto told his
disciples about himself, so far as it regarded them, was temporal; and,
therefore, if he had not added this clause, the consolation would not have been
complete; particularly since our memory is so short, when we are called to
consider the gifts of God. On this subject it is unnecessary to go to others for
examples; for, when God has loaded us with every kind of blessings, if He pause
for fourteen days, we fancy that he is no longer alive. This is the reason why
Christ not only mentions his present power, which the Apostles, at that time,
beheld with their eyes, but promises an uninterrupted conviction of it for the
future. And, indeed, not only was his Divinity attested, so long as he dwelt on
the earth, but after he had gone to the Father, striking proofs of it were
enjoyed by believers. But either our stupidity or our malice hinders us from
perceiving God in his works, and Christ in the works of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall do greater works than
these.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Many are perplexed by the
statement of Christ, that the Apostles
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would do greater works than he
had done</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>I pass by the other answers
which have been usually given to it, and satisfy myself with this single answer.
First, we must understand what Christ means; namely, that the power by which he
proves himself to be the Son of God, is so far from being confined to his bodily
presence, that it must be clearly demonstrated by many and striking proofs, when
he is absent. Now the ascension of Christ was soon afterwards followed by a
wonderful conversion of the world, in which the Divinity of Christ was more
powerfully displayed than while he dwelt among men. Thus, we see that the proof
of his Divinity was not confined to the person of Christ, but was diffused
through the whole body of the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I go to the
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the reason why the
disciples would do greater things than Christ himself. It is because, when he
has entered into the possession of his kingdom, he will more fully demonstrate
his power from heaven. Hence it is evident that his glory is in no degree
diminished, because, after his departure, the Apostles, who were only his
instruments, performed more excellent works. What is more, in this manner it
became evident that he sitteth at the right hand of the Father, <i>that every
knee may bow before him</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;502910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And whatever you ask in my name,
that I will do.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words He
plainly declares that he will be the Author of all that shall be done by the
hands of the Apostles. But it may be asked, was he not even then the Mediator in
whose name men ought to pray to the Father? I reply, he plainly discharged the
office of Mediator, ever since he entered into the heavenly sanctuary; as we
shall afterwards repeat at the proper place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the Father may be glorified in
the Son.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage agrees with what
Paul says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">That every tongue may

his hand be concealed, we have it visible <i>in Christ</i>.<i> </i>Consequently,
in the benefits which the Father bestows upon us, we have no right to separate
<i>the Father </i>from <i>the Son</i>,<i> </i>according to that
saying,</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If you shall ask any thing in
my name, I will do it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is not a
useless repetition. All see and feel that they are unworthy to approach God; and
yet the greater part of men burst forward, as if they were out of their senses,
and rashly and haughtily address God; and afterwards, when that unworthiness, of
which I have spoken, comes to their recollection, every man contrives for
himself various expedients. On the other hand, when God invites us to himself,
he holds out to us one Mediator only, by whom he is willing to be appeased and
reconciled. But here again the wickedness of the human mind breaks out for the
greater part do not cease to forsake the road, and to pass through many
windings. The reason why they do so is, that they have but a poor and slender
perception of the power and goodness of God in Christ. To this is added a second
error, that we do not consider that we are justly excluded from approaching God,
until he calls us, and that we are called only through the Son. And if one
passage has not sufficient weight with us, let us know that, when Christ
repeats, a second time, that we must pray to the Father in his name, he lays his
hand on us, as it were, that we may not lose our pains by fruitlessly seeking
other intercessors.</font><br></div>

was true and sincere, and yet there was some superstition mixed with it, as is
frequently the case with ourselves; for it was very foolish in them to wish to
keep him in the world. To correct this fault, he bids them direct their love to
another end; and that is, to employ themselves in <i>keeping the commandments
</i>which he had given them. This is undoubtedly a useful doctrine, for of those
who think that they <i>love </i>Christ, there are very few who honor him as they
ought to do; but, on the contrary, after having performed small and trivial
services, they give themselves no farther concern. The true <i>love </i>of
Christ, on the other hand, is regulated by the observation of his doctrine as
the only rule. But we are likewise reminded how sinful our affections are, since
even the love which we bear to Christ is not without fault, if it be not
directed to a pure obedience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.

soothing the grief which they might feel on account of Christ&#8217;s absence;
but at the same time, Christ promises that he will give them strength <i>to keep
his commandments</i>;<i> </i>For otherwise the exhortation would have had little
effect. He therefore loses no time in informing them that, though he be absent
from them in body, yet he will never allow them to remain destitute of
assistance; for he will be present with them by his Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here he calls the Spirit the gift of <i>the
Father</i>,<i> </i>but a gift which he will obtain by his prayers; in another
passage he promises that he will give the Spirit. <i>If I depart</i>,<i>
</i>says he, <i>I will send</i>,<i> Him to you</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
16:7.) Both statements are true and correct; for in so far as Christ is our
Mediator and Intercessor, he obtains from <i>the Father </i>the grace of the
Spirit, but in so far as he is God, he bestows that grace from himself. The
meaning of this passage therefore is: &#8220;I<i> </i>was given to you by <i>the
Father </i>to be <i>a Comforter</i>,<i> </i>but only for a time; now, having
discharged my office, I will pray to him to give another <i>Comforter</i>,<i>
</i>who will not be for a short time, but will remain always with
you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he will, give you another
Comforter.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Comforter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is here applied both to Christ and to the Spirit, and justly; for it is an
office which belongs equally to both of them, to <i>comfort </i>and exhort us,
and to guard us by their protection. Christ was the Protector of his disciples,
so long as he dwelt in the world: and afterwards he committed them to the
protection and guardianship of the Spirit. It may be asked, are we not still
under the protection of Christ? The answer is easy. Christ is a continual
Protector, but not in a visible way. So long as he dwelt in the world, he openly
manifested himself as their Protector; but now he guards us by his
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls the Spirit ANOTHER <i>Comforter</i>,<i>
</i>on account of the difference between the blessings which we obtain from
both. The peculiar office of Christ was, to appease the wrath of God by atoning
for the sins of the world, to redeem men from death, to procure righteousness
and life; and the peculiar office of the Spirit is, to make us partakers not
only of Christ himself, but of all his blessings. And yet there would be no
impropriety in inferring from this passage a distinction of Persons; for there
must be some peculiarity in which the Spirit differs from the Son so as to be
<i>another </i>than the Son.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Spirit of

another title, namely, that he is the Master or Teacher of truth. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f397</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence it follows, that until we have been inwardly instructed by him, the
understandings of all of us are seized with vanity and
falsehood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom the world cannot
receive.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This contrast shows the
peculiar excellence of that grace which God bestows on none but his elect; for
he means that it is no ordinary gift of which the world is deprived. In this
sense, too, Isaiah says, <i>For</i>,<i> </i>the darkness shall cover the earth,
and thick darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise on thee, O
Jerusalem!&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f398</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For the mercy of God towards the Church deserves so much the higher praise, when
he exalts the Church, by a distinguished privilege, above the whole world. And
yet Christ exhorts the disciples, That they must not be puffed up, as the world
is wont to be, by carnal views, and thus drive away from themselves the grace of
the Spirit. All that Scripture tells us about the Holy Spirit is regarded by
earthly men as a dream; because, trusting to their own reason, they despise
heavenly illumination. Now, though this pride abounds everywhere, which
extinguishes, so far as lies in our power, the light of the Holy Spirit; yet,
conscious of our own poverty, we ought to know, that whatever belongs to sound
understanding proceeds from no other source. Yet Christ&#8217;s words show that
nothing which relates to the Holy Spirit can be learned by human reason, but
that He is known only by the experience of faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>The world</i>,<i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cannot receive the Spirit</i>,<i>
because it knoweth him not</i>;<i> but you know him</i>,<i> because he dwelleth
with you</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It is the Spirit alone
therefore, who, by <i>dwelling in us</i>,<i> </i>makes himself to be known by
us, for otherwise, he is unknown and incomprehensible.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not have you

are, and what they can do, when they have been deprived of the protection of the

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>orphans</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>exposed to every kind of fraud and injustice, incapable of governing
themselves, and, in short, unable of themselves to do any thing. The only remedy
for so great a defect is, if Christ govern us by his Spirit, which he promises
that he will do. First then, the disciples are reminded of their weakness, that,
distrusting themselves, they may rely on nothing else than the protection of
Christ; and, secondly, having promised a remedy, he gives them good
encouragement; for he declares that he will <i>never leave them</i>.<i> </i>When
he says, <i>I</i> <i>will</i> <i>come to you</i>,<i> </i>he shows in what manner
he dwells in his people, and in what manner he fills all things. It is, by the
power of his Spirit; and hence it is evident, that the grace of the Spirit is a
striking proof of his Divinity.</font><br></div>

removing the grief of the disciples. &#8220;When<i> </i>I shall have

must not judge of his presence or his absence according to carnal perception,
but we must earnestly employ the eyes of faith for contemplating his power. Thus
believers always have Christ present by his Spirit, and behold him, though they
be distant from him in body.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I

live</i>,<i> you also shall live</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>and
then the meaning will be, that believers <i>will live</i>,<i> because Christ
liveth</i>.<i> </i>I willingly embrace the former opinion, and yet we may draw
from it the other doctrine, that the life of Christ is the cause of our life. He
begins by pointing out the cause of the difference, why he shall be <i>seen
</i>by his disciples, and <i>not by the world</i>.<i> </i>It isn&#8217;t because
Christ cannot be <i>seen </i>but according to the spiritual life, of which the
world is deprived. <i>The world seeth not </i>Christ; this is not wonderful, for
the death of blindness is the cause; but as soon as any man begins to live by
the Spirit, he is immediately endued with eyes to see Christ. Now, the reason of
this is, that our life is closely connected with the life of Christ, and
proceeds from it as from its source; for we are dead in ourselves, and the life
with which we flatter ourselves is a very bad death. Accordingly, when the
question is, how we are to obtain life, our eyes must be directed to Christ, and
his life must be conveyed to us by faith, that our consciences may be fully
convinced, that, so long as Christ lives, we are free from all danger of
destruction; for it is an undoubted truth, that <i>his life </i>would be
nothing, when his members were dead.</font><br></div>

last resurrection. From that time they began to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>

wrought so powerfully in them. For the object of these words is, to show that we

union between us and him, and again, between him and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>but that the only way of knowing
it is, when he diffuses his life in us by the secret efficacy of the Spirit; and
this is the trial of faith, which I lately mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the manner in which this passage was formerly
abused by the Aryans, to prove that Christ is God only by participation and by
grace, it is easy to refute their sophistry. For Christ does not speak merely of
his eternal essence, but of that Divine power which was manifested in him. As
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>has laid up in the Son all
fullness of blessings, so, on the other hand, the Son has conveyed himself

<div><font face="Palatino">But there is no debate here about cause or effect;
and therefore there is no ground for the inference, that the love with which we
love Christ comes in order before the love which God has toward us; for Christ
meant only, that all who <i>love him </i>will be happy, because they will also
<i>be loved by him and by the Father</i>;<i> </i>not that God then begins to
<i>love </i>them, but because they have a testimony of his love to them, as a
Father, engraven on their hearts. To the same purpose is the clause which
immediately follows: &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will manifest myself to
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Knowledge undoubtedly goes before
love; but Christ&#8217;s meaning was, I will grant to those who purely observe
my doctrine, that they shall make progress from day to day in faith; &#8220;that
is, &#8220;I will cause them to approach more nearly and more familiarly to
<i>me</i>.&#8221;<i> </i>Hence infer, that the fruit of piety is progress in the
knowledge of Christ; for he who promises that he will give himself to him who
has it rejects hypocrites, and causes all to make progress in faith who,
cordially embracing the doctrine of the Gospel, bring themselves entirely into
obedience to it. And this is the reason why many fall back, and why we scarcely
see one in ten proceed in the right course; for the greater part do not deserve
that he should <i>manifest himself to them</i>.<i> </i>It ought also to be
observed, that a more abundant knowledge of Christ is here represented as an
extraordinary reward of our love to Christ; and hence it follows that it is an
invaluable treasure.</font><br></div>

Iscariot</i>)<i> saith to him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not
without reason that he asks why Christ does not cause his light to be imparted 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f400</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to more than a few persons; since he is <i>the Sun of Righteousness</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;390402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
4:2) by whom the whole world ought to be enlightened; and, therefore, it is
unreasonable that he should enlighten but a few, and not shed his light
everywhere without distinction. Christ&#8217;s reply does not solve the whole
question; for it makes no mention of the first cause, why Christ
&#8216;<i>manifested himself to </i>a few,&#8217; conceals himself from the
greater part of men; for certainly he finds all men at first alike, that is,
entirely alienated from him; and, therefore, he cannot choose any person who
loves him, but he chooses from among his enemies those whose hearts he bends to
the love of him. But he did not intend, at present, to take any notice of that
distinction, which was far from the object he had in view. His design was, to
exhort his disciples to the earnest study of godliness, that they might make
greater progress in faith; and, therefore, he is satisfied with distinguishing
them from the world by this mark, that they keep the doctrine of the
Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, this mark comes after the commencement of faith,
for it is the effect of their calling. In other passages, Christ had reminded
the disciples of their being called by free grace, and he will afterwards bring
it to their recollection. At present, he only enjoins them to observe his
doctrine, and to maintain godliness. By these words, Christ shows in what manner
the Gospel is properly obeyed. It is, when our services and outward actions
proceed from the love of Christ; for in vain do the arms, and the feet, and the
whole body toil, if the love of God does not reign in the heart, to govern the
outward members. Now, since it is certain that we <i>keep the commandments
</i>of Christ only in so far as we <i>love </i>him, it follows that a perfect
<i>love </i>of him can nowhere be found in the world, because there is no man
who <i>keeps his commandments </i>perfectly; yet God is pleased with the
obedience of those who sincerely aim at this end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And my Father will love
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have already explained that the
love of God to us is not placed in the second rank, as if it came after our
piety as the cause of that love, but that believers may be fully convinced that
the obedience which they render to the Gospel is pleasing to God, and that they
may continually expect from him fresh additions of gifts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we will come to him who loveth
me;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, he will feel that the grace
of God dwelleth in him, and will every day receive additions to the gifts of
God. He therefore speaks, not of that eternal love with which he loved us,
before we were born, and even before the world was created, but since the time
when he seals it on our hearts by making us partakers of his adoption.
Nor</font><font face="Palatino" color="Red"> </font><font face="Palatino">does
he even mean the first illumination, but those degrees of faith by which
believers must continually advance, according to that saying,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The Papists; therefore are wrong in inferring from
this passage that there are two kinds of love with which we love God. They
falsely maintain that we naturally love God, before he regenerates us by his
Spirit, and even that by this preparation we merit the grace of regeneration; as
if Scripture did not everywhere teach, and as if experience also did not loudly
proclaim, that we are altogether alienated from God, and that we are infected
and filled with hatred of him, until he change our hearts. We must therefore
keep in view the design of Christ, that he <i>and the Father will come</i>,<i>
</i>to confirm believers, in uninterrupted confidence in his
grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who loveth, me but keepeth
not my words.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As believers are mixed
with unbelievers in the world, and as they must be agitated by various storms,
as in a troubled sea, Christ again confirms them by this admonition, that they
may not be drawn away by bad examples. As if he had said, &#8220;Do not look
upon the world so as to depend on it; for there will always be some who despise
me and my doctrine; but as for you, preserve constantly to the end the grace
which you have once received.&#8221; Yet he likewise intimates that the world is
justly punished for its ingratitude, when it perishes in its blindness, since,
by despising true righteousness, it manifests a wicked hatred towards
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the word which you
hear.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That the disciples may not be
discouraged or waver on account of the obstinacy of the world, he again procures
credit to his doctrine, by testifying that it is from God, and that it was not
contrived by men on the earth. And, indeed, the strength of our faith consists
in our knowing that God is our leader, and that we are founded on nothing else
than his eternal truth. Whatever then may be the rage and madness of the world,
let us follow the doctrine of Christ, which rises far above heaven and earth.
When he says that <i>the word is not his</i>,<i> </i>he accommodates himself to
the disciples; as if he had said that it is not human, because he teaches
faithfully what has been enjoined on him by the Father. Yet we know that, in so
far as he is the eternal Wisdom of God, he is the only fountain of all doctrine,
and that all the prophets who have been from the beginning spoke by his
Spirit.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These things I have spoken to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He<i> </i>adds this, that they may
not despair, though they may have profited less than they ought to have done;
for at that time he scattered a seed of doctrine, which lay hidden, and, as it
were, suffocated in the disciples. He therefore exhorts them to entertain good
hopes, until fruit be yielded by the doctrine which might now appear to be
useless. In short, he testifies that in the doctrine which they had heard they
have abundant ground of consolation, and that they ought not to seek it anywhere
else. And if they do not immediately see it, he bids them be of good courage,
until the Holy Spirit, who is the inward Teacher, speak the same thing in their
hearts. This admonition is highly useful to all; for, if we do not immediately
understand what Christ teaches, we begin to grow weary, and grudge to bestow
unprofitable labor on what is obscure. But we must bring an eager desire to
receive instruction; we must lend our ears and give attention, if we desire to
make due proficiency in the school of God; and especially we need patience,
until the Holy Spirit enable us to understand what we thought that we had often
read or heard to no purpose. That the desire of learning may not be weakened in
us, or that we may not fall into despair, when we do not immediately perceive
the meaning of Christ speaking to us, let us know that this is spoken to us
all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Holy Spirit will bring to your
remembrance all things that I have said to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is indeed a punishment
threatened by Isaiah against unbelievers, that the Word of God shall be to them
<i>as a book that is sealed</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
29:11) but in this manner, also, the Lord frequently humbles his people. We
ought, therefore, to wait patiently and mildly for the time of revelation, and
must not, on that account, reject the word. When Christ testifies that it is the
peculiar office of the Holy Spirit to teach the apostles what they had already
learned from his mouth, it follows that the outward preaching will be vain and
useless, if it be not accompanied by the teaching of the Spirit. God has
therefore two ways of teaching; for, <i>first</i>,<i> </i>he sounds in our ears
by the mouth of men; and, <i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>he addresses us inwardly by
his Spirit; and he does this either at the same moment, or at different times,
as he thinks fit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But observe what are <i>all these things </i>which he
promises that the Spirit will teach. <i>He will suggest</i>,<i> </i>he says,
<i>or bring to your remembrance</i>,<i> </i>ALL THAT I HAVE SAID. Hence it
follows, that he will not be a builder of new revelations. By this single word
we may refute all the inventions which Satan has brought into the Church from
the beginning, under the pretense of the Spirit. Mahomet and the Pope agree in
holding this as a principle of their religion, that Scripture does not contain a
perfection of doctrine, but that something loftier has been revealed by the
Spirit. From the same point the Anabaptists and Libertines, in our own time,
have drawn their absurd notions. But the spirit that introduces any doctrine or
invention apart from the Gospel is a deceiving spirit, and not the Spirit of
Christ. What is meant by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Spirit being sent by the Father in the name of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>I have already
explained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.

word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he means prosperity, which men are
wont to wish for each other when they meet or part; for such is the import of
the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in the Hebrew language. He therefore alludes to the ordinary custom of his
nation; as if he had said, <i>I give you my Farewell</i>.<i> </i>But he
immediately adds, that this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is of far greater value than that which is usually to be found among men,
who generally have the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>but coldly in their mouth, by way of ceremony, or, if they sincerely wish
<i>peace </i>for any one, yet cannot actually bestow it. But Christ reminds them
that <i>his peace </i>does not consist in an empty and unavailing wish, but is
accompanied by the effect. In short, he says that he goes away from them in
body, but that <i>his peace </i>remains with the disciples; that is, that they
will be always happy through his blessing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let not your heart be
troubled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He again corrects the alarm
which the disciples had felt on account of his departure. It is no ground for
alarm, he tells them; for they want only his bodily presence, but will enjoy his
actual presence through the Spirit. Let us learn to be always satisfied with
this kind of presence, and let us not give a loose reign to the flesh, which
always binds God by its outward inventions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If you loved me you would
rejoice.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The disciples unquestionably
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>loved
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Christ, but not as they ought to have done; for
some carnal affection was mixed with their <i>love</i>,<i> </i>so that they
could not endure to be separated from him; but if they had <i>loved </i>him
spiritually, there was nothing which they would have had more deeply at heart,
than his return to the Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Father is greater than
I.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage has been tortured in
various ways. The Aryans, in order to prove that Christ is some sort of inferior
God, argued that <i>he is less than the Father</i>.<i> </i>The orthodox Fathers,
to remove all ground for such a calumny, said that this must have referred to
his</font><font face="Palatino" color="Red"> </font><font face="Palatino">human
nature; but as the Aryans wickedly abused this testimony, so the reply given by
the Fathers to their objection was neither correct nor appropriate; for Christ
does not now speak either of his human nature, or of his eternal Divinity, but,
accommodating himself to our weakness, places himself between God and us; and,
indeed, as it has not been granted to us to reach the height of God, Christ
descended to us, that he might raise us to it. <i>You ought to have
rejoiced</i>,<i> </i>he says, <i>because I return to the Father</i>;<i> </i>for
this is the ultimate object at which you ought to aim. By these words he does
not show in what respect he differs in himself from the Father, but why he
descended to us; and that was that he might unite us to God; for until we have
reached that point, we are, as it were, in the middle of the course. We too
imagine to ourselves but a half-Christ, and a mutilated Christ, if he do not
lead us to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is a similar passage in the writings of Paul,
where he says that Christ</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">will deliver up the
Kingdom to God his Father, that God may be all in all,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461524&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 15:24.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Christ certainly reigns, not only in human nature,
but as he is God manifested in the flesh. In what manner, therefore, will he lay
aside the kingdom? It is, because the Divinity which is now beheld in
Christ&#8217;s face alone, will then be openly visible in him. The only point of
difference is, that Paul there describes the highest perfection of the Divine
brightness, the rays of which began to shine from the time when Christ ascended
to heaven. To make the matter more clear, we must use still greater plainness of
speech. Christ does not here make a comparison between the Divinity of the
Father and his own, nor between his own human nature and the Divine essence of
the Father, but rather between his present state and the heavenly glory, to
which he would soon afterwards be received; as if he had said, &#8220;You wish
to detain me in the world, but it is better that I should ascend to
heaven.&#8221; Let us therefore learn to behold Christ humbled in the flesh, so
that he may conduct us to the fountain of a blessed immortality; for he was not
appointed to be our guide, merely to raise us to the sphere of the moon or of
the sun, but to make us one with God the Father.</font><br></div>

should be frequently admonished on this point; for it was a secret far exceeding
all human capacity. He testifies that he

believe</i>;</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for it was a useful
confirmation of their faith when they brought to recollection the predictions of
Christ, and saw accomplished before their eyes what they had formerly heard from
his mouth. Yet it appears to be a sort of concession, as if Christ had said,
&#8220;Because you are not yet capable of comprehending so deep a mystery, I
bear with you till the event has happened, which will serve as an interpreter to
explain this doctrine.&#8221; Although for a time he seemed to speak to the
deaf, yet it afterwards appeared that his words were not scattered in vain, or,
as we may say, in the air, but that it was a seed thrown into the earth. Now, as
Christ speaks here about his word and the accomplishment of events, so his
death, and resurrection, and ascension to heaven, are combined with doctrine,
that they may produce faith in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Henceforth I will not talk
much with you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this word he intended
to fix the attention of the disciples on himself, and to impress his doctrine
more deeply on their minds; for abundance generally takes away the appetite, and
we desire more eagerly what we have not in our possession, and delight more in
the enjoyment of that which is speedily to be taken from us. In order,
therefore, to make them more desirous of hearing his doctrines, he threatens
that he will very soon go away. Although Christ does not cease to teach us
during the whole course of our life, yet this statement may be applied to our
use; for, since the course of our life is short, we ought to embrace the present
opportunity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the prince of this world
cometh</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He might have said, in direct
language, that he would soon<i> </i>die, and that the hour of his death was at
hand; but he makes use of a circumlocution, to fortify their minds beforehand,
lest, terrified by a kind of death so hideous and detestable, they should faint;
for to believe in him crucified, what is it but to seek life in hell? First, he
says that his power will be given to Satan; and next he adds, That he will go
away, not because he is compelled to do so, but in order to obey the
Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The devil is called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the prince of this
world,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>not because he has a kingdom
separated from God, (as the Manicheans imagined,) but because, by God&#8217;s
permission, he exercises his tyranny over the world. Whenever, therefore, we
hear this designation applied to the devil, let us be ashamed of our miserable
condition; for, whatever may be the pride of men, they are the slaves of the
devil, till they are regenerated by the Spirit of Christ; for under the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>world
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is here included the whole human race. There is
but one Deliverer who frees and rescues us from this dreadful slavery. Now,
since this punishment was inflicted on account of the sin of the first man, and
since it daily grows worse on account of new sins, let us learn to hate both
ourselves and our sins. While we are held captives under the dominion of Satan,
still this slavery does not free us from blame, for it is voluntary. It ought
also to be observed, that what is done by wicked men is here ascribed to the
devil; for, since they are impelled by Satan, all that they do is justly
reckoned his work.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f403</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is in consequence of the sin of Adam that Satan holds the dominion of death,
and, therefore, he could not touch Christ, who is pure from all the pollution of
sin, if he had not voluntarily subjected himself. And yet I think that these
words have a wider meaning than that in which they are usually explained; for
the ordinary interpretation is, &#8220;Satan hath found nothing in Christ, for
there is nothing in him that deserves death, because he is pure from every stain
of sin.&#8221; But, in my opinion, Christ asserts here not only his own purity,
but likewise his Divine power, which was not subject to death; for it was proper
to assure the disciples that he did not yield through weakness, lest they should
think less highly of his power. But in this general statement the former is also
included, that, in enduring death, he was not compelled by Satan. Hence we
infer, that he was substituted in our room, when he submitted to
death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But that the world may

be read as closely connected with the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise</i>,<i> let us go
hence</i>,</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>so as to make the sense complete.
Others read the former part of the verse separately, and suppose that it breaks
off abruptly. As it makes no great difference in regard to the meaning, I leave
it to the reader to give a preference to either of these views. What chiefly
deserves our attention is, that the decree of God is here placed in the highest
rank; that we may not suppose that Christ was dragged to death by the violence
of Satan, in such a manner that anything happened contrary to the purpose of
God. It was God who appointed his Son to be the Propitiation, and who determined
that the sins of the world should be expiated by his death. In order to
accomplish this, he permitted Satan, for a short time, to treat him with scorn;
as if he had gained a victory over him. Christ, therefore, does not resist
Satan, in order that he may obey the decree of his Father, and may thus offer
his obedience as the ransom of our righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, let us go
hence.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some think that Christ, after he
said these things, changed his place, and that what follows was spoken by him on

Greek word

sometimes denotes <i>a vine</i>,<i> </i>and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">a]mpelov</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
a vineyard</i>,<i> </i>I am more disposed to adopt the opinion, that Christ
compares himself to a field planted with <i>vines</i>,<i> </i>and compares us to
the plants themselves. On that point, however, I will not enter into a debate
with any person; only I wish to remind the reader, that he ought to adopt that
view which appears to him to derive greater probability from the
context.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, let him remember the rule which ought to be
observed in all parables; that we ought not to examine minutely every property
of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the
vine</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>but only to take a general view of
the object to which Christ applies that comparison. Now, there are three
principal parts; first, that we have no power of doing good but what comes from
himself; secondly, that we, having a root in him, are dressed and pruned by the
Father; thirdly, that he removes the unfruitful branches, that they may be
thrown into the fire and burned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is scarcely any one who is ashamed to
acknowledge that every thing good which he possesses comes from God; but, after
making this acknowledgment, they imagine that universal grace has been given to
them, as if it had been implanted in them by nature. But Christ dwells
principally on this, that the vital sap &#8212; that is, all life and strength 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f405</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; proceeds from himself alone. Hence it follows, that the nature of man is
unfruitful and destitute of everything good; because no man has the nature of a
<i>vine</i>,<i> </i>till he be implanted in him. But this is given to the elect
alone by special grace. So then, the Father is the first Author of all
blessings, who plants us with his hand; but the commencement of life is in
Christ, since we begin to take root in him. When he calls himself <i>the
</i>TRUE <i>vine </i>the meaning is, <i>I am </i>TRULY <i>the</i>
<i>vine</i>,<i> </i>and therefore men toil to no purpose in seeking strength
anywhere else, for from none will useful fruit proceed but from <i>the branches
</i>which shall be produced by me.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every branch in me that
beareth not fruit</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As some men corrupt
the grace of God, others suppress it maliciously, and others choke it by
carelessness, Christ intends by these words to awaken anxious inquiry, by
declaring that all </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
branches</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which shall be unfruitful will
be cut off from </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
vine</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>But here comes a question. Can any
one who is engrafted into Christ be without fruit? I answer, many are supposed
to be <i>in the vine</i>,<i> </i>according to the opinion of men, who actually
have no root <i>in the vine</i>.<i> </i>Thus, in the writings of the prophets,
the Lord calls the people of Israel <i>his vine</i>,<i> </i>because, by outward
profession, they had the name of The Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And every branch that beareth,
fruit he pruneth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words, he
shows that believers need incessant culture that they may be prevented from
degenerating; and that they produce nothing good, unless God continually apply
his hand; for it will not be enough to have been once made partakers of
adoption, if God do not continue the work of his grace in us. He speaks of
pruning or <i>cleansing</i>, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f406</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>because our flesh abounds in superfluities and destructive vices, and is too
fertile in producing them, and because they grow and multiply without end, if we
are not <i>cleansed </i>or <i>pruned</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f407</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>by the hand of God. When he says that vines are <i>pruned</i>,<i> that they
may yield more abundant fruit</i>,<i> </i>he shows what ought to be the progress
of believers in the course of true religion?

him, and have also been <i>cleansed </i>or <i>pruned</i>.<i> </i>He points out
the means of <i>pruning</i>,<i> </i>namely, doctrine; and there can be no doubt
that he speaks of outward preaching, for he expressly
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mentions the
word,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which they had heard from his
mouth. Not that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

has so great efficacy, but, so far as Christ works in the heart by the Spirit,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>itself is the instrument of
<i>cleansing</i>.<i> </i>Yet Christ does not mean that the apostles are pure
from all sin, but he holds out to them their experience, that they may learn
from it that the continuance of grace is absolutely necessary. Besides, he
commends to them the doctrine of the gospel from the fruit which it produces,
that they may be more powerfully excited to meditate on it continually, since it
resembles the vine-dresser&#8217;s knife to take away what is
useless.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">lest our indifference should carry us away, and make
us fly to our destruction. In order to prove that he did not begin the work of
our salvation for the purpose of leaving it imperfect in the middle of the
course, he promises that his Spirit will always be efficacious in us, if we do
not prevent him. <i>Abide in me</i>,<i> </i>says he;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for I am ready to abide in

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who abideth in me beareth much

all who have a living root in him are fruit-bearing

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Without me you can do nothing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is
the conclusion and application of the whole parable. So long as we are separate
from him, we bear no fruit that is good and acceptable to God, for we are unable
to do anything good. The Papists not only extenuate this statement, but destroy
its substance, and, indeed, they altogether evade it; for, though in words they
acknowledge that <i>we can do nothing without Christ</i>,<i> </i>yet they
foolishly imagine that they possess some power, which is not sufficient in
itself, but, being aided by the grace of God, co-operates (as they say,) that
is, works along with it; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f409</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for they cannot endure that man should be so much annihilated as to do nothing
of himself. But these words of Christ are too plain to be evaded so easily as
they suppose. The doctrine invented by the Papists is, that we can do nothing
without Christ, but that, aided by him, we have something of ourselves in
addition to his grace. But Christ, on the other hand, declares that we can do
nothing of ourselves. <i>The branch</i>,<i> </i>he says, <i>beareth not fruit of
itself</i>;<i> </i>and, therefore, he not only extols the aid of his
co-operating grace, but deprives us entirely of all power but what he imparts to
us. Accordingly, this phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>without
me,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>must be explained as meaning,
<i>except from me</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Next follows another sophism; for they allege that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
branch</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>has something from nature, for if
another <i>branch</i>,<i> </i>which is not fruit-bearing, be engrafted in <i>the
vine</i>,<i> </i>it will produce nothing. But this is easily answered; for
Christ does not explain what the <i>branch </i>has naturally, before it become
united to the vine, but rather means that we begin to become <i>branches </i>at
the time when we are united to him. And, indeed, Scripture elsewhere shows that,
before we are in him, we are dry and useless wood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any one abide not in
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He again lays before them the
punishment of ingratitude, and, by doing so, excites and urges them to
perseverance. It is indeed the gift of God, but the exhortation to fear is not
uncalled for, lest our flesh, through too great indulgence, should root us
out.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He is cast out, and withered, like
a branch.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Those who are cut off from
Christ are said to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whither
</i></font><font face="Palatino">like a dead branch; because, as the
commencement of strength is from him, so also is its uninterrupted continuance.
Not that it ever happens that any one of the elect is
<i>dried</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Red"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>up</i>,<i> </i>but because there are many
hypocrites who, in outward appearance, flourish and are green for a time, but
who afterwards, when they ought to yield fruit, show the very opposite of that
which the Lord expects and demands from his people.

If you abide in me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Believers often feel that
they are starved, and are very far from that rich fatness which is necessary for
yielding abundant fruit. For this reason it is expressly added, Whatever those
who are in Christ may need, there is a remedy provided for their poverty, as
soon as they ask it from God. This is a very useful admonition; for the Lord
often suffers us to hunger, in order to train us to earnestness in prayer. But
if we fly to him, we shall never want what we ask, but, out of his inexhaustible
abundance, he will supply us with every thing that we need,

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If my words abide in
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He<i> </i>means that we take root
in him by faith; for as soon as we have departed from the doctrine of the
Gospel, we seek Christ separately from himself. When he promises that he will
grant whatever we wish, he does not give us leave to form wishes according to
our own fancy. God would do what was ill fitted to promote our welfare, if he
were so indulgent and so ready to yield to us; for we know well that men often
indulge in foolish and extravagant desires. But here he limits the wishes of his
people to the rule of praying in a right manner, and that rule subjects, to the
good pleasure of God, all our affections. This is confirmed by the connection in
which the words stand; for he means that his people
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or <i>desire </i>not riches, or honors, or any
thing of that nature, which the flesh foolishly desires, but the vital sap of

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In this my Father is

former statement; for he shows that we ought not to doubt that God will listen
to the prayers of his people, when they desire to be rendered fruitful; for this
contributes very greatly to his glory. But by this end or effect he likewise
kindles in them the desire of doing good; for there is nothing which we ought to
value more highly than that the name of God may be glorified by us. To the same
effect is the latter clause, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
you may become my disciples;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for he
declares that he has no one in his flock who does not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bear

God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
As the Father hath loved me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He intended
to express something far greater than is commonly supposed; for they who think
that he now speaks of the sacred <i>love </i>of God the Father, which he always
had towards the Son, philosophize away from the subject; for it was rather the
design of Christ to lay, as it were, in our bosom a sure pledge of God&#8217;s
<i>love </i>towards us. That abstruse inquiry, as to the manner in which the
Father always <i>loved </i>himself in the Son, has nothing to do with the
present passage. But the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which is here mentioned must be
understood as referring to us, because Christ testifies that <i>the Father loves
</i>him, as he is the Head of the Church. And this is highly necessary for us;
for he who without a Mediator, inquires how he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>loved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>by God, involves him in a labyrinth, in which he will neither discover the
entrance, nor the means of extricating himself. We ought therefore to cast our
eyes on Christ, in whom will be found the testimony and pledge of the love of
God; for the love of God was fully poured out on him, that from him it might
flow to his members. He is distinguished by this title, that he is <i>the
beloved Son</i>,<i> </i>in whom the will of the Father is satisfied,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
3:17.) But we ought to observe the end, which is, that God may accept us in him.
So, then, we may contemplate in him, as in a mirror, God&#8217;s paternal love
towards us all; because he is not <i>loved </i>apart, or for his own private
advantage, but that he may unite us with him to the Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Abide in my
love.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some explain this to mean, that
Christ demands from his disciples mutual
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>but others explain it better, who understand it to mean the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of Christ towards us. He means that we should continually enjoy that love
with which he once loved us, and, therefore, that we ought to take care not to
deprive ourselves of it; for many reject the grace which is offered to them, and
many throw away what they once had in their hands. So, then, since we have been
once received into the grace of Christ, we must see that we do not fall from it
through our own fault.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The conclusion which some draw from these words, that
there is no efficacy in the grace of God. unless it be aided by our
steadfastness, is frivolous. For I do not admit that the Spirit demands from us
no more than what is in our own power, but he shows us what we ought to do,
that, if our strength be deficient, we may seek it from some other quarter. In
like manner, when Christ exhorts us, in this passage, to perseverance, we must;
not rely on our own strength and industry, but we ought to pray to him who
commands us, that he would confirm us in his love.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If you keep my
commandments.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He points out to us the
method of perseverance. his, to follow where he calls, for, as Paul
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">They who are in Christ
walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
8:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For these two things are continually united, that
faith which perceives the undeserved love of Christ toward us, and a good
conscience and newness of life. And, indeed, Christ does not reconcile believers
to the Father, that they may indulge in wickedness without reserve, and without
punishment; but that, governing them by his Spirit, he may keep them under the
authority and dominion of his Father. Hence it follows, that the love of Christ
is rejected by those who do not prove, by true obedience, that they are his
disciples.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one object that, in that case, the security of
our salvation depends on ourselves, I reply, it is wrong to give such a meaning
to Christ&#8217;s words; for the obedience which believers render to him is not
the cause why he continues his love toward us, but is rather the effect of his
love. For whence comes it that they answer to their calling, but because they
are led by the Spirit of adoption of free grace?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But again, it may be thought that the condition
imposed on us is too difficult, that we should <i>keep the commandments </i>of
Christ, which contain the absolute perfection of righteousness, &#8212; a
perfection which far exceeds our capacity, &#8212; for hence it follows, that
the love of Christ will be useless, if we be not endued with angelical purity.
The answer is easy; for when Christ speaks of the desire of living a good and
holy life, he does not exclude what is the chief article in his doctrine,
namely, that which alludes to righteousness being freely imputed, in consequence
of which, through a free pardon, our duties are acceptable to God, which in
themselves deserved to be rejected as imperfect and unholy. Believers,
therefore, are reckoned as <i>keeping</i> <i>the commandments </i>of Christ when
they apply their earnest attention to them, though they be far distant from the
object at which they aim; for they are delivered from that rigorous sentence of
the law,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Cursed be he that hath
not confirmed all the words of this law to do them,

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As I also have kept my
Father&#8217;s commandments.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As we have
been elected in Christ, so in him the image of our calling is exhibited to us in
a lively manner; and therefore he justly holds himself out to us as a pattern,
to the imitation of which all the godly ought to be conformed. &#8220;In<i>
</i>me,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is<i> </i>brightly displayed the resemblance of
those things which I demand from you; for you see how sincerely I am devoted to
obedience to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my

course. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>too, hath loved me, not for a
moment, or for a short time, but his love toward me is constant.&#8221; This
conformity between the Head and the members ought to be always placed before our
eyes, not only that believers may form themselves after the example of Christ,
but that, they may entertain a confident hope that his Spirit will every day
form them anew to be better and better, that they may walk to the end in newness
of life.</font><br></div>

God which is possessed by all that have been justified by free grace. As often,

<div><font face="Palatino">I call him also the Author of it, because by his

cheerfulness. It is said to be <i>ours </i>for a different reason; because we
enjoy it since it has been given to us. Now since Christ declares that <i>he
spake these things</i>,<i> that the disciples might have joy</i>,<i> </i>we
conclude from these words, that all who have duly profited by this sermon have
something on which they can rest.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is my

regulate our life according to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of Christ, it is necessary, first of all, that we should understand what it
is that he <i>wills </i>or <i>commands</i>.<i> </i>He now therefore repeats what
he had formerly said, that it is his will, above all things, that believers
should cherish <i>mutual love </i>among themselves. True, the love and reverence
for God comes first in order, but as the true proof of it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>toward our neighbors, he dwells chiefly on this point. Besides, as he
formerly held himself out for a pattern in maintaining the general doctrine, so
he now holds himself out for a pattern in a particular instance; for he loved
all his people, that they may love each other. Of the reason why he lays down no
express rule, in this passage, about loving unbelievers, we have spoken under
the former chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Greater love hath no one than
this.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ sometimes proclaims the
greatness of his love to us, that he may more fully confirm our confidence in
our salvation; but now he proceeds further, in order to inflame us, by his
example, to love the brethren. Yet he joins both together; for he means that we
should taste by faith how inestimably delightful his goodness is, and next he
allures us, in this way, to cultivate brotherly love. Thus Paul
writes:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved
us, and hath given himself for us an offering and sacrifice to God of a
sweet-smelling savor,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
5:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God might have redeemed us by a single word, or by a
mere act of his will, if he had not thought it better to do otherwise for our
own benefit, that, by not sparing his own well-beloved Son, he might testify in
his person how much he cares for our salvation. But now our hearts, if they are
not softened by the inestimable sweetness of Divine love, must be harder than
stone or iron.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a question is put. How did Christ die for
friends, since</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">we were enemies, before
he reconciled us,

5:10;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for, by expiating our sins through the sacrifice of
his death, he destroyed the enmity that was between God and us? The answer to
this question will be found under the third chapter, where we said that, in
reference to us, there is a state of variance between us and God, till our sins
are blotted out by the death of Christ; but that the cause of this grace, which
has been manifested in Christ, was the

</i>Let this be regarded by you, therefore, as a pledge of my love toward you,
that I have, in a kind and friendly manner, explained to you the secrets of
heavenly wisdom which I had heard from the Father.&#8221; It is indeed a noble
commendation of the Gospel, that we have the heart of Christ opened (so to
speak) in it, so that we can no longer doubt of it or perceive it slightly. We
have no reason for desiring to rise above the clouds, or to penetrate into the
deep,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:6, 7) to obtain the certainty of our salvation. Let us be satisfied with this
testimony of his love toward us which is contained in the Gospel, for it will
never deceive us. Moses said to the ancient people,</font><br></div>

conferred on us, since God hath entirely conveyed himself to us in his Son. So
much the greater is the ingratitude and wickedness of those who, not satisfied
with the admirable wisdom of the Gospel, fly with proud eagerness to new
speculations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All that I have heard from my
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is certain that the disciples
did not know all that Christ knew, and indeed it was impossible that they should
attain to so great a height; and because the wisdom of God is incomprehensible,
he distributed to each of them a certain measure of knowledge, according as he
judged to be necessary. Why then does he say that he revealed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>I answer, this is limited to the
person and office of the Mediator. He places himself between God and us, having
received out of the secret sanctuary of God those things which he should deliver
to us &#8212; as the phrase is &#8212; from hand to hand. Not one of those
things, therefore, which related to our salvation, and which it was of
importance for us to know was omitted by Christ in the instructions given to his
disciples. Thus, so far as he was appointed to be the Master and Teacher of the
Church, he heard nothing from the Father which he did not faithfully teach his
disciples. Let us only have an humble desire and readiness to learn, and we
shall feel that Paul has justly called the Gospel <i>wisdom to make men

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You have not chosen
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He declares still more clearly that
it must not be ascribed to their own merit, but to his grace, that they have
arrived at so great an honor; for when he says that <i>he was not chosen by
them</i>,<i> </i>it is as if he had said, that whatever they have they did not
obtain by their own skill or industry. Men commonly imagine some kind of
concurrence to take place between the grace of God and the will of man; but that
contrast, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I chose you</i>,<i> I
was not chosen by you</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>claims,
exclusively, for Christ alone what is usually divided between Christ and man; as
if he had said, that a man is not moved of his own accord to seek Christ, until
he has been sought by him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">True, the subject now in hand is not the ordinary
<i>election </i>of believers, by which they are adopted to be the children of
God, but that special <i>election</i>,<i> </i>by which he set apart his
disciples to the office of preaching the Gospel. But if it was by free gift, and
not by their own merit, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>chosen
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to the apostolic office, much more is it
certain that the <i>election</i>,<i> </i>by which, from being the children of
wrath and an accursed seed, we become the children of God, is of free grace.
Besides, in this passage Christ magnifies his grace, by which they had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>chosen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to be Apostles, so as to join with it that former election by which they had
been engrafted into the body of the Church; or rather, he includes in these
words all the dignity and honor which he had conferred on them. Yet I
acknowledge that Christ treats expressly of the apostleship; for his design is,
to excite the disciples to execute their office diligently and faithfully. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f414</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He takes, as the ground of his exhortation, the
undeserved favor which he had bestowed on them; for the greater our obligations
to the Lord, the more earnest ought we to be in performing the duties which he
demands from us; otherwise it will be impossible for us to avoid the charge of
base ingratitude. Hence it appears that there is nothing which ought more
powerfully to kindle in us the desire of a holy and religious life, than when we
acknowledge that we owe every thing to God, and that we have nothing that is our
own; that both the commencement of our salvation, and all the parts which follow
from it, flow from his undeserved mercy. Besides, how true this statement of
Christ is, may be clearly perceived from the fact, that Christ <i>chose </i>to
be his apostles those who might have been thought to be the most unfit of all
for the office; though in their person he intended to preserve an enduring
monument of his grace. For, as Paul says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:16,) who among men shall be found fit for discharging the embassy
by which God reconciles mankind to himself? Or rather, what mortal is able to
represent the person of God? It is Christ alone who makes them fit by his
election. Thus Paul ascribes his <i>apostleship </i>to <i>grace</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:5,) and again mentions that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">he had been separated
from his mother&#8217;s
womb,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians
1:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nay more, since we are altogether useless servants,
those who appear to be the most excellent of all will not be fit for the
smallest calling, till they have been <i>chosen</i>.<i> </i>Yet the higher the
degree of honor to which any one has been raised, let him remember that he is
under the deeper obligations to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I have appointed
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The election is hidden till it is
actually made known, when a man receives an office to which he had been
appointed; as Paul, in the passage which I quoted a little ago, where he says
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he had been separated from
his mother</i>&#8217;<i>s womb</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>adds,
that he was created an apostle, because <i>it so pleased God</i>.<i> </i>His
words are:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">When it pleased God, who
separated me from my mother&#8217;s womb, and called me by his grace,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians
1:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus also the Lord testifies that he <i>knew
</i>Jeremiah <i>before he was in his mother</i>&#8217;<i>s womb</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:5,) though he calls him to the prophetical office at the proper and appointed
time. It may happen, no doubt, that one who is duly qualified enters into the
office of teaching; or rather, it usually happens in the Church that no one is
called till he be endued and furnished with the necessary qualifications. That
Christ declares himself to be the Author of both is not wonderful; since it is
only by him that God acts, and he acts along with the Father. So then, both
election and ordination belong equally to both.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That you may
go.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He<i> </i>now points out the reason
why he mentioned his grace. It was, to make them apply more earnestly to the
work. The apostleship was not a place of honor without toil, but they had to
contend with very great difficulties; and therefore Christ encourages them not
to shrink from labors, and annoyances, and dangers. This argument is drawn from
the end which they ought to have in view; but Christ reasons from the effect,
when he says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That you may bear
fruit;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for it is hardly possible that
any one would devote himself earnestly and diligently to the work, if he did not
expect that the labor would bring some advantage. Christ, therefore, declares
that their efforts will not be useless or unsuccessful, provided that they are
ready to obey and follow when he calls them. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f415</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For he not only enjoins on the apostles what their calling involves and demands,
but promises to them also prosperity and success, that they may not be cold or
indifferent. It is hardly possible to tell how great is the value of this
consolation against those numerous temptations which daily befall the ministers
of Christ. Whenever, then, we see that we are losing our pains, let us call to
remembrance that Christ will, at length, prevent our exertions from being vain
or unproductive; for the chief accomplishment of this promise is at the very
time when there is no appearance of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fruit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Scorners, and those whom the world looks upon as wise men, ridicule our
attempts as foolish, and tell us that it is in vain for us to attempt to mingle
heaven and earth; because the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fruit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>does not yet correspond to our wishes. But since Christ, on the contrary,
has promised that the happy result, though concealed for a time, will follow,
let us labor diligently in the discharge of our duty amidst the mockeries of the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that your fruit may
abide.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A question now arises, why does
Christ say that this <i>fruit </i>will be perpetual? As the doctrine of the
Gospel obtains souls to Christ for eternal salvation, many think that this is
the perpetuity of <i>the fruit</i>.<i> </i>But I extend the statement much
farther, as meaning that the Church will last to the very end of the world; for
the labor of the apostles yields <i>fruit </i>even in the present day, and our
preaching is not for a single age only, but will enlarge the Church, so that new
<i>fruit </i>will be seen to spring up after our death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>your
fruit</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he speaks as if it had been
obtained by their own industry, though Paul teaches that <i>they who plant or
water are nothing</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:7.) And, indeed, the formation of the Church is so excellent a
work of God, that the glory of it ought not to be ascribed to men. But as the
Lord displays his power by the agency of men, that they may not labor in vain,
he is wont to transfer to them even that which belongs peculiarly to himself.
Yet let us remember that, when he so graciously commends his disciples, it is to
encourage, and not to puff them up.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That your Father may give you all
that you ask in my name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This clause was
not added abruptly, as many might suppose; for, since the office of teaching far
exceeds the power of men, there are added to it innumerable attacks of Satan,
which never could be warded off but by the power of God. That the apostles may
not be discouraged, Christ meets them with the most valuable aid; as if he had
said, &#8220;If the work assigned to you be so great that you are unable to
fulfill the duties of your office, my Father will not forsake you; for I have
appointed you to be ministers of the Gospel on this condition, that my Father
will have his hand stretched out to assist you, whenever you pray to him,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in my
name</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>to grant you assistance.&#8221;
And, indeed, that the greater part of teachers either languish through
indolence, or utterly give way through despair, arises from nothing else than
that they are sluggish in the duty of prayer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This promise of Christ, therefore, arouses us to call
upon God; for whoever acknowledges that the success of his work depends on God
alone, will offer his labor to him with fear and trembling. On the other hand,
if any one, relying on his own industry, disregard the assistance of God, he
will either throw away his spear and shield, when he comes to the trial, or he
will be busily employed, but without any advantage. Now, we must here guard
against two faults, pride and distrust; for, as the assistance of God is
fearlessly disregarded by those who think that the matter is already in their
own power, so many yield to difficulties, because they do not consider that they
fight through the power and protection of God, under whose banner they go forth
to war.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These things I command
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This too, was appropriately added,
that the Apostles might know that mutual love among ministers is demanded above
all things, that they may be employed, with one accord, in building up the
Church of God; for there is no greater hindrance than when every one labors
apart, and when all do not direct their exertions to the common good. If, then,
ministers do not maintain brotherly intercourse with each other, they may
possibly erect some large heaps, but latterly disjointed and confused; and, all
the while, there will be no building of a Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If the world hate
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After having armed the Apostles for
the battle, Christ exhorts them likewise to patience; for the Gospel cannot be
published without instantly driving the world to rage. Consequently, it will
never be possible for godly teachers to avoid the hatred of the world. Christ
gives them early information of this, that they may not be instances of what
usually happens to raw recruits, who, from wont of experience, are valiant
before they have seen their enemies, but who tremble as soon as the battle is
commenced. And not only does Christ forewarn his disciples, that nothing may
happen to them which is new and unexpected, but likewise confirms them by his
example; for it is not reasonable that Christ should be <i>hated by the
world</i>,<i> </i>and that we, who represent his person, should have the world
on our side, which is always like itself.</font><br></div>

Christ, who is far exalted above them, was not exempted from the hatred of the
world, and therefore his ministers ought not to refuse the same condition; for
the phraseology is the same as that which we have seen twice before, in

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

passage, all who have not been regenerated by the Spirit of God; for he
contrasts the Church with <i>the world</i>,<i> </i>as we shall see more fully
under the seventeenth chapter. And yet this doctrine does not contradict the
exhortation of Paul,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Be at peace with all men,
as far as lieth in
you,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans

that we ought to see what is right and proper for us to do that no man, by
seeking to please <i>the world</i>,<i> </i>may give himself up to its
corruptions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is still another objection that may be
urged; for we see that it commonly happens that wicked men, who are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>are not only <i>hated</i>,<i>
</i>but accursed by others. In this respect, certainly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the world
loveth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what is its
own</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I<i> </i>reply, earthly men, who are
regulated by the perception of their flesh, never have a true hatred of sin, but
only so far as they are affected by the consideration of their own convenience
or injury. And yet the intention of Christ was not to deny that <i>the world
</i>foams and rages within itself by internal quarrels. He only intended to
show, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the world
hates</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>nothing in believers but what is
of God. And hence, too, it plainly appears how foolish are the dreams of the
Anabaptists, who conclude, from this single argument that they are the servants
of God, because they displease the greater part of men. For it is easy to reply,
that many who are <i>of the world </i>favor their doctrine, because they are
delighted at the thought of having every thing in shameful confusion; while many
who are <i>out of the world </i>hate it, because they are desirous that the good
order of the state should remain unbroken.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.

very different; but I think that it is more suitable to read it in the
imperative mood, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remember the
word.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is a confirmation of what
Christ had spoken immediately before, when he said that he was hated by the
world, though he was far more excellent than his disciples; for it is
unreasonable that the condition of <i>the servant </i>should be better than that
of <i>his master</i>.<i> </i>Having spoken of persons, he likewise makes mention
of doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they have heard my word, they
will keep yours also.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Nothing gives
greater uneasiness to the godly than when they see the doctrine, which is of
God, haughtily despised by men; for it is truly shocking and dreadful, and the
sight of it might shake the stoutest heart. But when we remember on the other
hand, that not less obstinate resistance was manifested against the Son of God
himself, we need not wonder that the doctrine of God is so little reverenced
among men. When he calls it <i>his doctrine </i>and <i>their doctrine</i>,<i>
</i>this refers to the ministry. Christ is the only Teacher of the Church; but
he intended that <i>his doctrine</i>,<i> </i>of which he had been the first
Teacher, should be afterwards preached by the apostles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But all these things they
will do to you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the fury of the world
is monstrous, when it is so enraged against the doctrine of its own salvation,
Christ assigns the reason to be, that it is hurried on by blind ignorance to its
own destruction; for no man would deliberately engage in battle against God. It
is blindness and ignorance of God, therefore, that hurries on the world, so that
it does not hesitate to make war with Christ. We ought, then, always to observe
the cause of this conduct, and the true consolation consists in nothing else
than the testimony of a good conscience. It should also excite gratitude in our
minds, that, while the world perishes in its blindness, God hath given to us his
light. Yet let it be understood that hatred of Christ arises from stupidity of
mind, when God is not known; for, as I have often said, unbelief is blind; not
that wicked men do not understand or know anything, but because all the
knowledge that they have is confused, and quickly vanishes away. On this subject
I have elsewhere treated more largely.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I had not
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He had said that the Jews regarded
the Gospel with hatred, because they did not know God. Lest any one should think
that this tended to alleviate their guilt, he adds, that it is through malice
that they are blind, just as if one were to shut his eyes, that he might not be
compelled to see the light. For otherwise it might have been brought as an
objection against Christ. &#8220;If they do not know thy Father, how comes it
that thou dost not cure their ignorance? Why didst thou not at least make trial
whether they were altogether incapable of being taught, or not?&#8221; He
replies, that he has performed the duty of a good and faithful Teacher, but
without success, because their malice would not suffer them to acquire soundness
of mind. In the person of those men he intended to strike terror into all who
reject the truth of God, when it is offered to them, or intentionally fight
against it, when it is known. And though a dreadful vengeance awaits them, still
Christ, in this passage, looks chiefly to his own disciples, to animate them by
the confident and well-grounded expectation of victory, lest, at any time, they
should yield to the malice of wicked men; for when we learn that such will be
the issue, we may already triumph, as if we were in the midst of the
battle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They would not have
sin.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It may be thought that Christ
intended by these words to say, that there is no other sin but unbelief; and
there are some who think so. Augustine speaks more soberly, but he approaches to
that opinion; for, since faith forgives and blots out all sins, he says, that
the only sin that damns a man is unbelief. This is true, for unbelief not only
hinders men from being delivered from the condemnation of death, but is the
source and cause of all evils. But the whole of that reasoning is inapplicable
to the present passage; for the
word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is not taken in a general sense, but
as related to the subject which is now under consideration; as if Christ had
said, that their ignorance is utterly inexcusable, because in his person they
maliciously rejected God; just as if we were to pronounce a person to be
innocent, just, and pure, when we wished merely to acquit him of a single crime
of which he had been accused. Christ&#8217;s acquittal of them, therefore, is
confined to one kind of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sin</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>because it takes away from the Jews every pretense of ignorance in this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sin</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f416</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of despising and hating the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is still another question that arises:
&#8220;Was not unbelief sufficient to condemn men before the coming of
Christ?&#8221; There are fanatics who reason inconclusively from this passage,
that all who died before the coming of Christ died without faith, and remained
in a state of doubt and suspense till Christ manifested himself to them; as if
there were not many passages of Scripture which testify that their conscience
alone was sufficient to condemn them. <i>Death</i>,<i> </i>says Paul, <i>reigned
in the world even to Moses</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:14.) And again he declares, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">they who have sinned
without law shall perish without law,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
2:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, then, does Christ mean? There is undoubtedly an
admission made in these words, by which he means that the Jews have nothing more
to offer in extenuation of their guilt, since they knowingly and willfully
rejected the life which was offered to them. Thus the excuse which he makes for
them does not free them from all blame, but only extenuates the heinousness of
their crime, according to that saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The</i> <i>servant</i>,<i> who
knoweth the will of his master</i>,<i> and despiseth it</i>,<i> shall be
severely punished</i></font><font face="Palatino">? 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f417</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>For it was not the intention of Christ here to promise pardon to any, but to
hold his enemies convicted, who had obstinately rejected the grace of God, that
it might be fully evident that they were unworthy of all pardon and
mercy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I had not come and </i>SPOKEN TO
THEM<i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It ought to be observed, that he does
not speak of his coming, as viewed by itself, but as connected with his
doctrine, for they would not have been held guilty of so great a crime on
account of his bodily presence alone, but the contempt of the doctrine made them
utterly inexcusable.</font><br></div>

doctrine of the Gospel without manifesting his impiety against God. There are
many, indeed, who profess differently in words; for, though they abhor the
Gospel, still they wish to be thought very good servants of God; but it is
false, for a contempt of God is concealed within. In this manner Christ
discovers the hypocrisy of many by the light of his doctrine; and on this

It is commonly objected, that he did not perform more miracles or greater
miracles than Moses and the Prophets. The answer is well known, that Christ is
more eminent in miracles in this respect, that he was not merely a minister,
like the rest, but was strictly the Author of them; for he employed his own
name, his own authority, and his own power, in performing miracles. But, as I
have said, he includes in general all the testimonies of heavenly and spiritual
power by which his Divinity was displayed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have seen and hated.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He<i> </i>concludes that his enemies cannot
escape by any shifts to which they may have recourse, since they despised his
power, which evidently was altogether Divine; for God had openly manifested his
Divinity in the Son; and therefore it would serve no purpose for them to say
that they had only to do with a mortal man. This passage reminds us to consider
attentively the works of God, in which, by displaying his power, he wishes us to
render the honor which is due to him. Hence it follows, that all who obscure the
gifts of God, or who contemptuously overlook them, are ungrateful to God, and
malicious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But that the word may be

appears to be incredible. But nothing is more contrary to reason than to hate
God; and, therefore, Christ says that so great was the malice with which their
minds were envenomed, that <i>they hated him without a cause</i>.<i> </i>Christ
quotes a passage from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;193519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
35:19, which, he says, is now <i>fulfilled</i>.<i> </i>Not that the same thing
did not happen, formerly, to David, but to reprove the obstinate malice of the
nation, which reigned perpetually from age to age, being continued from
grandfathers to grandchildren in unbroken succession; as if he had said, that
they were in no respect better than their fathers, who <i>hated </i>David
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>without a

than an appendage to <i>the Law</i>;<i> </i>and we know that the ministry of
Moses lasted till the time of Christ. He calls it THEIR <i>Law</i>,<i> </i>not
as an expression of respect for them, but to wound them more deeply by a
designation which was well known among them; as if he had said, &#8220;They have
<i>a Law </i>transmitted to them by hereditary right, in which they see their
morals painted to the life.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But when the Comforter is

apostles that the Gospel ought not to be less highly valued by them, because it
has many adversaries, even within the Church itself; Christ now, in opposition
to the wicked fury of those men, produces the testimony of the Spirit, and if
their consciences rest on this testimony, they will never be shaken; as if he
had said, &#8220;True,<i> </i>the world will rage against you; some will mock,
and others will curse your doctrine; but none of their attacks will be so
violent as to shake the firmness of your faith, when <i>the Holy Spirit
</i>shall have been given to you to establish you by his testimony.&#8221; And,
indeed, when the world rages on all sides, our only protection is, that the
truth of God, scaled by the Holy Spirit on our hearts, despises and defies all
that is in the world; for, if it were subject to the opinions of men, our faith
would be overwhelmed a hundred times in a day.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought, therefore, to observe carefully in what
manner we ought to remain firm among so many storms. It is
because</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">we have received, not the spirit of the
world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things which have
been given to us by God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 2:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This single witness powerfully drives away, scatters,
and overturns, all that the world rears up to obscure or crush the truth of God.
All who are endued with this Spirit are so far from being in danger of falling
into despondency on account of the hatred or contempt of the world, that every
one of them will obtain glorious victory over the whole world. Yet we must
beware of relying on the good opinion of men; for so long as faith shall wonder
in this manner, or rather, as soon as it shall have gone out of the sanctuary of
God, it must become involved in miserable uncertainty. It must, therefore, be
brought back to the inward and secret testimony of the Spirit, which, believers
know, has been given to them from heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Spirit is said to <i>testify of Christ</i>,<i>
</i>because he retains and fixes our faith on him alone, that we may not seek
elsewhere any part of our salvation. He calls him also the <i>Comforter</i>,<i>
</i>that, relying on his protection, we may never be alarmed; for by this title
Christ intended to fortify our faith, that it may not yield to any temptations.
When he calls him </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Spirit of
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>we must apply the term to the
matter in hand; for we must presuppose a contrast to this effect, that, when
they have not this Witness, men are carried about in various ways, and have no
firm resting-place, but, wherever he speaks, he delivers the minds of men from
all doubt and fear of being deceived.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says that he <i>will send him from the
Father</i>,<i> </i>and, again, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he proceedeth from the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he does so in order to increase
the weight of his authority; for the testimony of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>would not be sufficient against
attacks so powerful, and against efforts so numerous and fierce, if we were not
convinced that <i>he
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>proceedeth from
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>So then it is Christ who sends the
Spirit, but it is from the heavenly glory, that we may know that it is not a
gift of men, but a sure pledge of Divine grace. Hence it appears how idle was
the subtlety of the Greeks, when they argued, on the ground of these words, that
the Spirit does not</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
proceed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>from the Son; for here Christ,
according to his custom, mentions <i>the Father </i>in order to raise our eyes
to the contemplation of his Divinity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

means that the testimony of <i>the Spirit </i>will not be of such a nature that
the apostles shall have it for their private advantage, or that they alone shall
enjoy it, but that by them it will be widely diffused, because they will be
organs of the Holy Spirit, as indeed, he spoke by their mouth. We now see in
what way <i>faith is by hearing</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These things I have
spoken to you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He again states that none
of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those things which he has
spoken </i>are</font><font face="Palatino"> superfluous; for, since wars and
contests await them, it is necessary that they should be provided beforehand
with the necessary arms. Yet he also means that, if they meditate deeply on this
doctrine, they will be fully prepared for resistance. Let us remember that what
he then said to the disciples is also spoken to us. And, first, we ought to
understand that Christ does not send his followers into the field unarmed, and,
therefore, that, if any man fail in this warfare, his own indolence alone is to
blame. And yet we ought not to wait till the struggle be actually commenced, but
ought rather to endeavor to become well acquainted with these discourses of
Christ, and to render them familiar to our minds, so that we may march into the
field of battle, as soon as it is necessary; for we must not doubt that the
victory is in our hands, so long as those admonitions of Christ shall be deeply
imprinted on our minds. For, when he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">THAT YOU MAY NOT<i> be
offended</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he means that there is no
danger, lest anything turn us aside from the right course. But how few there are
that learn this doctrine in a proper manner, is evident from this fact, that
they who think that they know it by heart when they are beyond arrow-shot, are
no sooner obliged to enter into actual combat than they give way, as if they
were utterly ignorant, and had never received any instruction. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f422</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Let us, therefore accustom ourselves to use this armor in such a manner that it
may never drop out of our hands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They will drive you out
of the synagogues.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This was no light
offense to disturb their minds, that they were to be banished like wicked men
from the assembly of the godly, or, at least, of those who boasted that they
were the people of God, and gloried in the title of <i>The Church</i>;<i>
</i>for believers are subject not only to persecutions, but to ignominy and
reproaches, as Paul tells us,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:12, 18.) But Christ bids them stand firm against this attack;
because, though they be <i>banished from the synagogues</i>,<i> </i>still they
remain within the kingdom of God. His statement amounts to this, that we ought
not to be dismayed by the perverse judgments of men, but ought to endure boldly
the reproach of the cross of Christ, satisfied with this single consideration,
that our cause which men unjustly and wickedly condemn, is approved by
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence too we infer, that the ministers of the Gospel
not only are ill treated by the avowed enemies of the faith, but sometimes also
endure the greatest reproaches from those who appear to belong to the Church,
and who are even regarded as its pillars. The scribes and priests, by whom the
apostles were condemned, boasted that they were appointed by God to be judges of
the Church; and, indeed, the ordinary government of the Church was in their
hands, and the office of judging was from God, and not from men. But by their
tyranny, they had corrupted the whole of that order which God had appointed. The
consequence was, that the power which had been given to them for edification,
was nothing else thorn a cruel oppression of the servants of God; and
excommunication, which ought to have been a medicine for purifying the Church,
was turned to an opposite purpose, for driving away from it the fear of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since the apostles knew this by experience, in their
own age, we have no reason to be greatly alarmed at the Pope&#8217;s
excommunications, with which he thunders against us on account of the testimony
of the Gospel; for we ought not to fear that they will do us any more injury
than those ancient excommunications which were made against the apostles. Nay
more, nothing is more desirable than to be driven out of that assembly from
which Christ is banished. Yet let us observe that, though the abuse of
excommunication was so gross, still it did not effect the destruction of that
discipline which God had appointed in his Church from the beginning; for, though
Satan devotes his utmost efforts to corrupt all the ordinances of God, we must
not yield to him, so as to take away, on account of corruptions, what God has
appointed to be perpetual. Excommunication, therefore, not less than Baptism and
the Lord&#8217;s Supper, must be brought back, by the correction of abuses, to
its pure and lawful use.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the hour
cometh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ dwells still more largely
on this <i>offense</i>,<i> </i>that the enemies of the Gospel lay claim to so
much authority, that they think they are offering sacrifices to God where they
slay believers. It is sufficiently hard in itself, that innocent people should
be cruelly tormented, but it is far more grievous and distressing that those
outrages, which wicked men commit against the children of God, should be
reckoned punishments justly due to them on account of their crimes. But we ought
to be so fully assured of the protection of a good conscience, as to endure
patiently to be oppressed for a time, till Christ appear from heaven, to defend
his cause and ours.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be thought strange, however, that the enemies
of the truth, though they are conscious of their own wickedness, not only impose
on men, but even in the presence of God lay claim to praise for their unjust
cruelty. I reply, hypocrites, though their conscience accuses them, always
resort to flatteries to deceive themselves. They are ambitious, cruel, and
proud, but they cover all these vices with the cloak of zeal, that they may
indulge in them without restraint. To this is added what may be called a furious
drunkenness, after having tasted the blood of martyrs.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they will do these
things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Not without good reason does
Christ frequently remind the apostles of this consideration, that there is only
one reason why unbelievers are so greatly enraged against them. It is, because
they do not know God. And yet this is not said for the purpose of extenuating
their guilt, but that the apostles may boldly despise their blind fury; for it
often happens that the authority which wicked men possess, and the luster which
shines in them, shake modest and pious minds. But Christ, on the other hand,
enjoins his followers to rise with holy magnanimity, to despise their
adversaries, who are impelled by nothing else than error and blindness; for this
is our wall of brass, when we are fully persuaded that God is on our side, and
that they who oppose us are destitute of reason. Again, these words remind us,
what a serious evil it is not to know God, since it leads even those who have
murdered their own parents to expect praise and approbation for their
wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That when the hour
cometh, you may remember.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He repeats
what he had already said, that this is not a philosophy fitted only for a season
of leisure, but that it is adapted to practice and use, and that he now
discourses on these matters, that they may actually demonstrate that they have
not been taught in vain. When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that you may
remember</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he enjoins them, first, to lay
up in their minds what they have heard; secondly, to remember them, when they
shall be required to put them in practice; and, lastly, he declares that no
small importance attaches to the fact, that he utters predictions of future
events.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I told you not these things at
the beginning.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the apostles were
still weak and tender, so long as Christ conversed with them in the flesh, their
singularly good and indulgent Master spared them, and did not suffer them to be
urged beyond what they were able to bear. At that time, therefore, they had no
great need of confirmation, while they enjoyed leisure and freedom from
persecution; but now he tells them that they must change their mode of life, and
as a new condition awaits them, he likewise exhorts them to prepare for a
conflict.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And now I go to him who
sent me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By a very excellent consolation
he assuages the grief which they might feel on account of his departure, and
this was highly necessary. They who had hitherto been allowed to remain at their
ease, were called to severe and arduous battles for the future. What then, would
have become of them, if they had not known that Christ was in heaven, as the
guardian of their salvation? For <i>to go to the Father </i>is nothing else than
to be received into the heavenly glory, in order to possess the highest
authority. This is held out to them, therefore, as a solace and remedy of grief,
that, though Christ be absent from them in body, yet he will sit at the right
hand of the Father, to protect believers by his power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here Christ reproves the apostles for two faults;
first, that they were too much attached to the visible presence of his flesh;
and, secondly, that, when this had been taken away, they were seized with grief,
and did not lift their eyes to a higher region. The same thing happens to us;
for we always hold Christ bound by our senses, and then, if he do not appear to
us according: to our desire, we contrive for ourselves a ground of
despair.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And none of you asketh me, whither
goest thou?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It may appear to be an
unfounded charge against the apostles, that they <i>did not ask whether
</i>their Master <i>was going</i>;<i> </i>for they had formerly inquired at him
on this subject with great earnestness. But the answer is easy. When they
inquired, they did not raise their minds to confidence, and this was the chief
duty which they were bound to perform. The meaning therefore is, as soon as you
hear of my departure, you become alarmed, and do not consider <i>whither I am
going</i>,<i> </i>or for what purpose I go away.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet I tell you the
truth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That they may no longer wish to
have him present before their eyes, he testifies that his absence will be
advantageous, and makes use of a sort of oath; for we are carnal, and
consequently nothing is more difficult than to tear from our minds this foolish
inclination, by which we attempt to draw down Christ from heaven to us. He
explains where the advantage lies, by saying, that the Holy Spirit could not be
given to them, if he did not leave the world. But far more advantageous and far
more desirable is that presence of Christ, by which he communicates himself to
us through the grace and power of his Spirit, than if he were present before our
eyes. And here we must not put the question, &#8220;Could<i> </i>not Christ have
drawn down the Holy Spirit while he dwelt on earth?&#8221; For Christ takes for
granted all that had been decreed by the Father and, indeed, when the Lord has
once pointed out what he wishes to be done, to dispute about what is possible
would be foolish and pernicious.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when he is
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Passing by the diversity of
expositions, which we have received in consequence of the obscurity of the
passage, I shall only state what appears to me to be in accordance with
Christ&#8217;s true meaning. He had promised his <i>Spirit </i>to the disciples;
and now he praises the excellence of the gift from its effect, because this
<i>Spirit </i>will<i> </i>not only guide, support, and protect them in private,
but will extend more widely his power and efficacy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will convince the
world;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, he will not remain shut
up in you, but; his power will go forth from you to be displayed to the whole
world. He therefore promises to them a<i> Spirit</i>,<i> </i>who will be the
Judge of the world, and by whom their preaching will be so powerful and
efficacious, that it will bring into subjection those who formerly indulged in
unbounded licentiousness, and were restrained by no fear or
reverence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought to be observed, that in this passage Christ
does not speak of secret revelations, but of the power of the Spirit, which
appears in the outward doctrine of the Gospel, and in the voice of men. For how
comes it that the voice proceeding from the mouth of a man 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f423</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
penetrates into the hearts, takes root there, and at length yields fruit,
changing hearts of stone into hearts of flesh, and renewing men, but because the
Spirit of Christ quickens it? Otherwise it would be a dead letter and a useless
sound, as Paul says in that beautiful passage, in which he boasts of being <i>a
minister of the Spirit</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:6,) because God wrought powerfully in his doctrine. The meaning
therefore is, that, though the Spirit had been given to the apostles, they would
be endued with a heavenly and Divine power, by which they would exercise
jurisdiction over the whole world. Now, this is ascribed to the Spirit rather
than to themselves, because they will have no power of their own, but will be
only ministers and organs, and the Holy Spirit will be their director and
governor. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f424</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Under the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>are, I think, included not only those who would be truly converted to
Christ, but hypocrites and reprobates. For there are two ways in which <i>the
Spirit convinces </i>men by the preaching of the Gospel. Some are moved in good
earnest, so as to bow down willingly, and to assent willingly to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>by which they are condemned. Others, though they are convinced of guilt and
cannot escape, yet do not sincerely yield, or submit themselves to the authority
and jurisdiction of the Holy Spirit, but, on the contrary, being subdued they
groan inwardly, and, being overwhelmed with confusion, still do not cease to
cherish obstinacy within their hearts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive in what manner the Spirit was to
CONVINCE <i>the world </i>by the apostles. It was, because God revealed his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in the Gospel, by which their consciences were struck, and began to perceive
their evils and the grace of God. for the verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejle&gt;gcein</font><font face="Koine">
</font><font face="Palatino">here signifies <i>to convince </i>or
<i>convict</i>;<i> </i>and, for understanding this passage, not a little light
will be obtained from the words of the Apostle Paul, when he
says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">If all shall prophesy, and an unbeliever
or unlearned man enter, he is CONVICTED by all, he is judged by all, and thus
shall the secrets of his heart be made manifest,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461423&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 14:23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In that passage Paul speaks particularly of one kind
of <i>conviction</i>,<i> </i>that is; when the Lord brings his elect to
repentance by the Gospel; but this plainly shows in what manner <i>the Spirit
</i>of God, by the sound of the human voice, constrains men, who formerly were
not accustomed to his yoke, to acknowledge and submit to his
authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A question now arises, For what purpose did Christ
say this? Some think that he points out the cause of the hatred which he had
mentioned; as if he had said, that the reason why they will be hated by <i>the
world </i>is, that <i>the Spirit</i>,<i> </i>on the other hand, will earnestly
solicit <i>the world </i>by means of them. But I rather agree with those who
tell us that the design of Christ was different, as I stated briefly at the
commencement of the exposition of this verse; for it was of great importance
that the apostles should know that the gift of <i>the Spirit</i>,<i> </i>which
had been promised to them, was of no ordinary value. He therefore describes its
uncommon excellence, by saying that God will, in this way, erect his tribunal
for<i> judging </i>the whole <i>world</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of
sin.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It now remains that we see what it
is to <i>convince of sin</i>.<i> </i>Christ appears to make unbelief the only
cause </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
sin</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and this is tortured by
commentators in various ways; but, as I have already said, I do not intend to
detail the opinions which have been held and advanced. First, it ought to be
observed, that the <i>judgment of the Spirit </i>commences with the
demonstration <i>of</i> <i>sin</i>;<i> </i>for the commencement of spiritual
instruction is, that men born in <i>sin </i>have nothing in them but what leads
to <i>sin</i>.<i> </i>Again, Christ mentioned
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unbelief</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>in order to show what is the nature of men in itself for, since faith is the
bond by which he is united to us, until we believe in him, we are out of him and
separated from him. The import of these words is as if he had said,
&#8220;<i>When the Spirit is come</i>,<i> </i>he will produce full conviction
that, apart from me, <i>sin </i>reigns in <i>the world</i>;&#8221;<i> </i>and,
therefore, unbelief is here mentioned, because it separates us from Christ, in
consequence of which nothing is left to us but <i>sin</i>.<i> </i>In short, by
these words he condemns the corruption and depravity of human nature, that we
may not suppose that a single drop of integrity is in us without
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of
righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We must attend to the
succession of steps which Christ lays down. He now says that <i>the world
</i>must be <i>convinced </i>OF RIGHTEOUSNESS; for men will never hunger and
thirst for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>but, on the contrary, will disdainfully reject all that is said concerning
it, if they have not been moved by a conviction <i>of sin</i>.<i> </i>As to
believers particularly, we ought to understand that they cannot make progress in
the Gospel till they have first been humbled; and this cannot take place, till
they have acknowledged their sins. It is undoubtedly the peculiar office of the
Law to summon consciences to the judgment-seat of God, and to strike them with
terror; but the Gospel cannot be preached in a proper manner, till it lead men
from <i>sin </i>to <i>righteousness</i>,<i> </i>and from death to life; and,
therefore, it is necessary to borrow from the Law that first clause of which
Christ spoke.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>must here be understood that which is imparted to us through the grace of
Christ. Christ makes it to consist in his ascension to the Father, and not
without good reason; for, as Paul declares that he <i>rose for our
justification</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450425&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:25) so he now sits at the right hand of the Father in such a manner as to
exercise all the authority that has been given to him, and thus to <i>fill all
things</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:10.) In short, from the heavenly glory he fills the world with the sweet savor
of his <i>righteousness</i>.<i> </i>Now <i>the Spirit </i>declares, by the
Gospel, that this is the only way in which we are accounted <i>righteous</i>.<i>
</i>Next to the conviction of <i>sin</i>,<i> </i>this is the second step, that
<i>the Spirit </i>should <i>convince the world </i>what true <i>righteousness
</i>is, namely, that Christ, by his ascension to heaven, has established the
kingdom of life, and now sits at the right hand of the Father, to confirm true
<i>righteousness</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of
judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Those who understand the word
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kri&gt;sewv</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>judgment </i>as signifying <i>condemnation</i>,<i> </i>have some argument on
their side; for Christ immediately adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the prince of this world hath
been judged</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>But I prefer a different
opinion, namely, that, the light of the Gospel having been kindled, <i>the
Spirit </i>manifests that the world has been brought into a state of good order
by the victory of Christ, by which he overturned the authority of Satan; as if
he had said, that this is a true restoration, by which all things are reformed,
when Christ alone holds the kingdom, having subdued and triumphed over Satan.
<i>Judgment</i>,<i> </i>therefore, is contrasted with what is confused and
disordered, or, to express it briefly, it is the opposite
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">th~v
ajtaxi&gt;av</font><font face="Palatino">) of <i>confusion</i>,<i> </i>or, we
might call it <i>righteousness</i>,<i> </i>a<i> </i>sense which it often bears
in Scripture. The meaning therefore is, that Satan, so long as he retains the
government, perplexes and disturbs all things, so that there is an unseemly and
disgraceful confusion in the works of God; but when he is stripped of his
tyranny by Christ, then the world is restored, and good order is seen to reign.
Thus </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Spirit convinces the
world of judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>that is, having
vanquished the prince of wickedness, Christ restores to order those things which
formerly were torn and decayed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
I have still many things to say to you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Christ&#8217;s discourse could not have so much influence over his
disciples, as to prevent their ignorance from still keeping them in perplexity
about </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>many
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>and not only so, but they
scarcely obtained a slight taste of those things which ought to have imparted to
them full satisfaction, had it not been for the obstruction arising from the
weakness of the flesh. It was, therefore, impossible but that the consciousness
of their poverty should oppress them with fear and anxiety. But Christ meets it
by this consolation, that, when they have received the Spirit, they will be new
men, and altogether different from what they were before.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But you are not able to bear them
now.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When he says that, were he to tell
them anything more, or what was loftier, they would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not be able to bear
it</i>,</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>his object is to encourage them by
the hope of better progress, that they may not lose courage; for the grace which
he was to bestow on them ought not to be estimated by their present feelings,
since they were at so great a distance from heaven. In short, he bids them be
cheerful and courageous, whatever may be their present weakness. But as there
was nothing else than doctrine on which they could rely, Christ reminds them
that he had accommodated it to their capacity, yet so as to lead them to expect
that they would soon afterwards obtain loftier and more abundant instruction; as
if he had said, &#8220;If<i> </i>what you have heard from me is not yet
sufficient to confirm you, have patience for a little; for ere long, having
enjoyed the teaching of the Spirit, you will need nothing more; he will remove
all the ignorance that now remains in you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now arises a question, what were those things which
the apostles <i>were not yet able </i>to learn? The Papists, for the purpose of
putting forward their inventions as the oracles of God, wickedly abuse this
passage. &#8220;Christ,&#8221;<i> </i>they tell us, &#8220;promised to the
apostles new revelations; and, therefore, we must not abide solely by Scripture,
for something beyond Scripture is here promised by him to his followers.&#8221;
In the first place, if they choose to talk with Augustine, the solution will be
easily obtained. His words are, &#8220;Since<i> </i>Christ is silent, which of
us shall say that it was this or that? Or, if he shall venture to say so, how
shall he prove it? Who is so rash and insolent, even though he say what is true,
as to affirm, without any Divine testimony, that those are the things which the
Lord at that time did not choose to say?&#8221;<i> </i>But we have a surer way
of refuting them, taken from Christ&#8217;s own words, which
follow.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But when he is come, the
Spirit of truth. The Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>whom Christ
promised to the apostles, is declared to be perfect Master or Teacher 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f425</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>And why was he promised, but that
they might deliver from hand to hand the wisdom which they had received from
him? </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>was given to them, and under his
guidance and direction they discharged the office to which they had been
appointed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will lead you into all
truth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That very <i>Spirit </i>had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lead them into all
truth</i>,</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>when they committed to writing
the substance of their doctrine. Whoever imagines that anything must be added to
their doctrine, as if it were imperfect and but half-finished, not only accuses
the apostles of dishonesty, but blasphemes against <i>the Spirit</i>.<i> </i>If
the doctrine which they committed to writing had proceeded from mere learners or
persons imperfectly taught, an addition to it would not have been superfluous;
but now that their writings may be regarded as perpetual records of that
revelation which was promised and given to them, nothing can be added to them
without doing grievous injury to the Holy Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When they come to determine what those things
actually were, the Papists act a highly ridiculous part, for they define those
mysteries, which the apostles were <i>unable to bear</i>,<i> </i>to be certain
childish fooleries, the most absurd and stupid things that can be imagined. Was
it necessary that the Spirit should come down from heaven that the apostles
might learn what ceremony must be used in consecrating cups with their altars,
in baptizing church-bells, in blessing the holy water, and in celebrating Mass?
Whence then do fools and children obtain their learning, who understand all
those matters most thoroughly? Nothing is more evident than that the Papists
mock God, when they pretend that those things came from heaven, which resemble
as much the mysteries of Ceres or Proserpine as they are at variance with the
pure wisdom of the Holy Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If we do not wish to be ungrateful to God, let us
rest satisfied with that doctrine of which the writings of the apostles declare
them to be the authors, since in it the highest perfection of heavenly wisdom is
made known to us, fitted <i>to make the man of God perfect
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 3:17.) Beyond this let us not reckon ourselves at liberty to go; for our
<i>height</i>,<i> </i>and <i>breadth</i>,<i> </i>and <i>depth</i>,<i>
</i>consist in <i>knowing the love of God</i>,<i> </i>which is manifested to us
in Christ. This <i>knowledge</i>,<i> </i>as Paul informs us, <i>far exceeds all
learning</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:18;) and when he declares that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Colossians
2:3,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he does not contrive some unknown Christ, but one
whom by his preaching he painted to the life, so that, as he tells the
Galatians,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">we see him, as it were,
crucified before our
eyes,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians
3:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that no ambiguity may remain, Christ himself
afterwards explains by his own words what those things are which the apostles
<i>were not yet able to bear</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will tell you things which are
to come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some indeed limit this to the
Spirit of prophecy; but, in my opinion, it denotes rather the future condition
of his spiritual kingdom, such as the apostles, soon after his resurrection, saw
it to be, but were at that time utterly unable to comprehend. He does not
therefore promise them prophecies of things that would happen after their death,
but means only that the nature of his kingdom will be widely different, and its
glory far greater than their minds are now able to conceive. The Apostle Paul,
in the Epistle to the Ephesians, from the first chapter to the close of the
fourth, explains the treasures of this <i>hidden wisdom</i>,<i> </i>which the
heavenly angels learn with astonishment from the Church; and therefore we need
not go to seek them from the archives or repositories of the
Pope.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he will not speak from
himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is a confirmation of the
clause, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will lead you into all
truth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We know that God is the fountain
of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and that out of Him there is
nothing that is firm or sure; and, therefore, that the apostles may safely place
full confidence in the oracles of the Spirit, Christ declares that they will be
divine oracles; as if he had said, that every thing which the Holy Spirit shall
bring proceeds from God himself. And yet these words take nothing away from the
majesty of the Spirit, as if he were not God, or as if he were inferior to the
Father, but are accommodated to the capacity of our understanding; for the
reason why his Divinity is expressly mentioned <i>is</i>,<i> </i>because, on
account of the veil that is between us, we do not sufficiently understand with
what reverence we ought to receive what the Spirit reveals to us. In like
manner, he is elsewhere called <i>the earnest</i>,<i> </i>by which God ratifies
to us our salvation, and <i>the seal</i>,<i> </i>by which he <i>seals </i>to us
its certainty,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:13, 14.) In short, Christ intended to teach that the doctrine of the Spirit
would not be of this world, as if it were produced in the air, but that it would
proceed from the secret places of the heavenly sanctuary.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will glorify
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ now reminds them that the
Spirit will not come to erect any new kingdom, but rather to confirm the
<i>glory </i>which has been given to him by the Father. For many foolishly
imagine that Christ taught only so as to lay down the first lessons, and then to
send the disciples to a higher school. In this way they make the Gospel to be of
no greater value than <i>the Law</i>,<i> </i>of which it is said that it was
<i>a</i> <i>schoolmaster </i>of the ancient people,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:24.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This error is followed by another equally
intolerable, that, having bid adieu to Christ, as if his reign were terminated,
and he were now nothing at all, they substitute the Spirit in his place. From
this source the sacrileges of Popery and Mahometanism have flowed; for, though
those two Antichrists differ from each other in many respects, still they agree
in holding a common principle; and that is, that in the Gospel we receive the
earliest instructions to lead us into the right faith, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f426</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but that we must seek elsewhere the perfection of doctrine, that it may complete
the course of our education. If Scripture is quoted against the Pope, he
maintains that we ought not to confine ourselves to it, because the Spirit is
come, and has carried us above Scripture by many additions. Mahomet asserts
that, without his Alcoran, men always re-main children. Thus, by a false
pretense of the Spirit, the world was bewitched to depart from the simple purity
of Christ; for, as soon as the Spirit is separated from the word of Christ, the
door is open to all kinds of delusions and impostures. A similar method of
deceiving has been attempted, in the present age, by many fanatics. The written
doctrine appeared to them to be literal, and, therefore, they chose to contrive
a new theology that would consist of revelations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that the information given by Christ, that
he would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glorified</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>by the Spirit whom he should send, is far from being superfluous; for it was
intended to inform us, that the office of the Holy Spirit was nothing else than
to establish the kingdom of Christ, and to maintain and confirm for ever all
that was given him by the Father. Why then does he speak of the Spirit&#8217;s
teaching? Not to withdraw us from the school of Christ, but rather to ratify
that word by which we are commanded to listen to him, otherwise he would
diminish the glory of Christ. The reason is added, Christ says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he will take of what is
mine.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words he means that we
receive the Spirit in order that we may enjoy Christ&#8217;s blessings. For what
does he bestow on us? That we may be washed by the blood of Christ, that sin may
be blotted out in us by his death, that <i>our old man may be crucified</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:6,) that his resurrection may be efficacious in forming us again to <i>newness
of life</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:4;) and, in short, that we may become partakers of his benefits. Nothing,
therefore, is bestowed on us by the Spirit apart from Christ, but he takes it
from Christ, that he may communicate it to us. We ought to take the same view of
his doctrine; for he does not enlighten us, in order to draw us away in the
smallest degree from Christ, but to fulfill what Paul says, that <i>Christ is
made to us wisdom</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460130&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:30,) and likewise to display <i>those treasures which are hidden
in Christ</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:3.) In a word, the Spirit enriches us with no other than the riches of Christ,
that he may display his glory in all things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All things that the Father
hath are mine.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As it might be thought
that Christ took away from the Father what he claimed for himself, he
acknowledges that he has received from the Father all that he communicates to us
by the Spirit. When he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all things that the Father hath
are his</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he speaks in the person of the
Mediator, for we must draw <i>out of his fullness</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:16.) He always keeps his eye on us, as we have said. We see, on the other
hand, how the greater part of men deceive themselves; for they pass by Christ,
and go out of the way to seek God by circuitous paths.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Other commentators explain these words to mean, that
<i>all that the Father hath </i>belongs equally to the Son, because he is the
same God. But here he does not speak of his hidden and intrinsic power, as it is
called, but of that office which he has been appointed to exercise toward us. In
short, he speaks of his riches, that he may invite us to enjoy them, and reckons
the Spirit among the gifts which we receive from the rather by his
hand.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A little while, and you
do not see me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ had often
forewarned the apostles of his departure, partly that they might bear it with
greater courage, partly that they might desire more ardently the grace of the
Spirit, of which they had no great desire, so long as they had Christ present
with them in body. We must, therefore, guard against becoming weary of reading
what Christ, not without cause, repeats so frequently. First, he says that he
will very soon be taken from them, that, when they are deprived of his presence,
on which alone they relied, they may continue to be firm. Next, he promises what
will, compensate them for his absence, and he even testifies that he will
quickly be restored to them, after he has been removed, but in another manner,
that is, by the presence of the Holy Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And again a little while, and you
will see me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Yet some explain this
second clause differently: You will see, me when I shall have risen from the
dead, but only for a short time; for I shall very soon be received into
heaven.&#8221; But I do not think that the words will bear that meaning. On the
contrary, he mitigates and soothes their sorrow for his absence, by this
consolation, that it will not last long; and thus he magnifies the grace of the
Spirit, by which he will be continually present with them; as if he had promised
that, after a short interval, he would return, and that they would not be long
deprived of his presence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor ought we to think it strange when he says that he
is <i>seen</i>,<i> </i>when he dwells in the disciples by the Spirit; for,
though he is not <i>seen </i>with the bodily eyes, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f428</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet his presence is known by the undoubted experience of faith. What we are
taught by Paul is indeed true, that believers,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">so long as they remain on
earth, are absent from the Lord, because they walk, by faith, and not by sight,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 5:6, 7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is equally true that they may justly, in the
meantime, glory in having Christ dwelling in them by faith, in being united to
him as members to the Head, in possessing heaven along with him by hope. Thus
the grace of the Spirit is a mirror, in which Christ wishes to be seen by us,
according to the words of Paul,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Though we have known Christ according to
the flesh, yet we know him no more; if any man be in Christ, let him be a new
creature,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I go to the
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some explain these words as
meaning that Christ will no longer be seen by the disciples, because he will be
in heaven, and they on earth. For my part, I would rather refer it to the second
clause, <i>You will soon see me</i>;<i> </i>for my death is not a destruction to
separate me from you, but a passage into the heavenly glory, from which my
divine power will diffuse itself even to you.&#8221; He intended, therefore, in
my opinion, to teach what would be his condition after his death, that they
might rest satisfied with his spiritual presence, and might not think that it
would be any loss to them that he no longer dwelt with them as a mortal
man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus, therefore, knew that

the Lord appears to speak to the deaf, he, at length, cures the ignorance of his
disciples, that his instruction may not be useless. Our duty is to endeavor that
our slowness of apprehension may not be accompanied by either pride or
indolence, but that, on the contrary, we show ourselves to be humble and
desirous to learn.</font><br></div>

foretold that his departure was at hand, and, at the same time, added a promise
about his speedy return. It was, that they might understand better that the aid
of the Spirit was highly necessary. &#8220;A<i> </i>hard and severe
temptation,&#8221; says he, &#8220;<i>awaits </i>you; for, when I shall be
removed from you by death, the world will proclaim its triumphs over you. You
will feel the deepest anguish. The world will pronounce itself to be happy, and
you to be miserable. I have resolved, therefore, to furnish you with the
necessary arms for this warfare.&#8221; He describes the interval that elapsed
between his death and the day when the Holy Spirit was sent; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f429</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for at that time their faith, so to speak, lay prostrate and
exhausted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your sorrow will be turned into

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

afterwards free from all
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sorrow,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>but that all the sorrow which they would endure was, swallowed up by
<i>spiritual joy</i>.<i> </i>We know that the apostles: so long as they lived,
sustained a severe warfare, that they endured base reproaches, that they had
many reasons for <i>weeping and lamenting</i>;<i> </i>but, renewed by the
Spirit, they had laid aside their former consciousness of weakness, so that,
with lofty heroism, they nobly trampled under foot all the evils that they
endured. Here then is a comparison between their present weakness and the power
of the Spirit, which would soon be given to them; for, though they were nearly
overwhelmed for a time, yet afterwards they not only fought bravely, but
obtained a glorious triumph in the midst of their struggles. Yet it ought also
to be observed, that he points out not only the interval that elapsed between
the resurrection of Christ and the death of the apostles, but also the period
which followed afterwards; as if Christ had said, &#8220;You will lie prostrate,
as it were, for a short time; but when the Holy Spirit shall have raised you up
again, then will begin a new<i> joy</i>,<i> </i>which will continue to increase,
until, having been received into the heavenly glory, you shall have <i>perfect

the ground and occasion of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

adversity has been followed by prosperity, men forget their former grief, and
give themselves up unreservedly
to</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

</i>But Christ means that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sorrow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>which they shall endure for the sake of the Gospel will be profitable.
Indeed, the result of all griefs cannot be otherwise than unfavorable, unless
when they are blessed in Christ. But as the cross of Christ always contains in
itself the victory, Christ justly compares the grief arising from it to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the sorrow of a woman in
labor</i>,</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which receives its reward when
the mother is cheered by the birth of the child. The comparison would not apply,
if <i>sorrow </i>did not produce<i> joy </i>in the members of Christ, when they
become partakers of his sufferings, just as the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>labor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in the, woman is the cause of the birth. The comparison must also be applied
in this respect, that though the

</i>of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

<div><font face="Palatino">We ought now to appropriate the use of this doctrine
to ourselves. Having been regenerated by the Spirit of Christ, we ought to feel

ought, I say, to resemble <i>women in labor</i>,<i> </i>on whom the mere sight
of <i>the child born </i>produces such an impression, that their pain gives them
pain no longer. But as we have received nothing more than the first-fruits, and
these in very small measure, we scarcely taste a few drops of that spiritual
gladness, to soothe our grief and alleviate its bitterness. And yet that small
portion clearly shows that they who contemplate Christ by faith are so far from
being at any time overwhelmed by grief, that, amidst their heaviest sufferings,

been delivered from the incessant afflictions of the present life, we obtain a
full view of the fruit of our faith. To sum up the whole in a few words,
believers are like <i>women in labor</i>,<i> </i>because, having been born again
in Christ, they have not yet entered into the heavenly kingdom of God and a
blessed life; and they are like pregnant women who are in childbirth, because,
being still held captive in the prison of the flesh, they long for that blessed
state which lies hidden under hope.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.<i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is greatly enhanced by its
perpetuity; for it follows that the afflictions are light, and ought to be
patiently endured, because they are of short duration. By these words Christ
reminds us what is the nature of true
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>joy</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>The world must unavoidably be soon deprived of its <i>joys</i>,<i> </i>which
it seeks only in fading things; and, therefore, we must come to the resurrection
of Christ, in which there is eternal solidity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I will see you
again.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When he says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>will
see</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>his disciples, he means that he will
visit them again by the grace of his Spirit, that they may continually enjoy his
presence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And in that day you will ask
me nothing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After having promised to the
disciples that they would derive<i> joy </i>from their unshaken firmness and
courage, he now speaks of another grace of the Spirit which would be given to
them, that they would receive so great light of understanding as would raise
them on high to heavenly mysteries. They were at that time so slow that the
slightest difficulty of any kind made them hesitate; for as children who are
learning the alphabet cannot read a single verse without pausing frequently, so
almost every word of Christ gave them some sort of offense, and this hindered
their progress. But soon afterwards, having been enlightened by the Holy Spirit,
they no longer had any thing to prevent them from becoming familiarly acquainted
with the wisdom of God, so as to move amidst the mysteries of God without
stumbling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">True, the apostles did not cease to <i>ask </i>at the
mouth of Christ, even when they had been elevated to the highest degree of
wisdom, but this is only a comparison between the two conditions; as if Christ
had said that their ignorance would be corrected, so that, instead of being
stopped &#8212; as they now were &#8212; by the smallest obstructions, they
would penetrate into the deepest mysteries without any difficulty. Such is the
import of that passage in Jeremiah,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">No longer shall every man teach his
neighbor, saying, Know the Lord for all shall know me, from the least to the
greatest, saith the Lord,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;243134&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
31:34.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The prophet assuredly does not take away or set aside
instruction, which must be in its most vigorous state in the kingdom of Christ;
but he affirms that, when all shall be taught by God, no room will be any longer
left for this gross ignorance, which holds the minds of men, till Christ, <i>the
Sun of Righteousness</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;390402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
4:2,) shall enlighten them by the rays of his Spirit. Besides, though the
apostles were exceedingly like children, or rather, were more like stocks of
wood than men, we know well what they suddenly became, after having enjoyed the
teaching of the Holy Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whatever you shall ask the Father
in my name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> He </i>shows whence they will
obtain this new faculty. It is because they will have it in their power to draw
freely from God, the fountain of wisdom, as much as they need; as if he had
said, &#8220;You must not fear that you will be deprived of the gift of
understanding; for <i>my</i> <i>Father </i>will be ready, with all the abundance
of blessings, to enrich you bountifully.&#8221; Besides, by these words he
informs them that the Spirit is not promised in such a manner that they to whom
He is promised may wait for him in sloth and inactivity, but, on the contrary,
that they may be earnestly employed in seeking the grace which is offered. In
short, he declares that he will at that time discharge the office of Mediator,
so that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whatever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they shall
ask</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he will obtain for them from the
Father abundantly, and beyond their prayers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here arises a difficult question: Was this the
first time that men began to call on God <i>in the name </i>of Christ? for never
could God be reconciled to men in any other way than for the sake of the
Mediator. Christ describes the future time, when the Heavenly Father will give
to the disciples </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whatever they
shall ask in his name</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>If this be a new
and unwonted favor, it would seem that we may infer from it that, so long as
Christ dwelt on earth, he did not yet exercise the office of Advocate, that
through him the prayers of believers might be acceptable to God. This is still
more clearly expressed by what immediately follows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hitherto you have asked
nothing in my name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is probable that
the apostles kept the rule of prayer which had been laid down in the Law. Now we
know that the fathers were not accustomed to pray without a Mediator; for God
had trained them, by so many exercises, to such a form of prayer. They saw the
high priest enter into the holy place in the name of the whole people, and they
saw sacrifices offered every day, that the prayers of the Church might be
acceptable before God. It was, therefore, one of the principles of faith, that
prayers offered to God, when there was no Mediator, were rash and useless.
Christ had already testified to his disciples plainly enough that he was the
Mediator, but their knowledge was so obscure, that they were not yet able to
form their prayers <i>in his name </i>in a proper manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor is there any absurdity in saying that they<i>
</i>prayed to God, with confidence in the Mediator, according to the injunction
of the Law, and yet did not clearly and fully understand what that meant. The
veil of the temple was still stretched out, the majesty of God was concealed
under the shadow of the cherubim, the true High Priest had not yet entered into
the heavenly sanctuary to intercede for his people, and held not yet consecrated
the way by his blood. We need not wonder, therefore, if he was not acknowledged
to be the Mediator as he is, now that he appears for us in heaven before the
Father, reconciling Him to us by his sacrifice, that we, miserable men, may
venture to appear before him with boldness; for truly Christ, after having
completed the satisfaction for sin, was received into heaven, and publicly
showed himself to be the Mediator.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we ought to attend to the frequent repetition of
this clause, that we must pray <i>in the name of </i>Christ. This teaches us
that it is a wicked profanation of the name of God, when any one, leaving Christ
out of view, ventures to present himself before the judgment-seat of God. And if
this conviction be deeply impressed on our minds, that God will willingly and
abundantly give to us </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whatever we
shall ask in the name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of his Son, we
will not go hither and thither to call to our aid various advocates, but will be
satisfied with having this single Advocate, who so frequently and so kindly
offers to us his labors in our behalf. We are said <i>to pray in the name of
</i>Christ when we take him as our Advocate, to reconcile us, and make us find
favor with his Father, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f430</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
though we do not expressly mention his name with our lips.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ask, and
receive.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This relates to the time of his
manifestation, which was to take place soon afterwards. So much the less
excusable are those who, in the present day, obscure this part of doctrine by
the pretended intercessions of the Saints. The people, under the Old Testament, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f431</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
had to turn their eyes to the high priest, (who was given to them to be a figure
and shadow 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f432</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)
and to the sacrifices of beasts, whenever they wished to pray. We are,
therefore, worse than ungrateful, if we do not. keep our senses fixed on the
true High Priest, who is exhibited to us as our Propitiator, that by him we may
have free and ready access to the throne of the glory of God. He adds,
lastly,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That your joy may be
full.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this he means that nothing will
be wanting which could contribute to a perfect abundance of all blessings, to
the accomplishment of our desires, and to calm satisfaction, provided that we
ask from God, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in his
name</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>whatever we need.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These things I have
spoken to you in proverbs.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The intention
of Christ is to give courage to his disciples, that, entertaining good hopes of
making better progress, they may not think that the instruction to which they
now listen is useless, though there be but little of it that they comprehend;
for such a suspicion might lead them to suppose that Christ did not wish to be
understood, and that he purposely kept them in suspense. He declares, therefore,
that they will soon perceive the fruit of this doctrine, which, by its
obscurity, might produce disgust in their minds. The Hebrew
word,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Red">
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">l&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino"><b>
</b>(<i>mashal</i>)<i> </i>sometimes denotes a <i>proverb</i>;<i> </i>but as
<i>proverbs </i>most commonly contain tropes and figures, this is the reason why
the Hebrews give the name of
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yl&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino"><b>
</b>(<i>meshalim</i>)<i> </i>to enigmas or remarkable sayings, which the Greeks
call
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpofqe&gt;gmata</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>apophthegms</i>,<i> </i>which have almost always some ambiguity or obscurity.
The meaning therefore is, &#8220;You<i> </i>think that I now speak to you
figuratively, and not in plain and direct language; but I will soon speak to you
in a more familiar manner, in order that there may be nothing puzzling or
difficult to you in my doctrine.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see what I mentioned a little ago, that this
is intended to encourage the disciples by holding out to them the expectation of
making greater progress, that they may not reject the doctrine, because they do
not yet understand what it means; for, if we are not animated by the hope of
profiting, the desire of learning must, unavoidably, be cooled. The fact,
however, clearly shows that Christ did not employ terms purposely obscure, but
addressed his disciples in a simple and even homely style but such was their
ignorance that they hung on his lips with astonishment. That obscurity,
therefore, did not lie so much in the doctrine as in their understandings; and,
indeed, the same thing happens to us in the present day, for not without good
reason does the word of God receive this commendation, that it is our
<i>light</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B9A5&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
119:105;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;610119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 1:19;) but its brightness is so obscured by our darkness, that, what we
hear we reckon to be pure allegories. For, as he threatens by the prophet, that
he will be a barbarian to the unbelievers and reprobate, as if he had <i>a
stammering tongue</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:11;) and Paul says that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the Gospel is hidden from
such persons, because Satan hath blinded their understandings,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 4:3, 4;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">so to the weak and ignorant it commonly appears to be
something so confused that it cannot be understood. For, though their
understandings are not completely darkened, like those of unbelievers, still
they are covered, as it were, with clouds. Thus God permits us to be stupefied
for a time, in order to humble us by a conviction of our own poverty; but those
whom he enlightens by his Spirit he causes to make such progress, that the word
of God is known and familiar to them. Such, too, is the import of the next
clause:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the time
cometh</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>that is, <i>the time </i>will
soon <i>come</i>,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> when I shall no
more speak to you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in figurative
language. The Holy Spirit, certainly, did not teach the apostles anything else
than what they had heard from the mouth of Christ himself, but, by enlightening
their hearts, he drove away their darkness, so that they heard Christ speak, as
it were, in a new and different manner, and thus they easily understood his
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But will tell you plainly about the
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When he says that he <i>will
tell them about the Father</i>,<i> </i>he reminds us that the design of his
doctrine is to lead us to God, in whom true happiness lies. But another question
remains: How does he <i>say</i>,<i> </i>elsewhere, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">it was given to the
disciples to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
13:11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For here he acknowledges that he has spoken to them
in obscure language, but there he lays down a distinction between them and the
rest of the people, that <i>he speaketh to the people in parables</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:13.) I reply, the ignorance of the apostles was not so gross that they had
not, at least, a slight perception of what their Master meant, and, therefore,
it is not without reason that he excludes them from the number of the blind. He
now says that his discourses have hitherto been allegorical, in comparison of
that clear light of understanding which he would soon give to them by the grace
of his Spirit. Both statements are therefore true, that the disciples were far
above those who had no relish for the word of the Gospel, and yet they were
still like children learning the alphabet, in comparison of the new wisdom which
was bestowed on them by the Holy Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that day you shall ask in
my name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He again repeats the reason why
the heavenly treasures were then to be so bountifully opened up. It is, because
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they ask in the name of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>whatever they need, and God will
refuse nothing that shall be asked <i>in the name </i>of his Son. But there
appears to be a contradiction in the words; for Christ immediately adds, that it
will be unnecessary for him <i>to pray to the Father</i>.<i> </i>Now, what
purpose does it serve to pray <i>in his name</i>,<i> </i>if he does not
undertake the office of Intercessor? In another passage John calls him <i>our
Advocate</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
1 John 2:1.) Paul also testifies that Christ now <i>intercedes </i>for
<i>us</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450834&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:34;) and the same thing is confirmed by the author of the Epistle to the
Hebrews, who declares that Christ <i>always liveth to make intercession for
us</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580725&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
7:25.) I reply, Christ does not absolutely say, in this passage, that he will
not be Intercessor, but he only means, that <i>the Father </i>will be so
favorably disposed towards the disciples, that, without any difficulty, he will
give freely whatever they shall ask. &#8220;<i>My Father</i>,&#8221;<i> </i>he
says, &#8220;will meet you, and, on account of the great love which he bears
towards you, will anticipate the Intercessor, who, otherwise, would speak on
your behalf.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, when Christ is said to intercede with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for <i>us</i>,<i> </i>let us not
indulge in carnal imaginations about him, as if he were on his knees before
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>offering humble supplication in
our name. But the value of his sacrifice, by which he once pacified God toward
us, is always powerful and efficacious; the blood by which he atoned for our
sins, the obedience which he rendered, is a continual intercession for us. This
is a remarkable passage, by which we are taught that we have the heart of the
Heavenly Father, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f433</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as soon as we have placed before Him <i>the name </i>of his
Son.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because you have loved
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These words remind us that the only
bond of our union with God is, to be united to Christ; and we are united to him
by a faith which is not reigned, but which springs from sincere affection, which
he describes by the name of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i>
</i>for no man believes purely in Christ who does not cordially embrace him,
and, therefore, by this word he has well expressed the power and nature of
faith. But if it is only when we have loved Christ that God begins to love us,
it follows that the commencement of salvation is from ourselves, because we have
anticipated the grace of God. Numerous passages of Scripture, on the other hand,
are opposed to this statement. The promise of God is, <i>I will cause them to
love me</i>;<i> </i>and John says, <i>Not that we first loved Him</i>, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f434</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 4:10.) It would be superfluous to collect many passages; for nothing is
more certain than this doctrine, that the Lord <i>calleth those things which are
not</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

65:1;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451020&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:20.) I reply, God loves men in a secret way, before they are called, if they
are among the elect; for he loves his own before they are created; but, as they
are not yet reconciled, they are justly accounted <i>enemies </i>of God, as Paul
speaks,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">On this ground it is said that we are <i>loved by

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I came out from the

our attention to the Divine power which is in Christ. Our faith in him would not
be steady, if it did not perceive his Divine power; for his death and
resurrection, the two pillars of faith, would be of little avail to us, if
heavenly power were not connected with them. We now understand in what manner we
ought to <i>love </i>Christ. Our <i>love </i>ought to be of such a nature that
our faith shall contemplate the purpose and power of God, by whose hand he is
offered to us. for we must not receive coldly the statement that <i>he came out
from God</i>,<i> </i>but must also understand for what reason and for what
purpose <i>he came out</i>,<i> </i>namely, that he might be</font><br></div>

points out to us that this power is perpetual- for the disciples might have
thought that it was a temporary blessing, that he was sent into the world to be
a Redeemer. He therefore said that <i>he returns to the Father</i>,<i> </i>that
they may be fully persuaded that none of those blessings which he brought are
lost by his departure, because from his heavenly glory he sheds on the world the
power and efficacy of his death and resurrection. He therefore <i>left the world
</i>when, laying aside our weaknesses, he was received into heaven; but his
grace toward us is still in all its force, because he is seated at the right
hand of the Father, that he may sway the scepter of the whole world.

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His disciples say to
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This shows how great was the
efficacy of, that consolation, for it suddenly brought into a state of great
cheerfulness those minds which formerly were broken and cast down. And yet it is
certain that <i>the disciples </i>did not yet understand fully the meaning of
Christ&#8217;s discourse; but though they were not yet capable of this, the mere
odor of it refreshed them. When they exclaim that their Master
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speaketh
openly</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and without a figure, their
language is certainly extravagant, and yet they state honestly what they feel.
The same thing falls within our own experience in the present day; for he who
has only tasted a little of the doctrine of the Gospel is more inflamed, and
feels much greater energy in that small measure of faith, than if he had been
acquainted with all the writings of Plato. Not only so, but the <i>roads
</i>which the Spirit of God produces in the hearts of the godly are sufficient
proofs that God worketh in a secret manner beyond their capacity; for otherwise
Paul would not call them <i>groans that cannot be uttered</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450826&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:26.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus we ought to understand that the apostles were
conscious of having made some progress, so that they could say with truth, that
they did not now find the words of Christ to be altogether obscure; but that
they were deceived in this respect, that they thought they understood more than
they did. Now the source of their mistake was, that they did not know what the
gift of the Holy Spirit would be. They therefore give themselves up to joy
before the time, just as if a person should think himself rich with a single
gold piece. They conclude, from certain signs, that Christ
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came out from
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and they glory in it, as if nothing
more were needed. Yet still they were far from that knowledge, so long as they
did not understand what Christ would be to them in future.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do you now
believe?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the disciples were too
highly pleased with themselves, Christ reminds them that, remembering their
weakness, they ought rather to confine themselves within their own little
capacity. Now, we never are fully aware of what we want, and of our great
distance from the fullness of faith, till we come to some serious trial; for
then the fact shows how weak our faith was, which we imagined to be full. Christ
recalls the attention of the disciples to this matter, and declares that they
will ere long forsake him; for persecution is a touchstone to try faith, and
when its smallness becomes evident, they who formerly were swelled with pride
begin to tremble and to draw back.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The question put by Christ is therefore ironical; as
if he had said, &#8220;Do you boast as if you were full of faith? But the trial
is at hand, which will disclose your emptiness.&#8221; In this manner we ought
to restrain our foolish confidence, when it indulges itself too freely. But it
might be thought, either that the disciples had no faith at all, or that it was
extinguished, when they had forsaken Christ, and were scattered in all
directions. I reply, though their faith was weakened, and had almost given way,
still something was left, from which fresh branches might afterwards shoot
forth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet I am not
alone.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This correction is added, in
order to inform us that, when Christ is forsaken by men, he loses nothing of his
dignity. For since his truth and his glory are founded on himself, and. do not
depend on what the world believes, if it happen that he is forsaken by the whole
world, still he is in no degree impaired, because he is God, and needs not any
assistance from another.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because my Father is with
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the </i>FATHER <i>will be with
me</i>,</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the meaning is, that God will be on
his side, so that he will have no need to borrow anything from men. Whoever
shall meditate on this in a proper manner will remain firm, though the whole
world should be shaken, and the revolt of all men will not overturn his faith;
for we do not render to God the honor which is due to him, if we are not
satisfied with having God alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>33.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These things I have spoken to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He again repeats how necessary
those consolations are which he had addressed to them; and he proves it by this
argument, that numerous distresses and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tribulations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>await them in </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
world.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We ought to attend, first, to
this admonition, that all believers ought to be convinced that their life is
exposed to many afflictions, that they may be disposed to exercise patience.
Since, therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is like a troubled sea,
true</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>will be found nowhere but in
Christ. Next, we ought to attend to the manner of enjoying that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>which he describes in this passage. He says that they will have
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>if they make progress in this doctrine. Do we wish then to have our minds
calm and easy in the midst of afflictions? Let us be attentive to this discourse
of Christ, which in itself will give us
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But be of good
courage.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As our sluggishness must be
corrected by various afflictions, and as we must be awakened to seek a remedy
for our distress, so the Lord does not intend that our minds shall be cast down,
but rather that we shall fight keenly, which is impossible, if we are not
certain of success; for if we must fight, while we are uncertain as to the
result, all our zeal will quickly vanish. When, therefore, Christ calls us to
the contest, he arms us with assured confidence of victory, though still we must
toil hard.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have overcome the
world.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As there is always in us much
reason for trembling, he shows that we ought to be confident for this reason,
that he has obtained a <i>victory </i>over
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>not for himself individually, but
for our sake. Thus, though in ourselves almost overwhelmed, if we contemplate
that magnificent glory to which our Head has been exalted, we may boldly despise
all the evils which hang over us. If, therefore, we desire to be Christians, we
must not seek exemption from the cross, but must be satisfied with this single
consideration, that, fighting under the banner of Christ, we are beyond all
danger, even in the midst of the combat. Under the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>World,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

especially all the corruptions which Satan abuses for the purpose of laying
snares for us.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These words spake
Jesus.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After having preached to the
disciples about bearing the cross, the Lord exhibited to them those
consolations, by relying on which they would be enabled to persevere. Having
promised the coming of the Spirit, he raised them to a better hope, and
discoursed to them about the splendor and glory of his reign. Now he most
properly betakes himself to prayer; for doctrine has no power, if efficacy be
not imparted to it from above. He, therefore, holds out an example to teachers,
not to employ themselves only in sowing the word, but, by mingling their prayers
with it, to implore the assistance of God, that his blessing may render their
labor fruitful. In short, this passage of the Lord Jesus 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f436</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Christ might be said to be the seal of the preceding doctrine, both that it
might be ratified in itself, and that it might obtain full credit with the
disciples.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And lifted up his eyes to
heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This circumstance related by
John, that Christ prayed, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lifting
up his eyes to heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>was an indication
of uncommon ardor and vehemence; for by this attitude Christ testified that, in
the affections of his mind, he was rather in heaven than in earth, so that,
leaving men behind him, he converted familiarly with God. He looked towards
<i>heaven</i>,<i> </i>not as if God&#8217;s presence were confined to
<i>heaven</i>,<i> </i>for He <i>filleth also the earth</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;242324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:24,) but because it is there chiefly that his majesty is displayed. Another
reason was, that, by looking towards <i>heaven</i>,<i> </i>we are reminded that
the majesty of God is far exalted above all creatures. It is with the same view
that the hands are lifted up in prayer; for men, being by nature indolent and
slow, and drawn downwards by their earthly disposition, need such excitements,
or I should rather say, chariots, to raise them to
<i>heaven</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet if we desire actually to imitate Christ, we must
take care that outward gestures do not express more than is in our mind, but
that the inward feeling shall direct the eyes, the hands, the tongue, and every
thing about us. We are told, indeed, that <i>the publican</i>,<i> </i>with
downcast eyes, prayed aright to God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
18:13,) but that is not inconsistent with what has now been stated; for, though
he was confused and humbled on account of his sins, still this self-abasement
did not prevent him from seeking pardon with full confidence. But. it was proper
that Christ should pray in a different manner, for he had nothing about him of
which he ought to be ashamed; and it is certain that David himself prayed
sometimes in one attitude, and sometimes in another, according to the
circumstances in which he was placed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father, the hour is
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ asks that his kingdom may
be glorified, in order that he also may advance the glory of the Father. He says
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the hour is
come,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because though, by miracles and by
every kind of supernatural events, he had been manifested to be the Son of God,
yet his spiritual kingdom was still in obscurity, but soon afterwards shone with
full brightness. If it be objected, that never was there any thing less glorious
than the death of Christ, which was then at hand, I reply, that in that death we
behold a magnificent triumph which is concealed from wicked men; for there we
perceive that, atonement having been made for sins, the world has been
reconciled to God, the curse has been blotted out, and Satan has been
vanquished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is also the object of Christ&#8217;s prayer, that
his death may produce, through the power of the Heavenly Spirit, such fruit as
had been decreed by the eternal purpose of God; for he says
that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the hour is
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>not an hour which is determined by
the fancy of men, but an hour which God had appointed. And yet the prayer is not
superfluous, because, while Christ depends on the good pleasure of God, he knows
that he ought to desire what God promised would certainly take place. True, God
will do whatever he has decreed, not only though the whole world were asleep,
but though it were opposed to him; but it is our duty to ask from him whatever
he has promised, because the end and use 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f437</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of promises is to excite us to prayer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That thy Son also may glorify
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He means that there is a mutual
connection between the advancement of his glory and of the glory of his Father;
for why is Christ manifested, but that he may lead us to the Father? Hence it
follows, that all the honor which is bestowed on Christ is so far from
diminishing the honor of the Father, that it confirms it the more. We ought
always to remember under what character Christ speaks in this passage; for we
must not look only at his eternal Divinity, because he speaks as God manifested
in the flesh, and according to the office<i> </i>of Mediator.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
As thou hast given him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He<i> </i>again
confirms the statement, that he asks nothing but what is agreeable to the will
of the Father; as it is a constant rule o prayer not to ask more than God would
freely bestow; for nothing is more contrary to reason, than to bring forward in
the <i>presence </i>of God whatever we choose.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Power over all
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>means the authority which was
given to Christ, when the Father appointed him to be King and Head; but we must
observe the end, which is, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
give eternal life</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to all his people. Christ
receives authority, not so much for himself as for the sake of our salvation;
and, therefore, we ought to submit to Christ, not only that we may obey God, but
because nothing is more lovely than that subjection, since it brings to us
eternal life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To all whom thou hast given
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ does not say that he has been
made Governor over the whole world, in order to bestow <i>life </i>on all
without any distinction; but he limits this grace to those who <i>have been
given to him</i>.<i> </i>But how were they <i>given to him</i>?<i> </i>For the
Father has subjected to him the reprobate. I reply, it is only the elect who
belong to his peculiar flock, which he has undertaken to guard as a Shepherd. So
then, the kingdom of Christ extends, no doubt, to all men; but it brings
salvation to none but the elect, who with voluntary obedience follow the voice
of the Shepherd; for the others are compelled by violence to obey him, till at
length he utterly bruise them with his iron scepter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this is eternal
life</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He now describes the manner of
bestowing
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>namely, when he enlightens the elect in the true knowledge of God; for he
does not now speak of the enjoyment
of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which we hope for, but only of the
manner in which men obtain life And that this verse may be fully understood, we
ought first to know that we are all in death, till we are enlightened by God,
who alone is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>Where he has shone, we possess him by faith, and, therefore, we also enter
into the possession of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and this is the reason why the <i>knowledge </i>of him is truly and justly
called saving, or bringing salvation. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f438</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Almost every one of the words has its weight; for it is not every kind of
knowledge that is here described, but that knowledge which forms us anew into
the image of God from faith to faith, or rather, which is the same with faith,
by which, having been engrafted into the body of Christ, we are made partakers
of the Divine adoption, and heirs of heaven. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f439</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To know thee, and Jesus Christ whom
thou hast sent.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The reason why he says
this is, that there is no other way in which God is <i>known </i>but in the face
of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus
Christ,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>who is the bright and lively
image of Him. As to his placing the Father first, this does not refer to the
order of faith, as if our minds, after having known God, afterwards descend to
Christ; but the meaning is, that it is by the intervention of a Mediator that
God is known.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The only true
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Two epithets are added, <i>true
</i>and only; because, in the first place, faith must distinguish God from the
vain inventions of men, and embracing him with firm conviction, must never
change or hesitate; and, secondly, believing that there is nothing defective or
imperfect in God, faith must be satisfied with him alone. Some explain it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may know thee</i>,<i>
who alone art God</i>;</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but this is a poor
interpretation. The meaning therefore is,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may know thee alone to
be the true God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be thought that Christ disclaims for
himself the right and title of Divinity. Were it replied, that the name of God
is quite as applicable to Christ as to the Father, the same question might be
raised about the Holy Spirit; for if only the Father and the Son are God, the
Holy Spirit is excluded from that rank, which is as absurd as the former. The
answer is easy, if we attend to that manner of speaking which Christ uniformly
employs throughout the Gospel of John, of which I have already reminded my
readers so frequently, that they must have become quite accustomed to it.
Christ, appearing in the form of a man, describes, under the person of the
Father, the power, essence, and majesty of God. So then the Father of Christ is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
only</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>true
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i>
</i>that is, he is <i>the one God</i>,<i> </i>who formerly promised a Redeemer
to the world; but in Christ the <i>oneness </i>and <i>truth </i>of Godhead will
be found, because Christ was humbled, in order that he might raise us on high.
When we have arrived at this point, then his Divine majesty displays itself;
then we perceive that he is wholly in the Father, and that the Father is wholly
in him. In short, he who separates Christ from the Divinity of the Father, does
not yet acknowledge Him who is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the only true
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but rather invents for himself a
strange god. This is the reason why we are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">enjoined <i>to know God</i>,<i> and
Jesus Christ whom he hath sent</i>,</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by whom,
as it were, with outstretched hand, he invites us to himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the opinion entertained by some, that it would
be unjust, if men were to perish solely on account of their ignorance of God, it
arises from their not considering that there is no fountain of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>but in God alone, and that all who are alienated from him are deprived of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>Now, if there be no approach to God but by faith, we are forced to conclude,
that unbelief keeps us in a state of death. If it be objected, that persons
otherwise righteous and innocent are unjustly treated, if they are condemned,
the answer is obvious, that nothing right or sincere is found in men, so long as
they remain in their natural state. Now, Paul informs us that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">we are renewed in the
image of God by the knowledge of him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Colossians
3:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It will be of importance for us now to bring into one
view those three articles of faith; first, that the kingdom of Christ brings
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and salvation; secondly, that all do not receive <i>life </i>from him, and
it is not the office of Christ to <i>give life </i>to all, but only to the elect
whom the Father has committed to his protection; and, thirdly, that this life
consists in faith, and Christ bestow, it on those whom he enlightens in the
faith of the Gospel. Hence we infer that the gift of illumination and heavenly
wisdom is not common to all, but peculiar to the elect. It is unquestionably
true that the Gospel is offered to all, but Christ speaks here of that secret
and efficacious manner of teaching by which the children of God only are drawn
to faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have glorified
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>His reason for saying this is,
that God had been made known to the world both by the doctrine of Christ, and by
his miracles; and the <i>glory </i>of God is, when we know what he is. When he
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have finished the work
which thou gavest me to do</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he means
that he has completed the whole course of his calling; for the full time was
come when he ought to be received into the heavenly <i>glory</i>.<i> </i>Nor
does he speak only of the office of teaching, but includes also the other parts
of his ministry; for, though the chief part of it still remained to be
accomplished, namely, the sacrifice of death, by which he was to take away the
iniquities of us all, yet, as the hour of his death was already at hand, he
speaks as if he had already endured it. The amount of his request, therefore,
<i>is </i>that the Father would put him in possession of the kingdom; since,
having completed his course, nothing more remained for him to do, than to
display, by the power of the Spirit, the fruit and efficacy of all that he had
done on earth by the command of his Father, according to the saying of
Paul,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">He humbled and annihilated
himself,</font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f440</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
by taking the form of a servant. Therefore God hath highly exalted him, and
given him a name which is above every name,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Philippians
2:7, 10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The glory which I had
with thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He<i> </i>desires to be <i>glorified
</i>WITH THE FATHER, not that the Father may <i>glorify </i>him secretly,
without any witnesses, but that, having been received into heaven, he may give a
magnificent display of his greatness and power, <i>that every knee may bow to
him</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;502910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:10.) Consequently, that phrase in the former clause, <i>with the
Father</i>,<i> </i>is contrasted with earthly and fading glory, as Paul
describes the blessed immortality of Christ, by saying that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">he died to sin once, but
now he liveth to God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
6:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The glory which I had with thee
before the world was.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now declares
that he desires nothing that does not strictly belong to him, but only that he
may appear in the flesh, such as he was before the creation of the world; or, to
speak more plainly, that the Divine majesty, which he had always possessed, may
now be illustriously displayed in the person of the Mediator, and in the human
flesh with which he was clothed. This is a remarkable passage, which teaches us
that Christ is not a God who has been newly contrived, or who has existed only
for a time; for if his

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
I have manifested thy name.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here Christ
begins to pray to the Father for his disciples, and, with the same warmth of
love with which he was immediately to suffer death for them, he now pleads for
their salvation. The first argument which he employs on their behalf is, that
they have embraced the doctrine which makes men actually children of God. There
was no want of faith or diligence on the part of Christ, to call all men to God,
but among the elect only was his labor profitable and efficacious. His
preaching, which </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>manifested the
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of God, was common to all, and he
never ceased to maintain the glory of it even among the obstinate. Why then does
he say that it was only to a small number of persons that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>manifested the
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of his Father, but because the
elect alone profit by the grace of the Spirit, who teaches inwardly? 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f442</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Let us therefore infer that not all to whom the doctrine is exhibited are truly
and efficaciously taught, but only those whose minds are enlightened. Christ
ascribes the cause to the election of God; for he assigns no other difference as
the reason why he <i>manifested the name </i>of the Father to some, passing by
others, but because they were <i>given to him</i>.<i> </i>Hence it follows their
faith flows from the outward predestination of God, and that therefore it is not
given indiscriminately to all, because all do not belong to Christ. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f443</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thine they were, and thou hast
given them to me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By adding these words,
he points out, first, the eternity of election; and, secondly, the manner in
which we ought to consider it. Christ declares that the elect always belonged to
God. God therefore distinguishes them from the reprobate, not by faith, or by
any merit, but by pure grace; for, while they are alienated from him to the
utmost, still he reckons them as his own in his secret purpose. The certainty of
that election by free grace 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f444</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
lies in this, that he commits to the guardianship of his son all whom he has
elected, that they may not perish; and this is the point to which we should turn
our eyes, that we may be fully certain that we belong to the rank of the
children of God; for the predestination of God is in itself hidden, but it is
manifested to us in Christ alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they have kept thy
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the third step; for the
first is, the election by free grace, and the second is, that gift by which we
enter into the guardianship of Christ. Having been received by Christ, we are
gathered by faith into the fold. The word of God flows out to the reprobate, but
it takes root in the elect, and hence they are said to <i>keep
</i>it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now they have
known.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here our Lord expresses what is
the chief part in faith, which consists in our believing in Christ in such a
manner, that faith does not rest satisfied with beholding the flesh, but
perceives his Divine power. For when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have known that all things
which thou hast given me are from thee,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he means, that believers feel that all that they possess is heavenly and
divine. And, indeed, if we do not perceive God in Christ, we must remain
continually in a state of hesitation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they have received
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He expresses the manner of this
knowledge. It is, because they have received the doctrine which he taught them.
But that no one may think that his doctrine is human or is earthly in its
origin, he declares that God is the Author of it, when he
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, The words which thou gavest
me I have given to them</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He speaks
according to his ordinary custom, in the person of the Mediator or servant of
God, when he says that he taught nothing but what he had received from the
Father; for, since his own condition was still mean, while he was in the flesh,
and since his Divine majesty was concealed under the form of a servant, under
the person of the Father he simply means God. Yet we must hold by the statement
which John made at the beginning of his Gospel, that, in so far as Christ was
the Eternal Word of God, he was always one God with the Father. The meaning
therefore is, that Christ was a faithful witness of God to the disciples, so
that their faith was founded exclusively on the truth of God, since the Father
himself spoke in the Son. The <i>receiving</i>,<i> </i>of which he speaks, arose
from his having efficaciously manifested to them the name of his Father by the
Holy Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And have known
truly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now repeats in other words
what he had formerly mentioned; for that Christ <i>came out from the
Father</i>,<i> </i>and <i>was sent </i>by him, has the same meaning with what
went before, that <i>all things which he has are from the Father</i>.<i> </i>The
meaning amounts to this, that faith ought to cast its eyes direct on Christ, yet
so as to form no conception of him that is earthly or mean, but to be carried
upwards to his Divine power, so as to believe firmly that he has perfectly in
himself God, and all that belongs to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And have
believed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Let it be observed, also, that
in the former clause he employs the verb <i>know </i>and now he employs the verb
<i>believe</i>;<i> </i>for thus he shows that nothing which relates to God can
be known aright but by <i>faith</i>,<i> </i>but that in <i>faith </i>there is
such certainty that it is justly called <i>knowledge</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I pray for
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Hitherto Christ has brought
forward what might procure for the disciples favor with the Father. He now forms
the prayer itself, in which he shows that he asks nothing but what is agreeable
to the will of the Father, because he pleads with the Father in behalf of those
only whom the Father himself willingly loves. He openly declares that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>does not pray for the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>because he has no solicitude but
about his own flock, which he received from the hand of the Father. But this
might be thought to be absurd; for no better rule of prayer can be found than to
follow Christ as our Guide and Teacher. Now, we are commanded to <i>pray for
all</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 2:17) and Christ himself afterwards prayed indiscriminately for
all,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Father, forgive them; for
they know not what they
do,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422334&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
23:34.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I reply, the prayers which we offer for all are still
limited to the elect of God. We ought to pray that this man, and that man, and
every man, may be saved, and thus include the whole human race, because we
cannot yet distinguish the elect from the reprobate; and yet, while we desire
the coming of the kingdom of God, we likewise pray that God may destroy his
enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is only this difference between the two cases,
that we pray for the salvation of all whom we know to have been created after
the image of God, and who have the same nature with ourselves; and we leave to
the judgment of God those whom he knows to be reprobate. But in the prayer which
is here related there was some special reason, which ought not to be produced as
an example; for Christ does not now pray from the mere impulse of faith and of
love towards men, but, entering into the heavenly sanctuary, he places before
his eyes the secret judgments of the Father, which are concealed from us, so
long as we walk by faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, we learn from these words, that God chooses
out of the world those whom he thinks fit to choose to be heirs of life, and
that this distinction is not made according to the merit of men, but depends on
his mere good-pleasure. For those who think that the cause of election is in men
must begin with faith. Now, Christ expressly declares that they who <i>are given
to him </i>belong to <i>the Father; </i>and it is certain that they are
<i>given</i> so as to believe, and that faith flows from this act of
<i>giving</i>. If the origin of faith is this act of giving, and if election
comes before it in order and time, what remains but that we acknowledge that
those whom God wishes to be saved out of the world are elected by free grace?
Now since Christ prays for the elect only, it is necessary for us to believe the
doctrine of election, if we wish that he should plead with the Father for our
salvation. A grievous injury, therefore, is inflicted on believers by those
persons who endeavor to blot out the knowledgeof election from the hearts of
believers, because they deprive them of the pleading and intercession of the Son
of God. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f445</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><b>
</b>These words serve also to expose the stupidity of those who, under the
pretence of election, give themselves up to the indolence, whereas it ought
rather to arouse us to earnestness in prayer, as Christ teaches us by his
example.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all things that are mine
are thine.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The object of the former
clause is to show that the Father will assuredly listen to him. &#8220;I do
not,&#8221; says he, &#8220;plead with thee for any but those whom thou
acknowledgest to be <i>thine, </i>for I have nothing separated from thee, and
therefore I shall not meet with a refusal.&#8221; In the second clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and thine are
mine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he shows that he has good reason
for caring about the elect; for they are <i>his </i>in consequence of their
being <i>his Father&#8217;s. </i>All these things are spoken for the
confirmation of our faith. We must not seek salvation anywhere else than in
Christ. But we shall not be satisfied with having Christ, if we do not know that
we possess God in him. We must therefore believe that there is such a unity
between the Father and the Son as makes it impossible that they shall have
anything separate from each other.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I am glorified in
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is connected with the second
clause of the verse, <i>and thine are mine; </i>for it follows that it is
reasonable that he, for his part, should promote their salvation; and this is a
most excellent testimony for confirming our faith, that Christ never will cease
to care for our salvation, since he <i>is glorified in us.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I am no longer in the
world.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He assigns another reason why he
prays so earnestly for the disciples, namely, because they will very soon be
deprived of his bodily presence, under which they had reposed till now. So long
as he dwelt with them, he cherished them,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">as a hen gathereth her
chichens under her
wings,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402337&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
23:37;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but now that he is about to depart, he asks that the
Father will guard them by his protection. And he does so on their account; for
he provides a remedy for their trembling, that they may rely on God himself, to
whose hands, as it were, he now commits them. It yields no small consolation to
us, when we learn that the Son of God becomes so much the more earnest about the
salvation of his people, when he leaves them as to his bodily presence; for we
ought to conclude from it, that, while we are labouring under difficulties in
the world, he keeps his eye on us, to send down, from his heavenly glory, relief
from our distresses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Holy
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The whole prayer is directed to
this object, that the disciples may not lose courage, as if their condition were
made worse on account of the bodily absence of their Master. For Christ, having
been appointed by the Father to be their guardian for a time, and having now
discharged the duties of that office gives them back again, as it were, into the
hands of the Father, that henceforth they may enjoy his protection, and may be
upheld by his power. It amounts therefbre to this, that, when the disciples are
deprived of Christ&#8217;s bodily presence they suffer no loss, because God
receives them under his guardianship, the efficacy of which shall never
cease.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may be
one.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This points out the way in which
they shall be kept; for those whom the Heavenly <i>Father </i>has decreed to
<i>keep, </i>he brings together in a <i>holy </i>unity of faith and of the
Spirit. But as it is not enough that men be agreed in some manner, he adds,
<i>.As we are. </i>Then will our unity be truly happy, when it shall hear the
image of God the Father and of Christ, as the wax takes the form of the seal
which is impressed upon it. But in what manner the Father, and Jesus Christ

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>While I was with them in the
world.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ says that he hath kept
them in the name of his Father; for he represents himself to be only a servant,
who did nothing but by the power, and under the protection, of God. He means,
therefore, that it were most unreasonable to suppose that they would now perish,
as if by his departure the power of God had been extinguished or dead. But it
may be thought very absurd that Christ surrenders to God the office of keeping
them, as if, after having finished the course of his life, he ceased to be the
guardian of his people. The reply is obvious. He speaks here of visible
guardianship only which ended at the death of Christ; for, while he dwelt on
earth, he needed not to borrow power from another, in order to <i>keep </i>his
disciples; but all this relates to the person of the Mediator, who appeared, for
a time, under the form of a servant. But now he bids the disciples, as soon as
they have begun to be deprived of the external aid, to raise their eyes direct
towards heaven. Hence we infer that Christ keeps believers in the present day
not less than he formerly did, but in a different manner, because Divine majesty
is openly displayed in him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom thou hast given
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He again employs the same argument,
that it would be highly unbecoming that the Father should reject those whom his
Son, by his command, has <i>hept </i>to the very close of his ministry; as if he
had said, &#8220;What thou didst commit to me I have faithfully executed, and I
took care that <i>nothing was lost </i>in my hands; and when thou now receivest
what thou hadst intrusted to me, it belongs to thee to see that it continue to
be safe and sound.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the son of
perdition.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> Judas </i>is excepted, and not
without reason; for, though he was not one of the elect and of the true flock of
God, yet the dignity of his office gave him the appearance of it; and, indeed,
no one would have formed a different opinion of him, so long as he held that
exalted rank. Tried by the rules of grammar, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F447</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the exception is incorrect; but if we examine the matter narrowly, it was
necessary that Christ should speak thus, in accommodation to the ordinary
opinion of men. But, that no one might think that the eternal election of God
was overturned by the damnation of Judas, he immediately added, that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the son of
perdition</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words Christ means
that his ruin, which took place suddenly before the eyes of men, had been known
to God long before; for </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the son
of perdition</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>according to the Hebrew
idiom, denotes a man who is ruined, or devoted to destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the Scripture might be
fulfilled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This relates to the former
clause. Judas fell,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that the
Scripture might be fulfilled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But it
would be a most unfounded argument, if any one were to infer from this, that the
revolt of Judas ought to be ascribed to God rather than to himself; because the
prediction laid him under a nccesslty. For the course of events ought not to be
ascribed to prophecies, because it was predicted in them; and, indeed, the
prophets threaten nothing but what would have happened, though they had not
spoken of it. It is not in the prophecies, therefore, that we must go to seek
the cause of events. I acknowledge, indeed, that nothing happens but what has
been appointed by God; but the only question now is, Do those things which it
has foretold, or predicted, lay men under a necessity? which I have already
demonstrated to be false.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor was it the design of Christ to transfer to
Scripture the cause of the ruin of Judas, but he only intended to take away the
occasion of stumbling, which might shake weak minds. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F448</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now the method of removing it is, by showing that the Spirit of God had long ago
testified that such an event would happen; for we commonly startle at what is
new and sudden. This is a highly useful admonition, and admits of extensive
application. For how comes it that in our own day, the greater part of men give
way on account of offences, but because they do not remember the testimonies of
Scripture, by which God has abundantly fortified his people, having foretold
early all the evils and distresses which would come before their eyes
?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And these things I speak in
the world.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here Christ shows that the
reason why he was so earnest in praying for his disciples was, not that he was
anxious about their future condition, but rather to provide a remedy for their
anxiety. We know how prone our minds are to seek external aids; and if these
present themselves, we eagerly seize them, and do not easily suffer ourselves to
be torn from them. Christ, therefore, prays to his :Father in the presence of
his disciples, not because he needed any words, but to remove from them all
doubt. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I speak in the
world,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he; that is, within their
hearing, or, in their presence, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F449</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that their minds may be calm; for their salvation already was in no danger,
having been placed by Christ in the hands of God.</font><br></div>

if you choose to express it more briefly, he calls it <i>his, </i>because he is

uneasiness, but in Christ alone there is peace and joy.</font><br></div>

consists; not that they are free from every annoyance, and live in luxury and at
their ease, but that, in the midst of dangers, they continue to be safe through
the assistance of God. For he does not admonish the Father of what is proper to
be done, but rather makes provision for their weakness, that, by the method
which he prescribes, they may restrain their desires, which are apt to go beyond
all bounds. In short, he promises to his disciples the grace of the Father; not
to relieve them from all anxiety and toil, but to furnish them with invincible
strength against their enemies, and not to suffer them to be overwhelmed by the
heavy burden of contests which they will have to endure. If,<i> </i>therefore,
we wish to be <i>kept </i>according to the rule which Christ has laid down, we
must not desire exemption from evils, or pray to God to convey us immediately
into a state of blessed rest, but must rest satisfied with the certain assurance
of victory, and, in the meantime, resist courageously all the evils, from which
Christ prayed to his Father that we might have a happy issue. In short, God does
not <i>take </i>his people <i>out of the world, </i>because he does not wish
them to be effeminate and slothful; but he <i>delivers them from evil, </i>that
they may not be overwhelmed; for he wishes them to fight, but does not suffer
them to be mortally wounded.</font><br></div>

</i>includes the kingdom of God and his righteousness; that is, when God renews
us by his Spirit, and confirms in us the grace of renewal, and continues it to
the end. He asks, first, therefore, that the Father would sanctify the
disciples, or, in other words, that he would consecrate them entirely to
himself, and defend them as his sacred inheritance. Next, he points out the
means of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctification</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and not without reason; for there are fanatics who indulge in much useless
prattle about
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctification</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but who neglect <i>the truth of </i>God, by which he consecrates us to
himself. Again, as there are others who chatter quite as foolishly about <i>the
truth </i>and yet disregard <i>the word, </i>Christ expressly says that <i>the
truth, </i>by which God sanctifies his sons, is not to be found any where else
than in <i>the word.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy word is truth;

for the light of heavenly wisdom, in which God manifests himself to us, that he
may conform us to his image. The outward preaching of <i>the word, </i>it is
true, does not of itself accomplish this, For that preaching is wickedly
profaned by the reprobate; but let us remember that Christ speaks of the elect
whom the Holy Spirit efficaciously regenerates <i>by the word. </i>Now, as the
apostles were not altogether destitute of this grace, we ought to infer from
Christ&#8217;s words, that <i>sanctification </i>is not instantly completed in
us on the first day, but that we make progress in it through the whole course of
our life, till at length God, having taken away from us the garment of the
flesh, fills us with his righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As thou hast sent me into the
world. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He confirms his prayer by another
argument; namely, because the calling of Christ and of the apostles is the same
calling, and is common to both. &#8220;I now,&#8221; he says, &#8220;appoint
them to an office, which I have hitherto held by thy command; and, therefore, it
is necessary that they should be furnished with the power of thy Spirit, that
they may be able to sustain so weighty a charge.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And for their sales I
sanctify myself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words he
explains more clearly from what source that <i>sanctification </i>flows, which
is completed in us by the doctrine of the Gospel. It is, because he consecrated
himself to the Father, that his holiness might come to us; for as the blessing
on the first-fruits is spread over the whole harvest, so the Spirit of God
cleanses us by the holiness of Christ and makes us partakers of it. Nor is this
done by imputation only, for in that respect he is said to have been <i>made to
us righteousness; </i>but he is likewise said to have been <i>made to us
sanctification,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460130&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:30,) because he has, so to speak, presented us to his Father in
his own person, that we may be renewed to true holiness by his Spirit. Besides,
though this sanctification belongs to the whole life of Christ, yet the highest
illustration of it was given in the sacrifice of his death; for then he showed
himself to be the true High Priest, by consecrating the temple, the altar, all
the vessels, and the people, by the power of his Spirit.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I ash not for these
only.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now gives a wider range to his
prayer, which hitherto had included the apostles alone; for he extends it to all
the disciples of the Gospel, so long as there shall be any of them to the end of
the world. This is assuredly a remarkable ground of confidence; for if we
believe in Christ through the doctrine of the Gospel, we ought to entertain no
doubt that we are already gathered with the apostles into his faithful
protection, so that not one of us shall perish. This prayer of Christ is a safe
harbour, and whoever retreats into it is safe from all danger of shipwreck; for
it is as if Christ had solemnly sworn that he will devote his care and diligence
to our salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He began with his apostles, that their salvation,
which we know to be certain, might make us more certain of our own salvation;
and, therefore, whenever Satan attacks us, let us learn to meet him with this
shield, that it is not to no purpose that the Son of God united us with the
apostles, so that the salvation of all was bound up, as it were, in the same
bundle. There is nothing, therefore that ought more powerfully to excite us to
embrace the Gospel; for as it is an inestimable blessing that we are presented
to God by the hand of Chrisb to be preserved from destruction, so we ought
justly to love it, and to care for it above all things else. In this respect the
madness of the world is monstrous. All desire salvation; Christ instructs us in
a way of obtaining it, from which if any one turn aside, there remains for him
no good hope; and yet scarcely one person in a hundred deigns to receive what
was so graciously offered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For those who shall believe on
me,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We must attend to this form of
expression. Christ <i>prays for all who shall believe in him. </i>By these words
he reminds us of what we have sometimes said already, that our faith ought to be
directed to him. The clause which immediately follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through their
word,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>expresses admirably the power and
nature of faith, and at the same time is a familiar confirmation to us who know
that our faith is founded on the Gospel taught by the apostles. Let the world
then condemn us a thousand times, this alone ought to satisfy us, that Christ
acknowledges us to be his heritage and pleads with the Father for
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But woe to the Papists, whose faith is so far removed
from this rule, that they are not ashamed to vomit out this horrid blasphemy,
that there is nothing in Scripture but what is ambiguous, and may be turned in a
variety of ways. The tradition of the Church is therefore their only
authoritative guide to what they shall believe. But let us remember that the Son
of God, who alone is competent to judge, does not approve of any other faith 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F452</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
than that which is drawn from the doctrine of the apostles, and sure information
of that doctrine will be found no where else than in their
writings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also observe that form of expression, <i>to
believe through the word, </i>which means that faith springs from hearing,
because the outward preaching of men is the instrument by which God draws us to
faith. It follows, that God is, strictly speaking, the Author of faith, and men
are <i>the</i> <i>ministers by whom we believe, </i>as Paul teaches
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That all may be
one.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He again lays down the end of our
happiness as consisting in unity, and justly; for the ruin of the human race is,
that, having been alienated from God, it is also broken and scattered in itself.
The restoration of it, therefore, on the contrary, consists in its being
properly united in one body, as Paul declares the perfection of the Church to
consist in</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">believers being joined together in one
spirit and says that apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastors, were given,
that they might edify and restore the body of Christ, till it came to the unity
of faith; and therefore he exhorts believers to grow into Christ, who is the
Head, from whom the whole body joined together, and connected by every bond of
supply, according to the operation in the measure of every part, maketh increase
of it to
edifcation,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
4:3, 11-16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Wherefore, whenever Christ speaks about unity, let us
remember how basely and shockingly, when separated from him, the world is
scattered; and, next, let. us learn that the commencement of a blessed life is,
that we be all governed, and that we all live, by the Spirit of Christ
alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again, it ought to be understood, that, in every
instance in which Christ declares, in this chapter, that he is <i>one with the
Father, </i>he does not speak simply of his Divine essence, but that he is
called <i>one</i> as regards his mediatorial office, and in so far as he is our
Head. Many of the fathers, no doubt, interpreted these words as meaning,
absolutely, that Christ is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>with the Father, because he is the eternal God. But their dispute with the
Arians led them to seize on detached passages, and to torture them out of their
natural meaning, in order to employ them against their antagonists. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F453</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now, Christ&#8217;s design was widely different from that of raising our minds
to a mere speculation about his hidden Divinity; for he reasons from the end, by
showing that we ought to be <i>one,</i> otherwise the <i>unity </i>which he has
with the Father would be fruitless and unavailing. To comprehend aright what was
intended by saying, that Christ and the Father are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>we must take care not to deprive Christ of his office as Mediator, but must
rather view him as he is the Head of the Church, and unite him with his members.
Thus will the chain of thought be preserved, that, in order to prevent the
<i>unity </i>of the Son with the Father from being fruitless and unavailing, the
power of that <i>unity </i>must be diffused through the whole body of believers.
Hence, too, we infer that we are <i>one </i>with the Son of God; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F454</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
not because he conveys his substance to us, but because, by the power of his
Spirit, he imparts to us his life and all the blessings which he has received
from the Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the world may
believe.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some explain the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to mean the elect, who, at that time, were still dispersed; but since the
word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>world,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>throughout the whole of this chapter, denotes the reprobate, I am more
inclined to adopt a different opinion. It happens that, immediately afterwards,
he draws a distinction between all his people and the same <i>world </i>which he
now mentions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The verb, <i>to believe, </i>has been inaccurately
used by the Evangelist for the verb, <i>to know; </i>that is, when unbelievers,
convinced by their own experienc, perceive the heavenly and Divine glory of
Christ. The consequence is, that,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>believing, they do not
believe</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because this conviction does
not penetrate into the inward feeling of the heart. And it is a just vengeance
of God, that the splendor of Divine glory dazzles the eyes of the reprobate
because they do not deserve to have a clear and pure view of it. He afterwards
uses the verb, <i>to know </i>in the same sense.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I have given to them
the glory which thou gavest to me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Let
it be observed here, that, while a pattern of perfect happiness was exhibited in
Christ, he had nothing that belonged peculiarly to himself, but rather was rich,
in order to enrich those who believed in him. Our happiness lies in having the
image of God restored and formed anew in us, which was defaced by sin. Christ is
not only the lively image of God, in so far as he is the eternal Word of God.
but even on his human nature, which he has in common with us, the likeness of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of the Father has been engraved,
so as to form his members to the resemblance of it. Paul also teaches us this,
that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">we all, with unveiled
face, by beholding THE GLORY OF GOD, are changed into the same image,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 3:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence it follows, that no one ought to be reckoned
among the disciples of Christ, unless we perceive <i>the glory of God
</i>impressed on him, as with a seal, by the likeness of Christ. To the same
purpose are the words which immediately follow:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I in them, and thou in
me;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for he intends to teach that in him
dwells all fullness of blessings, and that what was concealed in God is now
manifested in him, that he may impart it to his people, as the water, flowing
from the fountain by various channels, waters the fields on all
sides.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hast loved
them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F455</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He means that it is a very striking exhibition, and a very excellent pledge, of
the love of God towards believers, which the world is compelled to feel, whether
it will or not, when the Holy Spirit dwelling in them sends forth the rays of
righteousness and holiness. There are innumerable other ways, indeed, in which
God daily testifies his fatherly love towards us, but the mark of adoption is
justly preferred to them all. He likewise
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> and hast loved
them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As THOU HAST LOVED ME. By these
words he intended to point out the cause and origin of the love; for the
particle <i>as, </i>means <i>because, </i>and the words, AS
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou hast loved me,
</i>mean</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">BECAUSE <i>thou hast loved
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for to Christ alone belongs the
title of <i>Well-beloved,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
3:17; 17:5.) Besides, that love which the heavenly Father bears towards the Head
is extended to all the members, so that he loves none but in
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet this gives rise to some appearance of
contradiction; for Christ, as we have seen elsewhere 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F456</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
declares that the unspeakable <i>love of God </i>towards <i>the world </i>was
the reason why <i>he gave his only-begotten Son,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:16.) If the cause must go before the effect, we infer that God the Father
<i>loved </i>men apart from Christ; that is, before he was appointed to be the
Redeemer. I reply, in that, and similar passages, <i>love </i>denotes the mercy
with which God was moved towards unworthy persons, and even towards his enemies,
before he reconciled them to himselfi It is, indeed, a wonderful goodness of
God, and inconceivable by the human mind, that, exercising benevolence towards
men whom he could not but hate, he removed the cause of the hatred, that there
might be no obstruction to his love. And, indeed, Paul informs us that there are
two ways in which we are <i>loved </i>in Christ; first, because the
Father</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">chose us in him before
the creation of the
world,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
1:4;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and, secondly, because in Christ God <i>hath
reconciled us to himself, </i>and hath showed that he is gracious to us,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:10.) Thus we are at the same time the enemies and the friends of God, until,
atonement having been made for our sins, we are restored to favor with God. But
when we are justified by faith, it is then, properly, that we begin to be
<i>loved </i>by God, as children by a father. That <i>love </i>by which Christ
was appointed to be the person, in whom we should be fiercly chosen before we
were born, and while we were still ruined in Adam, is hidden in the breast of
God, and far exceeds the capacity of the human mind. True, no man will ever feel
that God is gracious to him, unless he perceives that God is pacified in Christ.
But as all relish for the love of God vanishes when Christ is taken away, so we
may safely conclude that, since by faith we are ingrafted into his body, there
is no danger of our falling from <i>the love of God; </i>for this foundation
cannot be overturned, that we are <i>loved, </i>because the Father <i>hath loved
</i>his Son

faith what Christ is, and how great is his majesty. For my own part, after
carefully weighing the whole matter, I think that Christ speaks of the perfect
happiness of believers, as if he had said, that his desire will not be satisfied
till they have been received into heaven. In the same manner I explain the
BEHOLDING of the <i>glory. </i>At that time they saw the <i>glory </i>of Christ,
just as a man shut up in the dark obtains, through small chinks, a feeble and
glimmering light. Christ now wishes that they shall make such progress as to
enjoy the full brightness of heaven. In short, he asks that the Father will
conduct them, by uninterrupted progress, to the full vision of his
<i>glory.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thou lovedst

person of the Mediator than with Christ&#8217;s Divinity alone. It would be
harsh to say that the Father loved his Wisdom; and though we were to admit it,
the connection of the passage leads us to a different view. Christ,
unquestionably, spoke as the Head of the Church, when he formerly prayed that
the apostles might be united with him, and might

With such a love did the Father love

they had received from <i>the Father; </i>for it is proper that they who alone
know God, whom the whole world rejects, should be distinguished above others,
and most properly does Christ plead with peculiar warmth for those whom the
unbelief of <i>the world </i>did not prevent from acknowledging God. By calling
him </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Righteous
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>Christ defies <i>the world
</i>and its malice; as if he had said, &#8220;However proudly <i>the world
</i>may despise or reject God, still it takes nothing from him, and cannot
hinder the honor of his righteousness from remaining unimpaired.&#8221; By these
words he declares that the faith of the godly ought to be founded on God, in
such a manner that, though <i>the whole world </i>should oppose, it would never
fail; just as, in the present day, we must charge the Pope with injustice, in
order that we may vindicate for God the praise which is due to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I have known thee, and these
have known that thou hast sent me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Christ does not merely say that God was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>known</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>by the disciples, but mentions two steps; first, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he has known the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and, secondly, that the
disciples </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have known that he was
sent by the Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But as he adds
immediately afterwards, that he has <i>declared to them the name </i>of the
Father, he praises them, as I have said, for the knowledge of God, which
separates them from the rest of the world. Yet we must attend to the order of
faith, as it is here described. The Son came out of the bosom of the Father,
and, properly speaking, he alone <i>knows </i>the Father; and, therefore, all
who desire to approach God must betake themselves to Christ meeting them, and
nmst devote themselves to him; and, after having been known by the disciples, he
will, at length, raise them to God the Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I have declared to them
thy name, and will declare it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ
discharged the office of Teacher, but, in order to make known the :Father, he
employed the secret revelation of the Spirit, and not the sound of his voice
alone. He means, therefore, that he taught the apostles efficaciously. Besides,
their faith being at that time very weak, he promises greater progress for the
future, and thus prepares them to expect more abundant grace of the Holy Spirit.
Though he speaks of the apostles, we ought to draw from this a general
exhortation, to study to make constant progress, and not to think that we have
run so well that we have not still a long journey before us, so long as we are
surrounded by the flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the love with which thou hast

thou mayest love them in me, or, that

strictly speaking, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the love with

<i>with which he loved </i>his Son from the beginning, so as to render us also
acceptable to him, and capablc of being <i>loved </i>in Christ. And, indeed, as
was said a little before, so far as relates to us, apart from Christ, we are
hated by God, and he only begins to love us, when we are united to the body of
his beloved Son. It is an invaluable privilege of faith, that we know that
Christ was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>loved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>by the Father on our account, that we might be made partakers of the same
love, and might enjoy it for ever.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I in
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This clause deserves our
attention, for it teaches us that the only way in which we are included in that
love which he mentions is, that Christ dwells in us; for, as the Father cannot
look upon his Son without having likewise before his eyes the whole body of
Christ, <i>so, </i>if we wish to be beheld in him, we must be actually his
members.</font><br></div>

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When Jesus bad spoken
these words.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this narrative John
passes by many things which the other three Evangelists relate, and he does so
on purposej as his intention was to collect many things worthy of being
recorded, about which they say nothing; and, therefore, let the reader go to the
other Evangelists to find what is wanting here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Over the brook
Kedron.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the Greek original there is
an article prefixed to <i>Kedron, </i>which would seem to intimate that the
<i>brook </i>takes its name from the <i>cedars;</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F459</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>but this is probably an error which has crept into the text; for <i>the
valley </i>or </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brook
</i>KEDRON</font><font face="Palatino"> is often mentioned in Scripture. The
place was so called from its being <i>dark </i>or <i>gloomy, </i>because, being
a hollow valley, it was shady, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F460</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
On that point, however, I do not dispute: I only state what is more
probable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The chief thing to be considered is, the intention of
the Evangelist in pointing out the place; for his object was, to show that
Christ went to death willingly. He came into a place which, he knew, was well
known to <i>Judas. </i>Why did he do this but to present himself, of his own
accord, to the traitor and to the enemies? Nor was he led astray by
inadvertency, for he knew beforehand all that was to happen. John afterwards
mentions also that he went forward to meet them. He therefore suffered death,
not by constraint, but willingly, that he might be a voluntary sacrifice; for
without obedience atonement would not have been obtained for us. Besides, he
entered into the garden, not for the purpose of seeking a place of concealment,
but that he might have a better opportunity, and greater leisure, for prayer.
That he prayed three times to be delivered from death,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402644&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
26:44,) is not inconsistent with that voluntary obedience of which we have
spoken; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F461</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for it was necessary that he should contend with difficulties, that he might be
victorious. Now, having subdued the dread of death, he advances to death freely
and willingly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judas, therefore, having
received a band of soldiers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Judas</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>came accompanied by soldiers and by so large a retinue, is a sign of a bad
conscience, which always trembles without any cause. It is certain that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>band of
soldiers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>was borrowed from the governor,
who also sent a captain at the head of a thousand soldiers; for, on account of
sudden mutinies, a garrison was stationed in the city, and the governor himself
kept a body-guard, wherever he was. The rest were <i>officers </i>sent by <i>the
priests; </i>but John makes separate mention <i>of the Pharisee, </i>because
they were more enraged than all the rest, as if they had cared more about
religion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus therefore,
hnowing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Evangelist states more
clearly with what readiness Christ went forward to death, but, at the same time,
describes the great power which he exercised by a single word, in order to
inform us that wicked men had no power over him, except so far as he gave
permission.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is
I.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He replies mildly that he is the
person <i>whom they seek, </i>and yet, as if they had been struck down by a
violent tempest, or rather by a thunderbolt, he lays them prostrate on the
ground. There was no want of power in him, therefore, to restrain their hands,
if he had thought proper; but he wished to obey his Father, by whose decree he
knew that he was called to die.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may infer from this how dreadful and alarming to
the wicked the voicc of Christ will be, when he shall ascend his throne to judge
the world. At that time he stood as a lamb ready to be sacrificed; his majesty,
so far as outward appearance was concerned, was utterly gone; and yet when he
utters but a single word, his armed and courageous enemies fall down. And what
was the word? He thunders no fearful excommunication against them, but only
replies, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is
I</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>What then will be the result, when he
shall come, not to be judged by a man, but to be the Judge of the living and the
dead; not in that mean and despicable appearance but shining in heavenly glory,
and accompanied by his angels? He intended, at that time, to give a proof of
that efficacy which Isaiah ascribes to his voice. Among other glorious
attributes of Christ, the Prophet relates that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">he will strike the earth
with the rod of his mouth, and will slay the wicked by the breath of his lips,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;231104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
11:4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">True, the fulfillment of this prophecy is declared by
Paul to be delayed till the end of the world,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;530208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 2:8.) Yet we daily see the wicked, with all their rage and pride,
struck down by the voice of Christ; and, when those men fell down who had come
to bind Christ, there was exhibited a visible token of that alarm which wicked
men feel within themselves, whether they will or not, when Christ speaks by his
ministers. Besides, as this was in some measure accidental to the voice of
Christ, to whom it peculiarly belongs to raise up men who were lying in a state
of death, he will undoubtedly display toward us such power as to raise us even
to heaven.</font><br></div>

powerful effect of that blindness with which God strikes the minds of wicked
men, and how dreadful is their stupidity, when, by a just judgment of God, they
have been bewitched by Satan. Oxen and asses, if they fall, are touched with
some kind of feeling; but those men, after having had an open display of the
divine power of Christ, proceed as fearlessly as if they had not perceived in
him even the shadow of a man; nay, Judas himself remains unmoved. Let us learn,
therefore, to fear the judgment of God, by which the reprobate, delivered into
the hands of Satan, become more stupid than brute beasts. Nor can it be doubted
that Satan hurried them on, with wild fury, to such a desperate hardihood; for
there is no insanity that drives a man with such viohnee as this kind of
blindness; Wicked men, after having been <i>given over to a reprobate mind,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28,) care no more about rushing against God than if they had only to do with a
fly. They feel his power, indeed, but not so as to be disposed to obey; for
sooner will they be broken a hundred times than they will yield. In short, their
malice is a veil to hinder them from observing the light of God; their obstinacy
renders them harder than stones, so that they never suffer themselves to be
subdued.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have told you that it
is I.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here we see how the Son of God not
only submits to death of his own accord, that by his obedience he may blot out
our transgressions, but also how he discharges the office of a good Shepherd in
protecting his flock. He sees the attack of the wolves, and does not wait till
they come to the sheep which have been committed to his care, but immediately
goes forward to guard them. Whenever, therefore, either wicked men or devils
make an attack upon us, let us not doubt that this good Shepherd is ready 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F462</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to aid us in the same manner. Yet by his example Christ has laid down to
shepherds a rule which they ought to follow, if they wish to discharge their
office in a right manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have lost
none.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage appears to be
inappropriately quoted, as it relates to their souls rather than to their
bodies; for Christ did not keep the apostles safe to the last, but this he
accomplished, that, amidst incessant dangers, and even in the midst of death,
still their eternal salvation was secured. I reply, the Evangelist does not
speak merely of their bodily life, but rather means that Christ, sparing them
for a time, made provision for their eternal salvation. Let us consider how
great their weakness was; what do we think they would have done, if they had
been brought to the test? While, therefore, Christ did not choose that they
should be tried beyond the strength which he had given to them, he rescued them
from eternal destruction. And hence we may draw a general doctrine, that, though
he try our faith by many temptations, still he will never allow us to come into
extreme danger without supplying us also with strength to overcome. And, indeed,
we see how he continually bears with our weakness, when he puts himself forward
to repel so many attacks of Satan and wicked men, because he sees that we are
not yet able or prepared for them. In short, he never brings his people into the
field of battle till they have been fully trained, so that even in perishing
they do not perish, because there is gain provided for them both in death and in
life.</font><br></div>

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Simon Peter, having
a sword, drew it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Evangelist now
describes the foolish zeal <i>of Peter, </i>who attempted to defend his Master
in an unlawful manner. Boldly and courageously, indeed, he incurs great risk on
Christ&#8217;s account; but as he does not consider what his calling demands,
and what God permits, his action is so far from deserving praise, that he is
severely blamed by Christ. But let us learn that, in the person of <i>Peter,
</i>Christ condemns every thing that men dare to attempt out of their own fancy.
This doctrine is eminently worthy of attention; for nothing is more common than
to defend, under the cloak of zeal, every thing that we do, as if it were of no
importance whether God approved, or not, what men suppose to be right, whose
prudence is nothing else than mere vanity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If we saw nothing faulty in the zeal of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>still we ought to be satisfied on this single ground, that Christ declares
that he is displeased with it. But we see that it was not owing to him that
Christ did not turn aside from death, and that his name was not exposed to
perpetual disgrace; for, in offering violence to the captain and the soldiers,
he acts the part of a highwayman, because he resists the power which God has
appointed. Christ having already been more than enough hated by the world, this
single deed might give plausibility to all the calumnies which his enemies
falsely brought against him. :Besides, it was exceedingly thoughtless in Peter
to attempt to prove his faith by his sword, while he could not do so by his
tongue. When he is called to make confession, he denies his Master; and now,
without his Master&#8217;s authority, he raises a tumult.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Warned by so striking an example, let us learn to
keep our zeal within proper bounds; and as the wantonness of our flesh is always
eager to attempt more than God commands, let us learn that our zeal will succeed
ill, whenever we venture to undertake any thing contrary to the word of God. It
will sometimes happen that the commencement gives us flattering promises, but we
shall at length be punished for our rashness. Let obedience, therefore, be the
foundation of all that we undertake. We are also reminded, that those who have
resolved to plead the cause of Christ do not always conduct themselves so
skilfully as not to commit some fault; and, therefore, we ought the more
earnestly to entreat the Lord to guide us in every action by the spirit of
prudence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Put up thy sword into the
sheath.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this command Christ reproves
Peter&#8217;s action. :But we must attend to the reason, which is, that a
private individual was not permitted to rise in opposition to those who had been
invested with public authority; for this may be inferred from the other three
Evangelists, who relate Christ&#8217;s general declaration,</font><br></div>

never obtain for his conduct the approbation of God

53:7;) but it serves the purpose of an example, for the same patience is
demanded from all of us. Scripture compares afflictions to medicinal draughts;
for, as the master of a house distributes meat and drink to his children and
servants, so God has this authority over us, that he has a right to treat every
one as he thinks fit; and whether he cheers us by prosperity, or humbles us by
adversity, he is said to administer a sweet or a bitter draught. The draught
appointed for Christ was, to suffer the death of the cross for the
reconciliation of the world. He says, therefore, that he nmst
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>drink the cup which his
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>measured out and delivered to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the same manner we, too, ought to be prepared for
enduring the cross. And yet we ought not to listen to fanatics, who tell us that
we must not seek remedies for diseases and any other kind of distresses, lest we
reject <i>the cup </i>which the Heavenly Father
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F464</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
presents to us. Knowing that <i>we must once die,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580927&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
9:27,) we ought to be prepared for death; but the time of our death being
unknown to us, the Lord permits us to defend our life by those aids which he has
himself appointed. We must patiently endure diseases, however grievous they may
be to our flesh; and though they do not yet appear to be mortal, we ought to
seek alleviation of them; only we must be careful not to attempt any thing but
what is permitted by the word of God. In short, provided that this remain always
fixed in our hearts, <i>Let the will of the Lord be done,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;442114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

strange that Christ, who laid the soldiers prostrate on the ground by a single
word, now allows himself to be <i>taken; </i>for if he intended at length to
surrender to his enemies, what need was there for performing such a miracle? But
the demonstration of divine power was advantageous in two respects; for, first,
it serves to take away the offense, that we may not think that Christ yielded as
if he had been overcome by weakness; and, secondly, it proves that in dying he
was altogether voluntary. So far as it was useful, therefore, he asserted his
power against his enemies; but when it was necessary to obey the Father, he
restrained himself, that he might be offered as a sacrifice. But let us remember
that the body of the Son of God was bound, that our souls might be loosed from
the cords of sin and of Satan.</font><br></div>

Josephus. By the injunction of the Law, this honor was perpetual, and ended only
at the death of him who held it; but ambition and intestine broils gave occasion
to the Roman governors to dethrone one high priest and put another in his room,
at their own pleasure, either for money or for favor. Thus Vitellius deposed
Caiaphas, and appointed Jonathan, the son of Annas, to be his

John, because he is accustomed to speak of himself without mentioning his name.
But what intimacy with a proud <i>high priest </i>could John have, who was a
mean fisherman? And how was it possible for him, being one of Christ&#8217;s
household, to be in the habit of visiting the house of <i>the high priest?
</i>It is more probable that he was not one of the twelve, but that he is called
a disciple, because he had embraced the doctrine of the Son of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">John is not very exact in arranging the narrative,
being satisfied with drawing up a brief summary; for, after having related that
Peter once denied Christ, he intermingles other matters, and afterwards returns
to the other two denials. Inattentive readers were led by this circumstance to
conclude that the first denial took place in the house of <i>Annas. </i>The
words, however, convey no such meaning, but rather state clearly that it was the
high priest&#8217;s maid that constrained Peter to deny Christ. We must,
therefore, understand that, when Christ was brought before the high priest,
admission was not granted to any person who chose, but that <i>the disciple who
was known to the high priest </i>requested, as a personal favor, that Peter
might be admitted. There is no reason to doubt that godly zeal was the motive
that induced both of them to follow Christ; but since Christ had plainly
declared that he spared Peter and the others, he who was so weak would have
found it to be far better for him to groan and pray in some dark corner than to
go into the presence of men. He now undertakes, with great earnestness, the
performance of a duty from which Christ had released him; and when he comes to
the confession of faith, in which he ought to have persevered even to death, his
courage fails. We ought always to consider what the Lord requires from us, that
those who are weak may not undertake what is not necessary.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then the maid that kept the
door said to Peter.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> Peter </i>is introduced
into the high priest&#8217;s hall; but it cost him very dear, for, as soon as he
sets his foot within it, he is constrained to deny Christ. When he stumbles so
shamefully at the first step, the foolishness of his boasting is exposed. He had
boasted that he would prove to be a valiant champion, and able to meet death
with firmness; and now, at the voice of a single <i>maid, </i>and that voice
unaccompanied by threatening, he is confounded and throws down his arms. Such is
a demonstration of the power of man. Certainly, all the strength that appears to
be in men is smoke, which a breath immediately drives away. When we are out of
the battle, we are too courageous; but experience shows that our lofty talk is
foolish and groundless; and, even when Satan makes no attacks, we contrive for
ourselves idle alarms which disturb us before the time. The voice of a feeble
woman terrified Peter: and what is the case with us? Do we not continually
tremble at the rustling of a falling leaf? A false appearance of danger, which
was still distant, made Peter tremble: and are we not every day led away from
Christ by childish absurdities? In short, our courage is of such a nature, that,
of its own accord, it gives way where there is no enemy; and thus does God
revenge the arrogance of men by reducing fierce minds to a state of weakness. A
man, filled not with fortitude but with wind, promises that he will obtain an
easy victory over the whole world; and yet, no sooner does he see the shadow of
a thistle, than he immediately trembles. Let us therefore learn not to be brave
in any other than the Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This does not seem, indeed, to be
an absolute denial of Christ; but when Peter is afraid to acknowledge that he is
<i>one of Christs disciples, </i>it amounts to an assertion that he has nothing
to do with him. This ought to be carefully observed, that no one may imagine
that he has escaped by acting the part of a sophist, when it is only in an
indirect manner that he shrinks from the confession of his
faith.</font><br></div>

after having denied his Master; though it is possible that he may have been
restrained by fear lest, in going out of the high priest&#8217;s house, he

<div><font face="Palatino">and that he therefore confers this favor on none but
the twelve apostles. I answer, when he says in the passage now under review,
that <i>he spoke nothing in secret, </i>this refers to the substance of the
doctrine, which was always the same, though the form of teaching it was various;
for he did not speak differently among the disciples, so as to instruct them in
something different; nor did he act cunningly, as if he purposely intended to
conceal from the people what he spoke to a small number of persons in the house.
He could, therefore, testify with a good conscience that he had openly declared
and honestly proclaimed the substance of his doctrine.</font><br></div>

inform us, first, how great was the rage of the enemies of Christ, and how
tyrannical their government was; and, secondly, what sort of discipline existed
among those priests. They sit like judges, but they are as cruel as ferocious
beasts. A council is assembled, in which the utmost gravity ought to have
prevailed; and yet a single <i>officer </i>is so daring and presumptuous, that,
in the midst of the judicial proceedings, and in the presence of the judges, he
strikes the person accused, who was not found to be in any respect guilty. We
need not wonder, therefore, that the doctrine of Christ is condemned by so
barbarous an assembly, from which not only all justice, but likewise all
humanity and modesty, are banished.</font><br></div>

courts.&#8221; Christ complains, therefore, that a grievous injury has been
clone to him, if he has committed no offense, and that, even if he has committed
an offense, still they ought to proceed in a lawful manner, and not with rage
and violence.</font><br></div>

do injury to others, in order that nobody may provoke them. It is a foolish
exposition of Christ&#8217;s words, therefore, that is given by those who view
them in such a light as if we were commanded to hold out fresh inducements to
those who already are too much disposed to do mischief; for he means nothing
else than that each of us should be more ready to bear a second injury than to
take revenge for the first; so that there is nothing to prevent a Christian man

not be very great; next, it becomes habitual, and at length, after that
conscience has been laid asleep, he who has accustomed himself to despise God
will think nothing unlawful for him, but will dare to commit the greatest

very heinous. The first is, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F477</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they do not consider that they carry more pollution within their hearts, than
they can contract by entering any place however profane; and the second is, they
carry to excess their care about smaller matters, and neglect what is of the
highest importance.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">To the defiled and to

<div><font face="Palatino">But these hypocrites, though they are so full of
malice, ambition, fraud, cruelty, and avarice, that they ahnost infect heaven
and earth with their abominable smell, are only afraid of external pollutions.
So then it is an intolerable mockery, that they expect to please God, provided
that they do not contract defilement by touching some unclean thing, though they
have disregarded true purity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Another fault connected with hypocrisy is, that,
while it is careful in performing ceremonies, it makes no scruple of neglecting
matters of the highest importance; for God enjoined on the Jews those ceremonies
which are contained in the Law, for no other reason, than that they might be
habituated to the love and practice of true holiness. Besides, no part of the
Law forbade them to enter into the house of a Gentile, but it was a precaution
derived from the traditions of the fathers, that no person might, through
oversight, contract any pollution from an unclean house. But those venerable
expounders of the Law, while they carefully <i>strain at a gnat, swallow the
camel</i>

flea than to kill a man. This fault is closely allied to the other, of greatly
preferring the traditions of men to the holy commandments of God. In order
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may eat the
passover</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in a proper manner, they wish
to keep themselves pure; but they suppose uncleanness to be confined within the
wails of the governor&#8217;s house, and yet they do not hesitate, while heaven
and earth are witnesses, to pursue an innocent person to death. In short, they
observe the shadow of <i>the passover </i>with a false and pretended reverence,
and yet not only do they violate the true <i>passover </i>by sacrilegious hands,

deeds of <i>a malefactor </i>shall we find in him, except that he has cured
every kind of diseases, has driven the devils out of men, has made the
paralytics and the lame to walk, has restored sight to the blind, hearing to the
deaf, and life to the dead? Such were the real facts, and those men knew them
well; but, as I said a little ago, when men are intoxicated with pride, nothing
is more difficult than to arouse them to form a sound and correct

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Pilate went again into
the hall.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is probable that many
things were said on both sides, which the Evangelist passes over; and this
conclusion might be readily drawn from the other Evangelists. But John dwells
chiefly on a single point, that Pilate made a laborious inquiry whether Christ
was justly or unjustly accused. In the presence of the people, who were inflamed
with sedition, nothing could be done but in a riotous manner. He therefore
<i>goes again into the hall; </i>and, indeed, his intention is to acquit Christ,
but Christ himself, in order that he may obey his Father, presents himself to be
condemned; and this is the reason why he is so sparing in his replies. Having a
judge who was favorable, and who would willingly have lent an ear to him, it was
not difficult for him to plead his cause; but he considers for what purpose he
came down into the world, and to what he is now called by the Father. Of his own
accord, therefore, he refrains from speaking, that he may not escape from
death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Art thou the King of the
Jews?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It would never have struck
Pilate&#8217;s mind to put this question about <i>the kingdom, </i>if this
charge had not been brought against Christ by the Jews. Now, Pilate takes up
what was more offensive than all the rest, that, having disposed of it, he may
acquit the prisoner. The tendency of Christ&#8217;s answer is to show that there
is no ground for that accusation; and thus it contains an indirect refutation;
as if he had said, &#8220;It is absurd to bring that charge against me, fbr not
even the slightest suspicion of it can fall upon me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Pilate appears to have taken amiss that Christ asked
him why he suspected him of such a crime; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F482</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and, therefore, he angrily reproaches him, that all the evil comes from <i>his
own nation. </i>&#8220;I sit here as a judge,&#8221; says he; &#8220;it is not
foreigners, but your own countrymen, who accuse you. There is no reason,
therefore, why you should involve me in your quarrels. You would be allowed by
me and by the Romans to live at peace; but you raise disturbances among
yourselves, and I am reluctantly compelled to bear a part in
them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>36.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My kingdom is not of this

that he is <i>a king, </i>but, so far as was necessary to prove his innocence,
he clears himself of the calumny; for he declares, that there is no disagreement
between his kingdom and political government or order; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F483</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as if he had said, &#8220;I am falsely accused, as if I had attempted to produce
a dis-turbanee, or to make a revolution in public affairs. I have preached about
<i>the kingdom of God; </i>but that is spiritual, and, therefore, you have no
right to suspect me of aspiring to kingly power.&#8221; This <i>defense </i>was
made by Christ before Pilate, but the same doctrine is useful to believers to
the end of the world; for if the kingdom of Christ were earthly, it would be
frail and changeable, because</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">but now, since it is pronounced to <i>be
</i>heavenly, this assures us of its perpetuity. Thus, should it happen, that
the whole world were overturned, provided that our consciences are always
directed to <i>the kingdom </i>of Christ, they will, nevertheless, remain firm,
not only amidst shakings and convulsions, but even amidst dreadful ruin and
destruction. If we are cruelly treated by wicked men, still our salvation is
secured by <i>the kingdom </i>of Christ, which is not subject to the caprice of
men. In short, thougll there are innumerable storms by which <i>the world </i>is
continually agitated, <i>the kingdom </i>of Christ, in which we ought to seek
tranquillity, is separated from <i>the world.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are taught, also, what is the nature of this
<i>kingdom; </i>for if it made us happy according to the flesh, and brought us
riches, luxuries, and all that is desirable for the use of the present life, it
would smell of the earth and of the world; but now, though our condition be
apparently wretched, still our true happiness remains unimpaired. We learn from
it, also, who they are that belong to this <i>Mngdom; </i>those who, having been
renewed by the Spirit of God, contemplate the heavenly life in holiness and
righteousness. Yet it deserves our attention, likewise, that it is not said,
that <i>the kingdom </i>of Christ is not <i>in </i>this <i>world; </i>for we
know that it has its seat in our hearts, as also Christ says elsewhcre, <i>The
kingdom of God is within you,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421721&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
17:21.) But, strictly speaking,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the kingdom of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>while it dwells in us, is a
stranger to the world, because its condition is totally
different.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My servants would
strive.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He proves that he did not aim at
an earthly kingdom, because no one moves, no one takes arms in his support; for
if a private individual lay claim to royal authority, he must gain power by
means of seditious men. Nothing of this kind is seen in Christ; and, therefore,
it follows that he is not an earthly <i>king.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a question arises, Is it not law fill to
defend the <i>kingdom </i>of Christ by arms? For when <i>Kings </i>and
<i>Princes</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F484</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>are commanded to <i>kiss the Son of God,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;190210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
2:10-12) not only are they enjoined to submit to his authority in their private
capacity, but also to employ all the power that they possess, in defending the
Church and maintaining godliness. I answer, first, they who draw this
conclusion, that the doctrine of the Gospel and the pure worship of God ought
not to be defended by arms, are unskillful and ignorant reasoners; for Christ
argues only from the facts of the case in hand, how frivolous were the calumnies
which the Jews had brought against him. Secondly, though godly kings defend
<i>the kingdom </i>of Christ by the sword, still it is done in a different
manner from that in which worldly kingdoms are wont to be defended; for the
kingdom of Christ, being spiritual, must be founded on the doctrine and power of
the Spirit. In the same manner, too, its edification is promoted; for neither
the laws and edicts of men, nor the punishments inflicted by them, enter into
the consciences. Yet this does not hinder princes from accidentally defending
the kingdom of Christ; partly, by appointing external discipline, and partly, by
lending their protection to the Church against wicked men. It results, however,
from the depravity of <i>the world, </i>that the <i>kingdom </i>of Christ is
strengthened more by the blood of the martyrs than by the aid of
arms.</font><br></div>

learned, from the former answer, that Christ claims for himself some sort of

with this, he makes an additional statement, which serves for a seal, as it
were, to ratify what he had said. Hence we infer, that the doctrine concerning
Christ&#8217;s <i>kingdom </i>is of no ordinary importance, since he has deemed
it worthy of so solemn an affirmation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this cause was I born, that I

no doubt, a general sentiment; but it must be viewed in relation to the place
which it holds in the present passage. The words mean, that it is natural for
Christ to speak <i>the truth; </i>and, next, that he was sent <i>for this
purpose </i>by the Father; and, consequently, that this is his peculiar office.
There is no danger, therefore, that we shall be deceived by trusting him, since
it is impossible that he who has been commissioned by God, and whose natural
disposition leads him to maintain <i>the truth, </i>shall teach any thing that
is not <i>true.</i></font><br></div>

for the purpose of exhorting Pilate, (for he knew that he would gain nothing by
doing so,) as of defending his doctrine against the base reproaches which had
been east on it; as if he had said, &#8220;It is imputed to me as a crime that I
have asserted that <i>I am a king; </i>and yet this is an unquestionable truth,
which is received with reverence and without hesitation by all who have a
correct judgment and a sound understanding.&#8221; When he says,<i> </i>that
they are <i>of the truth </i>he does not mean that they naturally know the
truth, but that they are directed by the Spirit of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>38.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What is
truth?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some think that Pilate puts this
question through curiosity, as irreligious men are sometimes accustomed to be
eagerly desirous of learning something that is new to them, and yet do not know
why they wish it; for they intend nothing more than to gratify their ears. For
my own part, I rather think that it is an expression of disdain; for Pilate
thought himself highly insulted when Christ represented him as destitute of all
knowledge of <i>the truth. </i>Here we see in Pilate a disease which is
customary among men. Though we are all aware of our ignorance, yet there are few
who are willing to confess it; and the consequence is, that the greater part of
men reject the true doctrine. Afterwards, the Lord, who is the Teacher of the
humble, blinds the proud, and thus inflicts on them the punishment which they
deserve. From the same pride arises such disdain, that they do not choose to
submit to learn, because all lay claim to sagacity and acuteness of mind.
<i>Truth </i>is believed to be a common thing; but God declares, on the
contrary, that it far exceeds the capacity of the human
understanding.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The same thing happens in other matters. The
principal articles of theology are, the curse pronounced on the human race, the
corruption of nature, the mortification of the flesh, the renewal of the life,
the reconciliation <i>effected </i>by free grace through the only sacrifice, the
imputation of righteousness, by means of which a sinner is accepted by God, and
the illumination of the Holy Spirit. These, being paradoxes, are disdainfully
rejected by the ordinary understanding of men. Few, therefore, make progress in
the school of God, because we scarcely find one person in ten who attends to the
first and elementary instructions; and why is this, but because they measure the
secret wisdom of God by their own understanding ?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That Pilate spoke in mockery is evident from this
circumstance, that he immediately goes out. In short, he is angry with Christ
for boasting that he brings forward <i>the truth, </i>which formerly lay hidden
in darkness. Yet this indignation of Pilate shows that wicked men never reject
the doctrine of the Gospel so spitefully as not to be somewhat moved by its
efficacy; for, though Pilate did not proceed so far as to become humble and
teachable, yet he is constrained to feel some inward
compunction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>39.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But you have a
custom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Pilate was all along pondering
in what way he might save Christ&#8217;s life; but, the people being so fiercely
enraged, he attempted to keep a middle path, in order to allay their fury; for
he thought that it would be enough if Christ, being dismissed <i>as a
malefactor, </i>were marked with perpetual ignominy, lie therefore selects
<i>Barabbas </i>above all others, in order that, by a comparison with that man,
the hatred which they bore to Christ might be softened down; for Barabbas was
universally and strongly detested on account of his atrocious crimes. And,
indeed, is there any thing more detestable than <i>a robber? </i>But Luke
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
23:19) relates that, in addition to this, he was guilty of other
crimes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That the Jews preferred him to Christ, did not happen
without a singular interposition of the providence of God; for it would have
been highly unbecoming, that the Son of God should be rescued from death by so
dishonorable a price. Yeb by his death, he was thrown into the deepest ignominy,
so that, in consequence of the release of <i>Barabbas, </i>he was crucified
between two robbers; for he had taken upon himself the sins of all, which could
not be expiated in any other way; and the glory of his resurrection, by which it
was speedily followed, caused his death itself to be a splendid
triumph.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This <i>custom, </i>by which the Roman governor
delivered up to the Jews, every year, at the passover, some criminal, involved a
base and heinous crime. It was done, no doubt in order to honor the sacredness
of the day, but was, in reality, nothing else than a shameful profanation of it;
for Scripture declares, that</font><br></div>

improper kind of forgiveness. Let us learn by this example, that nothing is more
ridiculous, than to attempt to serve God by our inventions; for, as soon as men
begin to follow their own imaginations, there will be no end till, by falling
into some of the most absurd fooleries, they openly insult God. The rule for the

when Christ shall have been scourged, the Jews will be satisfied with this light
chastisement. When he labors so earnestly, and without any success, we ought to
recognize in this the decree of Heaven, by which Christ was appointed to death.
Yet his innocence is frequently attested by the testimony of the judge, in order
to assure us that he was free from all sin, and that he was substituted as a
guilty person in the room of others, and bore the punishment due to the sins of
others. We see also in Pilate a remarkable example of a trembling conscience. He
acquits Christ with his mouth, and acknowledges that <i>there is no guilt in
him, </i>and yet inflicts punishment on him, as if he were guilty. Thus, they

dishonorable life? Others select and approve of certain parts of the Gospel, and
yet tear the whole Gospel to pieces. They think that they have done exceedingly
well, if they have corrected a few gross abuses. It would be better that the
doctrine should be buried for a time, than that it should be <i>scourged </i>in

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have a
law.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They mean that, in proceeding
against Christ, they do what is right, and are not actuated by hatred or sinful
passion; for they perceived that Pilate had indirectly reproved them. Now, they
speak as in the presence of a man who was ignorant of <i>the law; </i>as if they
had said, &#8220;We<i> </i>are permitted to live after our own manner, and our
religion does not suffer any man to boast of being <i>the Son of
God.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>Besides, this accusation was not altogether void of
plausibility, but they erred grievously in the application of it. The general
doctrine was undoubtedly true, that it was not lawful for men to assume any
honor which is due to God, and that they who claimed for themselves what is
peculiar to God alone <i>deserved to be put to death. </i>But the source of
their error related to the person of Christ, because they did not consider what
are the titles given by Scripture to the Messiah, from which they might easily
have learned that he was the <i>Son of God, </i>and did not even deign to
inquire whether or not Jesus was the Messiah whom God had formerly
promised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see, then, how they drew a false conclusion from a
true principle, for they reason badly. This example warns us to distinguish
carefully between a general doctrine and the application of it, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F488</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for there are many ignorant and unsteady persons who reject the very principles
of Scripture, if they have once been deceived by the semblance of truth; and
such licentiousness makes too great progress in the world every day. Let us,
therefore, remember that we ought to guard against imposition, so that
principles which are true may remain in all their force, and that the authority
of Scripture may not be diminished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the other hand, we may easily find a reply to
wicked men, who falsely and improperly allege the testimony of Scripture, and
the principles which they draw from it, to support their bad designs; just as
the Papists, when they extol in lofty terms the authority of the Church, bring
forward nothing about which all the children of God are not agreed. They
maintain that the Church is the mother of believers, that she is the pillar of
truth, that she ought to be heard, that she is guided by the Holy Spirit. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F489</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
All this we ought to admit, but when they wish to appropriate to themselves all
the authority that is due to the Church, they wickedly, and with sacrilegious
presumption, seize what does not at all belong to them. For we must inquire into
the grounds of what they assume as true, that they deserve the title of The
Church; and here they utterly fail. In like manner, when they exercise furious
cruelty against all the godly, they do so on this pretence, that they have been
ordained to defend the faith and peace of the Church. But when we examine the
matter more closely, we plainly see that there is nothing which they have less
at heart than the defense of true doctrine, that nothing affects them less than
a care about peace and harmony, but that they only fight to uphold their own
tyranny. They who are satisfied with general principles, and do not attend to
the <i>circumstances, </i>imagine that the Papists do right in attacking us; but
the investigation of the matter quickly dissipates that smoke by which they
deceive the simple. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F490</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He was the more
afraid.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These words may be explained in
two ways. The first is, that Pilate dreaded lest some blame should be imputed to
him, if a tumult arose, because he had not condemned Christ. The second is,
that, after having heard the name of <i>the Son of God, </i>his mind was moved
by religion. This second view is confirmed by what immediately
follows:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he entered again into
the hall, and said to Jesus;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>WHENCE ART
THOU? ,or it is evident from this that he was in a state of perplexity and
anguish, because <i>he was afraid </i>that he would be punished for sacrilege,
if he laid his hand on </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Son of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It ought to be observed that, when
he asks <i>whence Christ is, </i>he does not inquire about his country, but the
meaning is, as if he had said, &#8220;Art thou a man born on the earth, or art
thou some god?&#8221; The interpretation which I give to this passage,
therefore, is, that Pilate, struck with the fear of God, was in perplexity and
doubt as to what he ought to do; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F491</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for he saw, on the one hand, the excitement of a mutiny, and, on the other hand,
conscience held him bound not to offend God for the sake of avoiding
danger.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This example is highly worthy of observation. Though
the countenance of Christ was so disfigured, yet, as soon as Pilate hears the
name of God, he is seized with the <i>fear </i>of violating the majesty of God
in a man who was utterly mean and despicable. If reverence for God had so much
influence on an irreligious man, must not they be worse than reprobate, who now
judge of divine things in sport and jest, carelessly, and without any <i>fear?
</i>for, indeed, Pilate is a proof that men have naturally a sentiment of
religion, which does not suffer them to rush fearlessly in any direction they
choose, when the question relates to divine things. This is the reason why I
said that those who, in handling the doctrine of Scripture, are not more
impressed with the majesty of God, than if they had been disputing about the
shadow of an ass, <i>are given up to a reprobate mind,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28.) Yet they will one day feel to their destruction, what veneration is due
to the name of God, which they now treat with such disdainful and outrageous
mockery. It is shocking to relate how haughtily the Papists condemn the plain
and ascertained truth of God, and with what cruelty they shed innocent blood.
Whence, I beseech you, comes that drunken stupidity, but because they do not
recollect that they have anything to do with God ?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jesus gave him no
answer.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We ought not to think it strange
that Jesus makes no reply; at least, if we keep in mind what I have formerly
mentioned, that he did not stand before Pilate to plead his own cause, &#8212;
as is customary with persons accused who are desirous to be acquitted, &#8212;
but rather to suffer condemnation; for it was proper that he should be
condemned, when he appeared in our room. This is the reason why he makes no
defense; and yet Christ&#8217;s silence is not inconsistent with what Paul
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Remember that Christ,
before Pilate, made a good
confession,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Timothy 6:13;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for there he maintained the faith of the Gospel, as
far as was necessary, and his death was nothing else than the sealing of the
doctrine delivered by him. Christ left nothing undone of what was necessary to
make a lawful confession, but he kept silence as to asking an acquittal.
Besides, there was some danger that Pilate would acquit Christ as one of the
pretended gods, as Tiberius wished to rank him among the gods of the Romans.
Justly, therefore, does Christ, by his silence, frown on this foolish
superstition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Knowest thou not that &#163;
have power to crucify thee?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This shows
that the dread with which Pilate had been suddenly seized was transitory, and
had no solid root; for now, forgetting all fear, he breaks out into haughty and
monstrous contempt of God. He threatens Christ, as if there had not been a Judge
in heaven; but this must always happen with irreligious men, that, shaking off
the fear of God, they quickly return to their natural disposition. Hence also we
infer, that it is not without good reason that <i>the heart of man </i>is called
<i>deceitful,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;241709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
17:9;) for, though some fear of God dwells in it, there likewise comes from it
mere impiety. Whoever, then, is not regenerated by the Spirit of God, though he
pretend for a time to reverence the majesty of God, will quickly show, by
opposite facts, that this fear was hypocritical.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again, we see in Pilate an image of a proud man, who
is driven to madness by his ambition; for, when he wishes to exalt his power, he
deprives himself of all praise and reputation for justice. He acknowledges that
Christ is innocent, and therefore he makes himself no better than a robber, when
he boasts that he has power to cut his throat ! Thus, wicked consciences, in
which faith and the true knowledge of God do not reign, must necessarily be
agitated, and there must be within them various feelings of the flesh, which
contend with each other; and in this manner God takes signal vengeance on the
pride of men, when they go beyond their limits, so as to claim for themselves
infinite power. By condemning themselves for injustice, they stamp on themselves
the greatest reproach and disgrace. No blindness, therefore, is greater than
that of pride; and we need not wonder, since pride feels the hand of God,
against which it strikes, to be armed with vengeance. Let us therefore remember,
that we ought not rashly to indulge in foolish boastings, lest we expose
ourselves to ridicule; and especially that those who occupy a high rank ought to
conduct themselves modestly, and not to be ashamed of being subject to God and
to his laws.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou wouldest have no
power.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some explain this in a general
sense, that nothing is done in the world but by the permission of God; as if
Christ had said, that Pilate, though he thinks that he can do all things, will
do nothing more than God permits. The statement is, no doubt, true, that this
world is regulated by the disposal of God, and that, whatever may be the efforts
of wicked men, still they cannot even move a finger but as the secret power of
God directs. But I prefer the opinion of those who confine this passage to the
office of the magistrate; for by these words Christ rebukes the foolish boasting
of Pilate, in extolling himself, as if his power had not been from God; as if he
had said, Thou claimest every thing for thyself&#8217;, as if thou hadst not to
render an account one day to God; but it was not without His providence that
thou wast made a judge. Consider, then, that His heavenly throne is far higher
than thy tribunal. It is impossible to find any admonition better fitted to
repress the insolence of those who rule over others, that they may not abuse
their authority. The father imagines that he may do what he pleases towards his
children, the husband towards his wife, the master towards his servants, the
prince towards his people, unless when they look to God, who hath determined
that their authority shall be limited by a fixed rule.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore he who delivered me to
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some think that this declares the
Jews to be more guilty than Pilate, because, with wicked hatred and malicious
treachery, they are enraged against an innocent man, that is, those of them who
were private individuals, and not clothed with lawful authority. But I think
that this circumstance renders their guilt more heinous and less excusable on
another ground, that they constrain a divinely appointed government to comply
with their lawless desires; for it is a monstrous sacrilege to pervert a holy
ordinance of God for promoting any wickedness. The robber, who, with his own
hand, cuts the throat of a wretched passenger, is justly held in abhorrence; but
he who, under the forms of a judicial trial, puts to death an innocent man, is
much more wicked. Yet Christ does not aggravate their guilt, for the purpose of
extenuating that of Pilate; for he does not institute a comparison between him
and them, but rather includes them all in the same condemnation, because they
equally pollute a holy power. There is only this difference, that he makes ,
direct attack on the Jews, but indirectly censures Pilate, who complies with
their wicked desire.</font><br></div>

</i>does not conduct himself conscientiously, and is actuated more by ambition
than by a regard to justice, and, on that account, is wretchedly irresolute, yet
his modesty is commendable on this ground, that, when he is severely reproved by
Christ, he does not fly into a passion, but, on the contrary, is still more
disposed to release him. He is a judge, and yet he meekly permits the accused
person to be his reprover; and, indeed, scarcely one person in a hundred will be
found, who so mildly suffers a reproof, even from one who is his
equal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art not Caesar&#8217;s
friend.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By threats they prevail on
Pilate to condemn Christ; for they could do nothing that was more hateful, or
more fitted to produce terror, than to hold him suspected of disloyalty to
Caesar. &#8220;Thou showest,&#8221; say they, &#8220;that thou dost not care
about Caesar&#8217;s authority, if thou acquit him who has endeavored to throw
every thing into confusion.&#8221; This wickedness at length broke down the
resolution of Pilate, who, till now, had only been shaken by their furious
clamours. Nor is it without a good reason that the Evangelist so laboriously
examines and details those circumstances; for it is of great importance to us to
know, that Pilate did not condemn Christ, before he had several times acquitted
him with his own mouth, in order that we may learn from it, that it was for our
sins that he was condemned, and not on his own account. We may also learn from
it, how voluntarily he offered himself to die, when he disdained to avail
himself of the favorable disposition of the judge towards him; and, indeed, it
was this obedience that caused his death to be <i>a sacrifice of sweet savour,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
5:2,) for blotting out all sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.

conflicting opinions passed through the mind of Pilate, as if he had been a
stage-player who was acting two characters. He ascends <i>the judgment-seat,
</i>in order to pronounce sentence of death on Christ solemnly, and in the
customary form; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F493</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and yet he declares openly, that he does so reluctantly and against his
conscience. When he calls Christ <i>king, </i>he speaks ironically, meaning that
it was a trivial charge which the Jews brought against him; or rather, for the
purpose of allaying their fury, he warns them, that it would bring disgrace on
the whole nation, if a report were spread abroad, that a person of that nation
had been condemned to die for aspiring to kingly power.</font><br></div>

Judge, may acquit us at the last day.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>About the sixth
hour.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Evangelists appear to differ,
and even to contradict each other, in the computation of time. The other three
Evangelists say that <i>the darkness </i>came on <i>about the sixth hour,
</i>while Christ was hanging on the cross,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402745&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
27:45;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411533&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
15:33;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422344&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke

sentence was pronounced on him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411525&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
15:25.) But this may be easily explained. It is plain enough from other passages
that the day was at that time divided into four parts, as the night also
contained four watches; in consequence of which, the Evangelists sometimes allot
not more than four hours to each day, and extend each hour to three, and, at the
same time, reckon the space of an hour, which was drawing to a close, as
belonging to the next part. According to this calculation, <i>John </i>relates
that Christ was condemned <i>about the sixth hour, </i>because the time of the
day was drawing towards <i>the sixth hour, </i>or towards the second part of the
day. Hence we infer that Christ was crucified at or about <i>the sixth hour;
</i>for, as the Evangelist afterwards mentions,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431920&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
19:20,) <i>the place was near to the city. The darkness </i>began between the
sixth and ninth hour, and lasted till the ninth hour, at which time Christ
died.</font><br></div>

madness, that the priests, who ought to have been well acquainted with the Law,
reject Christ, in whom the salvation of the people was wholly contained, on whom
all the promises depended, and on whom the whole of their religion was founded;
and, indeed, by rejecting Christ, they deprive themselves of the grace of God
and of every blessing. We see, then, what insanity had seized them. Let us
suppose that Jesus Christ was not the Christ; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F494</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
still they have no excuse for acknowledging <i>no other king but Caesar.
</i>For, first, they revolt from the spiritual kingdom of God; and, secondly,
they prefer the tyranny of the Roman Empire, which they greatly abhorred, to a
just government, such as God had promised to them. <i>Thus </i>wicked men, in
order to fly from Christ, not only deprive themselves of eternal life, but draw
down on their heads every kind of miseries. On the other hand, the sole
happiness of the godly is, to be subject to the royal authority of Christ,

did nothing but what had been determined by the hand and purpose of God; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F496</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for God did not surrender his Son to their lawless passions, but determined
that, according to his own will and good pleasure, he should be offered as a
sacrifice. And if there were the best reasons for the purpose of God in all
those things which he determined that his Son should suffer, we ought to
consider, on the one hand, the dreadful weight of his wrath against sin, and, on
the other hand, his infinite goodness towards us. In no other way could our
guilt be removed than by the Son of God becoming a curse for us. We see him
driven out into an accursed place, as if he had been polluted by a mass of all
sorts of crimes, that there he might appear to be accursed before God and men.
Assuredly we are prodigiously stupid, if we do not plainly see in this mirror
with what abhorrence God regards sin; and we are harder than stones, if we do
not tremble at such a judgment as this.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, on the other hand, God declares that our
salvation was so dear to him, that he did not spare his only-begotten Son, what
abundant goodness and what astonishing grace do we here behold! Whoever, then,
takes a just view of the causes of the death of Christ, together with the
advantage which it yields to us, will not, like <i>the Greeks, </i>regard the
doctrlne of <i>the cross as foolishness, </i>nor, like the Jews, will he regard
it as <i>an offense,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:23,) but rather as an invaluable token and pledge of the power,
and wisdom, and righteousness, and goodness of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When John says, that the name of the place was
<i>Golgotha, </i>he means that, in the Chaldaic or Syriac language, it was
called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">atlglg</font><font face="Palatino">,

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Pilate wrote also a
title.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Evangelist relates a
memorable action of Pilate, after having pronounced the sentence. It is perhaps
true that it was customary to affix <i>titles, </i>when malefactors were
executed, that the cause of the punishment might be known to all, and might
serve the purpose of an example. But in Christ there is this extraordinary
circumstance, that the <i>title </i>which is affixed to him implies no disgrace;
for Pilate&#8217;s intention was, to avenge himself indirectly on the Jews,
(who, by their obstinacy, had extorted from him an unjust sentence of death on
an innocent man,) and, in the person of Christ, to throw blame on the whole
nation. Thus he does not brand Christ with the commission of any
crime.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the providence of God, which guided the pen of
Pilate, had a higher object in view. It did not, indeed, occur to Pilate to
celebrate Christ as the Author of salvation, and the Nazarene of <i>God, </i>and
the King of a chosen people; but God dictated to him this commendation of the
Gospel, though he knew not the meaning of what he wrote. It. was the same secret
guidance of the Spirit that caused <i>the title </i>to be published in three
languages; for it is not probable that this was an ordinary practice, but the
Lord showed, by this preparatory arrangement, that the time was now at hand,
when the name of his Son should be made known throughout the whole
earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The chief priests of the Jews
said therefore to Pilate.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They feel that
they are sharply rebuked; and, therefore, they would wish that <i>the title
</i>were changed, so as not to involve the nation in disgrace, but to throw the
whole blame on Christ. But yet they do not conceal their deep hatred of the
truth, since the smallest spark of it is more than they are able to endure. Thus
Satan always prompts his servants to endeavor to extinguish, or, at least, to
choke, by their own darkness, the light of God, as soon as the feeblest ray of
it appears.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What I have written I
have written.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Pilate&#8217;s firmness
must be ascribed to the providence of God; for there can be no doubt that they
attempted, in various ways, to change his resolution. Let us know, therefore,
that he was held by a Divine hand, so that he remained unmoved. Pilate did not
yield to the prayers of the priests, and did not allow himself to be corrupted
by them; but God testified, by his mouth, the firmness and stability of the
kingdom of his Son. And if, in the writing of Pilate, the kingdom of Christ was
shown to be so firm that it could not be shaken by all the attacks of its
enemies, what value ought we to attach to the testimonies of the Prophets, whose
tongues and hands God consecrated to his service?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The example of <i>Pilate </i>reminds us, also, that
it is our duty to remain steady in defending the truth. A heathen refuses to
retract what he has justly and properly written concerning Christ, though he did
not understand or consider what he was doing. How great, then, will be our
dishonor, if, terrified by threatenigs or dangers, we withdraw from the
profession of his doctrine, which God hath sealed on our hearts by his Spirit!
Besides, it ought to be observed how detestable is the tyranny of the Papists,
which prohibits the reading of the Gospel, and of the whole of the Scripture, by
the common people. Pilate, though he was a reprobate man, and, in other
respects, an instrument of Satan, was nevertheless, by a secret guidance,
appointed to be a herald of the Gospel, that he might publish a short summary of
it in three languages. What rank, therefore, shall we assign to those who do all
that they can to suppress the knowledge of it, since they show that they are
worse than Pilate?</font><br></div>

his <i>garments, </i>except <i>the coat, </i>which, being <i>without seam
</i>could not be divided, and therefore <i>they cast lots </i>on it. To fix our
minds on the contemplation of the purpose of God, the Evangelists remind us
that, in this occurrence also, there was a fulfillment of Scripture. It may be
thought, however, that the passage, which they quote from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;192219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
22:19, is inappropriately applied to the subject in hand; for, though David
complains in it that he was exposed as a prey to his enemies, he makes use of
the word <i>garments </i>to denote metaphorically all his property; as if he had
said, in a single word, that &#8220;he had been stripped naked and bare by
wicked men;&#8221; and, when the Evangelists disregard the figure, they depart
from the natural meaning of the passage. But we ought to remember, in the first
place, that the psalm ought not to be restricted to David, as is evident from
many parts of it, and especially from a clause in which it is written, <i>I will
proclaim thy name among the Gentiles,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;192222&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
22:22)<i> </i>which must be explained as referring to Christ. We need not
wonder, therefore, if that which was faintly shadowed out in David is beheld in
Christ with all that superior clearness which the truth ought to have, as
compared with the figurative representation of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us also learn that. Christ was stripped of his
<i>garments, </i>that he might clothe us with righteousness; that his naked body
was exposed to the insults of men, that we may appear in glory before the
judgment-seat of God. As to the allegorical meaning to which some men have
tortured this passage, by making it mean, that heretics tear Scripture in
pieces, it is too far-fetched; though I would not object to such a comparison as
this, &#8212;that, as the <i>garments </i>of Christ were once divided by ungodly
<i>soldiers, </i>so, in the present day, there are perverse men who, by foreign
inventions, tear the whole of the Scripture, with which Christ is clothed, in
order that he may be manifested to us. But the wickedness of the Papists,
accompanied by shocking blasphemy against God, is intolerable. They tell us,
that Scripture is torn to pieces by heretics, but that <i>the coat &#8212; that
</i>is, the Church &#8212; remains entire; and thus they endeavor to prove that,
without paying any attention to the authority of Scripture, the unity of faith
consists in the mere title of the Church; as if the unity of the Church were
itself founded on any thing else than the authority of Scripture. When,
therefore, they separate faith from Scripture, so that it may continue to be
attached to the Church alone, by such a divorce they not only strip Christ of
his <i>garments, </i>but tear in pieces his body by shocking sacrilege. And
though we should admit what they maintain, that <i>the coat without seam </i>is
a figure of the Church, they will be very far from gaining their point: for it
will still remain to be proved, that the Church is placed under their authority,
of which they show no sign whatever.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now there stood by the cross
of Jesus.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Evangelist here mentions
incidentally, that while Christ obeyed God the Father, he did not fail to
perform the duty which he owed, as a son, towards <i>his mother. </i>True, he
forgot himself, and he forgot every thing, so far as was necessary for the
discharge of obedience to his Father, but, after having performed that duty, he
did not neglect what he owed to <i>his mother. </i>Hence we learn in what manner
we ought to discharge our duty towards God and towards men. It often happens
that, when God calls us to the performance of any thing, our parents, or wife,
or children, draw us in a contrary direction, so that we cannot give equal
satisfaction to all. If we place men in the same rank with God, we judge amiss.
We must, therefore, give the preference to the command, the worship, and the
service of God; after which, as far as we are able, we must give to men what is
their due.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And yet the commands of the first and second table of
the Law never jar with each other, though at first sight they appear to do so;
but we must begin with the worship of God, and afterwards assign to men an
inferior place. Such is the import of the following statements:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">He who loveth father or
mother more than me, is not worthy of me,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401041&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
10:41;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">If any one hate not his
father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, he cannot
be my

14:26.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought, therefore, to devote ourselves to the
interests of men, so as not in any degree to interfere with the worship and
obedience which we owe to God. When we have obeyed God, it will then be the
proper time to think about parents, and wife, and children; as Christ attends to
<i>his mother, </i>but it is after that he is on the cross, to which he has been
called by his Father&#8217;s decree.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet, if we attend to the time and place when these
things happened, Christ&#8217;s affection for <i>his mother </i>was worthy of
admiration. I say nothing about the severe tortures of his body; I say nothing
about the reproaches which he suffered; but, though horrible blasphemies against
God filled his mind with inconceivable grief, and though he sustained a dreadful
contest with eternal death and with the devil, still, none of these things
prevent him from being anxious about <i>his mother. </i>We may also learn from
this passage, what is the honor which God, by the Law, commands us to render to
parents,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;022012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:12.) Christ appoints <i>the disciple </i>to be his substitute, and charges
him to support and take care of <i>his mother; </i>and hence it follows, that
the honor which is due to parents consists, not in cold ceremony, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F500</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but in the discharge of all necessary duties.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the other hand, we ought to consider the faith of
those holy women 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F501</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is true that, in following Christ to the cross, they displayed more than
ordinary affection; but, if they had not been supported by faith they could
never have been present at this exhibition. As to John himself, we infer that,
though his faith was choked for a short time, it was not wholly extinguished.
How shameful will it be, if the dread of the cross deters us from following
Christ, when the glory of his resurrection is placed before our eyes, whereas
the women beheld in it nothing but disgrace and cursing!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mary of Cleophas, and Mary

Christ.</font><br></div>

</i>As if he had said, &#8220;Henceforth I shall not be an inhabitant of the
earth, so as to have it in my power to discharge to thee the duties of a <i>son;
</i>and, therefore, I put this man in my room, that he may perform my
office.&#8221; The same thing is meant, when he says to John,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold thy mother
!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For by these words he charges him to
treat her as a <i>mother, </i>and to take as much care of her as if she had been
his own <i>mother.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In refraining from mentioning his <i>mother&#8217;s
</i>name and in simply calling her <i>Woman ! </i>some think that he did so, in
order not to pierce her heart with a deeper wound. I do not object to this view;
but there is another conjecture which is equally probable, that Christ intended
to show that, after having completed the course of human life, he lays down the
condition in which he had lived, and enters into the heavenly kingdom, where he
will exercise dominion over angels and men; for we know that Christ was always
accustomed to guard believers against looking at the flesh, and it was
especially necessary that this should be done at his death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The disciple took her to his

John could not have exercised hospitality towards the mother of Christ, or have
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>taken her to his own
home</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>if he had not had a house and a
regular way of living. Those men, therefore, are fools, who think that the
Apostles relinquished their property, and came to Christ naked and empty; but
they are worse than fools, who make perfection to consist in
beggary.</font><br></div>

purposely passes by many things which are related by the other three
Evangelists. He now describes the last act, which was an event of the greatest
importance.When John says that <i>a vessel was placed there, </i>he speaks of it
as a thing that was customary. There has been much controversy on this subject;
but I agree with those who think (and, indeed, the custom is proved by
histories) that it was a kind of beverage usually administered for the purpose
of accelerating the death of wretched malefactors, when they had undergone
sufficient torture 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F505</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now, it ought to be remarked, that Christ does not ask any thing to <i>drink
</i>till <i>all things have been accomplished; </i>and thus he testified his
infinite love towards us, and the inconceivable earnestness of his desire to
promote our salvation. No words can fully express the bitterness of the sorrows
which he endured; and yet he does not desire to be freed from them, till the
justice of God has been satisfied, and till he has made a perfect atonement 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F506</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But how does he say, that all things were
accomplished, while the most important part still remained to be performed, that
is, his death? Besides, does not his resurrection contribute to the
<i>accomplishment </i>of our salvation? I answer, John includes those things
which were immediately to follow. Christ had not yet died: and had not yet risen
again; but he saw that nothing now remained to hinder him from going forward to
death and resurrection. In this manner he instructs us, by his own example, to
render perfect obedience, that we may not think it hard to live according to his
good pleasure, even though we must languish in the midst of the most
excruciating pains.</font><br></div>

David means by it, not only that they refused to him the assistance which he
needed, but that they cruelly aggravated his distresses. But there is no
inconsistency in saying that what had been dimly shadowed out in David was more
clearly exhibited in Christ: for thus we are enabled more fully to perceive the
difference between truth and figures, when those things which David suffered,
only in a figurative manner, are distinctly and perfectly manifested in Christ.
To show that he was the person whom David represented, Christ chose to drink

faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I

are more desirous to be thought ingenious than to promote true edification; and,

that the whole accomplishment of our salvation, and all the parts of it, are
contained in his death. We have already stated that his resurrection is not
separated from his death, but Christ only intends to keep our faith fixed on
himself alone, and not to allow it to turn aside in any direction whatever. The
meaning, therefore, is, that every thing which contributes to the salvation of
men is to be found in Christ, and ought not to be sought anywhere else; or
&#8212; which amounts to the same thing &#8212; that the perfection of salvation
is contained in him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is also an implied contrast; for Christ
contrasts his death with the ancient sacrifices and with all the figures; as if
he had said,&#8221; Of all that was practiced under the <i>Law, </i>there was
nothing that had any power in itself to make atonement for sins, to appease the
wrath of God, and to obtain justification; but now the true salvation is
exhibited and manifested to the world.&#8221; On this doctrine depends the
abolition of all the ceremonies of the Law; for it would be absurd to follow
shadows, since we have the body in Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If we give our assent to this word which Christ
pronounced, we ought to be satisfied with his death alone for salvation, and we
are not at liberty to apply for assistance in any other quarter; for he who was
sent by the Heavenly Father to obtain for us a full acquittal, and to accomplish
our redemption, knew well what belonged to his office, and did not fail in what
he knew to be demanded of him. It was chiefly for the purpose of giving peace
and tranquillity to our consciences that he pronounced this word, <i>It is
finished. </i>Let us stop here, therefore, if we do not choose to be deprived of
the salvation which he has procured for us 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F511</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the whole religion of Popery tends to lead men to
contrive for themselves innumerable methods of seeking salvation; and hence we
infer, that it is full to overflowing with abominable sacrileges. More
especially, this word of Christ condemns the abomination of the Mass. All the
sacrifices of the Law must have ceased, for the salvation of men has been
completed by the one sacrifice of the death of Christ. What right, then, have
the Papists, or what plausible excuse can they assign for saying, that they are
authorised to prepare a new sacrifice, to reconcile God to men? They reply that
it is not a new sacrifice, but the very sacrifice which Christ offered. But this
is easily refuted; for, in the first place, they have no command to offer it;
and, secondly, Christ, having once accomplished, by a single oblation, all that
was necessary to be done, declares, from the cross, that all <i>is finished.
</i>They are worse than forgers, therefore, for they wickedly corrupt and
falsify the testament sealed by the precious blood of the Son of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He yielded up his
breath.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>All the Evangelists take great
care to mention the death of Christ, and most properly; for we obtain from it
our confident hope of life, and we likewise obtain from it a fearless triumph
over death, because the Son of God has endured it in our room, and, in his
contest with it, has been victorious. But we must attend to the phraseology
which John employs, and which teaches us, that all believers, who die with
Christ, peacefully commit their souls to the guardianship of God, who is
faithful, and will not suffer to perish what he hath undertaken to preserve. The
children of God, as well as the reprobate, die; but there is this difference
between them, that the reprobate give up the soul, without knowing where it
goes, or what becomes of it; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F512</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
while the children of God commit it, as a precious trust, to the protection of
God, who will faithfully guard it till the day of the resurrection. The word
<i>breath </i>is manifestly used here to denote the immortal
soul.</font><br></div>

because it contains a mystery of no ordinary value. The Evangelist says, that

crosses. This had undoubtedly been enjoined by the Law of God; but the Jews, as
is usually the case with hypocrites, direct their whole attention to small
matters, and yet pass by the greatest crimes without any hesitation; for, in
order to a strict observance of their Sabbath, they are careful to avoid outward
pollution; and yet they do not consider how shocking a crime it is to take away

word <i>Sabbath </i>must be understood to denote <i>the week; </i>as if the
Evangelist had said, that the festival of that week was very solemn, on account
of the Passover. Note, the Evangelist speaks of the following day, which began
at sunset. But, if we choose rather to read

say that it happens naturally that one man dies sooner than another; but, if we
examine carefully the whole course of the narrative, we shall be constrained to
ascribe it to the secret purpose of God, that the death of Christ was brought on
much more rapidly than men could have at all expected, and that this prevented

of the saints. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F516</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Since their prayers, whenever they call on God, rest on such intercessors, what,
I ask, will they ever be able to obtain? But they who despise Christ, and seek
the intercessions of the dead, deserve that the devil should drive them to
ghosts and phantoms.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And immediately there came out
blood and water.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some men have deceived
themselves by imagining that this was a miracle; for it is natural that the
<i>blood, </i>when it is congealed, should lose its red color, and come to
resemble <i>water. </i>It is well known also that water is contained in the
membrane which immediately adjoins the intestines. What has led them astray is,
that the Evangelist takes so much pains to explain that <i>blood </i>flowed
along with the <i>water, </i>as if he were relating something unusual and
contrary to the order of nature. But he had quite a different intention; namely,
to accommodate his narrative to the passages of Scripture which he immediately
subjoins, and more especially that believers might infer from it what he states
elsewhere, that Christ <i>came with water and blood,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 5:6.) By these words he means that Christ brought the true atonement and
the true washing; for, on the one hand, forgiveness of sins and justification,
and, on the other hand, the sanctification of the soul, were prefigured in the
Law by those two symbols, <i>sacrifices </i>and <i>washings. </i>In
<i>sacrifices, </i>blood atoned for sins, and was the ransom for appeasing the
wrath of God. <i>Washings </i>were the tokens of true holiness, and the remedies
for taking away uncleanness and removing the pollutions of the
flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That faith may no longer rest on these elements, John
declares that the fulfillment of both of these graces is in Christ; and here he
presents to us a visible token of the same fact. The sacraments which Christ has
left to his Church have the same design; for the purification and sanctification
of the soul, which consists in <i>newness of life,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:4,) is pointed out to us in Baptism, and the Lord&#8217;s Supper is the pledge
of a perfect atonement. But they differ widely from the ancient figures of the
Law; for they exhibit Christ as being present, whereas the figures of the Law
pointed out that he was still at a distance. For this reason I do not object to
what Augustine says, that our sacraments have flowed from Christ&#8217;s side;
for, when Baptism and the Lord&#8217;s Supper lead us to Christ&#8217;s side,
that by faith we may draw from it, as from a fbuntain, what they represent, then
are we truly washed from our pollutions, and renewed to a holy life, and then do
we truly live before God, redeemed from death, and delivered from
condemnation.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;040912&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
9:12, where Moses treats of the paschal lamb. Note, Moses takes for granted that
that lamb was a figure of the true and only sacrifice, by which the Church was
to be redeemed. Nor is this inconsistent with the fact, that it was sacrificed
as the memorial of a redemption which had been already made; for, while God
intended that it should celebrate the former favor, he also intended that it
should exhibit the spiritual deliverance of the Church, which was still future.
On that account Paul, without any hesitation, applies to Christ the rule which
Moses lays down about eating the lamb:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">for even Christ, our Passover, is sacred
for us. Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with, the

<div><font face="Palatino">From this analogy, or resemblance,faith derives no
ordinary advantage, for, in all the ceremonies of the Law, it beholds the
salvation which has been manifested in Christ. Such is also the design of the
Evangelist John, when he says that Christ was not only the pledge of our
redemption, but also the price of it, because in him we see accomplished what
was formerly exhibited to the ancient people under the figure of the passover.
Thus also the Jews are reminded that they ought to seek in Christ the substance
of all those things which the Law prefigured, but did not actually
accomplish.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>37.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall look on him whom
they pierced.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage is violently
tortured by those who endeavor to explain it literally as referring to Christ.
Nor is this the purpose for which the;Evangelist quotes ib but rather to show
that Christ is that God who formerly complained, by Zechariah, that the Jews had
<i>pierced </i>his heart,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;381210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Zechariah
12:10) Now, God speaks there after the manner of men, declaring that He is
wounded by the sins of his people, and especially by their obstinate contempt of
his word, in the same manner as a mortal man receives a deadly wound, when his
heart is <i>pierced; </i>as he says, elsewhere, that <i>his Spirit was deeply
grieved,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F517</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now, as Christ is <i>God manifested in the flesh
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:16,) John says that in his visible flesh was plainly accomplished what
his Divine Majesty had endured from the Jews, so far as it was capable of
enduring; not that God can be at all affected by the outrages of men, or that
the reproaches which are cast at him from the earth ever reach him, but because
by this mode of expression he intended to declare with what enormous sacrilege
the wickedness of men is chargeable, when it rises in rebellion against heaven.
What was done by the hand of a Roman soldier the ]Evangelist John justly imputes
to the Jews; as they are elsewhere said <i>to have crucified the Son of God,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440236&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

<div><font face="Palatino">A question now arises as to this passage taken from
the prophet, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F518</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Does God promise to the Jews repentance to salvation, or, does he threaten that
he will come as an avenger? For my own part, when I closely examine the passage,
I think that it includes both; namely, that out of a worthless and unprincipled
nation God will gather a remnant for salvation, and that, by his dreadful
vengeance, he will show to despisers who it is with whom they have to do; for we
know that they were wont to treat the prophets as insolently as if the prophets
had told nothing but fables, and had received no commission from God. God
declares that they will not pass unpunished, for he will at length maintain his
cause.</font><br></div>

what place, and with what magnificence, Christ was buried. He mentions two
persons who buried Christ; namely, <i>Joseph </i>and <i>Nicodemus, </i>the
former of whom requested Pilate to give him the dead body, which otherwise would
have been exposed to the lawless violence of the soldiers. Matthew
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402757&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

23:50) says, that he was <i>a counsellor; </i>that is, he held the rank of a
senator. As to <i>Nicodemus, </i>we have seen, in the Third Chapter of this
Gospel, that he held an honorable rank among his own countrymen; and that he was
also <i>rich, </i>may be easily inferred from the great expense which he laid
out in procuring this <i>mixture.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Till now, therefore, <i>riches </i>had prevented them
from professing to be the disciples of Christ, and might afterwards have no less
influence in keeping them from making a profession so much hated and abhorred.
The Evangelist expressly says, that <i>Joseph </i>has formerly been kept back by
this <i>fear </i>from venturing to declare openly that he was <i>a disciple
</i>of Christ; and as to <i>Nicodemus, </i>he repeats what we have already seen,
that he came to Jesus secretly, and <i>by night,

affairs are at the lowest ebb, they fearlessly come forth to public view? I say
nothing of the great and evident danger which they must have incurred; but the
most important point is, that they did not scruple to place themselves in a
state of perpetual warfare with their own nation. It is therefore certain that
this was effected by a heavenly impulse, so that they who, <i>through, fear,
</i>did not render the honor due to him while he was alive, now run to his dead
body, as if they had become new men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They bring their spices to embalm the body of Christ;
but they would never have done so, if they had been perfumed with the sweet
sayour of his death. This shows the truth of what Christ had
said,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">For here we have a striking proof that his death was
more quickening than his life; and so great was the efficacy of that sweet
sayour which the death of Christ conveyed to the minds of those two men, that it
quickly extinguished all the passions belonging to the flesh. So long as
ambition and the love of money reigned in thenb the grace of Christ had no
charms for them; but now they begin to disrelish the whole
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, let us learn that their example points out
to us what we owe to Christ. Those two men, as a testimony of their faith, not
only took down Christ from the cross with great hazard, but boldly carried him
to the grave. Our slothfulness will be base and shameful if, now that he reigns
in the heavenly glory, we withhold from him the confession of our faith. So much
the less excusable is the wickedness of those who, though they now deny Christ
by base hypocrisy, plead in his behalf the example of Nicodemus. In one thing, I
admit, they resemble him, that they endeavor, as far as lies in their power, to
bury Christ; but the time for burying is past, since he hath ascended to the
right hand of the Father, that he may reign gloriously over angels and men, and
that every tongue may proclaim his dominion,

the holy boldness which the Spirit of the Lord wrought in the heart of
<i>Joseph, </i>there is reason to believe that it was not free from blame. Not
that all fear, by which believers guard against tyrants and enemies of the
Church, is faulty, but because the weakness of faith is manifested, whenever the
confession of faith is withheld <i>through fear. </i>We ought always to consider
what the Lord commands, and how far he bids us advance. He who stops in the
middle of the course shows that he does not trust in God, and he who sets a
higher value on his own life than on the command of God is without
excuse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who was a disciple of

Evangelist bestows on <i>Joseph </i>the honorable designation of <i>a disciple,
</i>at a time when he was excessively timid, and did not venture to profess his
faith before the world, we learn from it how graciously God acts towards his
people, and with what fatherly kindness he forgives their offenses. And yet the
false <i>Nicodemites </i>have no right to flatter themselves, who not only keep
their faith concealed within their own breast, but, by pretending to give their
consent to wicked superstitions, do all that is in their power to deny that they
are <i>disciples </i>of Christ.</font><br></div>

ignominy on the cross, God determined that his burial should be honourable, that
it might serve as a preparation for the glory of his resurrection. The money
expended on it by <i>Nicodemus </i>and <i>Joseph </i>is very great, and may be
thought by some to be superfluous; but we ought to consider the design of God,
who even led them, by his Spirit, to render this honor to his own Son, that, by
the sweet savor of his grave he might take away our dread of the cross. But
those things which are cut of the ordinary course ought not to be regarded as an
example.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, the Evangelist expressly states that he was
buried according to <i>the custom of the Jews. </i>By these words he informs us
that this was one of the ceremonies of the Law; for the ancient people, who did
not receive so clear a statement of the resurrection, and who had not such a
demonstration and pledge of it as we have in Christ, needed such aids to support
them, that they might firmly believe and expect the coming of the Mediator

We ought, therefore, to attend to the distinction between us, who have been
enlightened by the brightness of the Gospel, and the rather, to whom the figures
supplied the absence of Christ. This is the reason why allowance could then be
made for a greater pomp of ceremonies, which, at the present <i>day, </i>would
not be free from blame; for those who now bury the dead at so great an expense
do not, strictly speaking, bury dead men, but rather, as far as lies in their
power, draw down from heaven Christ himself, the King of life, and lay him in
the tomb, for his glorious resurrection 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F520</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
abolished those ancient ceremonies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Among the heathen, too, there was great anxiety and
ceremony in burying the dead, which unquestionably derived its origin from the
ancient Fathers of the Jews, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F521</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in the same manner as sacrifices; but, as no hope of the resurrection existed
along them, they were not imitators of the Fathers, but apes of them; for the
promise and word of God is, as it were, the soul, which gives life to
ceremonies. Take away the word, and all the ceremonies which men observe, though
outwardly they may resemble the worship of godly persons, is nothing else than
foolish or mad superstition. For our part, as we have said, we ought now to
maintain sobriety and moderation in this matter, for immoderate expense quenches
the sweet savour of Christ&#8217;s resurrection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>41.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now, in the place where he
was crucified there was a garden.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This
is the <i>third </i>point, as I have said, which ought to be observed in the
history of the burial. It is related by the Evangelist for various reasons. In
the first place, it did not happen by accident, but by an undoubted providence
of God, that the body of Christ was buried <i>in a new sepulchre; </i>for
although he died as all other men die, still, as he was to be <i>the first-born
from the dead,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:18,) and <i>the first-fruits of them that rise,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:20) he had a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>new
sepulcher, in which no person had ever been
laid</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>True, <i>Nicodemus </i>and
<i>Joseph </i>had a different object in view; for, in consequence of the short
time that now remained till sunset, which was the commencement of the Sabbath,
they looked to the convenience of the place, but, contrary to their intention
God provided for his own Son <i>a sepulchre </i>which had not yet been used. The
good men are merely gratified by <i>the place being near at hand, </i>that they
might not violate the Sabbath; but God offers them what they did not seek, that
the burial of his Son might have some token to distinguish him from the rank of
other men. The local situation served also to prove the truth of his
resurrection, and to throw no small light on the narrative which is contained in
the following chapter.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now, on the first day of
the week.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the resurrection of Christ
is the most important article of our faith, and without it the hope of eternal
life is extinguished, for this reason the Evangelists are the more careful to
prove it, as John here collects many proofs, in order to assure us that Christ
is risen from the dead. It may be thought strange, however, that he does not
produce more competent witnesses; for he begins with a woman; but thus the
saying is fulfilled, that</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">God chooseth what is weak, and foolish,
and contemptible in the world, that he may bring to nought the wisdom, and
excellence, and glory, of the flesh,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460127&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 1:27.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There certainly was nothing more of earthly grandeur
in the disciples than in the women who followed Christ; but as Christ was
pleased to reckon them the principal witnesses of his resurrection, on this
single ground their testimony is entitled to the greatest deference, and is not
liable to any objection. As to the priests ,and scribes, and the whole people,
and even Pilate, nothing but gross and wilful blindness prevented them from
firmly believing that Christ was risen. All of them, therefore, deserved that
<i>seeing they should not see; </i>yet Christ revealed himself to the little
flock.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Before proceeding farther, however, it is necessary
to show how the Evangelists agree with each other; for, at first sight, there
appears to be some contradiction in their words. John mentions but one woman,
<i>Mary Magdalene;
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402801&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
28:1 mentions two, <i>Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary;
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:1 mentions three, <i>Mary Magdalene, and Mary </i>(the mother) <i>of James,
and Salome;
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
24:10, 22 does not fix the number, but only relates that <i>women came, </i>who
had followed Christ from Galilee. But the difficulty is easily solved in this
manner. As Matthew inserts the names of two women who were best known, and had
the highest reputation among the disciples, so John satisfies himself with
mentioning the name of <i>Mary</i> <i>Magdalene </i>alone, but yet does not
exclude the others; and, indeed, it is evident, from viewing his words in their
connection, that she was not alone, for, shortly afterwards, <i>Mary Magdalene
</i>says, in the plural number, WE <i>know not where they have laid him.
</i>Although, therefore, John says nothing about her companions, yet the other
Evangelists, who relate that there were many along with her, say nothing that is
contradicted by John&#8217;s narrative.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The discrepancy as to the <i>time </i>may be easily
solved. When John says that they came before daybreak, we must understand, that
they had set out on their journey during the darkness of the night; that, before
they came to the sepulcher, the day had dawned; and that in the evening, after
sunset, when the Sabbath was ended, they had bought the spices; and thus the
narrative of the other Evangelists must be reconciled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be thought that there is another appearance of
contradiction in its being stated by John, that <i>Mary </i>spoke to none but
himself and <i>Peter, </i>while
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
24:10, 11 relates, that she came to the eleven Apostles, and that <i>her words
appeared to them to be idle tales. </i>But this is easily explained, for John
intentionally passed by the rest of the Apostles, because it was only himself
and <i>Peter </i>that came to the sepulcher. As to Luke mentioning Peter alone,
it is for the same reason as we have just now assigned in reference <i>to Mary
Megdalene </i>and the rest of the women. It is also probable, that the other
nine disciples were restrained by fear, lest they should be too easily observed
if they went in a body. Nor is this inconsistent with what Luke appears to
suggest, that they despised Mary&#8217;s words; for immediately afterwards he
adds, that <i>Peter ran,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
24:12.) He therefore means simply that, when they first heard it, they appeared
to be astonished, but that at length <i>Peter </i>took courage, and followed her
for the purpose of seeing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When Luke relates that Christ appeared to Mary before
that she had informed the disciples that the grave was empty, the order of the
narrative is inverted. This is evident from the context, for he adds what, John
tells us, happened before she saw Jesus; nor is there any thing strange in this,
for the Hebrew writers frequently relate first what is later in the order of
time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On the first day of the
week;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or, literally, on
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the first day of the
Sabbaths</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Evangelists do not relate
when or how Christ rose; for it was enough for them to explain at what time, and
to what persons, his resurrection was made known. John therefore says, that Mary
came on <i>the first day of the Sabbaths. </i>Literally, the words may be
rendered, <i>on </i>ONE<i>
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mia~|</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
day of the Sabbaths; </i>but it is customary with the Hebrews to use the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dha</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ehad</i>)<i> one, </i>instead <i>of first,</i> because in reckoning we begin
with <i>one. </i>Now as every seventh day was dedicated to <i>rest, </i>they
called the whole week a <i>Sabbath </i>conferring this honor on the sacredness
of the day, that the rest of the time was named from it. The women, therefore,
came to the sepulcher on the day after the Sabbath, having on the same day (but
after sunset) <i>bought spices; </i>and afterwards went out of the city
secretly, and during the darkness of the night, as people are wont to do when
they are afraid. Now, it was <i>the first day of the Sabbaths, </i>with respect
to the following <i>Sabbath, </i>because it was the commencement of the week, of
which <i>the Sabbath </i>was the close.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Peter therefore went forth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There being
so little faith, or rather almost no faith, both in the disciples and in the
women, it is astonishing that they had so great zeal; and, indeed, it is not
possible that religious feelings led them to seek Christ. Some seed of faith,
therefore, remained in their hearts, but quenched for a time, so that they were
not aware of having what they had. Thus the Spirit of God often works in the
elect in a secret manner. In short, we must believe that there was some
concealed root, from which we see fruit produced. Though this feeling of piety,
which they possessed, was confused, and was accompanied by much superstition,
still I give to it &#8212; though inaccurately &#8212; the name of <i>faith,
</i>because it was only by the doctrine of the Gospel that it was produced, and
it had no tendency but towards Christ. From this seed there at length sprang a
true and sincere <i>faith, </i>which, leaving the sepulcher, ascended to the
heavenly glory of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When Scripture speaks of the feeble beginnings of
faith, it says that Christ is born in us, and that we, on the other hand, are
born in him; but the disciples must be placed almost below infancy, for they are
ignorant of the resurrection of Christ, but yet the Lord nourishes them as a
mother nourishes the child that is contained in her womb. Formerly they
resembled children, and had made a little progress, but the death of Christ had
rendered them so weak, that they must be again begotten <i>and formed, </i>as
Paul says of the Galatians,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><i>My</i> <i>little
children, of whom </i>I TRAVAIL IN BIRTH <i>again until </i>CHRIST BE FORMED

</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480419&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians
4:19.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When we find that Peter, though he made less haste,
is the first to enter into the sepulcher, let us learn from it that many persons
have more given to them in the end than appears at the beginning. And, indeed,
we sometimes see many, who were full of fervour at the commencement, give way
when they come to the conflict; while others, who appeared to be slow and
indolent, assume new courage when danger is at hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And seeth the linen
clothes lying.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> The linen clothes </i>might
be regarded as the spoils, intended to lead to the belief of Christ&#8217;s
resurrection; for it was not probable that his body had been stripped naked, ill
order that it might be removed to another place. This would not have been done
by a friend, nor even by an enemy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the napkin which was
about his head.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When the Evangelist
says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
napkin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>was wrapped
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>about his
head</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>this refutes the falsehood of the
Papists, who pretend that the whole body was sewed up in one linen garment,
which they hold out to the wretched populace, calling it &#8220;the holy
winding-sheet.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F523</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I say nothing about their gross ignorance of the Latin language, which led them
to suppose that the word <i>napkin &#8212; denoting </i>what was used for wiping
the sweat from the face, such as <i>a handkerchief</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F524</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>&#8212; signified </i>a covering for the whole body; nor do I say any thing
about their impudence in boasting that they have this very <i>napkin </i>in five
or six different places. But this gross falsehood is intolerable, because it
openly contradicts the evangelical history. To this is added a fabulous miracle,
which they have contrived, to this effect, that the likeness of Christ&#8217;s
body continued to be visible in the linen cloth. I appeal to you, if such a
miracle had been wrought, would nothing have been said about it by the
Evangelist, who is so careful to relate events which were not of so great
importance? Let us be satisfied with this simple view of the matter, that
Christ, by laying aside the tokens of death, intended to testify that he had
clothed himself with a blessed and immortal life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he saw and
believed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is a poor exposition which
some give of these words, that John
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>believed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>what he had heard Mary say, namely, that Christ&#8217;s body had been
carried away; for there is no passage in which the word <i>believe </i>bears
this meaning, especially when it is used simply and without any addition. Nor is
this inconsistent with the fact, that <i>Peter and John </i>return home, while
they are still in doubt and perplexity; for in some passages John had employed
this phraseology, when lie intended to describe the increase of faith. Besides,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
24:12 relates that <i>Peter wondered </i>at seeing the sepulcher :in such good
order; meaning by this, that Peter thought of something greater and loftier than
what Mary had told him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For as yet they knew not
the scripture, that he must rise again from the
dead.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They had often heard from the
mouth of Christ what they now saw with their wes, but this flowed from their
hearts. Being now warned by the sight of a strange spectacle, they begin to
think of Christ as having something Divine, though they are still far from
having a clear and accurate knowledge of him. John, therefore, accuses himself,
when he acknowledges that the first time that he <i>believed </i>was, when he
beheld the proofs of Christ&#8217;s resurrection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, he represents more strongly his own guilt
and that of his brethren<i>, </i>by adding, that they not only had forgotten the
words of Christ, but that they did not believe <i>the Scriptures</i>; for to
this ignorance lie ascribes the deficiency<i> </i>of their faith. Hence, too, we
may draw a useful instruction, that we ought, to ascribe it to our carelessness,
when we are ignorant of what we ought to know about Christ, because we have not
profited as we ought to have done by <i>the Scriptures, </i>which clearly reveal
the excellence of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Not to go farther for an instance of this, it may be
thought that the resurrection of Christ is taught in them obscurely, and only
under figures; but the attentive reader will find abundantly clear testimonies.
Paul proves
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441334&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:34) that Christ must have risen from the dead, because God declares by the
prophet Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
55:3) that, under his reign, <i>the mercy promised to David would be sure.
</i>An unskilful person might imagine that what Paul quotes is not at all to the
purpose; but they who believe the principles of fkith, and are well acquainted
with <i>the Scriptures, </i>have no difficulty in perceiving the force of this
argument; for, in order theft Christ may secure to us for ever the grace of God,
Christ himself; must live for ever.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are many passages of the same kind, which it is
not, now necessary to collect. Let us therefore rest satisfied with the three
following. It is written,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Thou wilt not permit thy
Holy One to see
corruption,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;191610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
16:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Peter and Paul explain this prediction as referring
to Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440227&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:27, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441335&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:35,)and justly; for there is not one of all the sons of Adam who is not of
himself liable to corruption. Consequently, the immortality of Christ is there
declared. It is likewise beyond all doubt that the following passage refers to
Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The Lord said to my Lord,
Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
110:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, death will not be destroyed till the last day.
The kingdom is titan given to Christ till the end of the world, and this kingdom
cannot exist without his life. But Isaiah speaks more clearly than all the rest
when, after having foretold the death of Christ, he immediately adds, that <i>it
impossible to declare his age,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
53:8.) In short we ought to believe that the doctrine of Scripture is so full
and complete in every respect that whatever is defective in our faith ought
justly to be attributed to ignorance of <i>the Scriptures.</i></font><br></div>

faith could not be produced merely by the sight which they had beheld. Besides,
Christ did not present himself to their view, until they had been more fully
awakened from their carnal stupidity. They had indeed given a praise worthy
demonstration of their zeal, in hastening to the sepulcher; yet Christ hid
himself from them, because they sought him with too great

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
28:3 compares the countenance of the angel, who conversed with the women, to
<i>lightning. </i>And yet it is possible that their fear arose solely from their
minds being struck with admiration, for it appears that <i>they </i>stood
astonished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again, whenever we read that the <i>angels
</i>appeared in the visible form of men and clothed with <i>garments, </i>this
was done on account of the ignorance of men. For my part, I have no doubt that
they sometimes were clothed with real bodies; but whether or not those <i>two
angels </i>had merely the appearance of bodies, would be a useless inquiry, and
I shall therefore leave it undetermined. To me it is enough that the Lord gave
them a human shape, that the women might see and hear them, while the
magnificent and uncommon dress which they wore distinguished them from the
ordinary rank of men, and pointed out something divine and
heavenly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One at the head, and the other at
the feet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>One angel only is mentioned by
Matthew,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
28:2.) This, however, does not contradict John&#8217;s narrative; for both
angels did not address Mary at the same time, but only one of them who had a
commission to speak. There is no good ground for Augustine&#8217;s allegory,
that the position of the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>angels
&#8212; one at the head, and the other at the feet &#8212;
pointed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>out that the Gospel would be
preached from the East to the West. It is more worthy of observation, that
Christ, by preparatory arrangements of this nature, made a commencement of the
glory of his kingdom; for, by the honor which the angels render to the
sepulcher, not only is the ignominy of the cross taken away, but the heavenly
majesty of Christ shines.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woman, why weepest
thou?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From the statements of the
Evangelists, it may be readily concluded, that the angel held a long
conversation; but John gives a brief summary of what was spoken, because this
was sufficient for proving the resurrection of Christ. The conversation consists
of reproof mingled with comfort. The angel reproves Mary for her excessive
<i>weeping, </i>but, at the same time, mingles joy, when he says that there is
no reason to weep, since Christ has risen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And seeth Jesus
standing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It may be asked, Whence arose
this mistake, that Mary does not recognize Jesus, with whom she must have been
intimately acquainted? Some think that he appeared in a different form, but I
think that the fault lay rather in the eyes of the women, as Luke
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
24:16)says of the two disciples,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their eyes were withheld from
knowing him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We will not say, therefore,
that Christ was continually assuming new shapes, like <i>Proteus</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F526</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>but that it is in the power of God, who gave eyes to men, to lessen their
sharpness of vision whenever he thinks proper, that <i>seeing they may not
see.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In Mary we have an example of the mistakes into which
the human mind frequently falls. Though Christ presents himself to our view, yet
we imagine that he assumes various shapes, so that our senses conceive of any
thing rather than of the true Christ; for not only are our powers of
understanding liable to be deceived, but they are also bewitched by the world
and by Satan, that they may have no perception of the truth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.<i>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F527</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)
is employed by the Hebrews in addressing laborers and other persons of low
condition. We see that Mary has no view of this matter but what is earthly. She
desires only to obtain the dead body of Christ, that she may keep it hidden in
the sepulcher; but she leaves out the most important matter, the elevation of
her mind to the divine power of his resurrection. We need not wonder, therefore,
if such grovelling views place a veil before her eyes.</font><br></div>

time, to fall into a mistake, was useful for confirming her faith; but now, by a
single word, he corrects her mistake. He had formerly addressed her, but his
discourse seemed to be that of an unknown person; he now assumes the character
of the Master, and addresses his disciple by name, as we have formerly seen
that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the good shepherd calleth

10:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That <i>voice of the shepherd, </i>therefore, enters
into Mary&#8217;s heart, opens her eyes, arouses all her senses, and affects her
in such a manner, that she immediately surrenders herself to
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus in <i>Mary </i>we have a lively image of our
calling; for the only way in which we are admitted to the true knowledge of
Christ is, when he first knows us, and then familiarly invites us to himself,
not by that ordinary voice which sounds indiscriminately in the ears of all, but
by that voice with which he especially calls the sheep which the Father hath
given to him. Thus Paul says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">After that you have known
God, or rather, after that you have been known by him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And said to him,

evident from this circumstance, that Mary immediately renders to Christ the
honor which is due to him; for the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rabboni</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is not only respectful, but involves a profession of obedience. Mary
therefore declares, that she is a disciple of Christ, and submits to him as her
<i>Master. </i>This is a secret and wonderful change effected on the human
understanding, when God, enlightening her by his Spirit, renders her
clear-sighted, who formerly was slow of apprehension, and, indeed, altogether
blind. Besides, the example of Mary ought to serve the purpose of exhortation,
that all whom Christ invites to himself may reply to him without
delay.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rabboni</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is Chaldee, though the Chaldeans pronounce it <i>Ribboni; </i>but it is
customary to make a change on words, when they are transferred to a foreign
tongue. The meaning is the same as if we were to say, <i>My Lord! </i>or,
<i>My</i> <i>Master! </i>But in the time of Christ this mode of expression had
gained currency, of using <i>Rabbi </i>and <i>Rabboni </i>instead of
<i>Master.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Touch me
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This appears not to agree with the
narrative of Matthew; for he expressly says, that the women <i>held him </i>BY
THE FEET,<i> and worshipped him,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402809&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
28:9.) Now, since he allowed himself to be <i>touched </i>by his disciples, what
reason was there for forbidding Mary to <i>touch </i>him? The answer is easy,
provided that we remember that the women were not repelled from <i>touching
</i>Christ, till their eagerness to <i>touch </i>him had been carried to excess;
for, so far as it was necessary for removing doubt, he unquestionably did not
forbid them to <i>touch </i>him, but, perceiving that their attention was too
much occupied with embracing <i>his feet, </i>he restrained and corrected that
immoderate zeal. They fixed their attention on his bodily presence, and did not
understand any other way of enjoying his society than by conversing with him on
the earth. We ought, therefore, to conclude, that they were not forbidden to
<i>touch </i>him, until Christ saw that, by their foolish and unreasonable
desire, they wished to keep him in the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I am not yet ascended to my
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We ought to attend to this
reason which he adds; for by these words he enjoins the women to restrain their
feelings, until he be received into the heavenly glory. In short, he pointed out
the design of his resurrection; not such as they had imagined it to be, that,
after having returned to life, he should triumph in the world, but rather that,
by his <i>ascension </i>to heaven, he should enter into the possession of the
kingdom which had been promised to him, and, seated at the right hand <i>of the
Father, </i>should govern the Church by the power of his Spirit. The meaning of
the words therefore is, that his state of resurrection would not be full and
complete, until he should sit down in heaven at the right hand of the Father;
and, therefore, that the women did wrong in satisfying themselves with having
nothing more than the half of his resurrection, and desiring to enjoy his
presence in the world. This doctrine yields two advantages. The first is, that
those who are desirous to succeed in seeking Christ must raise their minds
upwards; and the second is, that all who endeavor to go to him must rid
themselves of the earthly affections of the flesh, as Paul
exhorts,</font><br></div>

of Christ, but, in my opinion, improperly; for why should he have sent to them
rather than to the disciples? They reply, Because John elsewhere testifies, that
HIS BRETHREN <i>did not believe in him.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
7:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I do not think it probable that Christ conferred
so great an honor on those who are there mentioned. It must also be admitted,
that Mary Magdalene 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F529</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
fully obeyed the injunctions of Christ. Now, it immediately follows, that she
went <i>to the disciples; </i>from which we conclude, that Christ had spoken of
them 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F530</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, Christ knew that <i>the disciples, </i>whom
those men, by their opinion, treat as separated, were assembled in one place;
and it would have been exceedingly absurd that he should pay attention to I know
not what sort of persons, and disregard <i>the disciples, </i>who, having been
collected into one place, were subjected to a violent conflict between hope and
fear. To this it may be added, that Christ appears to have borrowed this
expression from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;192222&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
22:22, where we and these words: <i>I will declare thy name to my brethren;
</i>for it is beyond all controversy, that this passage contains the fulfillment
of that prediction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I conclude, therefore, that Mary was sent to the
disciples in general; and I consider that this was done by way of reproach,
because they had been so tardy and sluggish to believe. And, indeed, they
deserve not only to have <i>women </i>for their teachers, but even oxen and
asses; since the Son of God had been so long and laboriously employed in
teaching, and yet they had made so little, or hardly any progress. Yet this is a
mild and gentle chastisement, when Christ thus sends his disciples to the school
of the women, that by their agency, he may bring them back to himself. Here we
behold also the inconceivable kindness of Christ, in choosing and appointing
<i>women </i>to be the witnesses of his resurrection to the Apostles; for the
commission which is given to them is the only foundation of our salvation, and
contains the chief point of heavenly wisdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought likewise to be observed, however, that this
occurrence was extraordinary, and &#8212; we might almost say &#8212;
accidental. They are commanded to make known to the Apostles what they
afterwards, in the exercise of the office committed to them, proclaimed to the
whole world. But, in executing this injunction, they do not act as if they had
been Apostles; and, therefore, it is wrong to frame a law out of this injunction
of Christ, and to allow women to perform the office of baptizing. Let us be
satisfied with knowing that Christ displayed in them the boundless treasures of
his grace, when he once appointed them to be the teachers of the Apostles, and
yet did not intend that what was done by a singular privilege should be viewed
as an example. This is peculiarly apparent in <i>Mary Magdalene, who had
formerly been possessed by seven devils,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:9;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
8:2;) for it amounted to this, that Christ had brought her out of the lowest
hell, that he might raise her above heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it be objected, that there was no reason why
Christ should prefer the women to the Apostles, since they were not less carnal
and stupid, I reply, it does not belong to us, but to the Judge, to estimate the
difference between the Apostles and the women. But I go farther, and say, that
the Apostles deserved to be more severely censured, because they not only had
been better instructed than all others, but, after having been appointed to be
the teachers of the whole world, and after having been called <i>the light of
the world,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:14,) and <i>the salt of the earth,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:13,) they so basely apostatized. Yet it pleased the Lord, by means of those
weak and contemptible vessels, to give a display of his power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I ascend to my
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By using the word <i>ascend
</i>he confirms the doctrine which I have lately explained; that he rose from
the dead, not for the purpose of remaining any longer on the earth, but that he
might enter into the heavenly life, and might thus draw believers to heaven
along with him. In short, by this term he forbids the Apostles to fix their
whole attention on his resurrection viewed simply in itself, but exhorts them to
proceed farther, until they come to the spiritual kingdom, to the heavenly
glory, to God himself. There is great emphasis, therefore, in this word
<i>ascend; </i>for Christ stretches out his hand to his disciples that they may
not seek their happiness anywhere else than in heaven;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">for where our treasure
is, there also must our heart
be,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew

<div><font face="Palatino">Now, Christ declares, that he <i>ascends </i>on high;
and, therefore, we must <i>ascend, </i>if we do not wish to be separated from
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he adds, that he <i>ascends </i>TO GOD, he
quickly dispels the grief and anxiety which the Apostles might feel on account
of his departure; for his meaning is, that he will always be present with his
disciples by Divine power. True, the word <i>ascend </i>denotes the distance of
places; but though Christ be absent in body, yet, as he is with God, his power,
which is everywhere felt, plainly shows his spiritual presence; for why did he
ascend to God, but in order that, being seated at God&#8217;s right hand, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F531</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he might reign both in heaven and in earth? In short, by this expression he
intended to impress on the minds of his disciples the Divine power of his
kingdom, that they might not be grieved on account of his bodily
absence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To my Father and your Father, and
to my God and your God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The benefit and
efficacy of that brotherly union, which has been lately mentioned, is expressed,
when Christ declares that we have this in common with himself, that he who is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his God and his
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>our God and our Father. I
ascend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to my Father, who is also your
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. In </i>other passages we learn that
we are made partakers of all the blessings of Christ; but this is the foundation
of the privilege, that he imparts to us the very fountain of blessings. It is,
unquestionably, an invaluable blessing, that believers can safely and firmly
believe, that He who is the God of Christ is <i>their God, </i>and that He who
is the Father of Christ is <i>their Father. </i>Nor have we any reason to fear
that this confidence will be charged with rashness, since it is founded on
Christ, or that it will be proud boasting, since Christ himself has dictated it
to us with his own mouth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Christ calls Him <i>his God, </i>in so far as,

<div><font face="Palatino">This is, therefore, peculiar to his human nature, but
is applied to his whole person, on account of the unity, because he is both God
and Man. As to the second clause, in which he says that he <i>ascends to his

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F532</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>there is also a diversity between him and us; for he is the Son of God by
nature, while we are the sons of God only by adoption; but the grace which we
obtain through him is so firmly established, that it cannot be shaken by any
efforts of the devil, so as to hinder us from always calling him our Father, who
hath adopted us through his Only-begotten Son.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When, therefore, it was
evening.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Evangelist now relates that
the resurrection of Christ was proved to the disciples by his presence. It did
not happen without the providence of God, that all were assembled in one place,
that the event might be more certain and more manifest. It is worthy of notice
how gently Christ acted towards them, in not keeping them in suspense any longer
than till the evening. Besides, he enlightened them, bringing the pledge of a
new life, while darkness was overspreading the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where the disciples were
assembled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As to their having
<i>assembled, </i>it was an indication of faith, or, at least, of religious
feelings. As to the circumstance of their keeping themselves concealed by
<i>shut doors, </i>we perceive in it some proof of their weakness; for, though
the strongest and boldest minds are sometimes seized with fear, yet it may
easily be inferred that the apostles, at that time, trembled in such a manner as
to manifest the deficiency of their faith. This example is worthy of notice;
for, though they are less courageous than they ought to have been, still they do
not give way to their weakness. True, they seek concealment for the sake of
avoiding danger, but they gather courage so far as to remain together; otherwise
they would have been scattered hither and thither, and no man would have
ventured to look at his neighbor. In this manner we ought to struggle against
the weakness of our flesh, and not to indulge fear, which tempts us to apostacy.
Christ also blesses their zeal, when he appears to them while they are
assembled; and Thomas is justly deprived of the favor bestowed on all his
brethren, because, like a wandering soldier, he had withdrawn from the standard
of union. Here, then, is a lesson for those who are excessively timid, to
sharpen and encourage themselves to correct their carnal fear; and particularly
they ought to beware lest fear should cause them to scatter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And while the doors were
shut.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This circumstance was expressly
added, because it contains a manifest proof of the Divine power of Christ; but
this is utterly at variance with the meaning of the Evangelist. We ought,
therefore, to believe that Christ did not enter without a miracle, in order to
give a demonstration of his Divinity, by which he might stimulate the attention
of his disciples; and yet I am far from admitting the truth of what the Papists
assert, that the body of Christ passed through <i>the shut doors. </i>Their
reason for maintaining this is, for the purpose of proving not only that the
glorious body of Christ resembled a spirit, but that it was infinite, and could
not be confined to any one place. But the words convey no such meaning; for the
Evangelist does not say that he entered through <i>the shut doors, </i>but that
he suddenly <i>stood in the midst </i>of his disciples, though <i>the doors
</i>had been <i>shut, </i>and had not been opened to him by the hand of man. We
know that Peter
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441010&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
10:10) went out of a prison which was locked; and must we, therefore, say that
he passed through the midst of the iron and of the planks? Away, then, with that
childish trifling, which contains nothing solid, and brings along with it many
absurdities! Let us be satisfied with knowing that Christ intended, by a
remarkable miracle, to confirm his disciples in their belief of his
resurrection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peace be to
you!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the ordinary form of
salutation among the Hebrews; and by the word <i>peace </i>they denote all that
cheerfulness and prosperity which is usually desired for a happy life. The
phrase, therefore, means, &#8220;May you be well and prosperous!&#8221; I
mention this, because there are some who, in explaining these words, enter into
unnecessary discussions about <i>peace </i>and harmony, though Christ intended
nothing else than to desire that his disciples might be happy and

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He showed them his hands and
his side.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was necessary to add this
confirmation, that by all these methods they might be fully assured that Christ
was risen. If any person think it strange and inconsistent with the glory of
Christ, that he should bear the marks of his wounds even after his resurrection,
let him consider, first, that Christ rose not so much for himself as for us;
and, secondly, that whatever contributes to our salvation is glorious to Christ;
for, when he humbled himself for a time, this took nothing away from his
majesty, and now, since those <i>wounds, </i>of which we are speaking, serve to
confirm the belief of his resurrection, they do not diminish his glory. But if
any person should infer from this, that Christ has still the wounded <i>side
</i>and the pierced <i>hands, </i>that would be absurd; for it is certain that
the use of the <i>wounds </i>was temporary, until the Apostles were fully
convinced that he was risen from the dead.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then were the disciples glad when
they saw the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This means, that all
the grief which had been occasional to them by the death of Christ was dispelled
by his new life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus saith to them again,
Peace be to you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This second salutation
appears to me to have no other object than that the Lord should receive such a
degree of attention as was due to the greatness and importance of the subjects
on which he was about to speak.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the Father hath sent
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words, Christ, as it were,
instals them in the <i>office </i>to which he had previously appointed them.
True, they had been already sent throughout Judea, but only as heralds, to issue
a command that the supreme Teacher should be heard, and not as Apostles, to
execute a perpetual office of teaching. But now the Lord ordains them to be his
ambassadors, to establish his kingdom in the world. Let it therefore be held by
us as an ascertained truth, that the Apostles were now, for the first time,
appointed to be ordinary ministers of the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">His words amount to a declaration, that hitherto he
has discharged the <i>office </i>of a Teacher, and that, having finished his
course, he now confers on them the same office; for he means that the Father
appointed him to be a <i>Teacher </i>on this condition, that he should be
employed, for a time, in pointing out the way to others, and should, afterwards,
put those persons in his room to supply his absence, for this reason Paul says
that <i>he gave some, apostles; some, evangelists; some, pastors, </i>to govern
the Church till the end of the world,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:11.) Christ therefore testifies, first, that, though he held a temporary
office of teaching, still the preaching of the Gospel is not for a short time,
but will be perpetual. Again, that his doctrine may not have less authority in
the mouth of the Apostles, he bids them succeed to that office which he has
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>received from his
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>places<i> them </i>in his room,
and bestows on them the same authority; and it was proper that their ministry
should be ratified in this manner, for they were unknown persons and of mean
condition. Moreover, though they had the highest splendor and dignity, yet we
know that all that belongs to men does not approach to the excellence of
faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is not without reason, therefore, that Christ
communicates to his Apostles the authority which he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>received from the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that thus he may declare that
the preaching of the Gospel was committed to him, nut by human authority, but by
the command of God. But he does not substitute them in his room, in such a
manner as to resign to them the highest authority as a teacher, which the Father
intended to be vested in him alone. He therefore continues, and will eternally
continue to be, the only Teacher of the Church; but there is only this
difference, that he spoke with his mouth so long as he dwelt on earth, but now
speaks by the Apostles. The succession or substitution, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F534</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
therefore, is of such a nature that it takes nothing from Christ, but his
authority remains full and entire, and his honor unimpaired; for that decree by
which we are enjoined to hear him, and not others, cannot be set
aside:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">This is my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
17:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, Christ intended here to adorn the doctrine
of the Gospel and not men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought likewise to be observed, that the only
subject which is handled in this passage is the preaching of the Gospel; for
Christ does not send his Apostles to atone for sins, and to procure
justification, <i>as he was sent by the Father. </i>Accordingly, he makes no
allusion in this passage to anything which is peculiar to himself, but only
appoints ministers and pastors to govern the Church; and on this condition, that
he alone keeps possession of the whole power, while they claim nothing for
themselves but the ministry.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He breathed on
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>,Not one of the sons of men is
qualified for discharging so difficult an office, and, therefore, Christ
prepares the Apostles for it by the grace of his Spirit. And, indeed, to govern
the Church of God, to carry the embassy of eternal salvation, to erect the
kingdom of God on earth, and to raise men to heaven, is a task far beyond human
capacity. We need not be astonished, therefore, that no man is found qualified
unless he be inspired by the Holy Spirit; for no man can speak a word concerning
Christ unless the Spirit guide his tongue,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 12:3;) so far is it from being true that there is any man who is
competent to discharge faithfully and honestly all the duties of so excellent an
office. Again, it is the glory of Christ alone to form those whom he appoints to
be teachers of his Church; for the reason why the fullness of the Spirit has
been poured out upon him is, that he may bestow it upon each person according to
a certain measure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Receive ye the Holy
Spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Though he continues to be the
only Shepherd of his Church, he must necessarily display the power of his Spirit
in the ministers whose agency he employs; and this also he testified by the
outward symbol, when <i>he breathed on </i>the Apostles; for this would not be
applicable, if the Spirit did not proceed from him. So much the more detestable
is the sacrilege of the Papists, who seize and claim for themselves the honor
which belongs to the Son of God, for their mitred bishops, when they make
priests, have the effrontery to boast of breathing the Holy Spirit on them. But
the fact plainly shows how different their stinking breath is from the Divine
<i>breathing </i>of Christ; for what else is it that they do than to change
horses into asses? Besides, not only does Christ communicate to his disciples
<i>the Spirit </i>which he has received, but he bestows it as his own, as the
Spirit which he has in common with the Father. Consequently, all those who boast
of giving <i>the Spirit </i>by <i>breathing </i>lay claim to the glory of
Divinity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought to be observed, that those whom Christ calls
to the pastoral office he likewise adorns with the necessary gifts, that they
may be qualified for discharging the office, or, at least, may not come to it
empty and unprovided. And if this be true, there is no difficulty in refuting
the foolish boasting of the Papists, who, while they employ lofty terms of
commendation in extolling their hierarchy, cannot show a single spark of the
Holy Spirit in their bishops. They wish us to believe that they are the lawful
pastors of the Church, and, in like manner, that they are the apostles and
vicars of Christ, while it is evident that they are utterly destitute of the
grace of the Holy Spirit. A sure criterion is here laid down for judging of the
calling of those who govern the Church of God; and that criterion is, if we see
that they have </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>received the Holy
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What Christ chiefly, however, intended by it was, to
uphold the dignity of the rank of the Apostles; for it was reasonable that
those, who had been chosen to be the earliest and most distinguished preachers
of the Gospel, should possess uncommon authority. But if Christ, at that time,
bestowed the Spirit on the Apostles by <i>breathing, </i>it may be thought that
it was superfluous to send the Holy Spirit afterwards. I reply, the Spirit was
given to the Apostles on this occasion in such a manner, that they were only
sprinkled by his grace, but were not filled with full power; for, when the
Spirit appeared on them in <i>tongues of fire,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:3,) they were entirely renewed. And, indeed, he did not appoint them to be
heralds of his Gospel, so as to send them forth immediately to the work, but
ordered them to take repose, as we read elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Remain ye in the city of
Jerusalem till ye are endued with power from on high,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422449&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
24:49.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And if we take all things properly into
consideration, we shall conclude, not that he furnishes them with necessary
gifts for present use, but that he appoints them to be the organs of his Spirit
for the future; and, therefore, this <i>breathing </i>ought to be understood as
referring chiefly to that magnificent act of sending the Spirit which he had so
often promised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Although Christ might have bestowed grace on his
Apostles by a secret inspiration, he chose to add a visible <i>breathing </i>in
order to confirm them more fully. Christ took this outward emblem from the
ordinary manner of speaking in the Scriptures, which very frequently compare the
Spirit to <i>wind; </i>a comparison which we briefly accounted for in the
exposition of the Third Chapter of this Gospel 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F535</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But let the reader observe, that with the visible and outward sign the word is
also joined; for this is the source from which the sacraments derive their
efficacy; not that the efficacy of the Holy Spirit is contained in the word
which sounds in our ears, but because the effect of all those things which
believers receive from the sacraments depends on the testimony of the word.
Christ <i>breathes on </i>the Apostles: they receive not only the <i>breathing,
</i>but also <i>the Spirit. </i>And why, but because Christ promises to them
?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In like manner, in baptism we <i>put on Christ,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480327&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:27,) we are <i>washed by his blood,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;660105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Revelation
1:5,) <i>our old man is crucified,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:6,) in order that the righteousness of God may reign in us. In the Holy Supper
we are spiritually fed with the flesh and blood of Christ. Whence do they derive
so great efficacy but from the promise of Christ, who does and accomplishes by
his Holy Spirit what he declares by his word? Let us therefore learn, that all
the sacraments which men have contrived are nothing else than absolute mockeries
or frivolous amusements, because the signs can have no truth unless they be
accompanied by the word of the Lord. Now, since we never sport in this manner
with sacred things, without wickedly pouring contempt on God and ruining souls,
we ought to be most carefully on our guard against those stratagems of
Satan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it be objected, that we ought not to blame the
Popish bishops, when by <i>breathing </i>they consecrate their priests, because
in those cases the word of Christ accompanies the sign, the answer is obvious.
In the first place, Christ did not speak to the Apostles so as to appoint a
perpetual sacrament in the Church, but intended to declare once what we said a
little ago, that <i>the Spirit </i>proceeds from no other than from himself
alone. Secondly, he never appoints men to an office without at the same time
communicating strength to his ministers, and furnishing them with ability. I do
not mention that in Popery the priests are ordained for a totally different, or
rather a contrary purpose; namely, to murder Christ daily, while the disciples
were made Apostles in order to slay men by the sword of the Gospel. Yet we ought
also to believe that it is Christ alone who gives all the blessings which he
represents and promises by outward signs; for he does not bid the Apostles
<i>receive the Holy Spirit </i>from the outward <i>breathing, </i>but from
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To all whose sins you shall
remit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here, unquestionably, our Lord
has embraced, in a few words, the sum of the Gospel; for we must not separate
this power of forgiving sins from the office of teaching, with which it is
closely <i>connected </i>in this passage. Christ had said a little before,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the living Father hath sent
me, so I also send you</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F536</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>He now makes a declaration of what is intended and what is meant by this
embassy, only he interwove with that declaration what was necessary, that he
gave to them his Holy Spirit, in order that they might have nothing from
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The principal design of preaching the Gospel is, that
men may be reconciled to God, and this is accomplished by the unconditional
pardon of sins; as Paul also informs us, when he calls the Gospel, on this
account, <i>the ministry of reconciliation,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:18.) Many other things, undoubtedly, are contained in the Gospel,
but the principal object which God intends to accomplish by it is, to receive
men into favor by not imputing their sins. If, therefore, we wish to show that
we are faithful ministers of the Gospel, we must give our most earnest attention
to this subject; for the chief point of difference between the Gospel and
heathen philosophy lies in this, that the Gospel makes the salvation of men to
consist in the forgiveness of sins through free grace. This is the source of the
other blessings which God bestows, such as, that God enlightens and regenerates
us by his Spirit, that he forms us anew to his image, that he arms us with
unshaken firmness against the world and Satan. Thus the whole doctrine of
godliness, and the spiritual building of the Church, rests on this foundation,
that God, having acquitted us from all sins, adopts us to be his children by
free grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">While Christ enjoins the Apostles to <i>forgive sins,
</i>he does not convey to them what is peculiar to himself. It belongs to him to
<i>forgive sins. </i>This honor, so far as it belongs peculiarly to himself, he
does not surrender to the Apostles, but enjoins them, in his name, to proclaim
<i>the forgiveness of sins, </i>that through their agency he may reconcile men
to God. In short, properly speaking, it is he alone who <i>forgives sins
</i>through his apostles and ministers 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F537</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, Since he appoints them to be
only the witnesses or heralds of this blessing, and not the authors of it, why
does he extol their power in such lofty terms? I reply, he did so in order to
confirm their faith. Nothing is of more importance to us, than to be able to
believe firmly, that our sins do not come into remembrance before God.
Zacharias, in his song, calls it <i>the knowledge of salvation,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420177&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
1:77;) and, since God employs the testimony of men to prove it, consciences will
never yield to it, unless they perceive God himself speaking in their person.
Paul accordingly says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">We exhort you to be
reconciled to God, as if Christ besought you by us,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 5:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the reason why Christ employs such
magnificent terms, to commend and adorn that ministry which he bestows and
enjoins on the Apostles. It is, that believers may be fully convinced, that what
they hear concerning the forgiveness of sins is ratified, and may not less
highly value the reconciliation which is offered by the voice of men, than if
God himself stretched out his hand from heaven. And the Church daily receives
the most abundant benefit from this doctrine, when it perceives that her pastors
are divinely ordained to be sureties for eternal salvation, and that it must not
go to a distance to seek the forgiveness of sins, which is committed to their
trust.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor ought we to esteem less highly this invaluable
treasure, because it is exhibited in earthen vessels; but we have ground of
thanksgiving to God, who hath conferred on men so high an honor, as to make them
the ambassadors and deputies of God, and of his Son, in declaring the
forgiveness of sins. There are fanatics who despise this embassy; but let us
know, that, by doing so, they trample under foot the blood of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Most absurdly do the Papists, on the other hand,
torture this passage, to support their magical absolutions. If any person do not
confess his sins in the ear of the priest, he has no right, in their opinion, to
expect forgiveness; for Christ intended that sins should be forgiven through the
Apostles, and they cannot absolve without having examined the matter; therefore,
confession is <i>necessary. </i>Such is their beautiful
argument.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F538</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But they fall into a strange blunder, when they pass by the most important point
of the matter; namely, that this right was granted to the Apostles, in order to
maintain the credit of the Gospel, which they had been commissioned to preach.
For Christ does not here appoint confessors, to inquire minutely into each sin
by means of low mutterings, but preachers of his Gospel, who shall cause their
voice to be heard, and who shall seal on the hearts of believers the grace of
the atonement obtained through Christ. We ought, therefore, to keep by the
manner of <i>forgiving sins, </i>so as to know what is that power which has been
granted to the apostles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to those whose sins you
retain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ adds this second clause,
in order to terrify the despisers of his Gospel, that they may know that they
will not escape punishment for this pride. As the embassy of salvation and of
eternal life has been committed to the apostles, so, on the other hand, they
have been armed with <i>vengeance </i>against all the ungodly, who reject the
salvation offered to them, as Paul teaches,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;471006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 10:6.) But this is placed last in order, because it was proper that
the true and real design of preaching the Gospel should be first exhibited. That
we are reconciled to God belongs to the nature of the Gospel; that believers are
ad-judged to eternal life may be said to be accidentally connected with it. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F539</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For this reason, Paul, in the passage which I lately quoted, when he threatens
vengeance against unbelievers, immediately adds,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">after that your obedience
shall have been
fulfilled,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;471006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 10:6;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for he means, that it belongs peculiarly to the
Gospel to invite all to salvation, but that it is accidental to it that it
brings destruction to any.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought to be observed, however, that every one who
hears the voice of the Gospel, if he do not embrace the forgiveness of sins
which is there promised to him, is liable to eternal damnation; for, as it is a
<i>living savior </i>to the children of God, so to those who perish <i>it is the
savour of death to death,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:16.) Not that the preaching of the Gospel is necessary for
condemning the reprobate, for by nature we are all lost, and, in addition to the
hereditary curse, every one draws down on himself additional causes of death,
but because the obstinacy of those who knowingly and willingly despise the Son
of God deserves much severer punishment.</font><br></div>

have his hands also as witnesses of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. Thus he was not
only obstinate, but also proud and contemptuous in his treatment of Christ. Now,
at least, when he saw Christ, he ought to have been overwhelmed with shame and
amazement; but, on the contrary, he boldly and fearlessly stretches forth his
hand, as if he were not conscious of any guilt; for it may be readily inferred
from the words of the Evangelist, that he did not repent before that he had
convinced himself by touching. Thus it happens that, when we render to the word
of God less honor than is due to it, there steals upon us, without our
knowledge, a glowing obstinacy, which brings along with it a contempt of the
word of God, and makes us lose all reverence for it. So much the more earnestly
should we labor to restrain the wantonness of our mind, that none of us, by
improperly indulging in contradiction, and extinguishing, as it were, the
feeling of piety, may block up against ourselves the gate of
faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My Lord and my
God!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Thomas awakes at length, though
late, and as persons who have been mentally deranged commonly do when they come
to themselves, exclaims, in astonishment,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My Lord and my
God!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For the abruptness of the language
has great vehemence; nor can it be doubted that shame compelled him to break out
into this expression, in order to condemn his own stupidity. Besides, so sudden
an exclamation shows that faith was not wholly extinguished in him, though it
had been choked; for in the side or hands of Christ he does not handle
Christ&#8217;s Divinity, but from those signs he infers much more than they
exhibited. Whence comes this, but because, after forgetfulness and deep sleep,
he suddenly comes to himself? This shows, therefore, the truth of what I said a
little ago, that the faith which appeared to be destroyed was, as it were,
concealed and buried in his heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The same thing happens sometimes with many persons;
for they grow wanton for a time, as if they had cast off all fear of God, so
that there appears to be no longer any faith in them; but as soon as God has
chastised them with a rod, the rebellion of their flesh is subdued, and they
return to their right senses. It is certain that disease would not, of itself,
be sufficient to teach piety; and hence we infer, that, when the obstructions
have been removed, the good seed, which had been concealed and crushed, springs
up. We have a striking instance of this in David; for, so long as he is
permitted to gratify his lust, we see how he indulges without restraint. Every
person would have thought that, at that time, faith had been altogether banished
from his mind; and yet, by a short exhortation of the Prophet, he is so suddenly
recalled to life, that it may easily be inferred, that some spark, though it had
been choked, still remained in his mind, and speedily burst into a flame. So far
as relates to the men themselves, they are as guilty as if&#8217; they had
renounced faith and all the grace of the Holy Spirit; but the infinite goodness
of God prevents the elect from falling so low as to be entirely alienated from
God. We ought, therefore, to be most zealously on our guard not to fall from
faith; and yet we ought to believe that God restrains his elect by secret
bridle, that they may not fall to their destruction, and that He always
cherishes miraculously in their hearts some sparks of faith, which he
afterwards, at the proper time, kindles anew by the breath of his
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are two clauses in this confession.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thomas</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>acknowledges that Christ is <i>his Lord, </i>and then, in the second
clauses, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F548</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he ascends higher, and calls him also <i>his God. </i>We know in what sense
Scripture gives to Christ the name of <i>Lord. </i>It is, because the rather
hath appointed him to be the highest governor, that he may hold all things under
his dominion., <i>that every knee may bow before him,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:10,) and., in short, that he may be the Father&#8217;s vicegerent in governing
the world. Thus the name
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>properly belongs to him, so far as he is the Mediator manifested in the
flesh, and the Head of the Church. But
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thomas,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>having acknowledged him to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is immediately carried upwards to his eternal Divinity, and justly; for the
reason why Christ descended to us, and first was humbled, and afterwards was
placed at the Father&#8217;s right hand, and obtained dominion over heaven and
earth, was, that he might exalt us to his own Divine glory, and to the glory of
the Father. That our faith may arrive at the eternal Divinity of Christ., we
must begin with that knowledge which is nearer and more easily acquired. Thus it
has been justly said by some, that by Christ Man we are conducted to Christ God,
because our faith makes such gradual progress that, perceiving Christ on earth,
born in a stable, and hanging on a cross., it rises to the glory of his
resurrection, and, proceeding onwards, comes at length to his eternal life and
power, in which his Divine Majesty is gloriously displayed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet we ought to believe, that we cannot know Christ
as <i>our Lord, </i>in a proper manner, without immediately obtaining also a
knowledge of his Divinity. Nor is there any room to doubt that this ought to be
a confession common to all believers., when we perceive that it is approved by
Christ. He certainly would never have endured that the Father should be robbed
of the honour due to him, and that this honor should be falsely and groundlessly
conveyed to himself. But he plainly ratifies what Thomas said; and, therefore,
this passage is abundantly sufficient for refuting the madness of Arius; for it
is not lawful to imagine two Gods. Here also is declared the unity of person in
Christ; for the same Jesus Christ 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F549</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is called both <i>God </i>and <i>Lord. </i>Emphatically, to, he twice calls him
<i>his</i> <i>own, </i>MY<i> Lord and </i>MY <i>God! </i>declaring, flint he
speaks in earnest, and with a lively sentiment of faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because thou hast seen
me, Thomas.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ blames nothing in
Thomas, but that he was so slow to believe, that he needed to be violently drawn
to faith by the experience of the senses; which is altogether at variance with
the nature of faith. If it be objected, that nothing is more unsuitable than to
say <i>that faith </i>is a conviction obtained from <i>touching </i>and
<i>seeing, </i>the answer may be easily obtained from what I have already said;
for it was not by mere <i>touching </i>or <i>seeing </i>that Thomas was brought
to believe that Christ is God, but, being awakened from sleep, he recalled to
remembrance the doctrine which formerly he had almost forgotten. Faith cannot
flow from a merely experimental knowledge of events, but must draw its origin
from the word of God. Christ, therefore, blames Thomas for rendering less honor
to the word of God than he ought to have done, and for having regarded faith
&#8212; which springs from hearing, and ought to be wholly fixed on the word
&#8212; as bound to the other senses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed are they who have not seen,

He therefore includes, in a short definition, the power and nature of faith;
namely, that it does not rest satisfied with the immediate exercise of sight,
but penetrates even to heaven, so as to believe those things which are hidden
from the human senses. And, indeed, we ought to give to God this honor, that we
should view His truth as
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aujto&gt;pistov</font><font face="Palatino">

beyond all doubt without any other proof 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F552</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Faith has, indeed, its own <i>sight </i>but one which does not confine its view
to the world, and to earthly objects. For this reason it is
called</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">a demonstration of things
invisible or not
seen,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
11:1;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and Paul contrasts it with <i>sight,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:7,) meaning, that it does not rest satisfied with looking at the
condition of present object, and does not cast its eye in all directions to
<i>those things which are visible </i>in the world, but depends on the mouth of
God, and, relying on His word, rises above the whole world, so as to fix its
anchor in heaven. It amounts to this, that faith is not of a right kind, unless
it be founded on the word of God, and rise to the invisible kingdom of God, so
as to go beyond all human capacity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it be objected, that this saying of Christ is
inconsistent with another of his sayings, in which he declares that <i>the eyes
which behold him are blessed,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:16,) I answer, Christ does not there speak merely of bodily sight, as he does
in this passage, but of revelation, which is common to all believers, since he
appeared to the world as a Redeemer. He draws a comparison between the Apostles
and <i>the holy kings and prophets,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:17,) who had been kept under the dark shadows of the Mosaic Law. He says,
that now the condition of believers is much more desirable, because a brighter
light shines around them, or rather, because the substance and truth of the
figures was made known to them. There were many unbelievers who, at that time,
<i>beheld </i>Christ with <i>the eyes </i>of flesh, and yet were not more
<i>blessed </i>on that account; but we, who have never beheld Christ with the
eyes, enjoy that <i>blessedness </i>of which Christ speaks with commendation.
Hence it follows, that he calls those eyes <i>blessed </i>which spiritually
behold in him what is heavenly and divine; for we now behold Christ in the
Gospel in the same manner as if he visibly stood before us. In this sense Paul
says to the Galatians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:1,) that <i>Christ was crucified before their eyes; </i>and, therefore, if we
desire to see in Christ what may render us <i>happy </i>and <i>blessed, </i>let
us learn to <i>believe, </i>when we <i>do not see. </i>To these words of Christ
corresponds what is stated in another passage, in which the Apostle commends
believers, who</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">love Christ whom they
have not seen, and rejoice with unspeakable joy, though they do not behold him.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Peter 1:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The manner in which the Papists torture these words,
to prove their doctrine of transubstantiation, is exceedingly absurd. That we
may be <i>blessed, </i>they bid us believe that Christ is present under the
appearance of bread. :But we know that nothing was farther from Christ&#8217;s
intention than to subject faith to the inventions of men; and as soon as it
passes, in the smallest degree, beyond the limits of the word, it ceases to be
faith. If we must believe without reserve all that we do not see, then every
monster which men may be pleased to form, every fable which they may contrive,
will hold our faith in bondage. That this saying of Christ may apply to the case
in hand, we must first prove from the word of God the very point in question.
They bring forward the word of God, indeed, in support of their doctrine of
transubstantiation; but when the word is properly expounded, it gives no
countenance to their foolish notion.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Many other signs also Jesus
did.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If the Evangelist had not cautioned
his readers by this observation, they might have supposed that he had left out
none of the miracles which Christ had performed, and had given a full and
complete account of all that happened. John, therefore, testifies, first, that
he has only related some things out of a large number; not that the others were
unworthy of being recorded, but because these were sufficient to edify faith.
And yet it does not follow that they were performed in vain, for they profited
that age. Secondly, though at the present day we have not a minute knowledge of
them, still we must not suppose it to be of little importance for us to know
that the Gospel was sealed by a vast number of miracles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But these are written, that
you may believe.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words he
means, that he committed to writing what ought to satisfy us, because it is
abundantly sufficient for confirming our faith; for he intended to reply to the
vain curiosity of men, which is insatiable, and allows itself excessive
indulgence. Besides, John was well aware of what the other Evangelists had
written; and, as nothing was farther from his intention than to set aside their
writings, he unquestionably does not separate their narrative from his
own.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be thought strange, however, that faith is
founded on miracles, while it ought to rest exclusively on the promises and word
of God. I reply, no other use is here assigned to miracles than to be the aids
and supports of faith; for they serve to prepare the minds of men, that they may
cherish greater reverence for the word of God, and we know how cold and sluggish
our attention is, if we be not excited by something else. Besides, it adds no
small authority to the doctrine already received, when, for the purpose of
supporting it, he stretches out his mighty hand from heaven; as Mark says that
the Apostles taught,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the Lord working with
them, and confirming the word by accompanying signs,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411620&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Mark
16:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Although, therefore, strictly speaking, faith rests
on the word of God, and looks to the word as its only end, still the addition of
miracles is not superfluous, provided that they be also viewed as relating to
the word, and direct faith towards it. Why miracles are called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>signs</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>we have already explained. It is because, by means of them, the Lord arouses
men to contemplate his power, when he exhibits any thing strange and
unusual.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That Jesus is the
Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He means
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>such as he had been promised in
the Law and the Prophets, as the Mediator between God and men, the
Father&#8217;s highest Ambassador the only Restorer of the world, and the Author
of perfect happiness. For John did not seize upon an empty and unmeaning title
to adorn the Son of God, but included, under the name <i>Christ, </i>all the
offices which the Prophets ascribe to him. We ought, therefore, to contemplate
him such as he is there described. This shows more fully what was said a little
ago, that faith does not confine its view to miracles, but carries us direct to
the word; for it is as if John had said, that what the Prophets formerly taught
by the word has been proved by miracles. And, indeed, we see that the
Evangelists themselves do not occupy their whole attention in relating miracles,
but dwell more largely on doe-trine, because miracles by themselves would
produce nothing but a confused admiration. The meaning of the words therefore
is, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>these things have been
written, that we may believe</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so far as
faith can be aided by <i>signs.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Son of
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Evangelist adds this, because
not one of the ordinary rank of men could have been found, who was competent to
perform so great undertakings; that is, to reconcile the Father to us, to atone
for the sins of the world, to abolish death, to destroy the kingdom of Satan, to
bring to us true righteousness and salvation. Besides, as the name,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Son of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>belongs only to Christ, it follows
that he is a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Son</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>not by adoption, but by nature; and, therefore, under this name is
comprehended the eternal Divinity of Christ. And, indeed, he who, after having
received those striking proofs, which are to be found in the Gospel, does not
perceive Christ to be God, does not deserve to look even at the sun and the
earth, for he is blind amidst the brightness of noonday.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That believing, you may have
life.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This effect of faith was also
added, to restrain the foolish longings of men, that they may not desire to know
more than what is sufficient for obtaining
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>For what obstinacy was it, not to be satisfied with eternal salvation, and
to wish to go beyond the limits of the heavenly kingdom? Here John repeats the
most important point of his doctrine, that we obtain eternal <i>life </i>by
<i>faith, </i>because, while we are out of Christ, we are dead, and we are
restored to life by his grace alone. On this subject we have spoken largely
enough in our exposition of the Third and Fifth Chapters of this
Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Through his

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through the

Christ, </i>the reason of this form of expression has been assigned by us in our
exposition of the twelfth verse of the First Chapter of this Gospel. The reader
may consult that passage, if he think proper, that I may not be troubled with
repeating the same things
frequently.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F553</font></sup><br></div>

still labors to prove the resurrection of Christ, and relates, that he appeared
to seven diseiples, among whom he mentions <i>Thomas, </i>not out of respect to
him, so much as because his testimony ought to be the more readily believed in
proportion to the obstinacy of his unbelief. The Evangelist enters sufficiently
into detail; for he carefully collects all the circumstances which contribute to
prove the truth of the history. We have formerly mentioned that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Lake of

custom, is called <i>the Sea of Tiberias.</i></font><br></div>

</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am going to
fish.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That Peter gave his attention to
<i>fishing, </i>ought not to be regarded as inconsistent with his office. By
<i>breathing on </i>him, Jesus had ordained him to be an Apostle, as we saw a
little before; but he abstained from the exercise of the apostleship for a short
time, till he should be clothed with new power. For he had not yet been enjoined
to appear in public for the discharge of his office of teaching, but had only
been reminded of his future calling, that he and the others might understand
that they had not in vain been chosen from the beginning. Meanwhile, they do
what they were accustomed to do, and what belonged to men in private life. It is
true that Paul, in the midst of his employment as a preacher, gained the support
of his life by his own hands, but it was for a different reason; for his time
was so arranged, that the labors of his hands did not withdraw him from
teaching. Peter and his companions, on the other hand, give themselves up
entirely to <i>fishing, </i>because they are not hindered from doing so by any
public employment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that night they caught

what followed immediately afterwards would not have so clearly manifested the
power of Christ, but when, after having toiled ineffectually during the whole
night, they are suddenly favored with a large take of fishes, they have good
reason for acknowledging the goodness of the Lord. In the same manner, also, God
often tries believers, that he may lead them the more highly to value his
blessing. If we were always prosperous, whenever we put our hand to labor,
scarcely any man would attribute to the blessing of God the success of his
exertions, all would boast of their industry, and would kiss their hands. But
when they sometimes labor and torment themselves without any advantage, if they
happen afterwards to succeed better, they are constrained to acknowledge
something out of the ordinary course; and the consequence is, that they begin to
ascribe to the goodness of God the praise of their prosperity and
success.</font><br></div>

command with authority and power as <i>Master </i>and <i>Lord, </i>but gives
advice like one of the people; and the disciples, being at a loss what to do,
readily obey him, though they did not know who he was. If, before the first
<i>casting of the net, </i>any thing of this sort had been said to them, they
would not have so quickly obeyed. I mention this, that no one may wonder that
they were so submissive, for they had already been worn out by long and useless
toil. Yet it was no small proof of patience and perseverance, that, though they
had labored unsuccessfully during the whole night, they continue their toil
after the return of daylight. And, indeed, if we wish to allow an opportunity
for the blessing of God to descend on us, we ought constantly to expect it; for
nothing can be more unreasonable than to withdraw the hand immediately from
labor, if it do not give promise of success.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That <i>Simon Peter </i>WAS NAKED, is a proof that
the disciples had labored in earnest; and yet they do not hesitate to <i>cast
the net </i>again to make another trial, that they may not neglect any
opportunity. Their obedience to the command of Christ cannot be ascribed to
faith; for they hear him speak as a person who was unknown to them. Now, if we
dislike our calling, because the labor which we undertake appears to be
unproductive, yet, when the Lord exhorts us to steadiness and perseverance, we
ought to take courage; in the end we shall obtain a happy result, but it will be
at the proper time.</font><br></div>

</i>Christ here exhibited two proofs of his Divine power. The first consisted in
their taking so large a draught of fishes; and the second was, when, by his
concealed power, he preserved the <i>net </i>whole, which otherwise must
unavoidably have been broken in pieces. Other circumstances are mentioned,
namely, that the disciples find burning coals on the shore, that fishes are laid
on them, and that bread is also prepared. As to the number of <i>the fishes,
</i>we ought not to look for any deep mystery in it. Augustine enters into
ingenious reasonings about the statement of the number, and says that it denotes
the Law and the Gospel; but if we examine the matter carefully, we shall find
that this is childish trifling.</font><br></div>

Evangelist shows, by his example, that it is our duty to raise our hearts to
God, whenever we succeed in any thing beyond our expectation; because we ought
instantly to remember that this act of kindness has flowed from the favor of Him
who is the Author of every blessing. That holy recognition of the grace of God,
which dwelt in the heart of John, led him also to the knowledge of Christ; for
he does not perceive Christ with his eyes, but, being convinced that the great
multitude of fishes has been brought to him by the hand of God, he concludes
that it was Christ who had guided his hands. But, as John goes before Peter in
faith, so Peter afterwards excels him in zeal, when, disregarding personal
danger, he throws himself into the lake. The rest follow in the ship. True, all
come to Christ at length, but Peter is actuated by a peculiar zeal in comparison
of the others. Whether he crossed over to the shore by walking or by swimming,
is uncertain; but let us rest satisfied with knowing that the act of leaving the
ship and going on shore was not the result of folly and rashness, but that he
advanced beyond the others in proportion to his zeal.</font><br></div>

What hindered them? Was it shame arising from reverence, or was it any thing
else? But if Christ saw that they were in a state of uncertainty, he ought to
remove their doubt, as he had done on many other occasions. I reply, there was
no other reason for shame, but because they were not sufficiently certain that
he was the Christ; for it is not usual with us to inquire about matters that are
doubtful and obscure. The Evangelist, therefore, means that the disciples <i>did
not ask </i>Christ, because they were afraid of doing him wrong; so plain and

the disciples at intervals, in order to confirm their belief of his

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When, therefore, they had
dined.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Evangelist now relates in
what manner Peter was restored to that rank of honor from which he had fallen.
That treacherous denial, which has been formerly described, had, undoubtedly,
rendered him unworthy of the apostleship; for how could he be capable of
instructing others in the faith, who had basely revolted from it? He had been
made an Apostle, but it was along with Judas, and from the time when he had
abandoned his post, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F559</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he had likewise been deprived of the honor of apostle-ship. Now, therefore, the
liberty, as well as the authority, of teaching is restored to him, both of which
he had lost through his own fault. And that the disgrace of his apostacy might
not stand in his way, Christ blots out and destroys the remembrance of it. Such
a restoration was necessary, both for Peter and for his hearers; for Peter, that
he might the more boldly execute his office, being assured of the calling with
which Christ had again invested him; for his hearers, that the stain which
attached to his person might not be the occasion of despising the Gospel. To us
also, in the present day, it is of very great importance, that Peter comes forth
to us as a new man, from whom the disgrace that might have lessened his
authority has been removed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Simon </i>(<i>son</i>)<i> of
John</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F560</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lovest thou
me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words Christ means that no
man can faithfully serve the Church, and employ himself <i>in feeding </i>the
flock, if he do not look higher than to men. First, the office <i>of feeding</i>
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F561</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is in itself laborious and troublesome; since nothing is more difficult than
to keep men under the yoke of God, among whom there are many who are weak,
others who are wanton and unsteady, others who are dull and sluggish, and others
who are slow and unteachable. Satan now brings forward as many causes of offense
as he can, that he may destroy or weaken the courage of a good pastor. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F562</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In addition to this, we must take into account the ingratitude of many and other
causes of disgust. No man, therefore, will steadily persevere in the discharge
of this office, unless the love of Christ shall reign in his heart, in such a
manner that, forgetful of himself and devoting himself entirely to Christ, he
overcomes every obstacle. Thus Paul declares this to have been the state of his
own feelings, when he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The love of Christ
constraineth us, judging thus, that if one died for all, then all must have been
dead,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 5:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For, though he means that <i>love </i>with which
Christ hath <i>loved </i>us, and of which he hath given us a proof by his death,
yet he connects with us that mutual <i>love </i>which springs from the
conviction of having received so great a blessing. Ungodly and false teachers,
on the other hand, are pointed out by him in another passage by this mark, that
they <i>do not love the Lord Jesus,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461622&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 16:22.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Those who are called to govern the Church ought,
therefore, to remember that, if they are desirous to discharge their office
properly and faithfully, they must begin with the love of Christ. Meanwhile,
Christ openly testifies how highly he values our salvation, when he employs such
earnest and striking language in recommending it to <i>Pastors, </i>and when he
declares that, if the salvation of their flock be the object of their earnest
solicitude, he will reckon it a proof of the ardor of their love to himself.
And, indeed, nothing could have been spoken that was better fitted for
encouraging the ministers of the Gospel, than to inform them that no service can
be more agreeable to Christ than that which is bestowed on <i>feeding his flock.
</i>All believers ought to draw from it no ordinary consolation, when they are
taught that they are so dear and so precious in the sight of the Son of God,
that he substitutes them, as it were, in his own room. But the same doctrine
ought greatly to alarm false teachers, who corrupt and overturn the government
of the Church; for Christ, who declares that he is insulted by them, will
inflict on them dreadful punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Feed my
lambs.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>feed
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is metaphorically applied by Scripture to any
kind of government; but as the present subject is the spiritual government of
the Church, it is of importance to observe what are the parts of which the
office of <i>pastor </i>or <i>shepherd </i>consists. No idle rank is here
described to us, nor does Christ bestow on a mortal man any government to be
exercised by him in a confused manner according to his own pleasure. In
expounding the Tenth Chapter, we have seen that Christ is the only <i>Pastor
</i>or <i>Shepherd </i>of the Church. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F563</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We have seen also why he takes this name to himself. If, is, because he
<i>feeds, </i>that is, he <i>governs </i>his sheep, because he is the only true
food of the soul. But because he employs the agency of men in preaching
doctrine, he conveys to them also his own name, or, at least, shares it with
them. Those men, therefore, are reckoned to be <i>Pastors </i>in the sight of
God, who govern the Church by the ministry of the word under Christ, who is
their Head. Hence we may easily infer what is the burden which Christ lays on
Peter, and on what condition he appoints him to govern his
flock.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This enables us plainly to refute the wicked
adherents of the Church of Rome, who torture this passage to support the tyranny
of their Popery. &#8220;To Peter&#8221; they tell us, &#8220;in<i>
</i>preference to others, it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Feed my
sheep</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>&#8221; We have already explained
the reason why it was said to him rather than to the others; namely, that being
free from every disgraceful stain, he might boldly preach the Gospel; and the
reason why Christ thrice appoints him to be a pastor is, that the three denials,
by which Peter had brought on himself everlasting shame, may be set aside, and
thus may form no barrier to his apostleship, as has been judiciously observed by
Chrysostom, Augustine, and Cyril, and most of the other Commentators. Besides,
nothing was given to Peter by these words, that is not also given to all the
ministers of the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In vain, therefore, do the Papists maintain that he
holds the highest rank, because he alone is specially addressed; and, granting
that some special honor was conferred on him, how, I ask, will they prove from
this that he has been elevated to the primacy? Though he were the chief among
the apostles, does it thence follow that he was the universal bishop of the
whole world? To this it must be added, that all that Peter received does not
belong to the Pope any more than to Mahomet; for on what ground does he claim to
be Peter&#8217;s heir, and what man of sound understanding will admit that
Christ here bestows on him any hereditary right? Yet he wishes to be reckoned
Peter&#8217;s successor: I wish he were so. None of us hinders him from
<i>loving </i>Christ, and from taking care to <i>feed his flock; </i>but to take
no concern about <i>loving </i>Christ, and to throw aside the office of
<i>feeding, </i>and then to boast of being Peter&#8217;s successor, is
excessively foolish and absurd. Now, as Christ, in assigning to Peter the duty
of teaching, did not intend to erect a throne for an idol or for a murderer of
souls, that by means of it he might miserably oppress the Church, so he stated
in a few words, what kind of government of the Church he approves. This removes
the mask from all the mitred bishops, who, satisfied with a mere theatrical
display and an empty title, claim for themselves the authority of
bishops.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Feed my
sheep.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ does not give to Peter and
others the office <i>of feeding </i>all sorts of persons, but only <i>his sheep
</i>or <i>his lambs. </i>He elsewhere describes who they are whom he reckons to
belong to his flock.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">My sheep, says he, hear
my voice, and follow me; they hear not the voice of a stranger,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
10:5, 27.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">True, faithful teachers ought to endeavor to gather
all to Christ; and as they cannot distinguish between <i>sheep </i>and wild
beasts, they ought to try by all methods if they can tame those who resemble
wolves rather than <i>sheep. </i>But after having put forth their utmost
efforts, their labor will be of no avail to any but the elect <i>sheep; </i>for
docility and faith arise from this, that the heavenly Father delivers to his
Son, that they may obey him, those whom he elected before the creation of the
world. Again, we are taught by this passage, that none can <i>be fed </i>to
salvation by the doctrine of the Gospel but those who are mild and teachable;
for it is not without reason that Christ compares his disciples to <i>lambs
</i>and <i>sheep; </i>but it must also be observed, that the Spirit of God tames
those who by nature were bears or lions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peter was
grieved.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Peter undoubtedly did not
perceive the object which Christ had in view, in putting the same question so
frequently; and therefore he thinks that he is-in-directly accused, as if he had
not answered with sincerity. But we have already showed that the repetition was
not superfluous. Besides, Peter was not yet sufficiently aware how deeply the
love of Christ must be engraven on the hearts of those who have to struggle
against innumerable difficulties. He afterwards learned by long experience, that
such a trial had not been made in vain. Those who are to undertake the charge of
governing the Church are also taught, in his person, not to examine themselves
slightly, but to make a thorough scrutiny what zeal they possess, that they may
not shrink or faint in the middle of their course. We are likewise taught, that
we ought patiently and mildly to submit, if at any time the Lord subject us to a
severe trial; because he has good reasons for doing so, though they are
generally unknown to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Verily, verily, I tell
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After having exhorted Peter <i>to
feed his sheep, </i>Christ likewise arms him to maintain the warfare which was
approaching. Thus he demands from him not only faithfulness and diligence, but
invincible courage in the midst of dangers, and firmness in bearing the cross.
In short, he bids him be prepared for enduring death whenever it shall be
necessary. Now, though the condition of all pastors is not alike, still this
admonition applies to all in some degree. The Lord spares many, and abstains
from shedding their blood, satisfied with this alone, that they devote
themselves to him sincerely and unreservedly as long as they live. But as Satan
continually makes new and various attacks, all who undertake the office of
<i>feeding </i>must be prepared for death; as they certainly have to do not only
with <i>sheep, </i>but also with wolves. So far as relates to Peter, Christ
intended to forewarn him of his death, that he might at all times ponder the
thought, that the doctrine of which he was a minister must be at length ratified
by his own blood. Yet it appears that in these words Christ did not speak with a
view to Peter alone, but that he adorned him with the honourable title of Martyr
in presence of the others; as if he had said, that Peter would be a very
different kind of champion from what he had formerly shown himself to
be.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When thou wast
younger.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Old age appears to be set apart
for tranquillity and repose; and, accordingly, old men are usually discharged
from public employments, and soldiers are discharged from service. Peter might,
therefore, have promised to himself at that age a peaceful life. Christ
declares, on the other hand, that the order of nature will be inverted, so that
he who had lived at his ease when he was young will be governed by the will of
another when he is old, and will even endure violent
subjection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In Peter we have a striking mirror of our ordinary
condition. Many have an easy and agreeable life before Christ calls them; but as
soon as they have made profession of his name, and have been received as his
disciples, or, at least, some time afterwards, they are led to distressing
struggles, to a troublesome life, to great dangers, and sometimes to death
itself. This condition, though hard, must be patiently endured. Yet the Lord
moderates the cross by which he is pleased to try his servants, so that he
spares them a little while, until their strength has come to maturity; for he
knows well their weakness, and beyond the measure of it he does not press them.
Thus he forbore with Peter, so long as he saw him to be as yet tender and weak.
Let us therefore learn to devote ourselves to him to the latest breath, provided
that he supply us with strength.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this respect, we behold in many persons base
ingratitude; for the more gently the Lord deals with us, the more thoroughly do
we habituate ourselves to softness and effeminacy. Thus we scarcely find one
person in a hundred who does not murmur if, after having experienced long
forbearance, he be treated with some measure of severity. But we ought rather to
consider the goodness of God in sparing us for a time. Thus Christ says that, so
long as he dwelt on earth, he conversed cheerfully with his disciples, as if he
had been present at a marriage, but that fasting and tears afterwards awaited
them, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F564</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
9:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Another will gird
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Many think that this denotes the
manner of death which Peter was to die, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F565</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
meaning that he was hanged, with his arms stretched out; but I consider the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gird</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as simply denoting all the outward actions by which a man regulates himself
and his whole life. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou girdedst
thyself;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, &#8220;thou wast
accustomed to wear such raiment as thou chosest, but this liberty of choosing
thy dress will be taken from thee.&#8221; As to the manner in which Peter was
put to death, it is better to remain ignorant of it than to place confidence in
doubtful fables.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And will lead thee whither thou
wouldst not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The meaning is, that Peter
did not die a natural death, but by violence and by the sword. It may be thought
strange that Christ should say that Peter&#8217;s death will not be voluntary;
for, when one is hurried unwillingly to death, there is no firmness and none of
the praise of martyrdom. But this must be understood as referring to the contest
between the flesh and the Spirit, which believers feel within themselves; for we
never obey God in a manner so free and unrestrained as not to be drawn, as it
were, by ropes, in an opposite direction, by the world and the flesh. Hence that
complaint of Paul,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The good that I
would I do not, but the evil that I would not, that I do,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450719&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
7:19.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, it ought to be observed, that the dread of
death is naturally implanted in us, for to wish to be separated from the body is
revolting to nature. Accordingly, Christ, though he was prepared to obey God
with his whole heart, prays that he may be delivered from death. Moreover, Peter
dreaded the cross on account of the cruelty of men; and, therefore, we need not
wonder if, in some measure, he recoiled from death. But this showed the more
clearly the obedience which he rendered to God, that he would willingly have
avoided death on its own account, and yet he endured it voluntarily, because he
knew that such was the will of God; for if there had not been a struggle of the
mind, there would have been no need of patience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This doctrine is highly useful to be known; for it
urges us to prayer, because we would never be able, without extraordinary
assistance from God, to conquer the fear of death; and, therefore, nothing
remains for us but to present ourselves humbly to God, and to submit to his
government. It serves also to sustain our minds, that they may not altogether
faint, if it happen at any time that persecutions make us tremble. They who
imagine that the martyrs were not moved by any fear make their own fear to yield
them a ground of despair. But there is no reason why our weakness should deter
us from following their example, since they experienced a fear similar to ours,
so that they could not gain a triumph over the enemies of truth but by
contending with themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Signifying by what death he
should glorify God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This circumlocution
is highly emphatic; for though the end held out to all believers ought to be, to
glorify God both by their life and by their death, yet John intended to employ a
remarkable commendation for adorning the death of those who, by their blood,
seal the Gospel of Christ and glorify his name, as Paul teaches us,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
1:20.) It is now our duty to reap the fruit which the death of Peter has
yielded; for it ought to be imputed to our indolence, if our faith be not
confirmed by it, and if we do not keep the same object in view, that the glory
of God may be displayed by us. If the Papists had considered this end in the
death of the martyrs, that sacrilegious and detestable invention would never
have entered into their minds, that their death contributes to appease the wrath
of God, and to pay the ransom for our sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when he had said this.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Christ here explains what was the design of
that prediction of a violent death. It was, that Peter might be prepared to
endure it; as if he had said, &#8220;Since<i> </i>you must endure death by my
example, follow your leader.&#8221; Again, that Peter may the more willingly
obey God who calls him to the cross, Christ offers himself as a leader; for this
is not a general exhortation by which he invites him to imitate himself, but he
speaks only of the kind of death. Now, this single consideration greatly soothes
all the bitterness that is in death, when the Son of God presents himself before
our eyes with his blessed resurrection, which is our triumph over
death.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Peter, turning
about.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have in Peter an instance of
our curiosity, which is not only superfluous, but even hurtful, when we are
drawn aside from our duty by looking at others; for it is almost natural to us
to examine the way in which other people live, instead of examining our own, and
to attempt to find in them idle excuses. We willingly deceive ourselves by this
semblance of apology, that other people are no better than we are, as if their
indolence freed us from blame. Scarce one person in a hundred considers the
import of those words of Paul,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Every man shall bear his
own burden,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians
6:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the person of one man, therefore, there is a
general reproof of all who look around them in every direction, to see how other
men act, and pay no attention to the duties which God has enjoined on
themselves. Above all, they are grievously mistaken in this respect, that they
neglect and overlook what is demanded by every man&#8217;s special
calling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Out of ten persons it may happen that God shall
choose one, that he may try him by heavy calamities or by vast labors, and that
he shall permit the other nine to remain at ease, or, at least, shall try them
lightly. Besides, God does not treat all in the same manner, but makes trial of
every one as he thinks fit. As there are various kinds of Christian warfare, let
every man learn to keep his own station, and let us not make inquiries like
busybodies about this or that person, when the heavenly Captain addresses each
of us, to whose authority we ought to be so submissive as to forget every thing
else.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom Jesus
loved.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This circumlocution was inserted,
in order to inform us what was the reason why Peter was induced to put the
question which is here related; for he thought it strange that he alone should
be called, and that John should be overlooked, whom Christ had always loved so
warmly. Peter had, therefore, some apparently good reason for asking why no
mention was made of John, as if Christ&#8217;s disposition towards him had
undergone a change. Yet Christ cuts short his curiosity, by telling him that he
ought to obey the calling of God, and that he has no right to inquire what other
people do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I will that he remain.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">It has been customary to take this sentence as
detached, and to read the former clause affirmatively,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will that he tarry till I
come;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but this has been done through the
ignorance of transcribers, not through the mistake of the translator; for he
could not have been mistaken about the Greek word, but a single letter might
easily creep into the Latin version, so as to alter the whole meaning. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F566</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The whole sentence, therefore, is a question, and ought to be read in immediate
connection; for Christ intended to put his hand on his disciple, in order to
keep him within the limits of his calling. &#8220;It is no concern of
yours,&#8221; says he, &#8220;and you have no right to inquire what becomes of
your companion; leave that to my disposal; think only about yourself, and
prepare to follow where you are called.&#8221; Not that all anxiety about
brethren is uncalled for but it ought to have some limit, so that it may be
anxiety, and not curiosity, that occupies our attention. Let every man,
therefore, look to his neighbours, if by any means he may succeed in drawing
them along with him to Christ, and let not the offenses of others retard his own
progress.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then this saying went
forth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Evangelist relates that, from
misunderstanding Christ&#8217;s words, an error arose among the disciples, that
John <i>would never die. </i>He means those who were present at that
conversation, that is, the Apostles; not that the name <i>brethren </i>belongs
to them alone, but that they were the first-fruits, as it were, of that holy
union. It is also possible, that, besides the eleven, he refers to others who
were at that time in company with them; and by the expression, <i>went forth,
</i>he means that this error was spread in all directions; yet probably it was
not of long duration, but subsisted among them, until, being enlightened by the
Holy Spirit, they formed purer and more correct views of the kingdom of Christ,
having laid aside carnal and foolish imaginations. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F567</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What John relates about the Apostles happens every
day, and we ought not to wonder at it; for if Christ&#8217;s disciples, who
belonged to his family and were intimately acquainted with him, were so
egregiously mistaken, how much more are they liable to fall into mistakes, who
have not been so familiarly instructed in the school of Christ? But let us also
observe whence this fault arises. The teaching of Christ is useful, and for
edification; that is, it is plain; but we obscure the light by our wicked
inventions, which we bring to it from our own views. Christ had not intended to
pronounce any thing certain or definite about John, but only to affirm that he
had full power to decide about his life and death; so that the doctrine is
simple and useful in itself, but the disciples imagine and contrive more than
had been told them. Accordingly, in order that we may be safe from this danger,
let us learn to be wise and to think soberly. But such is the wantonness of the
human understanding, that it rushes with all its force into foolishness. The
consequence was, that this very error, against which the Evangelist had
expressly warned them to be on their guard, continued notwithstanding to gain
currency in the world; for a fable has been contrived, that he ordered a ditch
to be digged for him, and went down into it, and that next day it was found
empty. We see, therefore, that we shall never cease to err, unless we
unreservedly receive what the Lord hath taught us, and reject all inventions of
men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is that
disciple.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Having hitherto mentioned
himself in the third person, John now declares that it is himself; that greater
weight may be attached to the statements of one who was an eye-witness, and who
had fully known all that he relates.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There are also many other
things that Jesus did.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Lest any one
should view his narrative with suspicion, as if it had been written through
partiality, because <i>Jesus loved him, </i>he anticipates this objection, by
saying, that he has passed over more than he has written. He does not speak of
Christ&#8217;s actions of every kind, but of those which relate to his public
office; nor ought we to think that the hyperbole is absurd, when we bear with
many figures of speech of the same kind in heathen authors. Not only ought we to
take into account the number of Christ&#8217;s works, but we ought also to
consider their importance and magnitude. The majesty of Christ, which by its
infinity swallowed up, if I may so speak, not only the senses of men, but heaven
and earth, gave a miraculous display of its own splendor in those works. If the
Evangelist, casting his eyes on that brightness, exclaims in astonishment, that
even the whole world could not contain a full narrative, ought we to wonder at
it? Nor is he at all to be blamed, if he employ a frequent and ordinary figure
of speech for commending the excellence of the works of Christ. For we know how
God accommodates himself to the ordinary&#8217; way of speaking, on account of
our ignorance, and sometimes even, if I may be allowed the expression,
stammers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet we ought to remember what we formerly stated,
that the summary which the Evangelists have committed to writing, is sufficient
both for regulating faith and for obtaining salvation. That man who has duly
profited under such teachers will be truly wise. And, indeed, since they were
appointed by God to be witnesses to us, as they have faithfully discharged their
duty; so it is our duty, on the other hand, to depend wholly on their testimony,
and to desire nothing more than what they have handed down to us; and
especially, because their pens were guided by the sure providence of God, that
they might not oppress us by an unlimited mass of narratives, and yet, in making
a selection, might make known to us all that God knew to be necessary for us,
who alone is wise, and the only fountain of wisdom; to whom be praise and glory
for ever. Amen.</font><br></div>

Is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Ke&gt;drwn</font><font face="Palatino">,
a proper name, or an appellative? CALVIN does not mean that the presence of the
article settles this question, but that it depends on the preference which shall
be given to one or another of the various readings. If we read
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tw~n

These statements regarding &#8220;The <i>Church</i>&#8221;<i> </i>our Author
considers to be what logicians call the major proposition of the syllogism; and
by the Latin word <i>&#8220;hypothesis&#8221;</i> rendered in French
<i>&#8220;l&#8217;application,&#8221;</i> he evidently means the minor
proposition, which he declares not only to be unsupported by proof, but to be
utterly false. His own early training and habits, as a lawyer, naturally led him
to throw the argument into this form, especially when it related to a criminal
prosecution; for even in our own times indictments invariably take the form of a
syllogism. He appears to have conceived the accusation against Christ to run
thus: &#8220;Any mere man, declaring himself to be <i>the Son of God, </i>is
guilty of blasphemy, and deserves to die. But Jesus of Nazareth, who is a mere
man, <i>hath made himself to be the Son of God. </i>Therefore, <i>according to
our law, </i>Jesus <i>ought to die.&#8221; </i>The major proposition cannot, be
questioned, being manifestly taken from the law of Moses. The minor proposmon
consrots of two parts. 1. Jesus is a mere man. 2. Jesus <i>hath made himself to
be the Son of God. </i>The second part is true, but the first is i,alse; and,
consequently, the whole argument, plausible as it had seemed, falls to the
ground. It ought to have been known and acknowledged by the <i>Jews, </i>that
the honorable rank of <i>the Son of God, </i>though it could not without
blasphemy be claimed by a mere child of Adam, belonged of right to Jesus of
Nazareth, of whom, even before his birth, the angel stud to the Virgin
Mary,</font><br></div>

Dr Bloomfield subjoins the following note to this verse :&#8212;&#8221; The
epitaph of this soldier, (if genuine,) said to be found in the Church of St
Mary, at Lyons, is as follows :&#8212;, <i>Qui Salvatoris latus Cruce
Cuspfdefixit, </i>LO,&#8217;GINUS <i>Mc jacet. &#8212;&#8217; Here lies
</i>LONGINU&#8217;S, <i>who pierced the Savior&#8217;s side on the Cross with a
spear.&#8217;&#8220; </i>As the learned annotator has thus summarily adverted to
this legendary tale, it is right that the reader should be briefly put in
possession of the whole of it, as it has. been collected by Moreri from
Tillemont and other ecclesiastical writers, in his &#8220;Directory&#8221; under
the head, <i>St Longin &#8212; </i>(<i>St </i>Longinns.) This <i>St Longinus
</i>is twofold: &#8220;some saying, that he was <i>the soldier </i>that pierced
our Lord&#8217;s side with a spear; and some, that he was <i>the centurion
</i>who commanded the guard at the cross. The legends report both these persons
to have been converted to the Christian faith, to have suffered martyrdom, and
to have been canonized.&#8221; Moreri, however, though an ecclesiastic of the
Romish Church, was constrained to add, <i>The acts of both Longinuses are
manifestly false; and the circumstances they allege mutually refute each
other.&#8221;</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It would appear that the name <i>Longinus </i>has
been formed from the Greek
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">lo&gt;gch</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
spear: longinus </i>being the Latin form of
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">lo&gt;gcimnov</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
&#8212; spear-man. </i>Thus, <i>St Longinus </i>is found to be a similar saint
to the <i>Sancta Veronica, </i>reported by Brydone. &#8220;The Greeks,&#8221;
continues Moreri, , celebrate the martyrdom of Longinus, <i>the centurion,
</i>on the 16th of October, the Latins on the 15th of March, and the Copts on
the 1st of November. The martyrdom of Longinus, <i>the soldier, </i>is <i>not
</i>acknowledged by the Greeks; but the Latins commemorate it on different days;
some on the 15th of March, some on the 1st of September, others on the 22nd<i>
</i>of November; or 11th of December.&#8221; We thus see how little this
offspring of credulity and superstition merits the attention of the readers of
the <i>Gospel. &#8212; Granville Penn&#8217;s Annotations.</i></font><br></div>

Proteus,

a king of Egypt, is mentioned by Herodotus, who relates that at Memphis, his
native place, a magnificent temple was erected for him. The historian quotes as
his authorities, the Egyptian priests with whom he had conversed, and who
detailed to him the most mentorable transactions of that reign, connected with
the carrying of Helena into Egypt; and he produces passages from the Iliad and
the Odyssey, to prove that Homer was well acquainted with the leading facts,
though he chose to disguise or palliate them, so as to make a better figure in
his story, (Herodotus, Book 2 112-116.) The key to the present allusion,
however, must be found in the fabulous accounts of <i>Proteus, </i>as a sea
deity, whom Ovid describes as PROTEA AMBIGUUM, <i>the shape-changing Proteus,
</i>(Metamorphoses, Book 2. Fable 1. 5:9,) and whose alleged habit frequently
changing his shape passed into a proverb. &#8220;he had (says Lempriere)
received the gift of prophecy from Neptune, and from his knowledge of futurity
mankind received the greatest services. He was difficult of access, and, when
consulted, he refused to give answers, by immediately <i>assuming different
shapes, </i>and eluding the grasp, if not properly secured by fetters.&#8221;
Proverbial references to this fable occur frequently in the ancient writers.

In the Latin original of the Commentaries, the illustration of this clause comes
before that of the 7th verse; but I have consulted the convenience of the
reader, by following the French version, which, in this respect, may be supposed
to give us the latest thoughts of the Author., and in which this clause is
restored to its natural order. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>

CALVIN here throws out a conjecture, that the clause originally stood in the
Vulgate, SI <i>eum volo manere, </i>and that. by the addition of&#8221; a single
letter&#8221; to the first word of the clause, some ignorant transcriber altered
it to SIC <i>eum rolo manere. </i>He declares it to be impossible that the word
<i>Sic </i>should have found its way into the verse in any other manner, because
the translator could not mistake the meaning of &#8220;the Greek word&#8221;
