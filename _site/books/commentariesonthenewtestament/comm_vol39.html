<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">TRANSLATOR&#8217;S
PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY was distinguished by a large
and valuable accession of Expositors of the Sacred Volume. Mosheim reckons up
not fewer than fifty-five writers, who, in the course of that century, devoted
their labors, to a greater or less extent, to the interpretation or illustration
of the inspired writings &#8212; a circumstance which at once indicated the
progress of the principles of the Reformation, and contributed most materially
to their diffusion. Nor were exository treatises, in illustrations of the Sacred
Scriptures, simply increased in number; they were marked by a decided
improvement in point of intrinsic value. It is to the honor of a large
proportion of the Interpreters of that age, that, rejecting the practice so well
exposed by BISHOP HORSLEY, of &#8220;drawing I know not what mystical meanings,
by a certain cabalistic alchemy, from the simplest expressions of holy
writ,&#8221; they made it their endeavor, in every case, to ascertain the true
meaning of the Spirit of God, by a careful examination of the text and
context.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In unbending integrity of purpose in the
investigation of the Inspired Oracles &#8212; which must be regarded as one of
the primary excellences of an Expositor &#8212; JOHN CALVIN is surpassed by none
in his own, or indeed in any age. His readers, even where they may not be
prepared to adopt his interpretation of a passage, cannot fail to perceive that
it is his sincere desire and honest endeavor to ascertain its true meaning. His
uprightness of design is more especially observable in connection with passages
bearing on controverted points. In such cases the candid reader will discover no
disposition to wrest a single expression for the purpose of enlisting it on the
side of a particular system of opinion; but, on the contrary, the utmost
fairness of interpretation is uniformly apparent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Every one that is acquainted with CALVIN&#8217;S
history, and considers the trying scenes through which he was called to pass,
must feel astonished that he should have found leisure to prepare, in addition
to all his other writings, Commentaries on nearly the whole of the Sacred
Scriptures. That he wrote so much, and more especially as an Expositor, appears
to have been chiefly owing to the frequent and urgent solicitations of his
intimate and beloved FAREL, who &#8220;not merely entreated CALVIN, but
frequently urged him with great vehemence to write one Commentary after another,
from a conviction that he possessed the gifts requisite for exposition in a very
extraordinary manner, and that, with the blessing of God, his works of this kind
would be extensively useful. &#8216;Being an inconsiderable man myself,&#8217;
said he, &#8216;I am wont to require very much from those that possess the
greatest excellence, and often press them hard to labor beyond their
strength.&#8217; It was his conviction that every one who had received superior
talents was bound to devote them to the advancement of the kingdom of
God.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f1</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE EPISTLES OF PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS form a most
important part of the Sacred Writings. Though not so systematic as the Epistle
to the ROMANS, they contain many passages, bearing directly on the fundamentally
important doctrines of the Christian system, while they are of the highest
utility in connection with Practical Theology. The disorders that had unhappily
crept into the Church at Corinth, gave occasion for the Apostle&#8217;s handling
at greater length than in any of his other Epistles various important points as
to doctrine and worship; while the relaxed state of discipline that had begun to
prevail among them rendered it necessary to exhibit more fully the principles
which ought to regulate the administration of the Christian Church. In this the
overruling hand of Him who brings good out of evil is strikingly
apparent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">While in the selection of the particular places into
which the Gospel was first introduced, and in which Christian Churches were
first planted, there is a display of Divine sovereignty which it is beyond our
power for fathom, this at least is abundantly manifest, that the places selected
were not those in which the triumphs of the Gospel were likely to be most easily
affected, but quite the reverse. As the skill of the workman appears so much the
more strikingly, when the tools employed by him are few and simple, and the
materials to be wrought upon are hard and unyielding; so the wonders achieved in
the first ages of the Church, through <i>the foolishness of preaching</i>.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:21) excite so much the more our astonishment, when we take into
view the peculiarly formidable obstacles that opposed its progress in the places
that were selected as the scenes of its triumphs. Of this the inspired narrative
furnished in the Acts of the Apostles presents numerous and striking
illustrations; and when we observe the particular Churches to which Paul&#8217;s
Epistles are addressed &#8212; in the order in which they are presented to our
view in the New Testament &#8212; it might almost seem as if the order of
arrangement had been designed for the very purpose of calling our particular
attention to the fact that the triumphs of the Gospel had been most signal in
those places in which its success might have appeared most unlikely. It is a
remarkable circumstance, and, assuredly, it is not to be looked upon as merely
accidental, that the Christian Church to which the <i>first</i> of Paul&#8217;s
Epistles &#8212; in the order in which they stand &#8212; is addressed, is one
that had been planted, not in some city of secondary importance, but in ROME
itself, the metropolis of the then known world; while the <i>second</i> of the
Churches to whom Paul&#8217;s Epistles are addressed is that of CORINTH, a city
that was proverbial among Heathens themselves for its extraordinary profligacy,
and consequently the most unlikely place of all to be the scene of the triumphs
of a religion that will allow of no compromise with iniquity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When PAUL first visited CORINTH, appearances were
most unpromising; but, having received special encouragement from his Divine
Master, he continued to labor at Corinth for <i>a year and six months</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
18:11;) and such was the success of his labors in that profligate city, that
after enumerating some of the worst descriptions of character, he says to the
Corinthian converts, &#8212; &#8220;<i>And such were some of you</i>,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 6:11). While, however, the notorious wickedness that prevailed at
Corinth was the occasion of illustrating so much the more clearly the power of
Christianity in subduing human depravity, that extreme dissoluteness of manners
to which the Corinthian Christians had been addicted previously to their
conversion, and which was daily witnessed by them in the unconverted around
them, was fitted to exert a most injurious influence; and while the disorders
that prevailed in the Corinthians Church after Paul left them, were in part
attributable to the insidious efforts of false teachers, there seems every
reason to believe that they were, in a very considerable degree, owing to the
contagion of corrupt manners around them. It is to this that we must trace their
preference of the ornaments of speech to the plain unadorned doctrine of the
cross &#8212; their party jealousies &#8212; their vexatious lawsuits &#8212;
their unseemly fellowship with heathens in their idol-feasts; and their
philosophical speculations, leading them to question the possibility of a
resurrection from the dead; while the flagrant case of incest, fallen into by
one of their number, and connived at by the others, must still more manifestly
be ascribed, in part, to the contagion of evil example. Yet even in this we have
occasion still farther to mark the overruling hand of God in making evil
subservient to good &#8212; the disordered state of the Corinthian Church having
given occasion for exhortations and reproofs that are fraught with invaluable
instruction to the Church of Christ in every successive age.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">CALVIN&#8217;S Commentary on the FIRST EPISTLE to the
Corinthians was <i>first published </i>in the year 1546, and his Commentary on
the SECOND EPISTLE was published in the course of the same year. It was a year
that was greatly &#8220;unfavorable to Calvin&#8217;s repose. He was obliged to
cheer the drooping spirits of the Genevese, whom the designs of CHARLES V.
against THE REFORMED RELIGION had alarmed. But, besides the cares which the fear
of all these evils occasioned him, he was deeply afflicted at the state of
GENEVA, and the general and daring profligacy of its
inhabitants.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f2</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the course of the same year (as is stated by BEZA)
one of the members of the senate, &#8220;instigated, it is supposed, by two
ministers of the Consistory, both of them given to drunkenness, and not less
afraid than others of the rigor of the law, accused CALVIN of preaching false
doctrine.&#8221; It may well appear surprising that in such circumstances he
should have found leisure for preparing this valuable portion of his Expository
Works. This, however, is not peculiar to this portion of his Commentaries; for
the greater part of them were prepared amidst numerous engagements and harassing
occurrences. Yet they do not bear the marks of haste, but might seem to have
been prepared in quiet retirement.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reader will observe that THE DEDICATION, which is
prefixed to the Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians in all the
ordinary editions of CALVIN&#8217;S works, bears date in 1556. It is however
stated, at the same time, by CALVIN in the close of the Dedication, that the
Commentary to which it is prefixed had been originally published by him ten
years previously. It will father be observed that in the commencement of the
Dedication, CALVIN alludes to an individual to whom he had originally dedicated
the Commentary, but whose name he had been under the painful necessity &#8212;
contrary to his usual manner &#8212; of erasing from his writings. The
individual alluded to is JAMES OF BURGUNDY. The original Dedication, which is
exceedingly rare, is contained in &#8220;Lettres de Calvin a Jaque de
Bourgogne,&#8221; kindly allowed to the Translator by Mr. Laing, Edinburgh, from
the Library of Writers to the Signet. A translation of <i>that </i>Dedication,
as well as of the one that was subsequently prefixed by Calvin to this part of
his Commentaries, will be found below.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The circumstances connected with the case of James of
Burgundy, are briefly stated by BAYLE in his Dictionary, (Art. <i>Philip of
Burgundy</i>,) in the following terms: &#8212; &#8220;James of Burgundy, Lord of
Fallaix, grandson, I suppose, of Baldwin, another natural son of Duke Philip,
professed the Protestant religion, but being scandalized at the disputes which
arose at Geneva between BOLSEC and CALVIN in the year 1551, he and his wife
turned aside from the doctrine of the Reformed. He had carried it fair in the
Church several years. CALVIN dedicated to him his Commentary on the First
Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians, but afterwards he suppressed that
Dedication, and prefixed another to THE MARQUIS OF VIC.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, Bayle, in the Art. <i>Calvin</i>, remarks,
when speaking of Beza&#8217;s Life of CALVIN &#8212; &#8220;We do not find in
the edition of 1564, in 12mo, what I have transcribed from the folio edition of
1565, when I said that the grandson of a bastard of Philip, the good Duke of
Burgundy, forsook the Church of Rome.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The editor of &#8220;Lettres de Calvin,&#8221; states
that, after much fruitless search in many quarters for two documents referred to
in CALVIN&#8217;S Letters, viz. the Dedication of Calvin&#8217;s Commentary on
the First Epistle to the Corinthians, and an Apology for the Masters of Falais,
presented to the Emperor Charles the Fifth, and composed by CALVIN, he had at
length obtained them from one of the librarians of Geneva. The Dedication, he
states, had been &#8220;transcribed from a copy that is at present at
Strasburg.&#8221; &#8220;These pieces,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;arrived just in
time for being printed in the last sheet of the Letters, to which I have not
failed to append them, as being absolutely necessary to render them
intelligible. I flatter myself that the public will receive them with delight,
as an authentic document,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> hitherto wanting in the ecclesiastical
history of this country. Even those who have neither interest nor inclination
for knowing this history to the bottom, will admire the beauty of CALVIN&#8217;S
genius, the insinuating turns of the Dedication, and the liberty and modesty
that reign equally in the Apology; and they will agree with me in thinking, that
CALVIN was no less expert, in the art of pleading, than he had been in the art
of preaching.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">JAMES OF BURGUNDY was the grandson of Baldwin, a
natural son of Philip, Duke of Burgundy, whom the Emperor Maximilian, in 1501,
put in possession of Falais, a &#8220;Manor of Brabant, situated on the borders
of the county of Namur, upon the river Mohaine, between the towns of Huy and
Henneguy.&#8221; He was &#8220;elevated to the court of the Emperor Charles the
Fifth. He embraced the views of the Protestants at the age of fifteen. He
afterwards married Jolande of Brederode, a descendant of the ancient Counts of
Holland, and aunt to Henry of Brederode.&#8221; &#8220;This marriage increased
the suspicions that he had conceived as to the religions in which he was brought
up, so that he adopted the resolution of leaving his native country, where he
reckoned his life no longer safe. His withdrawment led to a law-suit, before the
court of Malines, for the confiscation of his lands. During his exile, the
Master of Falais changed his abode from time to time, having taken refuge first
at Cologne, afterwards at Strasbourg, and at Basle, and, last of all, at Geneva.
There is ground to believe that he was a person of merit, upon the testimony of
CALVIN himself, who, after pronouncing upon him the highest eulogiums in his
Dedication to the First Epistle to the Corinthians, carried on a familiar
correspondence with him for nearly ten years, and takes pleasure in subscribing
himself vary frequently his friend unreservedly
forever.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f4</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;It is true that this friendship did not always
continue, but, on the contrary, changed into irreconcilable aversion. It may at
first view be thought, that the fault was altogether on the side of the Master
of Falais, and that CALVIN must have had sufficient reasons for carrying matters
so far. We must, however, beware of forming a rash judgment. We often see the
greatest animosities between the best friends arise out of nothing. Frequently
the two parties are equally in the wrong; and in many cases the fault is found
to have been on the side of the one that had been least suspected.&#8221;... The
reader who peruses superficially the statement of Beza, quoted by Bayle, might
imagine not merely that the Master of Falais had approved of all that Bolsec had
done or said, but also that he entirely abandoned the side of the Protestants,
and entered again the communion of the Romish Church. He might, therefore, fall
into a mistake on all these points.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;I do not believe that the Master of Falais
ever thought of approving of the conduct of Bolsec, who ventured in a full
church to contradict a minister, when preaching the doctrine of predestination.
Neither CALVIN nor Beza say so. Besides, the Master of Falais protests in his
Apology, that he has no sympathy with those that support their religion in a
turbulent and seditious manner. Assuredly he must have been a fanatic, to do
what Bolsec did on that occasion; but to say that he had done well, he must have
been a downright madman.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Nor is there any better proof that the Master
of Falais was of Bolsec&#8217;s opinion on the subject of predestination.
CALVIN, Beza, and Castalio himself, (who would not have failed to mention it,)
say no such thing. Besides this, the Confession of the Master of Falais, such as
he had published in his Apology, is quite in unison with CALVIN&#8217;S
sentiments; and it may be presumed that the had not renounced these views in
three years afterwards, while experience tells us, that they have once imbibed.
What was then, properly, the ground of quarrel between CALVIN and the Master of
Falais? In my opinion it was this: After Bolsec had been put in prison, on the
16th October 1551, for having contradicted the doctrine of CALVIN, and given
occasion of offense in the Church, CALVIN was disposed to punish him with all
possible severity. To accomplish his purpose in accordance with forms, he asked
the opinion of the Churches of Switzerland, hinting to them at the same time
what he desired from them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;&#8216;We are desirous,&#8217; says he,
&#8216;to clear our Church from this pestilence in such a way that it will not,
on being expelled from it, do injury to the neighboring Churches.&#8217;
meaning, plainly enough, that he must either be put to death, or suffered to
remain in prison during his whole life.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Master of Falais was of another mind; whether it
was that he was influenced by a regard to his own interest, and that, being
sickly, he imagined that his life depended on that of his physician; or whether
it was that, from a principle of humanity and Christianity forbearance, he
reckoned that Bolsec&#8217;s imprudence did not merit so severe a punishment, he
wrote to the clergy of the Cantons, or to his friends in that quarters, and
thereby defeated the design of CALVIN, who received replies less full and
distinct, and much more moderate, than he had expected and desired. CALVIN
finding himself thwarted by the Master of Falais, got into a passion, broke
entirely with him, and roused up against him so many enemies at Geneva, that he
was obliged to retire into the district of Vaud.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Judge, now, which of the two was in the right
&#8212; CALVIN or the Master of Falais.&#8221; &#8220;I do not know what became
of the Master of Falais after this time, nor <i>when </i>he died, nor
<i>where</i>, nor <i>in what communion</i>. I cannot, however, subscribe to the
views of Mr. Bayle, who says that the Master of Falais turned aside from the
doctrine of the Reformed, and that he renounced the Reformed Church. I am of
opinion that Beza, on whose authority Mr. Bayle proceeds, means nothing more
than this, that the Master of Falais left the Church of Geneva, on quarreling
with CALVIN. This does not mean that he renounced the Reformed Church, or
abandoned the Protestant party. For it was possible to quarrel with Calvin, to
reject his views on predestination and on persecution, and spurn the discipline
of the Church of Geneva, and yet, after all, be as good a Protestant, and member
of the Reformed Church, as CALVIN himself.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From the extracts furnished above form an
introductory notice by the
editor</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f5</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">of the work
already referred to, (&#8220;Lettres de Calvin a Jaque de Bourgogne,&#8221;) it
will abundantly appear that the writer is desirous to present as favorable a
view of James of Burgundy as the circumstances of the case will at all admit of.
His attempt to show that James of Burgundy may have, after all, remained in
connection with the Reformed Church, appears to be more ingenious than solid,
and seems directly at variance with a statement by CALVIN in his <i>second
</i>Dedication to this part of his Commentaries, to this effect, that the
individual to whom the former Dedication was addressed &#8220;has intentionally
made it his object, not merely to withdraw as much as possible from me
personally, but also<i> to have no connection with our
Church</i>.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f6</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">This
expression naturally conveys the idea that he had not simply left the Church of
Geneva, but had withdrawn entirely from the Reformed Church. But however matters
may have been as to this, the case, as a whole, was of such a nature as could
not fail to be painful in the extreme to the mind of CALVIN. In proportion,
however, to the pain excited in his mind by this distressing case, must have
been the happiness afforded him by an occurrence of an opposite nature, which
took place about the same time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE CHURCH OF GENEVA, which had suffered from the
defection of James of Burgundy, was strengthened by the accession of an Italian
nobleman, GALEAZUS CARACCIOLUS, who, having been led to espouse the Protestant
faith, took up his residence at Geneva in the year 1551, with a view to enjoy
the society of Calvin, and have opportunity of attending upon his ministry. The
particulars of his history, and more especially of his conversion from Popery,
are interestingly narrated in a work entitled &#8212; &#8220;THE ITALIAN CONVERT
&#8212; NEWES FROM ITALY OF A SECOND MOSES &#8212; THE LIFE OF GALEACIUS
CARACCIOLUS, THE NOBLE MARQUESSE OF VICO,&#8221; etc. London,
1635.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This work was written originally in Italian,
&#8220;by Nicola Balbani, minister of the Italian Church in Geneva. It was
translated into Latin by Beza; into French by Minutoli and by Sieur de Lestan;
and into English by William
Crashaw.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f7</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The writer of this work referred to presents, in the
dedicatory epistle, the following brief summary of the leading facts of this
interesting case: &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;I present you with as strange a story as, out
of the holy stories, afore it be laid down at large? Thus it is: &#8212;
Galeacius Caracciolus, son and heir-apparent to Calantonius, Marquesse of Vicum
in Naples, bred, borne and brought up in Popery &#8212; a courtier to the
Emperor Charles the Fifth, nephew to the Pope, Paul the Fourth, being married to
the Duke of Nucerne&#8217;s daughter, and having by her six goodly children, at
a sermon of Peter Martyr&#8217;s was first untouched, &#8212; after reading
Scripture, and other good means, was fully converted &#8212; labored with his
lady, but could not persuade her; therefore, that he might enjoy Christ and
serve Him with a good conscience, he left his lands, livings and honors of a
Marquesdome, the comforts of his lady and children, the pleasures of Italy, his
credit with the Emperor, his kindred with the Pope, and forsaking all for the
love of Jesus Christ, came to Geneva, and there lived a poor and mean, yet an
honorable and a holy life for forty years; and though his father, his lady, his
kinsmen, yea, the Emperor and Pope did all they could to reclaim him, yet
continued he constant to the end, and lived and died the blessed servant of God,
leaving behind him a rare examples to all
ages.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f8</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Caracciolus was born at Naples in January 1517. His
father&#8217;s name was Calantonius, who was descended from the ancient and
noble family of the Caracciolies in the district of Capua, and was elevated by
Charles the Fifth to the rank of Vico. His mother was descended from the noble
family of the Caraffi, and was sister to Pope Paul the Fourth. His wife,
Victoria, was daughter to the Duke of Nuceria, one of the principal noblemen of
Italy. She brought him a large fortune. He had by her six children &#8212; four
sons and two daughters. His mind was first influenced in favor of the Protestant
religion by repeated conversations held by him with a nobleman nearly related to
him, who had, along with various persons of distinction in Italy, been induced
to renounce Popery, chiefly through the instrumentality of a Spanish nobleman,
who at that time resided at Naples &#8212; Joannes Waldesius. The more immediate
instrument, however, of his conversion, was the celebrated Peter Martyr
Vermilius. Caracciolus having from curiousity gone to hear him, was savingly
impressed by what he heard; and it is to be noticed as an interesting
coincidence, that the means of his conversion was a discourse on a passage in
the <i>First Epistle to the Corinthians</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;At that time PETER MARTYR was in hand with
Paul&#8217;s First Epistle to the Corinthians, and as he was showing the
weakness and deceitfulness of the judgment of man&#8217;s reason in spiritual
things, as likewise the power and efficacy of the Word of God in those men in
whom the Lord worketh by His Spirit &#8212; amongst other things he used this
simile or comparison: If a man, walking in a large place, see afar off men and
women dancing together, and hear no sound of instrument, he will judge them mad,
or at least foolish; but if he come nearer them, and perceive their order and
hear their music, and mark their measures and their courses, he will then be of
another mind, and not only take delight in seeing them, but feel a desire in
himself to bear them company and dance with them. Even the same (said Martyr)
betides many men, who, when they behold in others a sudden and great change of
their looks, apparel, behavior, and whole course of life, at the first sight
they impute to melancholy, or some other foolish humor; but if they look more
narrowly into the matter, and begin to hear and perceive the harmony and sweet
consent of God&#8217;s Spirit, and His word in them, by the joint power of which
two this change was made and wrought, (which afore they counted folly,) then
they change their opinion of them, and first of all begin to like them, and that
change in them, and afterwards feel in themselves a motion and desire to imitate
them, and to be of the number of such men, who, forsaking the world and his
vanities, do think that they ought to reform their lives by the rule of the
gospel, that so they may come to true and sound holiness. This comparison, by
the grace of God&#8217;s Spirit, wrought so wonderfully with Galeacius, as
himself hath often told more carefully to restrain his affections from following
the world and his pleasures, as before they did, and to set his mind about
seeking out the truths of religion and the way to true happiness... And thus
far, in this short time, had the Lord wrought with him by that sermon: &#8212;
as <i>first</i>, to consider with himself seriously whether he were right or no:
<i>secondly</i>, to take up an exercise continual of reading Scripture:
<i>thirdly</i>, to change his former company and make choice of better. And this
time was done in the year 1541, and in the four and twentieth year of his
age.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Caracciolus having thus had his eyes opened to the
errors of Popery, and being fully satisfied that it was his duty to embrace the
Protestant faith, found himself placed in peculiarly trying circumstances. Even
those of his countrymen who were personally inclined towards the Protestant
cause could not be persuaded to hold meetings in private for their mutual
edification, but were prepared no merely to conceal their real sentiments, but
even to practice occasional conformity to the rites of Popery. In these
circumstances he was called to consider whether he would be prepared to spend
the remainder of his life in daily violation of the dictates of conscience, or
forsake all for Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;The sacrifice of his secular dignities and
possessions did not cost him a sigh, but as often as he reflected on the
distress which his departure would inflict on his aged father, who, with
parental pride, regarded him as the heir of his titles and the stay of his
family, &#8212; or his wife whom he loved, and by whom he was loved tenderly,
and on the dear pledges of their union, he was thrown into a state of
unutterable anguish, and started back with horror from the resolution to which
conscience had brought him. At length, by an heroic effort of zeal, which few
can imitate and many will condemn, he came to the determination of bursting the
tenderest ties which perhaps ever bound man to country and
kindred.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">The reader will observe that the author of the work
already referred to &#8212; &#8220;The Life of Galeacius Caracciolus,&#8221;
etc., entitles it &#8212; &#8220;The Italian Convert &#8212; Newes from Italy of
a Second Moses&#8221; &#8212; and in accordance with this title the writer, in
the dedicatory epistle prefixed to the work, institutes a comparison between
Moses and the subjects of his narrative in a variety of interesting
particulars.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;I may say much rather than Jacob &#8212; Few
and evil have my days been; yet in these few days of mine something have I seen,
more have I read, more have I heard; yet never saw I, heard I, or read I any
example (all things laid together) more nearly seconding the examples of Moses
than this of the most renowned Marquesse Galeacius. Moses was the adopted son of
a king&#8217;s daughter; Galeacius the natural son and heir apparent to a
Marquesse; Moses a courtier in the court of Pharoah, Galeacius in the court of
the emperor Charles the Fifth; Moses by adoption a kin to a Queen, Galeacius by
marriage to a Duke, by blood son to a Marquesse, nephew to a Pope; Moses in
possibility of a kingdom, he in possession of a Marquesdome; Moses in his youth
brought up in the heathenism of Egypt, Galeacius noozeled in the superstition of
Popery; Moses at last saw the truth and embraced it, so did Galeacius; Moses
openly fell from the heathenism of Egypt, so did Galeacius from the superstition
of Popery. But all this is nothing to that which they both suffered for their
conscience. What Moses suffered Saint Paul tells us &#8212; &#8216;Moses, when
he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharoah&#8217;s daughter,
and chose rather to suffer adversities with the people of God, than to enjoy the
pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the rebuke of Christ greater riches
than the treasures of Egypt.&#8217; Nay, Moses had rather be a base brick maker
amongst the oppressed Israelites, being true Christians, than to be the son of a
king&#8217;s daughter in the court of Pharaoh amongst idolaters. In like case
noble Galeacius, when he was come to years and knowledge of Christ, refused to
be called son and heir to a Marquesse, cup-bearer to an Emperor, nephew to a
Pope, and chose rather to suffer affliction, persecution, banishment, losse of
lands, livings, wife, children, honors and preferments, than to enjoy the sinful
pleasures of Italy for a season, esteeming the rebuke of Christ greater riches
than the honors of a Marquesdome without Christ, and therefore, seeing he must
either want Christ or want them, he despoiled himself of all these to gain
Christ. So excellent was the fact of Moses, and so heroical, that the Holy Ghost
vouchsafes it remembrance both in the Old and New Testament, that so the Church
in all ages might know it and admire it, and doth chronicle it in the epistle to
the Hebrews almost two thousand years after it was done. If God himself did so
to Moses, shall not God&#8217;s Church be careful to commend to posterity this
second Moses, whose love to Christ Jesus was so zealous, and so inflamed by the
heavenly fire of God&#8217;s Spirit, that no earthly temptations could either
quench or abate it; but to win Christ, and to enjoy Him in the liberty of His
Word and Sacraments, he delicately contemned the honors and pleasures of the
Marquesdome of Vicum &#8212; Vicum, one of the paradises of Naples, Naples, the
paradise of Italy &#8212; Italy of Europe &#8212; Europe of the earth; yet all
these paradises were nothing to him in comparison of attaining the celestial
paradise, there to live with Jesus Christ.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;And for my part I freely and truly profess, I
have been often ravished with admiration of this noble example &#8212; to see an
Italian so excellent a Christian &#8212; one so near the Pope so near to Jesus
Christ, and such blessed fruit to blossom in the Pope&#8217;s own garden; and to
see a nobleman of Italy forsake that for Christ, for which I fear many amongst
us would forsake Christ Himself. And surely (I confess truth) the serious
consideration of this so late, so true, so strange an example hath been a spur
to my slowness, and whetted my dull spirits, and made me to esteem more highly
of religion than I did before. I know it is an accusation of myself, and a
disclosing of my own shame to confess thus much; but it is a glory to God, an
honor to religion, a credit to the truth, and a praise to this noble Marquesse,
and therefore I will not hide it. And why should I shame to confess it, when
that famous and renowned man of God, holy Calvin, freely
confesseth,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f10</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">as in the
sequel of this story you shall hear, that this nobleman&#8217;s example did
greatly confirm him in his religion, and did revive and strengthen his faith,
and cheer up all the holy graces of God in him.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Caracciolus had no sooner left Naples, forsaking
country and kindred for the sake of Christ and his gospel, than every possible
effort was employed by his family and relatives, and all that were concerned for
the credit of the religion that he had abandoned, to induce him to
return.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On his refusing to do so, &#8220;sentence was passed
against him, and he was deprived of all the property which he inherited from his
mother.&#8221; &#8220;In the following year... an offer was made to him in the
name of his uncle now POPE PAUL
IV.,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f11</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">that he
should have a protection against the Inquisition, provided he would take up his
residence within the Venetian States; a proposal to which neither his safety nor
the dictates of his conscience would permit him to acceded.&#8221; He went
repeatedly to Italy, and had interviews with his aged father, but was refused
the privilege of seeing his wife and family, until about six years after he had
quitted Naples. His wife, VICTORIA, then wrote to him, earnestly requesting an
interview with him, and fixing the place of meeting. This she did on two
different occasions, but in both instances, on his arrival at the appointed
place, after a fatiguing and dangerous journey, he had the disappointment of
finding that she did not make her appearance. At length, impatient of delay, he
went once more to Italy, and at his father&#8217;s house had an interview with
Victoria, when he entreated her to accompany him to Geneva, &#8220;promising
that no restraint should be laid on her conscience, and that she should be at
liberty to practice her religion under his roof. After many protestations of
affection, she finally replied, that she could not reside out of Italy, nor in a
place where any other religion than that of the Church of Rome was professed,
and farther, that she could not live with him as her husband so long as he was
infected with heresy.&#8221; The scene at their final parting was peculiarly
tender. &#8220;Bursting into tears, and embracing her husband, Victoria besought
him not to leave her a widow, and her babies fatherless. The children joined in
the entreaties of their mother, and the eldest daughter, a fine girl of
thirteen, grasping his knees, refused to part with him. How he disengaged
himself, he knew not; for the first thing which brought him to recollection was
the noise made by the sailors on reaching the opposite shore of the Gulf.&#8221;
(of Venice.) &#8220;He used often to relate to his intimate friends, that the
parting scene continued long to haunt his mind; and that not only in dreams, but
also in reveries into which he fell during the day; he thought he heard the
angry voice of his father, saw Victoria in tears, and felt his daughter dragging
at his heels.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f12</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Caracciolus spent the remainder of his days at
Geneva, with the exception of five years spent by him at Nion and Lausanne, for
the sake of economy in his living, and continued steadfast in his attachment to
the Protestant faith. He was on terms of intimate friendship with CALVIN, which
continued unbroken until the death of the Reformer in 1564 &#8212; thirteen
years subsequent to the time when Carcciolus went to reside at Geneva.
<i>One</i> step taken by him during his exile must be regarded as (to say the
least) of greatly questionable propriety &#8212; that of contracting a second
marriage, about nine years after he went to reside at Geneva. CALVIN, on being
consulted by him as to the propriety of such a step, &#8220;felt great scruples
as to the expediency&#8221; of it, but &#8220;ultimately gave his approbation to
it, after he had consulted the divines of Switzerland and the
Grisons.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f13</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">Accordingly,
the courts of Geneva having legally pronounced a sentence of divorce against
Victoria, on the ground of her obstinate refusal to live with her husband, he
married Anne Fremejere, the widow of a French refugee from Rouen, with whom he
continued to live happily in a state of dignified
frugality.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f14</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">He was held,
deservedly, by the Church of Geneva, and wherever he was known, in the greatest
esteem, as one whose piety was of a very high order. Matthew Henry, in one part
of his Writings,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f15</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">makes
mention of &#8220;a noble saying of the Marquis of Vico, &#8216;Let their money
perish with them, who esteem all the wealth of this world worth one hour&#8217;s
communion with God in Jesus Christ,&#8217;&#8221; and assuredly the devotedness
manifested by him to the cause of Christ affords ample evidence that the
sentiment was deeply inwrought into his mind. He died at Geneva in 1568, in the
sixty-eighth year of his age.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">CALVIN&#8217;S Commentary on Paul&#8217;s Epistles to
the CORINTHIANS having, (in common with a large portion of his Commentaries on
other parts of the Scriptures) been translated by himself into French for the
benefit of his countrymen, the Latin original and French version have been
carefully collated, and any additional terms or clauses that occur in the
latter, tending to bring out more fully the Author&#8217;s meaning, will be
found given at the bottom of the page. &#8220;CALVIN,&#8221; says Pasquier
(Biographia Evangelica) &#8220;was a good writer, both in Latin and French, and
our French tongue is highly obliged to him for enriching it with so great a
number of fine expressions.&#8221; D&#8217;AUBIGNE, when speaking of
CALVIN&#8217;S early education, states that &#8220;he made great progress in
Latin literature. He became familiar with Cicero, and learned from this great
master to employ the language of the Romans with a facility, purity, and ease
that excite the admiration even of his enemies. But at the same time, he found
riches in this language which he afterwards transferred to his own.&#8221;
&#8220;CALVIN when called upon to discuss and to prove, enriched his
mother-tongue with modes of connection and dependence, with shadows,
transitions, and dialectic forms, that it did not as yet
possess.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f16</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The OLD ENGLISH TRANSLATION of this part of
CALVIN&#8217;S Commentaries having been published in black letter in 1573, about
thirty years after the Commentary itself was first published by CALVIN, it is
not to be wondered that it abounds with obsolete terms and phrases, fitted to
render it unpalatable to modern taste. In addition to this, the Author&#8217;s
meaning has, in not a few instances, been manifestly misapprehended, and in
almost all cases CALVIN&#8217;S critical observations are entirely omitted. The
Translator, Mr. Thomas Timme, was the author of various works, one of which more
particularly &#8212; quaintly entitled &#8220;A Silver Bell,&#8221; appears to
have gained much celebrity. It has been thought proper to subjoin to this
Preface, a <i>fac-simile </i>of the title-page to this old English version, with
a copy of &#8220;The Epistle Dedicatorie&#8221; to the ARCHBISHOP OF
CANTERBURY.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In preparing the present Translation of this part of
CALVIN&#8217;S COMMENTARIES, care has been taken to bring out as fully as
possible the Author&#8217;s meaning, while the reader will find in a variety of
instances in the <i>Notes </i>some additional light thrown on some important but
difficult passages &#8212; derived chiefly from the labors of interpreters that
have appeared subsequently to the times of CALVIN. The Translator is fully
persuaded that CALVIN&#8217;S Commentaries on <i>both </i>of Paul&#8217;s
Epistles to the Corinthians will be found, in so far at least as the
Author&#8217;s meaning is properly brought out in the Translation, to justify
most amply the confident expectation of the Author himself, (as expressed in his
<i>first </i>Dedication to the Commentary on the <i>First </i>Epistle) &#8212;
that it would &#8220;furnish no ordinary assistance for thoroughly understanding

<div><font face="Palatino">WOULD that this my Commentary, in which I have
attempted to expound an Epistle not less obscure than useful, published, as it
now is, in accordance with the earnest solicitations of many for a long time
past, and even reiterated demands, may be correspondingly answerable to the
hopes and wishes of all! I say this, not with the view of earning from this work
any need of praise &#8212; an ambition that ought to be quite away from the
minds of Christ&#8217;s servants &#8212; but from a desire that it may do good
at all, which it cannot do, if it does meet with acceptance. I have, for my
part, labored with the utmost faithfulness, and with no less diligence, that it
may, without any show, be of the greatest service to the Church of God. How far
I have succeeded, my readers will judge for themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This much at least I am confident that I have secured
&#8212; that it will furnish no ordinary assistance for thoroughly understanding
Paul&#8217;s mind. That it will to you, most illustrious Sir, prove exceedingly
acceptable, is so far from appearing to me doubtful, that I find it necessary
even to warn you against allowing yourself to be carried beyond due bounds by an
undue attachment to me, though, if it should so happen, I shall nevertheless
regard your judgment as of so much importance, that I shall reckon myself to
have succeeded admirably in my labors, if they have secured your unqualified
approbation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In dedicating my Work to
you,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f17</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">however, I
have not been influenced solely by the hope of its being acceptable to you, but
by various other considerations; and more especially this, that your personal
character corresponded admirably with the argument of Paul&#8217;s Epistle. For
while too many in the present day convert the Gospel into a cold and shadowy
philosophy, imagining that they have sufficiently discharged their duty, if they
simply give a nod of assent to what they hear, you, on the other hand, are an
illustrious pattern of that living
efficacy,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f18</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">which Paul
testifies, ought to breathe in the Gospel. This, assuredly, I do not mention on
your account, but because I consider it to be of great importance by way of
example.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It would have been an important point gained, though
there had been nothing more than this, that, in the first order of nobility, in
the elevated station of honor which you had obtained, and amidst a large
abundance of fortune and wealth, (situations in life that are all of them at the
present day overrun with so many corruptions,) you have yourself lived
moderately and temperately, and have regulated your household in a chaste and
honorable discipline. You have done both admirably. For you have conducted
yourself in such a manner, as to lead all to perceive, by clear tokens, that you
are altogether free from ambition. While retaining your splendor, as was
necessary, it has been in such a manner, that, moderate as has been your style
of living, no symptom of meanness was to be seen; while, at the same time, it
was abundantly apparent that you avoided magnificence rather than courted it.
You have shown yourself affable and kind to all, so that all were constrained to
commend your moderation, while there was not even the slightest token of
haughtiness or insolence to give offense to any one. As to your household,
suffice it to say, in one word, that is has been regulated in such a manner, as
to reflect the mind and manners of the Lord, as a mirror does the person. Even
this would have been an illustrious and rare pattern of virtue for
imitation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I reckon it, however, of much greater importance,
that while you have been groundlessly charged before the Emperor, through the
calumnies of wicked men, and that, too, simply because Christ&#8217;s kingdom,
whenever it begins to flourish in any quarter, drives them to madness and fury,
you bear up with unconquerable magnanimity, and are now in exile from your
native country, with no less credit than you had when adorning it previously
with your presence. Other things I pass over, because it were tedious to
enlarge. It ought indeed to be more than simply common and customary among
Christians, not merely to leave contentedly behind them estates, castles, and
princely domains, for Christ&#8217;s sake, but even cheerfully and willingly to
despise in comparison with Him every thing that is most valued under heaven. In
consequence, however, of the backwardness and indifference, too, of almost all
of us, as the virtue itself is worthy of special admiration, so when it is seen
in you so conspicuously, I do most earnestly desire that it may stir up many to
a desire of emulation, that they may not in future be always lurking idly in
their nests, but may at length discover openly some spark, if they have any, of
Christian spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to your being assaulted from time to time with
fresh accusations by those who are manifestly the infuriated enemies of piety,
they will gain nothing by this, except to make themselves more and more odious
by their gross indulgence in falsehood. At least every man in his senses,
perceives that they are mad dogs, that would fain tear you in pieces, and when
they cannot bite, take revenge upon themselves by barking. It is well that they
do so at a distance, so as to be perfectly harmless. From the injuries of the
wicked, however, much as they have diminished your pecuniary resources, there
has accrued to you no less glory among the pious. You, however, as becomes a
Christian, look beyond this. For you rest satisfied with nothing short of the
heavenly glory, which is laid up for us with God, and will be manifested, so
soon as &#8220;our outward man perishes.&#8221; &#8212;

intentionally made it his object, not merely to withdraw as much as possible
from me personally, but also to have no connection with our Church, he has left
himself no just ground of complaint. It is, however, with reluctance that I
deviate from my custom, so as to erase any one&#8217;s name from my writings,
and it grieves me that that individual should have quitted the lofty eminence
that I had assigned him,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so as not to hold out a light to others,
as it was my desire that he
should.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f20</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As, however, it is not in my power to
remedy this evil, let him, so far as I am concerned, remain buried, as I am
desirous even now of sparing his credit by not mentioning his
name.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To you, however, most illustrious Sir, I should have
had to look out for some apology, for now putting you in his place, did I not
freely take this liberty, from the confidence that I have in your incredible
kindness of disposition, and your affection towards me personally, which is well
known to all our friends. To return again to wishes, would that I had known you
ten years sooner, for I should not have had occasion at present for making any
change. So far as an example to the Church generally is concerned, it is a
fortunate circumstance; because there will not only be no loss incurred by
burying in oblivion the individual who has withdrawn from us, but in place of
him we shall have in you a
compensation</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> much more abundant and every way
superior. For although you do not court public applause &#8212; satisfied to
have God alone as your witness &#8212; and though it is not my design to herald
your praises, yet it were not proper to conceal altogether from my readers what
is useful and profitable to be known: &#8212; that a man, sprung from a family
of the first rank,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> prosperous in honors and wealth, blest
with a spouse of the noblest descent and strictest virtue, a numerous offspring,
domestic quiet and harmony, and happy in his entire condition in life, has, of
his own accord, with the view of joining the camp of Christ, quitted his native
country, has left behind him a fertile and lovely domain, a splendid patrimony,
and a residence not less commodious than delightful, has stript himself of
domestic splendor, has left father, wife, children, relatives, and connections,
and after bidding farewell to so many worldly allurements, satisfied with our
mean style, adopts our frugal and homely way of living, just as if he were one
of ourselves.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f23</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I make mention, however, of these things
to others, in such a way as not to overlook at the same time my own individual
advantage; for if I hold up here, as in a mirror, your virtues before the eyes
of my readers, in order that they may set themselves to imitate them, it were a
shame if I, who have a nearer view of them, were not more keenly affected by a
daily and distinct contemplation of them. As, however, I for my part know by
experience the tendency of your example to strengthen my faith and piety, and
all the children of God that live here acknowledge, as I do, that they have
derived from this source no ordinary advantage, I have thought that it might be
of importance, that, by my publishing it, the like benefit were made to flow out
to a still greater distance. But for
this,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it were utter folly to expatiate in the
praises of a man, whose nature and disposition are at the farthest distance
possible from ostentation, and that, too, before persons who are in foreign and
far distant regions. Hence, if any considerable number to whom, in consequence
of distance, you have been hitherto unknown, shall, on this admirable example
being presented to them, prepare to imitate it, by leaving the nests to which
they too fondly cling, I shall have obtained an ample reward for what I have
written.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought, indeed, to have been more than simply
common and customary among Christians, not simply to leave contentedly behind
them estates, castles, and princely domains, where Christ cannot be followed
otherwise, but even cheerfully and willingly to despise, in comparison with Him,
everything that is most valued under
heaven.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Such, however, is the backwardness or
rather indifference that pervades all of us, that, while many give a cold
assent</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f26</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to the doctrine of the gospel, scarcely
one in a hundred will, for the sake of it, if he possesses the most
insignificant little farm, allow himself to be torn from it. Scarcely one is
induced, without the greatest difficulty, to renounce the smallest conveniences:
so very far are they from being prepared to abandon, as were befitting, life
itself.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Above all things, I should wish that all
resembled you in that first of all excellences &#8212; self-denial.<i> </i>For
you are well prepared to bear witness to me, and I in like manner to you, how
little pleasure we feel in cultivating the society of those, who, after leaving
their native country, come at length to manifest, that they have not left their
old dispositions behind them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, it were better that my readers should
revolve in their minds, more than I can express in words, I now turn to entreat,
that God, who has encouraged you hitherto by the wonderful efficacy of His
Spirit, may furnish you with an unconquerable perseverance unto the end. For I
am well aware with what arduous conflicts God has exercised you, and from which,
in accordance with your singular prudence, you conclude, that a hard and
laborious warfare is still awaiting you. Well knowing, however, from ample
experience, how necessary it is for us to have a hand held out to us from
heaven, you will, of your own accord, unite with me in imploring from that
source the gift of perseverance. As for myself, I will entreat Christ our King,
to whom supreme power has been given by the Father, and in whose hands all the
treasures of spiritual blessings have been deposited, that He may long preserve
you safely to us for the spread of His kingdom; and that He may in you
accomplish farther triumphs over Satan and his bands.</font><br></div>

TO THE</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CORINTHIANS</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE advantages of this Epistle are various and
manifold; for it contains many special
topics,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f28</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the handling of which successively in
their order, will show how necessary they are to be known. Nay, it will appear
in part from the argument itself, in the recital of which I shall study to be
brief, yet in such a way as to take in the whole, without omitting any of the
leading points.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Corinth, as every one knows, was a wealthy and
celebrated city of Achaia. While it was destroyed by L. Mummius for no other
reason than that the advantageousness of its situation excited his suspicions,
posterity afterwards rebuilt it for the same reason that Mummius had for
destroying it.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f29</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The convenience of the situation, too,
occasioned its being restored again in a short time. For as it had the Aegean
Sea contiguous on the one side, and the Ionian on the other, and as it was a
thoroughfare between Attica and the Peloponnesus, it was very conveniently
situated for imports and exports. Paul, after teaching there for a year and a
half, as Luke mentions in the Acts, constrained at length by the wickedness of
the Jews, sailed thence into Syria
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
18:11, 18.) During Paul&#8217;s absence false apostles had crept in, not, in my
opinion, to disturb the Church openly with wicked doctrines, or designedly to
undermine sound doctrine; but, priding themselves in the splendor and
magnificence of their address, or rather, being puffed up with an empty
loftiness of speech, they looked upon Paul&#8217;s simplicity, and even the
Gospel itself, with contempt. They afterwards, by their ambition, gave occasion
for the Church being split into various parties; and, last of all, reckless as
to every thing, provided only they were themselves held in estimation, made it
their aim to promote their own honor, rather than Christ&#8217;s kingdom and the
people&#8217;s welfare.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the other hand, as those vices prevailed at
Corinth with which mercantile cities are wont to be particularly infested,
&#8212; luxury, pride, vanity, effeminacy, insatiable covetousness, and
ambition; so they had found their way even into the Church itself, so that
discipline was greatly relaxed. Nay more, purity of doctrine had already begun
to decline, so that the main article of religion &#8212; the resurrection of the
dead &#8212; was called in question. Yet amidst this great corruption in every
department, they were satisfied with themselves, equally as though every thing
had been on the best possible footing. Such are Satan&#8217;s usual artifices.
If he cannot prevent the progress of doctrine, he creeps forward secretly to
make an attack upon it: if lie cannot by direct falsehoods suppress it, so as to
prevent it from coming forth to light, he digs secret mines for its overthrow;
and in fine, if he cannot alienate men&#8217;s minds from it, he leads them by
little and little to deviate from it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to those worthless persons, however, who had
disturbed the Corinthian Church, it is not without good ground that I conclude
that they were not open enemies of the truth. We see that Paul nowhere else
spares false doctrines. The Epistles to the Galatians, to the Colossians, to the
Philippians, and to Timothy, are short; yet in all of them lie does not merely
censure the false apostles, but also points out at the same time in what
respects they injured the Church. Nor is it without good reason; for believers
must not merely be admonished as to the persons whom they ought to shun, they
must also be shown the evil against which they should be on their guard. I
cannot therefore believe that, in this comparatively long Epistle, he was
prepared to pass over in silence what he carefully insists upon in others that
are much shorter. In addition to this, he makes mention of many faults of the
Corinthians, and even some that are apparently trivial, so that he appears to
have had no intention of passing over any thing in them that was deserving of
reproof. Besides, he must, in any other view, be regarded as wasting many words
in disputing against those absurd teachers and prating
orators.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He censures their ambition; he reproves
them for transforming the gospel into human philosophy; he shows that they are
destitute of the efficacy of the Spirit, inasmuch as they are taken up with mere
ornaments of speech, and seek after a mere dead letter; but not a word is there
as to a single false doctrine. Hence I conclude that they were persons who did
not openly take away any thing from the substance of the gospel, but, as they
burned with a misdirected eagerness for distinction, I am of opinion that, with
the view of making themselves admired, they contrived a new method of teaching,
at variance with the simplicity of Christ. This must necessarily be the case
with all that have not as yet thrown off self, that they may engage unreservedly
in the Lord&#8217;s work. The first step towards serving Christ is to lose sight
of ourselves, and think only of the Lord&#8217;s glory and the salvation of men.
Farther, no one will ever be qualified for teaching that has not first himself
tasted the influence of the gospel, so as to speak not so much with the mouth,
as with the dispositions of the heart. Hence, those that are not regenerated by
the Spirit of God &#8212; not having felt inwardly the influence of the gospel,
and know not what is meant when it is said that we must become new creatures,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:7) have a dead preaching, whereas it ought to be lively and efficacious; and,
with the view of playing off their part, they disfigure the gospel by painting
it over, so as to make it a sort of worldly philosophy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor was it difficult for those of whom we are now
speaking to accomplish this at Corinth. For merchants are usually led away with
outward disguises, and they do not merely allow themselves to be imposed upon by
the empty show with which they deceive others, but in a manner take delight in
this. Besides, as they have delicate ears, so that they cannot bear to be rudely
taken to task, so if they meet with teachers of the milder sort, that will
handle them gently, they give them, as it were, a reward in turn by caressing
them.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is so, I grant, everywhere; but it is
more especially common ill wealthy and mercantile cities. Paul, who was in other
respects a god-like man, and distinguished by admirable virtues, was,
nevertheless, not adorned with outward elegance, and was not puffed up with
show, with the view of setting himself off to advantage. In fine, as he was
inwardly replenished with the genuine excellence<i> </i>of the Spirit, so he had
nothing of outward show. He knew not to flatter, and was not concerned to please
men.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
1:10.) The one object that he had in view was, that Christ might reign, himself
and all others being brought under subjection to him. As the Corinthians were
desirous of doctrine that was ingenious, rather than useful, the gospel had no
relish for them. As they were eager for new things, Christ had now become stale.
Or if they had not as yet fallen into these vices, they were, nevertheless,
already of their own accord predisposed to corruptions of that nature. Such were
the facilities afforded to the false apostles for adulterating the doctrine of
Christ among them; for <i>adulterated </i>it is, when its native simplicity is
stained, and in a manner painted over, so as to differ nothing from worldly
philosophy. Hence, to suit the taste of the Corinthians, they seasoned their
preaching in such a way that the true savor of the gospel was destroyed. We are
now in possession of the design that Paul had in view in writing this Epistle. I
shall now take in the sum of the argument, by noting down briefly the particular
heads of discourse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He begins with an ascription of
praise,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that is in effect an exhortation, that
they should go on as they have begun, and in this way he soothes them
beforehand, that he may make them the more docile. Immediately afterwards,
however, he proceeds to chide them, making mention of the dissensions with which
their Church was infested. Being desirous to cure this evil, he calls upon them
to exchange haughtiness for humility. For he overthrows all the wisdom of the
world, that the preaching of the Cross may alone be exalted. He also at the same
time abases them as individuals, in exhorting them to look around and see what
class of persons chiefly the Lord has adopted as members of his
flock.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>second chapter </i>he brings forward, by
way of example, his own preaching, which, in the account of men, was base and
contemptible, but had nevertheless been signalized by the influence of the
Spirit. And in the meantime he unfolds at greater length the sentiment, that
there is a heavenly and secret wisdom that is contained in the gospel, which
cannot be apprehended by any acuteness or perspicacity of intellect, or by any
perception of sense, and is not influenced by human reasonings, and needs no
meretricious ornament of words or embellishment, but simply by the revelation of
the Spirit comes to be known by the understandings of men, and is sealed upon
their hearts. He at length comes to this conclusion, that the preaching of the
gospel does not merely differ widely from the wisdom of the flesh, and consists
in the abasement of the Cross, but cannot be estimated as to its true nature by
the judgment of the flesh; and this he does, with the view of drawing them off
from a mistaken confidence in their own judgment, by which they measured every
thing amiss.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The beginning of the <i>third chapter </i>contains
the application of this last department of the subject to their case. For Paul
complains, that, being carnal, they were scarcely capable of learning the first
rudiments of the gospel. He intimates in this way, that the distaste which they
had contracted for the word, arose from no fault in the word itself, but from
their ignorance; and at the same time he indirectly admonishes them, that they
need to have their minds renewed, before they will begin to judge aright. He
afterwards shows in what estimation the ministers of the gospel ought to be held
&#8212; that it ought to be in such a way, that the honor given to them does not
in any degree detract from the glory that is due to God &#8212; as there is one
Lord, and all are his servants: all are mere instruments; he alone imparts
efficacy, and from him proceeds the entire result. He shows them, at the same
time, what they ought to have as their aim &#8212; to build up the Church. He
takes occasion from this to point out the true and proper method of building
aright. It is to have Christ alone as the foundation, and the entire structure
harmonizing with the foundation. And here, having stated in passing that he is a
wise master-builder, he admonishes those that come after him to make the
end</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> correspond with the beginning. He exhorts
also the Corinthians not to allow their souls to be desecrated by corrupt
doctrines, inasmuch as they are temples of God. Here he again brings to naught
proud fleshly wisdom, that the knowledge of Christ may alone be in estimation
among believers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the beginning of the <i>fourth chapter </i>he
points out what is the office of a true apostle. And as it was their corrupt
judgment that prevented them from recognizing him as such, putting it aside, he
appeals to the day of the Lord. Farther, as he was contemptible in their view
from an appearance of abasement, he teaches them that this ought to be regarded
as an honor to him rather than a disgrace. He afterwards brings forward tokens,
from which it might in reality appear that he had not consulted his own glory,
or his own belly
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451618&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
16:18), but had with faithfulness devoted himself exclusively to Christ&#8217;s
work. He comes at length to infer what honor is due to him from the Corinthians.
In the close of the chapter he recommends Timothy to them, until he shall come
to them himself; and at the same time he forewarns them that, on his coming, he
will openly discover how little account he makes of those empty boastings by
which the false apostles endeavored to recommend themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>fifth chapter </i>he takes them to task,
for silently tolerating an incestuous connection between a son-in-law and a
mother-in-law, and instructs them that in connection with a crime of such
enormity, there was good reason why they should be covered with shame, instead
of being elated with pride. From this he passes on to lay down a general
doctrine to this effect, that. crimes of that nature ought to be punished with
excommunication, that indulgence in sin may be repressed, and that the infection
may not spread from one individual to the others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>sixth chapter </i>consists chiefly of two
parts. In the <i>first </i>he inveighs against law-suits, with which they
harassed one another, before unbelievers, to the great dishonor of the gospel.
In the <i>second </i>he reproves indulgence in fornication, which had come to
such a pitch, that it was almost looked upon as a lawful thing. He sets out with
a heavy threatening, and afterwards enforces that threatening with
arguments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>seventh chapter </i>contains a discussion in
reference to virginity, marriage, and celibacy. So far as we may conjecture from
Paul&#8217;s words, a superstitious notion had become prevalent among the
Corinthians of this nature &#8212; that virginity was a distinguished, and in a
manner angelic virtue, so that marriage was held by them in contempt, as though
it had been a profane thing. With the view of removing this error, he teaches
that every one must consider what his gift is, and not strive in this matter
beyond his ability, inasmuch as all have not the same calling. Accordingly he
shows who they are that may abstain from marriage, and what ought to be the
design of abstaining from it; and on the other hand, who they are that ought to
enter into the married state, and what is the true principle of Christian
marriage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>eighth chapter </i>he prohibits them from
having fellowship with idolaters in their impure sacrifices, or giving
countenance to anything of such a nature as might injure weak consciences. And
as they excused themselves on this pretext, that they did not by any means
connect. themselves with idolaters in any corrupt sentiment, inasmuch as they
acknowledged in their heart <i>one </i>God, and regarded idols as empty
contrivances, he sets aside this excuse, on this principle that every one ought
to have a regard to his brethren, and that there are many weak persons whose
faith might be staggered by such dissimulation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>ninth chapter </i>he shows that he requires
from them nothing more than he himself practiced, that he may not be reckoned so
unreasonable as to impose upon others a law that he did not himself observe. For
he puts them in mind how he had voluntarily refrained from availing himself of
the liberty granted him by the Lord, lest he should give occasion of offense to
any one, and how he had, in things indifferent, put on as it were various
appearances, with the view of accommodating himself to all, that they may learn
from his example that no one should be so devoted to self as not to endeavor to
accommodate himself to his brethren for their edification.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as the Corinthians were highly satisfied with
themselves, as we said in the outset, in the beginning of the <i>tenth chapter
</i>he admonishes them, from the example of the Jews, not to deceive themselves
by a mistaken confidence; for if they are puffed up on account of outward things
and gifts of God, he shows that the Jews were not without similar ground of
glorying, and yet all this availed them nothing, because they abused their
privileges. After alarming them by this threatening he returns immediately to
the subject on which he had previously entered, and shows how unseemly it is for
those who partake of the Lord&#8217;s Supper to be participants in the
&#8220;table<i> </i>of devils,&#8221; that being a shameful and insufferable
pollution. He at length draws this conclusion, that all our actions should be
regulated in such a manner as not to be an occasion of offense to any
one.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>eleventh chapter </i>he clears the public
assemblies from certain corrupt observances, which were at variance with
Christian decorum and propriety, and shows what gravity and modesty ought to be
exercised when we stand in the view of God and angels. He takes them to task,
however, chiefly for their corrupt administration of the Supper. He subjoins the
method of correcting the abuse that had crept in, which is by calling them back
to our Lord&#8217;s original institution, as the only sure rule and permanent
law of right acting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, many abused spiritual gifts for purposes
of ambition, he enters into a discussion, in the <i>twelfth chapter</i>,<i>
</i>as to the purpose for which they are conferred by God, and also as to what
is the proper and genuine use of them, which is, that by contributing mutually
to each other&#8217;s advantage, we may be united together in one body, that of
Christ. This doctrine he illustrates by drawing a similitude from the human
body, in which, although there are different members and various faculties,
there is nevertheless such a symmetry and fellow-feeling, that what has been
conferred on the members severally contributes to the advantage of the whole
body &#8212; and hence love is the best directress in this matter.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F34</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The subject he follows out at greater length, and
illustrates it more fully in the <i>thirteenth chapter</i>.<i> </i>The sum is
this &#8212; that all things must be viewed in relation to love. He takes
occasion from this to make a digression for the purpose of commending that
virtue, that he may the more strongly recommend the pursuit of it, and may
encourage the Corinthians the more to cultivate it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>fourteenth chapter </i>he begins to point
out more particularly in what respect the Corinthians had erred in the use of
spiritual gifts; and as mere show bulked so much in their estimation, he teaches
them that in all things edification alone should be looked to. For this reason
he prefers prophecy to all other gifts, as being more useful, while the
Corinthians set a higher value on tongues, purely from empty show. In addition
to this, he lays down the right order of procedure, and at the same time
reproves the fault of sounding forth in unknown tongues without any advantage,
while in the meantime the doctrine and exhortations, which ought ever to hold
the foremost place, were left in the background. He afterwards forbids women to
teach publicly, as being a thing unseemly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>fifteenth chapter </i>he inveighs against a
very<i> </i>pernicious error, which, although we can scarcely suppose it to have
spread generally among the Corinthians, had nevertheless taken possession of the
minds of some of them to such a degree, that it was necessary that a remedy
should be openly administered. He appears, however, to have intentionally
delayed mentioning this matter until the close of the Epistle, for this reason
&#8212; that if he had set out with this, or had entered upon it immediately
after commencing,<i> </i>they might have thought that they were all reckoned<i>
</i>to be in fault. The hope of a resurrection, accordingly, he shows to be so
necessary, that, if it is taken away, the whole gospel falls to pieces. Having
established the doctrine itself by powerful arguments, he subjoins also the
principle and manner of it. In fine, he carefully draws out a full discussion of
this point.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>sixteenth chapter </i>consists of two parts.
In the first of these he exhorts them to relieve the necessity of the brethren
at Jerusalem. They were at that time pinched with famine, and they were cruelly
treated by the wicked.<i> </i>The apostles had assigned to Paul the charge of
stirring up the Churches of the Gentiles to afford them help. He accordingly
exharts them to lay up in store whatever they were inclined to contribute, that
it might be<i> </i>transmitted to Jerusalem<i> </i>without delay. He at length
concludes the Epistle with a friendly exhortation and
congratulations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we may gather, as I stated in the outset, that
the Epistle is replete with most profitable doctrine, containing, as it does, a
variety of discussions on many important
topics.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>COMMENTARY ON

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Paul, called to be an
Apostle</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>In this manner does Paul
proceed, in almost all the introductions to his Epistles, with the view of
procuring for his doctrine authority and favor. The former he secures to himself
from the station that had been assigned to him by God, as being an Apostle of
Christ sent by God; the latter by testifying his affection towards those to whom
he writes. We believe much more readily the man whom we look upon as regarding
us with affection, and as faithfully endeavoring to promote our welfare. In this
salutation, therefore, he claims for himself authority, when he speaks of
himself as </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an Apostle of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and that, too, as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called by
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that is, set apart <i>by</i> <i>the
will of God</i>.<i> </i>Now, two things are requisite in any one that would be
listened to in the Church, and would occupy the place of a teacher; for he must
be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>by God to that office, and he must faithfully employ himself in the
discharge of its duties. Paul here lays claim to both. For the name,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Apostle</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>implies that the individual conscientiously acts the part of an ambassador
for Christ
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:19), and proclaims the pure doctrine of the gospel. But as no one
ought to assume this honor to himself, unless he be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to it, he adds, that he had not rashly intruded into it, but had been
appointed</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to it by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us learn, therefore, to take these two things
together when we wish to ascertain what kind of persons we ought to esteem as
ministers of Christ, &#8212; a call to the office, and faithfulness in the
discharge of its duties. For as no man can lawfully assume the designation and
rank of a minister, unless he be called, so it were not enough for any one to be
called, if he does not also fulfill the duties of his office. For the Lord does
not choose ministers that they may be dumb idols, or exercise tyranny under
pretext of their calling, or make their own caprice their law; but. at the same
time marks out what kind of persons they ought to be, and binds them by his
laws, and in fine chooses them for the ministry, or, in other words, that in the
first place they may not be idle, and, secondly, that they may confine
themselves within the limits of their office. Hence, as the apostleship depends
on the <i>calling</i>,<i> </i>so the man who would be reckoned an apostle, must
show himself to be really such: nay more, so must every one who demands that
credit be given him, or that his doctrine be listened to. For since Paul rests
on these arguments for establishing his authority, worse than impudent were the
conduct of that man who would think to have any standing without such
proofs.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought, however, to be observed, that it is not
enough for any one to hold out to view the title to a call to the office, along
with faithfulness in discharging its duties, if he does not in reality give
proof of both. For it often happens that none boast more haughtily of their
titles than those that are destitute of the reality; as of old the false
prophets, with lofty disdain, boasted that they had been sent by the Lord. Nay,
at the present day, what else do the Romanists make a noise about, but
&#8220;ordination from God, and an inviolably sacred succession even from the
Apostles themselves,&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> while, after all, it appears that they
are destitute of those things of which they vaunt? Here, therefore, it is not
boasting that is required, but reality. Now, as the name is assumed by good and
bad alike, we must come to the test, that we may ascertain who has a right to
the name of Apostle, and who has not. As to Paul, God attested his <i>calling
</i>by many revelations, and afterwards confirmed it by miracles. The
<i>faithfulness </i>must be estimated by this, &#8212; whether or not he
proclaimed the pure doctrine of Christ. As to the twofold call &#8212; that of
God and that of the Church &#8212; see my
Institutes.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f38</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>An
Apostle</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Though this name, agreeably to
its etymology, has a general signification, and is sometimes employed in a
general sense, to denote any kind of
ministers,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> yet, as a peculiar designation, it is
applicable to those that were set apart by the Lord&#8217;s appointment to
publish the Gospel throughout the whole world. Now, it was of importance that
Paul should be reckoned in that number, for two <i>reasons</i>, &#8212;
<i>first</i>,<i> </i>because much more deference was paid to them than to other
ministers of the gospel; and, <i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>because they alone,
properly speaking, had authority to instruct all the Churches.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the will of
God</i>.</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>While the Apostle is accustomed
cheerfully to <i>acknowledge </i>himself indebted to God for whatever he has of
good, he does so more especially in reference to his apostleship, that he may
free himself from all appearance of presumption. And assuredly as a call to
salvation is of grace, so also a call to the office of apostle is of grace, as
Christ teaches in these words:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Ye have not chosen
me, but I have chosen
you,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
15:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul, however, at the same time indirectly intimates,
that all who attempt to undermine his apostleship, or in any way oppose it,
contend against an appointment of God. For Paul here makes no useless boast of
honorary titles, but designedly vindicates his apostleship from malicious
aspersions. For as his authority must have been sufficiently established in the
view of the Corinthians, it would have been superfluous to make particular
mention of &#8220;the will of God,&#8221; had not <i>wicked </i>men attempted by
indirect means to undermine that honorable rank which had been divinely assigned
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Sosthenes our
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This is that Sosthenes who was
ruler of the Jewish synagogue that was at Corinth, of whom <i>Luke </i>makes
mention in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441817&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
18:17. His name is added for this reason, that the Corinthians, knowing his
ardor and steadfastness in the gospel, could not but hold him in deserved
esteem, and hence it is still more to his honor to be made mention of now as
Paul&#8217;s <i>brother</i>,<i> </i>than formerly as <i>ruler of the
synagogue</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the Church of God which is
at Corinth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It may perhaps appear
strange that he should give the name of a Church of God to a multitude of
persons that were infested with so many distempers, that Satan might be said to
reign among them rather than God. Certain it is, that he did not mean to flatter
the Corinthians, for he speaks under the direction of the Spirit of God, who is
not accustomed to flatter. But</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> among so many pollutions, what appearance
of a Church is any longer presented? I answer, the Lord having said to him,
&#8220;Fear not: I have much people in this place&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441809&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
18:9, 10;) keeping this promise in mind, he conferred upon a godly few so much
honor as to recognize them as a Church amidst a vast multitude of ungodly
persons. Farther, notwithstanding that many vices had crept in, and various
corruptions both of doctrine and manners, there were, nevertheless, certain
tokens still remaining of a true Church. This is a passage that ought to be
carefully observed, that we may not require that the Church, while in this
world, should be free from every wrinkle and stain, or forthwith pronounce
unworthy of such a title every society in which everything is not as we would
wish it. For it is a dangerous temptation to think that there is no Church at
all where perfect purity is not to be seen. For the man that is prepossessed
with this notion, must necessarily in the end withdraw from all others, and look
upon himself as the only saint in the world, or set up a peculiar sect in
company with a few hypocrites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What ground, then, had Paul for recognizing a Church
at Corinth? It was this: that he saw among them the doctrine of the gospel,
baptism, the Lord&#8217;s Supper &#8212; tokens by which a Church ought to be
judged of. For although some had begun to have doubts as to the resurrection,
the error not having spread over the entire body, the name of the Church and its
reality are not thereby affected. Some faults had crept in among them in the
administration of the Supper, discipline and propriety of conduct had very much
declined: despising the simplicity of the gospel, they had given themselves up
to show and pomp; and in consequence<i> </i>of the ambition of their ministers,
they were split into various parties. Notwithstanding of this, however, inasmuch
as they retained fundamental doctrine: as the one God was adored among them, and
was invoked in the name of Christ: as they placed their dependence for salvation
upon Christ, and, had a ministry not altogether corrupted: there was, on these
accounts, a Church still existing among them. Accordingly, wherever the worship
of God is preserved uninfringed, and that fundamental doctrine, of which I have
spoken, remains, we must without hesitation conclude that in that case a Church
exists.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sanctified in Christ Jesus, called
to be saints</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He makes mention of the
blessings with which God had adorned them, as if by way of upbraiding them, at
least in the event of their showing no gratitude in return. For what could be
more base than to reject an Apostle through whose instrumentality they had been
set apart as God&#8217;s peculiar portion. Meanwhile, by these two epithets, he
points out what sort of persons ought to be reckoned among the true members of
the Church, and who they are that belong of right to her communion. For if you
do not by holiness of life show yourself to be a Christian, you may indeed be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in</i></font><font face="Palatino">
the Church, and pass
undetected,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but of it you cannot be. Hence all must
be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctified in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>who would be reckoned among the
people of God. Now the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctification</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>denotes <i>separation</i>.<i> </i>This takes place in us when we are
regenerated by the Spirit to newness of life, that we may serve God and not the
world. For while by nature we are unholy, the Spirit consecrates us to God. As,
however, this is effected when we are engrafted into the body of Christ, apart
from whom there is nothing but pollution, and as it is also by Christ, and not
from any other source that the Spirit is conferred, it is with good reason that
he says that we are </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctified in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>inasmuch as it is by Him that we
cleave to God, and in Him become new creatures.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What immediately follows &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called to be
saints</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; I<i> </i>understand to mean: As
ye have been called unto holiness. It may, however, be taken in two senses.
Either we may understand Paul to say, that the ground of sanctification is the
call of God, inasmuch as God has chosen them; meaning, that this depends on his
grace, not on the excellence of men; or we may understand him to mean, that, it
accords with our profession that we be holy, this being the design of the
doctrine of the gospel. The former interpretation appears to suit better with
the context, but it is of no great consequence in which way you understand it,
as there is an entire agreement between the two following positions &#8212; that
our holiness flows from the fountain of divine election, and that it, is the end
of our calling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must, therefore, carefully maintain, that it is
not through our own efforts that we are holy, but by the call of God, because He
alone sanctifies those who were by nature unclean. And certainly it appears to
me probable, that, when Paul has pointed out as it were with his finger the
fountain of holiness thrown wide open, he mounts up a step higher, to the good
pleasure of God, in which also Christ&#8217;s mission to us originated. As,
however, we are called by the gospel to harmlessness of life
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;504415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:15,) it is necessary that this be accomplished in us in reality, in order that
our calling may be effectual. It will, however, be objected,<i> </i>that, there
were not many such among the Corinthians. I answer, that the weak are not
excluded from this number; for here God only begins his work in us, and by
little and little carries it forward gradually and by successive steps. I answer
farther, that Paul designedly looks rather to the grace of God in them than to
their own defects, that he may put them to shame for their negligence, if they
do not act a suitable part.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With all that
call.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This, too, is an epithet common to
all the pious; for as it is one chief exercise of faith to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>call upon the
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of God, so it is also by this duty
chiefly that believers are to be estimated. Observe, also, that he says that
Christ is called upon by believers, and this affords a proof of his divinity
&#8212; invocation being one of the first expressions of Divine homage. Hence
invocation here by synecdoche</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f42</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kata&lt;
sunekdoch&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino">) denotes the entire profession of
faith in Christ, as in many passages of Scripture it is taken generally for the
whole of Divine worship. Some explain it as denoting mere profession, but this
appears to be meager, and at variance with its usual acceptation in Scripture.
The little words <i>nostri </i>(<i>ours</i>)<i> </i>and <i>sui
</i>(<i>theirs</i>)<i> </i>I have put in the genitive, understanding them as
referring to Christ, while others, understanding them as referring to place,
render them in the ablative. In doing so I have followed Chrysostom. This will,
perhaps, appear harsh, as the expression
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in every
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is introduced in the middle, but
in Paul&#8217;s Greek style there is nothing of harshness in this construction.
My reason for preferring this rendering to that of the Vulgate is, that if you
understand it as referring to place, the additional clause will be not merely
superfluous, but inappropriate. For what place would Paul call his own? <i>Judea
</i>they understand him to mean; but on what ground? And then, what place could
he refer to as inhabited by others? &#8220;All other places of the world&#8221;
(say they; ) but this, too, does not suit well. On the other hand, the meaning
that I have given it suits most admirably; for, after making mention of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all that in every place call upon
the name of Christ our Lord,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>both theirs and
ours</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>manifestly for the purpose of
showing that Christ is the one common Lord, without distinction, of all that
call upon him, whether they be Jews or Gentiles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In every
place</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This Paul has added, contrary to
his usual manner; for in his other Epistles he makes mention in the salutation
of those only for whom they are designed. He seems, however, to have had it in
view to anticipate the slanders of wicked men, that they might not have it to
allege that, in addressing the Corinthians, he assumed a confident air, and
claimed for himself an authority that he would not venture to assert in writing
to other Churches. For we shall see by and by, that he was unjustly loaded with
this reproach, too, as though he were preparing little
nests</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for himself, with the view of shunning
the light, or were withdrawing himself in a clandestine way from the rest of the
Apostles. It appears, then, that expressly for the purpose of refuting this
falsehood, he places himself in a commanding position, from which he may be
heard afar off.</font><br></div>

things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>are &#8212; the doctrine and word
of God. For in these riches it becomes Christians to abound; and they ought also
to be esteemed by us the more, and regarded by us as so much the more valuable,
in proportion as they are ordinarily slighted. The phrase <i>in ipso </i>(<i>in
him</i>)<i> </i>I have preferred to retain, rather than render it <i>per ipsum
</i>(<i>by him</i>,)<i> </i>because it has in my opinion more expressiveness and
force. For we are <i>enriched in Christ</i>,<i> </i>inasmuch as we are members
of his body, and are engrafted into him: nay more, being made one with him, he
makes us share with him in everything that he has received from the
Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even as the
testimony</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>etc. Erasmus gives a
different rendering, to this effect, &#8220;that<i> </i>by these things the
testimony of Christ was confirmed in them;&#8221; that is, by knowledge and by
the word. The words, however, convey another meaning, and if they are not
wrested, the meaning is easy &#8212; that God has sealed the truth of his gospel
among the Corinthians, for the purpose of confirming it. Now, this might be done
in two ways, either by miracles, or by the inward testimony of the Holy Spirit.
Chrysostom seems to understand it of miracles, but I take it in a larger sense;
and, first of all, it is certain, that the gospel is properly confirmed in our
experience by faith, because it is only when we receive it by faith that we
&#8220;set<i> </i>to our seal that God is true&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430333&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:33.) And though I admit that miracles ought to have weight for the
confirmation of it, yet<i> </i>we must go higher in search of the origin, namely
this, that the Spirit of God is the earnest and seal. Accordingly, I explain
these words in this manner &#8212; that the Corinthians excelled in knowledge,
inasmuch as God had from the beginning given efficacy to his gospel among them,
and that not in one way merely, but had done so both by the internal influence
of the Spirit, and by excellence and variety of gifts, by miracles, and by all
other helps. He calls the gospel
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the testimony of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or <i>respecting </i>Christ,
because the entire sum of it tends to discover Christ to us,</font><br></div>

the ground that Christ is the primary author of the gospel, so that the Apostles

little afterwards
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

abound in all the gifts of God, so as not to be in want of anything, as if he
had said, &#8220;The Lord has not merely honored you with the light of the
gospel, but has eminently endowed you with all those graces that may be of
service to the saints for helping them forward in the way of salvation.&#8221;
For he gives the name of gifts<i>
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">cari&gt;smata</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>to those spiritual graces that are, as it were, means of salvation to the
saints. But it is objected, on the other hand, that the saints are never in such
abundance as not to feel in want of graces to some extent, so that they must
always of necessity be &#8220;<i>hungering and thirsting</i>&#8221;<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

&#8220;As<i> </i>they are sufficiently endowed with needful gifts, and are never
in such destitution but that the Lord seasonably relieves their need; Paul on
this ground ascribes to them such wealth.&#8221; For the same reason he adds:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>waiting for the
manifestation</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>meaning, that he does not
ascribe to them such abundance as to leave nothing to be desired; but merely as
much as will suffice, until they shall have arrived at perfection. The

1:4, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:22) he teaches that this is the end of our calling &#8212; that we may appear
pure and unreproachable in the presence of Christ. It is, however, to be
observed, that this glorious purity is not in the first instance perfected in
us; nay, rather, it goes well with us if we are every day making progress in
penitence, and are being <i>purged from the sins
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;610109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 1:9)that expose us to the displeasure of God, until at length we put off,
along with the mortal body, all the offscourings of sin. Of the

when we come to the fourth chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
God is faithful</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>When the Scripture
speaks of God as faithful the meaning in many cases is, that in God there is
steadfastness and evenness of tenor, so that what he begins he <i>prosecutes
</i>to the end,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as Paul himself says elsewhere, that
<i>the calling of God is without repentance
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:29.) Hence, in my opinion, the meaning of this passage is, that God is
steadfast in what he purposes. This being the case, he consequently does not
make sport as to his calling, but will unceasingly take care of his
work.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f51</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> From God&#8217;s past benefits we ought
always to hope well as to the future. Paul, however, has something higher in
view, for he argues that the Corinthians cannot be cast off, having been once,
called by the Lord into Christ&#8217;s fellowship. To apprehend fully, however,
the force of this argument, let us observe first of all, that every one ought to
regard his calling as a token of his election. Farther, although one cannot
judge with the same certainty as to another&#8217;s election, yet we must always
in the judgment of charity conclude that all that are called are called to
salvation; I mean efficaciously and fruitfully. Paul, however, directed his
discourse to those in whom the word of the Lord had taken root, and in whom some
fruits of it had been produced.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Should any one object that many who have once
received the word afterwards fall away, I answer that the Spirit alone is to
every one a faithful and sure witness of his election, upon which perseverance
depends. This, however, did not stand in the way of Paul&#8217;s being
persuaded, in the judgment of charity, that the calling of the Corinthians would
prove firm and immovable, as being persons in whom he saw the tokens of
God&#8217;s fatherly benevolence. These things, however, do not by any means
tend to beget carnal security, to divest us of which the Scriptures frequently
remind us of our weakness, but simply to confirm our confidence in the Lord. Now
this was needful, in order that their minds might not be disheartened on
discovering so many faults, as he comes afterwards to present before their view.
The sum of all this may be stated thus, &#8212; that it is the part of Christian
candor to hope well of all who have entered on the right way of salvation, and
are still persevering in that course, notwithstanding that they are at the same
time still beset with really distempers. Every one of us, too, from the time of
his being <i>illuminated
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581032&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
10:32) by the Spirit of God in the knowledge of Christ, ought to conclude with
certainty from this that he has been adopted by the Lord to an inheritance of
eternal life. For effectual calling ought to be to believers an evidence of
divine adoption; yet in the meantime we must all walk <i>with fear and trembling
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;503512&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:12.) On this point I shall touch again to some extent when we come to the
tenth chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Into the
fellowship.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Instead of this rendering
Erasmus translates it <i>into partnership</i>.<i> </i>The old interpreter
renders it <i>society</i>.<i> </i>I have preferred, however, to render it
<i>fellowship</i>,<i> </i>as bringing out better the force of the Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">koinwniav</font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f52</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For this is the design of the
gospel, that Christ may become ours, and that we may be engrafted into his body.
Now when the Father gives him to us hi possession, he also communicates himself
to us in him; and hence arises a participation in every benefit. Paul&#8217;s
argument, then, is this &#8212; &#8220; Since you have, by means of the gospel
which you have received by faith, been called into the fellowship of Christ, you
have no reason to dread the danger of
death,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
3:14) who rose a conqueror over death.&#8221; In fine, when the Christian looks
to himself he finds only occasion for trembling, or rather for despair; but
having been called into the fellowship of Christ, he ought, in so far as
assurance of salvation is concerned, to think of himself no otherwise than as a
member of Christ, so as to reckon all Christ&#8217;s benefits his own. Thus he
will obtain an unwavering hope of final perseverance, (as it is called,) if he
reckons himself a member of him who is beyond all hazard of falling
away.</font><br></div>

Corinthians mildly, because he knew that they were much too sensitive. Now,
however, after preparing their minds for receiving correction, acting the part
of a good and skillful surgeon, who soothes the wound when about to apply a
painful remedy, he begins to handle them with more severity. Even here, however,
as we shall still farther see, he uses great moderation. The sum is this:
&#8220;It<i> </i>is my hope that the Lord has not in vain conferred upon you so
many gifts, so as not to have it in view to bring you to salvation, but you
ought at the same time to take heed lest graces so distinguished be polluted by
your vices. See, then, that you be agreed among yourselves; and it is not
without good reason that I call for agreement among yourselves, for I have been
informed that you are in a state of disagreement, amounting even to hostility,
and that there are parties and contentions raging among you, by which true unity
of faith is torn asunder.&#8221; As, however, they might not perhaps be
sufficiently aroused by mere exhortation, he uses earnest entreaty, for he
adjures them, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the name of
Christ,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that, as they loved him, they
should aim at promoting harmony.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye all speak the same
thing</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>In exhorting them to harmony, he
employs three different forms of expression: for, <i>in the first place</i>,<i>
</i>he requires such agreement among them that all shall have one voice;
<i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>he takes away the evil by which unity is broken and torn
asunder; and, <i>thirdly</i>,<i> </i>he unfolds the nature of true harmony,
which is, that they be agreed among themselves in mind and will. What he has
placed <i>second </i>is <i>first in order</i>, &#8212; that<i> </i>we beware of
strifes. For from this a <i>second </i>thing will naturally follow, &#8212; that
we be in harmony; and then at length a <i>third </i>thing will follow, which is
here mentioned <i>first</i>, &#8212; that<i> </i>we all speak, as it were, with
one mouth; a thing exceedingly desirable as a fruit of Christian harmony. Let us
then observe, that nothing is more inconsistent on the part of Christians than
to be at variance among themselves, for it is the main article of our religion
that we be in harmony among ourselves; and farther, on such agreement the safety
of the Church rests and is dependent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us see what he requires as to Christian
unity. If any one is desirous of nice distinctions &#8212; he would have them
<i>first of all </i>joined together in one mind;<i> secondly</i>,<i> </i>in one
judgment; and, <i>thirdly</i>,<i> </i>he would have them declare in words that
agreement. As, however, my rendering differs somewhat from that of Erasmus, I
would, in passing, call my readers to observe, that Paul here makes use of a
participle, which denotes things that are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fitly and suitably joined

<div><font face="Palatino">For <i>sententia </i>(judgment) Paul has

but I understand it here as denoting the will, so that there is a complete
division of the soul, and the <i>first </i>clause refers to faith, the <i>second
</i>to love. Then only will there be Christian unity among us, when there is not
merely a good agreement as to doctrine, but we are also in harmony in our
affections and dispositions, and are thus in all respects of one mind. Thus Luke
bears witness to believers in the primitive Church,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440246&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:46,) that they had &#8220;one<i> </i>heart and one soul.&#8221; And without
doubt this will be found wherever the Spirit of Christ reigns. When, however, he
exhorts them to speak the same thing, he intimates still more fully from the
effect, how complete the agreement ought to be &#8212; so that no diversity may
appear even in words. It is difficult, indeed, of attainment, but still it is
necessary among Christians, from whom there is required not merely one faith,
but also one confession.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It has been
declared.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As general observations have
usually little effect, he intimates, that what he had said was more particularly
applicable to them. The application, therefore, is designed with the view of
leading the Corinthians to perceive, that it was not without good reason that
Paul had made mention of harmony. For he shows that they had not merely turned
aside from a holy unity,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f58</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but had even fallen into contentions,
which are worse</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

said,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as though he lightly lent his ear to
false accusations, he speaks with commendation of his informants, who must have
been in the highest esteem, as he did not hesitate to adduce them as competent
witnesses against an entire Church. It is not indeed altogether certain, whether
<i>Chloe </i>is the name of a place or of a woman, but to me it appears more
probable that it is the name of a
woman.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f61</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I am of opinion, therefore, that it was a
well-regulated household that acquainted Paul with the distempered condition of
the Corinthian Church, being desirous that it might be remedied by him. The idea
entertained by many, in accordance with Chrysostom&#8217;s view, that he
refrained from mentioning names, lest he should bring odium upon them, appears
to me to be absurd. For he does not say that some of the household had reported
this to him, but, on the contrary, makes mention of them all, and there is no
doubt that they would willingly have allowed their names to be made use of.
Farther, that he might not exasperate their minds by undue severity, he has
modified the reproof by an engaging form of address; not as though he would make
light of the distemper, but with the view of bringing them to a more teachable
spirit, for perceiving the severity of the malady.</font><br></div>

that there are contentions among you is, because every one of you glories in the
name of some individual.&#8221; It will, however, be objected, that in these
words there is no appearance as yet of contention. My answer is, that where
there are jarrings in religion, it cannot but be that men&#8217;s minds will
soon afterwards burst forth in open strife. For as nothing is more effectual for
uniting us, and there is nothing that tends more to draw our minds together, and
keep them in a state of peace, than agreement in religion, so, on the other
hand, if any disagreement has arisen as to matters of this nature, the effect
necessarily is, that men&#8217;s minds are straightway stirred up for combat,
and in no other department are there more fierce
contendings.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

Christ&#8217;s faithful servants &#8212; Apollos, who had been his successor at
Corinth, and Peter himself too, and then adds himself to their number, that he
may appear to plead not so much his own cause as that of Christ. In any other
point of view it is not likely that there were any parties that espoused the
separate interests of ministers joined together by a sacred
agreement.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f63</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He has, however, as he afterwards
mentions, transferred to himself and Apollos what was applicable to others; and
this he has done, in order that they might more candidly consider the thing
itself, viewing it apart from respect of persons. It will, however, be replied,
that he makes mention here even of those who professed that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Was this, too, worthy of blame?
I answer, that in this way he shows more fully what unseemly consequences result
from those depraved affections, when we give ourselves up to men, as in that
case Christ must be acknowledged merely in part, and the pious have no
alternative left them, but to separate themselves from others, if they would not
renounce Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, this passage is wrested in various ways,
we must endeavor to ascertain more minutely what Paul intends here. His object
is, to maintain Christ&#8217;s exclusive authority in the Church, so that we may
all exercise dependence upon him, that he alone may be recognized among us as
Lord and Master, and that the name of no individual be set in opposition to his.
Those, therefore, that draw away disciples after them
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;442030&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
20:30,) with the view of splitting the Church into parties, he condemns as most
destructive enemies of our faith. Thus then he does not, suffer men to have such
pre-eminence in the Church as to usurp Christ&#8217;s supremacy. He does not
allow them to be held in such honor as to derogate even in the slightest degree
from Christ&#8217;s dignity. There is, it is true, a certain degree of honor
that is due to Christ&#8217;s ministers, and they are also themselves masters in
their own place, but this exception must always be kept in view, that Christ
must have without any infringement what belongs to him &#8212; that. he shall
nevertheless be the sole Master, and looked upon as such. Hence the aim of good
ministers is this, that they may all in common serve Christ, and claim for him
exclusively power, authority, and glory &#8212; fight under his banner &#8212;
obey him alone, and bring others in subjection to his sway. If any one is
influenced by ambition, that man gathers disciples, not to Christ, but to
himself. This then is the fountain of all evils &#8212; this the most hurtful of
all plagues &#8212; this the deadly poison of all Churches, when ministers seek
their own interests rather than those of Christ. In short, the unity of the
Church consists more especially in this one thing &#8212; that we all depend
upon Christ alone, and that men thus occupy an inferior place, so as not to
detract in any degree from his pre-eminence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is Christ
divided?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This intolerable evil was
consequent upon the divisions that prevailed among the Corinthians: for Christ
alone must reign in the Church. And as the object of the gospel is, that we be
reconciled to God through him, it is necessary, in the first place, that we
should all be bound together in him. As, however, only a very few of the
Corinthians, who were in a sounder condition than the
others,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f64</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">retained
Christ as their Master, (while all made it their boast that they were
Christians,) Christ was by this means torn asunder. For we must be one body, if
we would be kept together under him as our head. If, on the other hand, we are
split asunder into different bodies, we start aside from him also. Hence to
glory in his name amidst strifes and parties is to tear him in pieces: which
indeed is impossible, for never will he depart from unity and concord, because
&#8220;He cannot deny himself&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;550213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:13.) Paul, therefore, by setting before them this absurdity, designs
to lead the Corinthians to perceive that they are estranged from Christ,
inasmuch as they are divided, for <i>then </i>only does he reign in us, when we
have him as the bond of an inviolably sacred unity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Was Paul crucified for
you?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By two powerful considerations, he
shows how base a thing</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f65</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it is to rob Christ of the honor of being
the sole Head of the Church &#8212; the sole Teacher &#8212; the sole Master; or
to draw away from him any part of that honor, with the view of transferring it
to men. The <i>first </i>is, that we have been redeemed by Christ on this
footing, that we are not our own masters. This very argument Paul makes use of
in his Epistle to the Romans
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:9,) when he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;For<i> </i>this
end Christ died and rose again, that he might be Lord both of the living and the
dead.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To him, therefore, let us live and die, because we
are always his. Also in this same Epistle
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460723&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:23,)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Ye<i> </i>are
bought with a price: be not ye the servants of men.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As the Corinthians, therefore, had been purchased
with the blood of Christ, they in a manner renounced the benefit of redemption,
when they attached themselves to other leaders. Here is a doctrine that is
deserving of special notice &#8212; that we are not at liberty to put ourselves
under bondage to men,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because we are the Lord&#8217;s heritage.
Here, therefore, he accuses the Corinthians of the basest ingratitude, in
estranging themselves from that Leader, by whose blood they had been redeemed,
however they might have done so unwittingly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, this passage militates against the wicked
contrivance of Papists, by which they attempt to bolster up their system of
indulgences. For it is from the blood of Christ and the
martyrs</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f67</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that they make up that imaginary treasure
of the Church, which they tell us is dealt out by means of indulgences. Thus
they pretend that the martyrs by their death merited something for us in the
sight of God, that we may seek help from this source for obtaining the pardon of
our sins. They will deny, indeed, that they are on that account our redeemers;
but nothing is more manifest than that the one thing follows from the other. The
question is as to the reconciling of sinners to God; the question is as to the
obtaining of forgiveness; the question is as to the appeasing of the
Lord&#8217;s anger; the question is as to redemption from our iniquities. This
they boast is accomplished partly by the blood of Christ, and partly by that of
the martyrs. They make, therefore, the martyrs partners with Christ in procuring
our salvation. Here, however, Paul in strong terms denies that any one but
Christ has been crucified for us. The martyrs, it is true, died for our benefit,
but (as Leo</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f68</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> observes) it was to furnish an example of
perseverance, not to procure for us the gift of righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Or were ye baptized in the name of
Paul?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here we have <i>a second
</i>argument, which is taken from the profession of baptism; for we enlist
ourselves under the banners of him in whose name we are baptized. We are,
accordingly, bound</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f69</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to Christ, in whose name our baptism is
celebrated. Hence it follows that the Corinthians are chargeable with perfidy
and apostasy, if they place themselves under subjection to men. Observe here
that the nature of baptism resembles a
contract</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f70</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of mutual obligation; for as the Lord by
that symbol receives us into his household, and introduces us among his people,
so we<i> </i>pledge our fidelity to him, that we will never afterwards have any
other spiritual Lord. Hence as it is on God&#8217;s part a covenant of grace
that he contracts with us, in which he promises forgiveness of sins and a new
life, so on our part it is an oath of spiritual warfare, in which we promise
perpetual subjection to him. The former department Paul does not here touch
upon, because the subject did not admit of it; but in treating of baptism it
ought not to be omitted. Nor does Paul charge the Corinthians with apostasy
simply on the ground of their forsaking Christ and betaking themselves to men;
but he declares that if they do not adhere to Christ alone &#8212; that very
thing would make them covenant-breakers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is asked, what it is to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>baptized in the name of
Christ?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I answer that by this expression
it is not simply intimated that baptism is founded on the authority of Christ,
but depends also on his influence, and does in a manner consist in it; and, in
fine, that the whole effect of it depends on this &#8212; that the name of
Christ is therein invoked. It is asked farther, why it is that Paul says that
the Corinthians were </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>baptized in
the name of Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>while Christ himself
commanded
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402819&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
28:19) the Apostles to baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Spirit. I answer, that in baptism the <i>first </i>thing to be
considered is, that God the Father, by planting us in his Church in unmerited
goodness, receives us by adoption into the number of his sons.
<i>Secondly</i>,<i> </i>as we cannot have any connection with him except by
means of reconciliation, we have need of Christ to restore us to the
Father&#8217;s favor by his blood. <i>Thirdly</i>,<i> </i>as we are by baptism
consecrated to God, we need also the interposition of the Holy Spirit, whose
office it is to make us new creatures. Nay farther, our being washed in the
blood of Christ is peculiarly his work; but as we do not obtain the mercy of the
Father, or the grace of the Spirit, otherwise than through Christ alone, it is
on good grounds that we speak of him as the peculiar object in view in baptism,
and more particularly inscribe his name upon baptism. At the same time this does
not by any means exclude the name of the Father and of the Spirit; for when we
wish to sum up in short compass the efficacy of baptism, we make mention of
Christ alone; but when we are disposed to speak with greater minuteness, the
name of the Father and that of the Spirit require to be expressly
introduced.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I thank my
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In these words he reproves very
sharply the perversity of the Corinthians, which made it necessary for him to
avoid, in a manner, a thing so sacred and honorable as that of the
administration of baptism. Paul, indeed, would have acted with propriety, and in
accordance with the nature of his office, though he had baptized ever so many.
He rejoices, however, that it had happened otherwise, and acknowledges it as
having been so ordered, in the providence of God, that they might not take
occasion from that to glory in him, or that he might not bear any resemblance to
those ambitious men who endeavored in this way to catch followers. But what if
he had baptized many? There would have been no harm in it, but (as I have said)
there is couched under this a heavy reproach against the Corinthians and their
false apostles, inasmuch as a servant of the Lord found occasion to rejoice that
he had refrained from a work, otherwise good and commendable, lest it should
become an occasion of harm to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
For Christ sent me not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He anticipates
an objection that might, perhaps, be brought against him &#8212; that he had not
discharged his duty, inasmuch as Christ commands his Apostles to baptize as well
as teach. Accordingly he replies, that this was not the principal department of
his office, for the duty of teaching had been principally enjoined upon him as
that to which he should apply himself. For when Christ says to the Apostles,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402819&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
28:19,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:15,) <i>Go</i>,<i> preach and baptize</i>,<i> </i>he connects baptism with
teaching simply as an addition or appendage, so that teaching always holds the
first place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Two things, however, must be noticed here. The
<i>first </i>is, that the Apostle does not here absolutely deny that he had a
command to baptize, for this is applicable to all the Apostles: <i>Go and
baptize</i>;<i> </i>and he would have acted rashly in baptizing even
<i>one</i>,<i> </i>had he not been furnished with authority, but simply points
out what was the chief thing in his calling. The <i>second </i>thing is, that he
does not by any means detract here, as some think, from the dignity or utility
of the sacrament. For the question here is, not as to the efficacy of baptism,
and Paul does not institute this comparison with the view of detracting in any
degree from <i>that</i>;<i> </i>but because it was given to few to teach, while
many could baptize; and farther, as many could be taught at the same time, while
baptism could only be administered to individuals successively, one by one,
Paul, who excelled in the gift of teaching, applied himself to the work that was
more especially needful for him, and left to others what they could more
conveniently accomplish. Nay farther, if the reader considers minutely all the
circumstances of the case, he will see that there is
<i>irony</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f71</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>tacitly conveyed here, dexterously
contrived for making those feel acutely, who, under color of administering a
ceremony, endeavor to catch a little glory at the expense of another&#8217;s
labor. Paul&#8217;s labors in building up that Church had been incredible. There
had come after him certain effeminate masters, who had drawn over followers to
their party by the sprinkling of
water;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f72</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Paul, then, giving up to them the title
of honor, declares himself contented with having had the
burden.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f73</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not with wisdom of
words</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>There is here an instance of
<i>anticipation</i>,<i> </i>by which a twofold objection is refuted. For these
pretended teachers might reply that it was ludicrous to hear Paul, who was not
endowed with eloquence, making it his boast that the department of teaching had
been assigned to him. Hence he says, by way of concession, that he had not been
formed to be an orator,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f74</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">to set
himself off by elegance of speech: but a minister of the Spirit, that he might,
by plain and homely speech, bring to nothing the wisdom of the world. Now, lest
any one should object that he hunted after glory by his preaching, as much as
others did by baptism, he briefly replies, that as the method of teaching that
he pursued was the farthest removed from show, and breathed nothing of ambition,
it could give no ground of suspicion on that head. Hence, too, if I mistake not,
it may readily be inferred what was the chief ground of the controversy that
Paul had with the wicked and unfaithful ministers of the Corinthians. It was
that, being puffed up with ambition, that they might secure for themselves the
admiration of the people, they recommended themselves to them by a show of words
and mask of human wisdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From this main evil two others necessarily followed
&#8212; that by these disguises (so to speak) the simplicity of the gospel was
disfigured, and Christ was, as it were, clothed in a new and foreign garb, so
that the pure and unadulterated knowledge of him was not to be found. Farther,
as men&#8217;s minds were turned aside to neatness and elegance of expression,
to ingenious speculations, and to an empty show of superior sublimity of
doctrine, the efficacy of the Spirit vanished, and nothing remained but the dead
letter. The majesty of God, as it shines forth in the gospel, was not to be
seen, but mere disguise and useless show. Paul, accordingly, with the view of
exposing these corruptions of the gospel, makes a transition here to the manner
of his preaching. This he declares to be right and proper, while at the same
time it was diametrically opposed to the ambitious ostentation of those
men.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f75</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is as though he had said &#8212;
&#8220; I am well aware how much your fastidious teachers delight themselves in
their high-sounding phrases. As for myself, I do not simply <i>confess </i>that
my preaching has been conducted in a rude, coarse, and unpolished style, but I
even <i>glory </i>in it. For it. was right that it should be so, and this was
the method that was divinely prescribed to <i>me</i>.&#8221;<i> </i>By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wisdom of
words</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he does not mean
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">logodaidali&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f76</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which is mere empty talk, but true
eloquence, which consists in skillful contrivance of subjects, ingenious
arrangement, and elegance of expression. He declares that he had nothing of
this: nay more, that it was neither suitable to his preaching nor
advantageous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest the cross of Christ should be
made of none effect</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As he had so often
previously presented the name of Christ in contrast with the arrogant wisdom of
the flesh, so now, with the view of bringing down thereby all its pride and
loftiness, he brings forward to view the cross of Christ. For all the wisdom of
believers is comprehended in the cross of Christ, and what more contemptible
than a cross? Whoever, therefore, would desire to be truly wise in God&#8217;s
account, must of necessity stoop to this abasement of the cross, and this will
not be accomplished otherwise than by his first of all renouncing his own
judgment and all the wisdom of the world. Paul, however, shows here<i> </i>not
merely what sort of persons Christ&#8217;s disciples ought to be, and what path
of learning they ought to pursue, but also what is the method of teaching in
Christ&#8217;s school. &#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
cross of Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>(says he) would have
been </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made of none
effect,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>if my preaching had been adorned
with eloquence and show.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The cross of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he has put here for the benefit
of redemption, which must be sought from Christ crucified. Now the doctrine of
the gospel which calls us to this, should savor of the nature of the Cross, so
as to be despised and contemptible, rather than glorious, in the eyes of the
world. The meaning, therefore, is, that if Paul had made use of philosophical
acuteness and studied address in the presence of the Corinthians, the efficacy
of the cross of Christ, in which the salvation of men consists, would have been
buried, because it cannot come to us in that way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here two questions are proposed: <i>first</i>,<i>
</i>whether Paul here condemns in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>respect </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wisdom of
words</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>as opposed to Christ; and
<i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>whether he means that <i>eloquence </i>and the doctrine
of the gospel are invariably opposed, so they cannot agree together, and that
the preaching of the gospel is vitiated, if the slightest tincture of
eloquence</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f77</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is made use of for adorning it. To the
<i>first </i>of these I answer &#8212; that it were quite unreasonable to
suppose, that Paul would utterly condemn those arts which, it is manifest, are
<i>excellent </i>gifts of God, and which serve as instruments, as it were, to
assist men in the accomplishment of important purposes. As for those arts, then,
that have nothing of superstition, but contain solid
learning,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f78</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and are founded on just principles, as
they are useful and suited to the common transactions of human life, so there
can be no doubt that they have come forth from the Holy Spirit; and the
advantage which is derived and experienced from them, ought to be ascribed
exclusively to God. What Paul says here, therefore, ought not to be taken as
throwing any disparagement upon the arts, as if they were unfavorable to
piety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>second </i>question is somewhat more
difficult, for he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the
cross of Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made of none
effect</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>if there be any admixture of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wisdom of
words</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>I answer, that we must consider
who they are that Paul here addresses. The ears of the Corinthians were
<i>tickled </i>with a silly fondness for high sounding
style.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f79</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence they needed more than others to be
brought back to the abasement of the cross, that they might learn to embrace
Christ as he is, unadorned, and the gospel in its simplicity, without any false
ornament. I acknowledge, at the same time, that this sentiment in some respects
holds invariably, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the cross
of Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made of none
effect</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>not merely by the wisdom of the
world, but also by elegance of address. For the preaching of Christ crucified is
simple and unadorned, and hence it ought not to be obscured by false ornaments
of speech. It is the prerogative of the gospel to bring down the wisdom of the
world in such a way that, stripped of our own understanding, we show ourselves
to be simply docile, and do not think or even desire to know anything, but what
the Lord himself teaches. As to the wisdom of the flesh, we shall have occasion
to consider more at large ere long, in what respects it is opposed to Christ. As
to eloquence, I shall advert to it here in a few words, in so far as the passage
calls for.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see that God from the beginning ordered matters
so, that, the gospel should be administered in simplicity, without any aid from
eloquence. Could not he who fashions the tongues of men for eloquence, be
himself eloquent if he chose to be so? While he <i>could </i>be so, he did not
<i>choose </i>to be so. <i>Why </i>it was that he did not choose this, I find
two reasons more particularly. The <i>first </i>is, that in a plain and
unpolished manner of address, the majesty of the truth might shine forth more
conspicuously, and the simple efficacy of his Spirit, without external aids,
might make its way into the hearts of men. The <i>second </i>is, that he might
more effectually try our obedience and docility, and train us at the same time
to true humility. For the Lord admits none into his school but little
children.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f80</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence those alone are capable of heavenly
wisdom who, contenting themselves with the preaching of the cross, however
contemptible it may be in appearance,<i> </i>feel no desire whatever to have
Christ under a mask. Hence the doctrine of the gospel required to be regulated
with this view, that believers should be drawn off from all pride and
haughtiness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what if any one should at the present day, by
discoursing with some degree of elegance, adorn the doctrine of the gospel by
eloquence? Would he deserve to be on that account rejected, as though he either
polluted it or obscured Christ&#8217;s glory. I answer in the <i>first
</i>place, that eloquence is not at all at variance with the simplicity of the
gospel, when it does not merely not disdain to give way to it, and be in
subjection to it, but also yields service to it, as a handmaid to her mistress.
For as Augustine says, &#8220;He<i> </i>who gave Peter a fisherman, gave also
Cyprian an orator.&#8221; By this he means, that both are from God,
notwithstanding that the one, who is much the superior of the other as to
dignity, is utterly devoid of gracefulness of speech; while the other, who sits
at his feet, is distinguished by the fame of his eloquence. That eloquence,
therefore, is neither to be condemned nor despised, which has no tendency to
lead Christians to be taken up with an outward glitter of words, or intoxicate
them with empty delight, or tickle their ears with its tinkling sound, or cover
over the cross of Christ with its empty show as with a
veil;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f81</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but, on the contrary, tends to call us
back to the native simplicity of the gospel, tends to exalt the simple preaching
of the cross by voluntarily abasing itself, and, in fine, acts the part of a
herald</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f82</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to procure a hearing for those fishermen
and illiterate persons, who have nothing to recommend them but the energy of the
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I answer <i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>that the Spirit of
God, also, has an eloquence of his own, but of such a nature as to shine forth
with a native luster peculiar to itself, or rather (as they say) intrinsic, more
than with any adventitious ornaments. Such is the eloquence that the Prophets
have, more particularly Isaiah, David, and Solomon. Moses, too, has a sprinkling
of it. Nay farther, even in the writings of the Apostles, though they are more
unpolished, there are notwithstanding some sparks of it occasionally emitted.
Hence the eloquence that is suited to the Spirit of God is of such a nature that
it does not swell with empty show, or spend itself in empty sound, but is solid
and efficacious, and has more of substance than elegance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the preaching of the
cross</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>etc. In this first clause a
concession is made. For as it might very readily be objected, that the gospel is
commonly held in contempt, if it <i>be </i>presented in so bare and abject a
form, Paul of his own accord concedes this, but when he adds, that it is so in
the estimation of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>them that
perish</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he intimates that no regard must
be paid to their judgment. For who would choose to despise the gospel at the
expense of perishing? This statement, therefore, must be understood in this way:
&#8220;However<i> </i>the preaching of the cross, as having nothing of human
wisdom to recommend it to esteem, is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reckoned
foolishness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>them that
perish</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>in <i>our </i>view,
notwithstanding, the wisdom of God clearly shines forth in it.&#8221;<i> </i>He
indirectly reproves, however, the perverted judgment of the Corinthians, who,
while they<i> </i>were, through seduction of words, too easily allured by
ambitious teachers, regarded with disdain an Apostle who was endowed with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the power of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for their <i>salvation</i>,<i>
</i>and that simply because he devoted himself to the preaching of Christ. In
what way the preaching of the cross is the power of God unto salvation, we have
explained in commenting upon
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:16.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
For it is written</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>etc. He shows still
farther, from the testimony of Isaiah, how unreasonable a thing it is that the
truth of the gospel should be regarded with prejudice on the ground that the
wise of this world hold it in contempt, not to say derision. For it is evident
from the words of the Prophet, that their opinion is regarded as nothing in the
account of God. The passage is taken from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232914&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
29:14, where the Lord threatens that he will avenge himself upon the hypocrisy
of the people by this kind of punishment, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wisdom will perish from the
wise</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>etc.<i> </i>Now the application of
this to the subject in hand is this: &#8220;It<i> </i>is nothing new or unusual
for men to form utterly absurd judgments, who appear in other respects to be
distinguished for wisdom. For in this manner the Lord has been wont to punish
the arrogance of those who, depending on their own judgment, think to be leaders
to themselves and others. In this manner did He, among the Israelitish people of
old, destroy the wisdom of those who were the leaders of the people. If this
happened among a people, whose wisdom the other nations had occasion to admire,
what will become of others?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is proper, however, to compare the words of the
Prophet with those of Paul, and to examine the whole matter still more closely.
The Prophet, indeed, makes use of neuter verbs when he says, <i>Wisdom will
perish and prudence will vanish</i>,<i> </i>while Paul turns them into the
active form, by making them have a reference to God. They are, however,
perfectly the same in meaning. For this is a great prodigy which God declares he
will exhibit, so that all will be filled with astonishment.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>perishes</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>but it is by the Lord&#8217;s destroying it:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wisdom
vanishes</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>but it is by the Lord&#8217;s
covering it over and effacing it. As to the second term
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aqetei~n</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>(which Erasmus renders <i>reject</i>,)<i> </i>as it is ambiguous, and is
sometimes taken to mean <i>efface</i>,<i> </i>or <i>expunge</i>,<i> </i>or
<i>obliterate</i>,<i> </i>I prefer to understand it in this sense here, so as to
correspond with the Prophet&#8217;s word <i>vanish</i>,<i> </i>or <i>be
hid</i>.<i> </i>At the same time, there is another reason that has weighed more
with me,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f83</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; that the word <i>reject </i>was
not in accordance with the subject, as will appear ere long. Let us see, then,
as to the meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Prophet&#8217;s meaning, without doubt, is
precisely this, that they would no longer have governors that would rule well,
because the Lord will deprive them of sound judgment and intelligence. For as he
elsewhere threatens to send blindness upon the whole nation
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
6:10,) so here, upon the leaders; which is just as though he were plucking the
eyes out of the body. However this may be, a great difficulty arises from the
circumstance,<i> </i>that the term <i>wisdom </i>or <i>prudence </i>was taken by
Isaiah in a good sense, while Paul quotes it for an opposite purpose, as though
the wisdom of men were condemned by God, as being perverted, and their prudence
set aside as being mere vanity. I confess that it is commonly expounded in this
way; but as it is certain that the oracles of the Holy Spirit are not perverted
by the Apostles to meanings foreign to their real design, I choose rather to
depart from the common opinion of interpreters than to charge Paul with
falsehood. In other respects, too, the natural meaning of the Prophet&#8217;s
words accords not ill with Paul&#8217;s intention; for if even the wisest become
fools, when the Lord takes away a right spirit, what confidence is to be placed
in the wisdom of men? Farther, as it is God&#8217;s usual way of punishing, to
strike blind those who, following implicitly their own judgment, are wise in
their own esteem, it is not to be wondered if carnal men, when they rise up
against God, with the view of subjecting His eternal truth to their rashness,
are turned into fools, and become vain in their imaginations. We now see with
what appropriateness Paul makes use of this testimony. Isaiah declares that the
vengeance of God upon all those that served God with their own inventions would
be, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wisdom would vanish from
their wise men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Paul, with the view of
proving that the wisdom of this world is vain and worthless, when it exalts
itself against God, adduces this testimony from Isaiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where is the wise? where is
the scribe?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This expression of triumph
is added for the purpose of illustrating the Prophet&#8217;s testimony. Paul has
not taken this sentiment from Isaiah, as is commonly thought, but speaks in his
own person. For the passage which they point to
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;233318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
33:18) has nothing corresponding to the subject in hand, or nearly approaching
to it. For in that passage, while he promises to the Jews deliverance from the
yoke of Sennacherib, that he may magnify the more this great blessing from God,
he shows how miserable is the condition of those that are oppressed by the
tyranny of foreigners. He says, that they are in a constant fever of anxiety,
from thinking themselves beset with scribes or questors, treasurers, and
counters of towers. Nay more, he says, that the Jews were involved in such
difficulties, that they were stirred up to gratitude by the very remembrance of
them.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f84</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">It is a
mistake, therefore, to suppose that this sentence is taken from the
Prophet.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>world</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>ought not to be taken in connection with the last term merely, but also with
the other two. Now, by the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wise
of this world</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he means those who do not
derive their wisdom from illumination by the Spirit through means of the word of
God, but, endowed with mere worldly sagacity, rest on the assurance which it
affords.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is generally agreed, that by the term <i>scribes
</i>is meant teachers. For as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rps</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>saphar</i>,<i> </i>among the Hebrews, means to relate or recount, and the
noun derived from it,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rps</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sepher</i>,,<i> </i>is used by them to signify a book or volume, they employ
the term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">myrpws</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>sopherim</i>,<i> </i>to denote learned men, and those that are conversant
with books; and, for the same reason, too, <i>sopher regis </i>is often used to
denote a <i>chancellor </i>or <i>secretary</i>.<i> </i>The Greeks, following the
etymology of the Hebrew term, have translated it
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">grammateiv</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
scribes</i>.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f86</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He appropriately gives the name of
investigators</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f87</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to those that show off their acuteness by
starting difficult points and involved questions. Thus in a general way he
brings to nothing man&#8217;s entire intellect, so as to give it no standing in
the kingdom of God. Nor is it without good reason that he inveighs so vehemently
against the wisdom of men, for it is impossible to express how difficult a thing
it is to eradicate from men&#8217;s minds a misdirected confidence in the flesh,
that they may not claim for themselves more than is reasonable. Now there is
more than ought to be, if, depending even in the slightest degree upon their own
wisdom, they venture of themselves to form a judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hath not God made
foolish</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> etc</i>.<i> </i>By <i>wisdom
</i>here he means everything that man can comprehend either by the natural
powers of his understanding, or as deriving aid from practice, from learning, or
from a knowledge of the arts. For he contrasts the wisdom of the world with the
wisdom of the Spirit. Hence, whatever knowledge a man rosy come to have without
the illumination of the Holy Spirit, is included in the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wisdom of this
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This he says God has
utterly</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> made
foolish</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that is, He has convicted it of
folly. This you may understand to be effected in two ways; for whatever a man
knows and understands, is mere vanity, if it is not grounded in true wisdom; and
it is in no degree better fitted for the apprehension of spiritual doctrine than
the eye of a blind man is for discriminating colors. We must carefully notice
these two things &#8212; that a knowledge of all the sciences is mere smoke,
where the heavenly science of Christ is wanting; and man, with all his
acuteness, is as stupid for obtaining of himself a knowledge of the mysteries of
God, as an ass is unqualified for understanding musical harmonies. For in this
way he reproves the destructive pride of those who glory in the wisdom of the
world so as to despise Christ, and the entire doctrine of salvation, thinking
themselves happy when they are taken up with creatures; and he beats down the
arrogance of those who, trusting to their own understanding, attempt to scale
heaven itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is also a solution furnished at the same time
to the question, how it happens that Paul in this way throws down upon the
ground every kind of knowledge that is apart from Christ, and tramples, as it
were, under foot what is manifestly one of the chief gifts of God in this world.
For what is more noble than man&#8217;s reason, in which man excels the other
animals? How richly deserving of honor are the liberal sciences,<i> </i>which
polish man, so as to give him the dignity of true humanity! Besides this, what
distinguished and choice fruits they produce! Who would not extol with the
highest commendations civil
prudence</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> (not to speak of other things,) by which
governments, principalities, and kingdoms are maintained? A solution of this
question, I say, is opened up to view from the circumstance,<i> </i>that Paul
does not expressly condemn either man&#8217;s natural perspicacity, or wisdom
acquired from practice and experience, or cultivation of mind attained by
learning; but declares that all this is of no avail for acquiring spiritual
wisdom. And, certainly, it is madness for any one, confiding either in his own
acuteness, or the assistance of learning, to attempt to fly up to heaven, or, in
other words, to judge of the secret mysteries of the kingdom of
God,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f89</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">or to break
through
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021921&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:21) to a discovery of them, for they are hid from human view. Let us, then,
take<i> </i>notice, that we must restrict to the specialities of the case in
hand what Paul here teaches respecting the vanity of the wisdom of this world
&#8212; that it rests in the mere elements of the world, and does not reach to
heaven. In other respects, too, it holds true, that without Christ sciences in
every department are vain, and that the man who knows not God is vain, though he
should be conversant with every branch of learning. Nay more, we may affirm
this, too, with truth, that these choice gifts of God &#8212; expertness of
mind, acuteness of judgment, liberal sciences, and acquaintance with languages,
are in a manner profaned in every instance in which they fall to the lot of
wicked men.</font><br></div>

by the contemplation of his works, they would know God in the exercise of

light discerns nothing. For it is true, that this world is like a theater, in
which the Lord presents to us a clear manifestation of his glory, and yet,
notwithstanding that we have such a spectacle placed before our eyes, we are
stone-blind, not because the manifestation is furnished obscurely, but because

<div><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, when Paul here declares that God is not
known through means of his creatures, you must understand him to mean that a
pure knowledge of him is not attained. For that none may have any pretext for
ignorance, mankind make proficiency in the universal school of nature; so far as
to be affected with some perception of deity, but what God is, they know not,
nay more, they straightway become vain in their imaginations,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John

so as not to be chargeable with contempt, negligence, and ingratitude. Thus it
holds good, that all</font><br></div>

have not glorified
him,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans

<div><font face="Palatino">and that, on the other hand, no one under the
guidance of mere nature ever made such proficiency as to know God. Should any
one bring forward the philosophers as exceptions, I answer, that in them more
especially there is presented a signal token of this our <i>weak</i>ness. For
there will not be found one of them, that has not from that first principle of
knowledge, which I have mentioned, straightway turned aside into
wandering</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

foregoing statement &#8212; that the gospel
is</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the power of God unto
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Farther, by contrasting
believers, whose number is small, with a blind and senseless world, he teaches
us that we err if we stumble at the smallness of their number, inasmuch as they
have been divinely set apart to salvation.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Jews require a

foolishness</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>At the same time he does
not simply explain, but even goes a step farther, by saying that the Jews do not
merely despise the gospel, but even abhor it. &#8220;The<i> </i>Jews,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;desire through means of miracles to have before their eyes an
evidence of divine power: the Greeks are fond of what tends to gratify human
intellect by the applause of acuteness. We,<i> </i>on the other hand,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>preach Christ
crucified</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>wherein there appears at
first view nothing but weakness and folly. He is, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a stumblingblock to the
Jews,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>when they see him as it were
forsaken by God. To the Greeks it appears like a fable, to be told of such a
method of redemption.&#8221; By the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Greeks</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>here, in my opinion, he does not mean simply Gentiles, but has in view those
who had the polish of the liberal sciences, or were distinguished by superior
intelligence. At the same time by <i>synecdoche</i>,<i> </i>all the others come
in like manner to be included. Between Jews<i> </i>and Greeks, however, he draws
this distinction, that the former, striking against Christ by an unreasonable
zeal for the law, raged against the gospel with unbounded fury, as hypocrites
are wont to do, when contending for their superstitions; while the Greeks, on
the other hand, puffed up with pride, regarded him with contempt as
insipid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he ascribes it to the Jews as a fault, that they
are eagerly desirous of signs, it is not on the ground of its being wrong in
itself to demand signs, but he exposes their baseness in the following respects:
&#8212; that by an incessant demand for miracles, they in a manner sought to
bind God to their laws &#8212; that, in accordance with the dullness of their
apprehension, they sought as it were to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>feel him out</i><sup>
f93</sup></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in manifest miracles &#8212; that
they were taken up with the miracles themselves, and looked upon them with
amazement &#8212; and, in fine, that no miracles satisfied them, but instead of
this, they every day gaped incessantly for new ones. Hezekiah is not reproved
for having of his own accord allowed himself to be confirmed by a sign,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;121929&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 19:29, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;122008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 20:8,) nor even Gideon for asking a two-fold sign,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;070637&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
6:37, 39.) Nay, instead of this, Ahaz is condemned for refusing a sign that the
Prophet had offered him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
7:12.) What fault, then, was there on the part of the Jews in asking miracles?
It lay in this, that they did not ask them for a good end, set no bounds to
their desire, and did not make a right use of them. For while faith ought to be
helped by miracles, their only concern was, how long they might persevere in
their unbelief. While it is unlawful to prescribe laws to God, they wantoned
with inordinate desire. While miracles should conduct us to an acquaintance with
Christ, and the spiritual grace of God, they served as a hindrance in their way.
On this account, too, Christ upbraids there,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;410812&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
8:12.)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">A perverse generation
seeketh after a sign.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For there were no bounds to their curiosity and
inordinate desire, and for all that they had so often obtained miracles, no
advantage appeared to arise from them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Both Greeks and Jews</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He shows by this
contrast, that the fact that Christ was so unfavorably received, was not owing
to any fault on his part, nor to the natural disposition of mankind generally,
but arose from the depravity of those who were not enlightened by God, inasmuch
as the elect of God, whether Jews or Gentiles, are not hindered by any
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stumblingblock</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

&#8220; I<i> </i>am aware that nothing except signs has effect upon the
obstinacy of the Jews, and that nothing soothes down the haughtiness of the
Greeks, except an empty show of wisdom. We ought, however, to make no account of
this; because, however our Christ in connection with the abasement of his cross
is a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stumblingblock</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to the Jews, and is derided by the Greeks, he is, notwithstanding, to all

what appears

is a concession, as I have noticed a little ago. For no one can but perceive,
that in strict propriety neither foolishness nor weakness can be ascribed to
God, but it was necessary, by such ironical expressions, to beat down the mad
presumption of the flesh, which does not scruple to rob God of all his
glory.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold your
calling.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the mood of the Greek verb
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ble&gt;pete</font><font face="Palatino">)
is doubtful, and the indicative suits the context equally as well as the
imperative, I leave it to the reader&#8217;s choice which of them he may prefer.
The meaning is manifestly the same in either case, for supposing it to be the
indicative (<i>ye see</i>,)<i> </i>he would in that case summon them as
witnesses &#8212; as of a thing that is manifest, and call them forward as it
were to a thing that is present. On the other hand, understanding it in the
imperative, he stirs them up, as it were, from their drowsiness to a
consideration of the matter itself. The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>calling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>may be taken in a collective<i> </i>sense to mean the multitude of those
that are called &#8212; in this sense: &#8220;Ye<i> </i>see what description of
persons they are among you that the Lord has called.&#8221;<i> </i>I am,
however, rather inclined to think, that he points out the manner of their
calling, and it is a most forcible argument, because it follows from this, that,
if they despise the abasement of the cross, they in a manner make void their
calling, in which God had acted in such a manner, as to take away all merit from
human wisdom, and power, and glory. Hence he tacitly accuses them of
ingratitude, because, forgetful alike of God&#8217;s grace and of themselves,
they regard the gospel of Christ with disdain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Two things, however, must be observed here &#8212;
that he was desirous from the example of the Corinthians to confirm the truth of
what he had said: and farther, that he designed to admonish them, that they must
be entirely divested of pride, if they duly considered the order of things that
the Lord had observed in their calling.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To put to
shame</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wise and
noble,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to bring to naught things that
are</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Both expressions are appropriate,
for fortitude and wisdom vanish when they are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>put to
shame</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>but what has an existence
requires to be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brought to
naught</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>By the choosing of the poor, and
the foolish, and the ignoble, he means, that God has preferred them before the
great, and the wise, and the noble. For it would not have sufficed, for beating
down the arrogance of the flesh, if God had placed them all upon a level. Hence,
those who appeared to excel he put in the background, in order that he might
thoroughly abase them. That man, however, were an arrant fool, who would infer
from this, that God has in this manner abased the glory of the flesh, in order
that the great and noble might be shut out from the hope of salvation. There are
some foolish persons that make this a pretext for not merely triumphing over the
great, as if God had cast them off, but even despising them as far beneath them.
Let us, however, bear in mind, that this is said to the Corinthians, who, though
they had no great distinction in the world, were nevertheless, even without any
occasion, puffed up. God, therefore, by confounding the mighty, and the wise,
and the great, does not design to elate with pride the weak, the illiterate, and
the abject, but brings down all of them together to one level. Let those,
therefore, that are contemptible in the eyes of the world, think thus with
themselves: &#8220;What<i> </i>modesty is called for on our part, when even
those that have high honor in the view of the world have nothing left
them?&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

what must become of the stars? If the light of the stars is extinguished, what

those who have been called by the Lord, while of no estimation in the view of
the world, may not abuse these words of Paul by pluming their crests, but, on
the contrary, keeping in mind the exhortation &#8212;</font><br></div>

<i>none </i>of the noble and mighty that have been called by God, but that there
are <i>few</i>.<i> He </i>states the design of this &#8212; that the Lord might
bring down the glory of the flesh, by preferring the contemptible before the
great. God himself, however, by the mouth of David, exhorts kings to embrace
Christ,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f99

alike to small and great, alike to kings and their subjects,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 2:1-4.) He has himself furnished a token of this. Shepherds, in the

universal call of the pious, he says, that we are nothing previously to our
being called, which must be understood as referring to reality in the sight of

<i>nothingness
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oujdeneia</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>of which he speaks must be viewed as referring to the opinion of men, as is
manifest from the corresponding clause, in which he says that this is done in
order </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the things that are

nothing except in appearance, because in reality we are all nothing.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>a corresponding idea must be understood &#8212; that <i>in us </i>there is
nothing but <i>sin</i>;<i> </i>and so as to the other terms. Now he ascribes
here to Christ four commendatory titles, that include his entire excellence, and
every benefit that we receive from him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>first </i>place, he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he is made unto us
wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>by which he means, that we
obtain in him an absolute perfection of wisdom, inasmuch as the Father has fully
revealed himself to us in him, that we may not desire to know any thing besides
him. There is a similar passage in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:3 &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">In whom are hid all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Of this we shall have occasion to speak afterwards
when we come to the next chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Secondly</i>,<i> </i>he says that he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made unto us
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>by which he means that we
are on his account acceptable to God, inasmuch as he expiated our sins by his
death, and his obedience is imputed to us for righteousness. For as the
righteousness of faith consists in remission of sins and a gracious acceptance,
we obtain both through Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Thirdly</i>,<i> </i>he calls him our
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctification</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>by which he means, that we who are otherwise unholy by nature, are by his
Spirit renewed unto holiness, that we may serve God. From this, also, we infer,
that we cannot be justified freely through faith alone without at the same time
living holily. For these fruits of grace are connected together, as it were, by
an indissoluble
tie,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f101</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so that he who attempts to sever them does in a manner tear Christ in pieces.
Let therefore the man who seeks to be justified through Christ, by God&#8217;s
unmerited goodness, consider that this cannot be attained without his taking him
at the same time for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctification</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>or, in other words, being renewed to innocence and purity of life. Those,
however, that slander us, as if by preaching a free justification through faith
we called men off from good works, are amply refuted from this passage, which
intimates that faith apprehends in Christ regeneration equally with forgiveness
of sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Observe, on the other hand, that these two offices of
Christ are conjoined in such a manner as to be, notwithstanding, distinguished
from each other. What, therefore, Paul here expressly distinguishes, it is not
allowable mistakenly to confound.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Fourthly</i>,<i> </i>he teaches us that he is
given to us for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>redemption</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>by which he means, that through his goodness we are delivered at once from
all bondage to sin, and from all the misery that flows from it. Thus
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>redemption</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is the first gift of Christ that is begun in us, and the last that is
completed. For the commencement of salvation consists in our being drawn out of
the labyrinth of sin and death; yet in the meantime, until the final day of the
resurrection, <i>we groan </i>with desire for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>redemption</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>(as we read in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450823&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:23.) If it is asked in what way Christ is given to us <i>for
redemption</i>,<i> </i>I answer &#8212; &#8220;Because he made himself a
ransom.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In fine, of all the blessings that are here
enumerated we must seek in Christ not the half, or merely a part, but the entire
completion. For Paul does not say that he has been given to us by way of filling
up, or eking out righteousness, holiness, wisdom, and redemption, but assigns to
him exclusively the entire accomplishment of the whole. Now as you will scarcely
meet with another passage of Scripture that more distinctly marks out all the
offices of Christ, you may also understand from it very clearly the nature and
efficacy of faith. For as Christ is the proper object of faith, every one that
knows what are the benefits that Christ confers upon us is at the same time
taught to understand what faith is.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that glorieth let him glory in
the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Mark the end that God has in
view in bestowing all things upon us in Christ &#8212; that we may not claim any
merit to ourselves, but may give him all the praise. For God does not despoil
with the view of leaving us bare, but forthwith clothes us with his glory
&#8212; yet on this condition, that whenever we would glory we must go out of
ourselves. In short, man, brought to nothing in his own estimation, and
acknowledging that there is nothing good anywhere but in God alone, must
renounce all desire for his own glory, and with all his might aspire and aim at
the glory of God exclusively. This is also more clearly apparent from the
context in the writings of the Prophet, from whom Paul has borrowed this
testimony; for in that passage the Lord, after stripping all mankind of glory in
respect of strength, wisdom, and riches, commands us to glory only <i>in knowing
him</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240923&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
9:23, 24.) Now he would have us know him in such a way as to <i>know </i>that it
is </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he that exercises judgment,
righteousness, and mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>For this
knowledge produces in us at once confidence in him and fear of him. If therefore
a man has his mind regulated in such a manner that, claiming no merit to
himself, he desires that God alone be exalted; if he rests with satisfaction on
his grace, and places his entire happiness in his fatherly love, and, in fine,
is satisfied with God alone, that man <i>truly </i>&#8220;glories<i> </i>in the
Lord.&#8221; I say <i>truly</i>,<i> </i>for even hypocrites on false grounds
glory in him, as Paul declares,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:17,) when being either puffed up with his gifts, or elated with a base
confidence in the flesh, or abusing his word, they nevertheless take his name

And I, when I came</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Paul having begun to
speak of his own method of teaching, had straightway fallen into a discussion as
to the nature of gospel preaching generally. Now again he returns to speak of
himself, to show that nothing in him was despised but what belonged to the
nature of the gospel itself, and did in a manner adhere to it. He allows
therefore that he had not had any of the aids of human eloquence or wisdom to
qualify him for producing any effect, but while he acknowledges himself to be
destitute of such resources, he hints at the inference to be drawn from this
&#8212; that the power of God shone the more illustriously in his ministry, from
its standing in no need of such helps. This latter idea, however, he will be
found bringing forward shortly afterwards. For the present he simply grants that
he has nothing of human wisdom, and in the meantime reserves to himself this
much &#8212; that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>published
the testimony of God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Some interpreters,
indeed, explain the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>testimony of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in a passive sense; but as for
myself, I have no doubt that another interpretation is more in <i>accordance
</i>with the Apostle&#8217;s design, so that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the testimony of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is that which has come forth from
God &#8212; the doctrine of the gospel, of which he is the author and witness.
He now distinguishes between
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speech</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">lo&gt;gon ajpo&lt; th~v
sofi&gt;av</font><font face="Palatino">.)<i> </i>Hence what I noticed
before</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f103</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is here confirmed &#8212; that hitherto
he has not been speaking of mere empty prattling, but has included the entire
training of human learning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I did not reckon it

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eklegein</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>that is to choose out anything as
precious,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f104</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> there is, I think, no person of sound
judgment but will allow that the rendering that I have given is a probable one,
provided only the construction admits of it. At the same time, if we render it
thus &#8212; &#8220;No kind of knowledge did I hold in esteem,&#8221; there will
be nothing harsh in this rendering. If you understand something to be supplied,
the sentence will run smoothly enough in this way &#8212; &#8220;Nothing did I
value myself upon, as worth my knowing, or on the ground of knowledge.&#8221; At
the same time I do not altogether reject a different interpretation &#8212;
viewing Paul as declaring that he esteemed nothing as knowledge, or as entitled
to be called knowledge, except Christ alone. Thus the Greek preposition
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">and</font><font face="Palatino">,
would, as often happens, require to be supplied. But whether the former
interpretation is not disapproved of, or whether this latter pleases better, the
substance of the passage amounts to this: &#8220;As to my wanting the ornaments
of speech, and wanting, too, the more elegant refinements of discourse, the
reason of this was, that I did not aspire at them, nay rather, I despised them,
because there was one thing only that my heart was set upon &#8212; that I might
preach Christ with simplicity.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In adding the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>crucified,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he does not mean that he preached nothing respecting Christ except the
cross; but that, with all the abasement of the cross, he nevertheless preached
Christ. It is as though he had said: &#8220;The ignominy of the cross will not
prevent me from looking up to
him</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f105</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> from whom salvation comes, or <i>make
</i>me ashamed to regard all my wisdom as comprehended in him &#8212; in him, I
say, whom proud men despise and reject on account of the reproach of the
cross.&#8221; Hence the statement must be explained in this way: &#8220;No<i>
</i>kind of knowledge was in my view of so much importance as to lead me to
desire anything but Christ,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>crucified though he
was</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221;<i> </i>This little clause is added
by way of enlargement
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">au]xhsin</font><font face="Palatino">,)
with the view of galling so much the more those arrogant masters, by whom Christ
was next to despised, as they were eager to gain applause by being renowned for
a higher kind of wisdom. Here we have a beautiful passage, from which we learn
what it is that faithful ministers ought to teach, what it is that we must,
during our whole life, be learning, and in comparison with which everything else
must be &#8220;counted as dung.&#8221;

what he had previously touched upon &#8212; that he had nothing shining or
excellent in him in the eyes of men, to raise him to distinction. He concedes,
however, to his adversaries what they desired in such a way as to make those
very things which, in their opinion, tended to detract from the credit of his
ministry, redound to its highest commendation. If he appeared less worthy of
esteem from his being so mean and abject according to the flesh, he shows that
the power of God shone out the more conspicuously in this, that he could effect
so much, while sustained by no human helps. He has in his eye not merely those
foolish boasters</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who aimed at mere show, with the view of
obtaining for themselves a name, but the Corinthians, too, who gazed with
astonishment on their empty shows. Accordingly a recital of this kind was fitted
to have great weight with them. They were aware that Paul had brought nothing
with him in respect of the flesh that was fitted to help him forward, or that
might enable him to insinuate himself into the favor of men, and yet they had
seen the amazing success which the Lord had vouchsafed to his preaching. Nay
more, they had in a manner beheld with their own eyes the Spirit of God present
in his doctrine. When, therefore, despising his simplicity, they were tickled
with a desire for a kind of wisdom, I know not of what sort, more puffed up and
more polished, and were captivated with outward appearance, nay, even with
adventitious ornament, rather than with the living efficacy of the Spirit, did
they not sufficiently discover their ambitious spirit? It is with good reason,
therefore, that Paul puts them in mind of his <i>first entering in among
them</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;520201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 2:1,) that they may not draw back from that divine efficacy, which
they once knew by experience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>weakness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

Corinthians 11:30;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;471205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

person&#8217;s favor and dignity in the opinion of others.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear and
trembling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>are the effects<i> </i>of that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>weakness</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>There are, however, two ways in which these two terms may be explained by
us. Either we may understand him to mean, that when he pondered the magnitude of
the office that he sustained, it was tremblingly, and not without great anxiety,
that he occupied himself in it; or that, being encompassed with many dangers, he
was in constant alarm and incessant anxiety. Either meaning suits the context
sufficiently well. The second, however, is, in my opinion, the more simple. Such
a spirit of modesty, indeed, becomes the servants of the Lord, that, conscious
of their own weakness, and looking, on the other hand, at once<i> </i>to the
difficulty and the excellence of so arduous an office, they should enter on the
discharge of it with reverence<i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>For those that intrude themselves confidently, and in a spirit much elated,
or who discharge the ministry of the word with an easy mind, as though they were
fully equal to the task, are ignorant at once of themselves and of the
task.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f108</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, Paul here connects
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>weakness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and as the term <i>weakness </i>denotes everything that was fitted to render
him contemptible, it follows necessarily that this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>must relate to dangers and difficulties. It is certain, however, that this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>was of such a nature as did not prevent Paul from engaging in the
Lord&#8217;s work, as facts bear witness. The Lord&#8217;s servants are neither
so senseless as not to <i>perceive </i>impending dangers, nor so devoid of
feeling as not to be moved by them. Nay more, it is necessary for them to be
seriously afraid on two accounts chiefly &#8212; <i>first</i>,<i> </i>that,
abased in their own eyes, they may learn wholly to lean and rest upon God alone,
and <i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>that they may be trained to a thorough renunciation
of self. Paul, therefore, was not devoid of the influence of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>but that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he controlled in such a manner as to go forward, notwithstanding, with
intrepidity through the midst of dangers, so as to encounter with undaunted
firmness and fortitude all the assaults of Satan and of the world; and, in fine,
so as to struggle through every impediment.</font><br></div>

which she may conciliate for herself the affections of her hearers. With this he

</i>(<i>demonstration</i>;)<i> </i>for such is our dullness in contemplating the
works of God, that when he makes use of inferior instruments, they serve as so
many veils to hide from us his influence, so that we do not clearly perceive it.
On the other hand, as in the furtherance given to Paul&#8217;s ministry, there
was no aid furnished from the flesh or the world, and as the hand of God was as
it were made bare,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
52:10,) his influence was assuredly the more apparent.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That your faith should not be
in the wisdom of men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> To be </i>is used here
as meaning <i>to consist</i>.<i> </i>His meaning, then, is, that the Corinthians
derived this advantage from his having preached Christ among them without
dependence on human wisdom, and relying solely on the Spirit&#8217;s influence,
that their faith was founded not on men but on God. If the Apostle&#8217;s
preaching had rested exclusively on the power of eloquence, it might have been
overthrown by superior eloquence, and besides, no one would pronounce that to be
solid truth which rests on mere elegance of speech. It may indeed be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>helped by
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>but it ought not <i>to rest upon
it</i>.<i> </i>On the other hand, <i>that </i>must have been most powerful which
could stand of itself without any foreign aid. Hence it forms a choice
commendation of Paul&#8217;s preaching, that heavenly influence shone forth in
it so clearly, that it surmounted so many hindrances, while deriving no
assistance from the world. It follows, therefore, that they must not allow
themselves to be moved away from his doctrine, which they acknowledge to rest on
the authority of God. Paul, however, speaks here of the faith of the Corinthians
in such a way as to bring forward this, as a general statement. Let it then be
known by us that it is the property of faith to rest upon <i>God </i>alone,
without depending on
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>men</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i>
</i>for it requires to have so much certainty to go upon, that it will not fail,
even when assailed by all the machinations of hell, but will perseveringly
endure and sustain every assault. This cannot be accomplished unless we are
fully persuaded that God has spoken to us, and that what we have believed is no
mere contrivance of men. While faith ought properly to be founded on the word of
God alone, there is at the same time no impropriety in adding this second prop,
&#8212; that believers recognize the word which they hear as having come forth
from God, from the effect of its influence.</font><br><br></div>

boasted of a thing unknown.</font><br></div>

anticipation what he had already conceded &#8212; that the gospel was not human
wisdom, lest any one should object that there were few supporters of that
doctrine; nay more, that it was contemned by all that were most distinguished
for intellect. Hence he acknowledges of his own accord what might be brought
forward by way of objection, but in such a way as not at all to give up his
point.</font><br></div>

distinction in the world through means of any endowment, for sometimes there are
persons, who, though they are by no means distinguished by acuteness of
intellect, are nevertheless held in admiration from the dignity of the station
which they hold. That, however, we may not be alarmed by these imposing
appearances, the Apostle adds, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come to
nought</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or perish. For it were
unbefitting, that a thing that is eternal should depend upon the authority of
those who are frail, and fading, and cannot give perpetuity even to themselves:
&#8220;When the kingdom of God is revealed, let the wisdom of this world retire,
and what is transient give place to what is eternal; for the princes of this
world have their distinction, but it is of such a nature as is in one moment
extinguished. What is this in comparison with the heavenly and incorruptible
kingdom of God?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wisdom of God in a

mysteries, and is consequently
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hidden</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>For the gospel so far transcends the perspicacity of human intellect, that
to whatever height those who are accounted men of superior intellect may raise
their view, they never can reach its elevated height, while in the meantime they
despise its meanness, as if it were prostrate at their feet. The consequence is,
that the more proudly they contemn it, they are the farther from acquaintance
with it &#8212; nay more, they are removed to so great a distance as to be
prevented from even seeing it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which God hath
ordained.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Paul having said that the
gospel was a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hidden</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>thing, there was a danger lest believers should, on hearing this, be
appalled by the difficulty, and retire in despair. Accordingly he meets this
danger, and declares that it had notwithstanding been appointed to us, that we
might enjoy it. Lest any one, I say, should reckon that he has nothing to do
with the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hidden
wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or should imagine it to be
unlawful to direct his eyes towards it, as not being within the reach of human
capacity, he teaches that it has been communicated to us in accordance with the
eternal counsel of God. At the same time he has something still farther in view,
for by an implied comparison he extols that grace which has been opened up by
Christ&#8217;s advent, and distinguishes us above our fathers, who lived under
the law. On this point I have spoken more at large in the end of the last
chapter of the Romans. <i>First </i>of all then he argues from what God had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ordained</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>for if God has appointed nothing in vain, it follows, that we will be no
losers by listening to the gospel which he has appointed for us, for he
accommodates himself to our capacity in addressing us. In accordance with this
Isaiah
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;234519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
45:19) says &#8212;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Secondly</i>,<i> </i>with the view of rendering
the gospel attractive, and alluring us to a desire of acquaintance with it, he
draws an argument still farther from the design that God had in view in giving
it to us &#8212; &#8220;<i>for our glory</i>.&#8221;<i> </i>In this expression,
too, he seems to draw a comparison between us and the fathers, our heavenly
Father not having vouchsafed to them that honor which he reserved for the advent
of his Son.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

</i>If you supply the words <i>by their own discernment</i>,<i> </i>the
statement would not be more applicable to them than to the generality of
mankind, and the very lowest of the people; for what are the attainments of all
of us as to this matter, from the greatest to the least? Only we may perhaps
say, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>princes</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>rather than others, are charged with blindness and ignorance &#8212; for
this reason, that they alone appear in the view of the word clear-sighted and
wise. At the same time I should prefer to understand the expression in a more
simple way, agreeably to the common usage of Scripture, which is wont to speak
in terms of universality of those things that, happen
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">epi to
polu</font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that is <i>commonly</i>,<i> </i>and
also to make a negative statement in terms of universality, as to those things
that happen only </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpi
e]latton</font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that is <i>very seldom</i>.<i>
</i>In this sense there were nothing inconsistent with this statement, though
there were found a few men of distinction, and elevated above others in point of
dignity, who were at the same time endowed with the pure knowledge of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For had they
known</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The wisdom of God shone forth
clearly <i>in Christ</i>,<i> </i>and yet <i>there </i>the <i>princes </i>did not
perceive it; for those who took the lead in the crucifixion of Christ were on
the one hand the chief men of the Jews, high in credit for holiness and wisdom;
and on the other hand Pilate and the Roman empire. In this we have a most
distinct proof of the utter blindness of all that are wise only according to the
flesh. This argument of the Apostle, however, might appear to be weak.
&#8220;What! do we not every day see persons who, with deliberate malice, fight
against the truth of God, as to which they are not ignorant; nay, even if a
rebellion so manifest were not to be seen by us with our eyes, what else is the
sin against the Holy Ghost than a willful obstinacy against God, when a man
knowingly and willingly does not merely oppose his word, but even fights against
it. It is on this account, too, that Christ declares that the Pharisees, and
others of that description, <i>knew him</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430728&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
7:28,) while he deprives them of all pretext of ignorance, and accuses them of
impious cruelty in persecuting him, the faithful servant of the Father, for no
other reason but that they hated the truth.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I answer that there are two kinds of ignorance. The
<i>one </i>arises from inconsiderate zeal, not expressly rejecting what is good,
but from having an impression that it is evil. No one, it is true, sins in
ignorance in such a way as not to be chargeable meanwhile in the sight, of God
with an evil conscience, there being always a mixture of hypocrisy, or pride, or
contempt; but at the same time judgment, and all intelligence in the mind of
man, are sometimes so effectually choked, that nothing but bare ignorance is to
be seen by others, or even by the individual himself. Such was Paul before he
was enlightened; for the reason why he hated Christ and was hostile to his
doctrine was, that he was through ignorance hurried away with a preposterous
Zeal for the law.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f116</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Yet he was not devoid of hypocrisy, nor
exempt from pride, so as to be free from blame in the sight of God, but those
vices were so completely covered over with ignorance and blindness as not to be
perceived or felt even by himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>other </i>kind of ignorance has more of the
appearance of insanity and derangement, than of mere ignorance; for those that
of their own accord rise up against God, are like persons in a frenzy, who,
seeing, see not.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:13.) It must be looked upon, indeed, as a settled point, that infidelity is
always blind; but the difference lies here, that in some cases malice is covered
over with blindness to such a degree that the individual, through a kind of
stupidity, is without any perception of his own wickedness. This is the case
with those who, with a good intention, as they speak, or in other words, a
foolish imagination, impose upon themselves. In some cases malice has the
ascendancy in such a manner, that in spite of the checks of conscience, the
individual rushes forward into wickedness of this sort with a kind of
madness.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f117</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence it is not to be wondered, if Paul
declares that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the princes of this
world would not have crucified Christ, had they
known</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the wisdom of God. For the
Pharisees and Scribes did not know Christ&#8217;s doctrine to be true, so as not
to be bewildered in their mind, and wander on in their own
darkness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
As it is written, &#8220;What eye hath not
seen.&#8221;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>All are agreed that this
passage is taken from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;236404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
64:4, and as the meaning is at first view plain and easy, interpreters do not
give themselves much trouble in expounding it. On looking, however, more
narrowly into it, two very great difficulties present themselves. The <i>first
</i>is, that the words that are here quoted by Paul do not correspond with the
words of the Prophet. The <i>second </i>is, that it seems as though Paul had
perverted the Prophet&#8217;s declaration to a purpose quite foreign to his
design.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First then as to the words; and as they may be taken
in different senses, they are explained variously by interpreters. Some render
the passage thus: &#8220;From<i> </i>the beginning of the world men have not
heard, nor perceived with their ears, and eye hath not seen any god beside Thee,
who doth act in such a manner towards him that waiteth for him.&#8221; Others
understand the discourse as addressed to God, in this manner: &#8220;Eye<i>
</i>hath not seen, nor hath ear heard, O God, besides thee, the things which
thou dost for those that wait for thee.&#8221; Literally, however, the
Prophet&#8217;s meaning is: &#8220;From the beginning of the world men have not
heard, nor have they perceived with the ears, hath not seen a god, (or O God,)
besides thee, will do (or will prepare) for him that waiteth for him.&#8221; If
we understand
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">
(God) to be in the accusative, the relative <i>who </i>must be supplied. This
exposition, too, appears, at first view, to suit better with the Prophet&#8217;s
context in respect of the verb that follows being used in the third
person;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f118</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but it is farther removed from
Paul&#8217;s meaning, on which we ought to place more dependence than on any
other consideration. For where shall we find a surer or more faithful
interpreter than the Spirit of God of this authoritative declaration, which He
himself dictated to Isaiah &#8212; in the exposition which He has furnished by
the mouth of Paul. With the view of obviating, however, the calumnies of the
wicked, I observe that the Hebrew idiom admits of our understanding the Prophets
true meaning to be this: &#8220;O God, neither hath eye seen, nor hath ear
heard: but thou alone knowest the things which thou art wont to do to those that
wait for thee.&#8221;<i> </i>The sudden change of person forms no objection, as
we know that it is so common in the writings of the Prophets, that it needs not
be any hindrance in our way. If any one, however, prefers the former
interpretation, he will have no occasion for charging either us or the Apostle
with departing from the simple meaning of the words, for we supply less than
they do, as they are under the necessity of adding a mark of comparison to the
verb, rendering it thus: &#8220;<i>who</i> doth act <i>in such a
manner</i>.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to what follows respecting the<i> entering </i>of
these things </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into the heart of
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>though the expression is not made
use of by the Prophet, it does not differ materially from the clause <i>besides
thee</i>.<i> </i>For in ascribing this knowledge to God alone, he excludes from
it not merely the bodily senses of men, but also the entire faculty of the
understanding. While, therefore, the Prophet makes mention only of sight and
hearing, he includes at the same time by implication all the faculties of the
soul. And without doubt these are the two instruments by which we attain the
knowledge of those things that find their way into the understanding. In using
the expression </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>them that love
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he has followed the Greek
interpreters, who have translated it in this way from having been misled by the
resemblance between one letter and
another;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f119</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but as that did not affect the point in
hand, he did not choose to depart from the common reading, as we frequently have
occasion to observe how closely he follows the received version. Though the
words, therefore, are not the same, there is no real difference<i> </i>of
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I come now to the subject-matter. The Prophet in that
passage, when mentioning how signally God had on all occasions befriended his
people in their <i>emergencies</i>,<i> </i>exclaims, that his acts of kindness
to the pious surpass the comprehension of human intellect. &#8220;But<i>
</i>what has this to do,&#8221; some one will say, &#8220;with spiritual
doctrine, and the promises of eternal life, as to which Paul is here
arguing?&#8221;<i> </i>There are three ways in which this question may be
answered. There were no inconsistency in affirming that the Prophet, having made
mention of earthly blessings, was in consequence of this led on to make a
general statement, and even to extol that spiritual blessedness which is laid up
in heaven for believers. I prefer, however, to understand him simply as
referring to those gifts of God&#8217;s grace that are daily conferred upon
believers. In these it becomes us always to observe their source, and not to
confine our views to their present aspect. Now their source is that unmerited
goodness of God, by which he has adopted us into the number of his sons. He,
therefore, who would estimate these things aright, will not contemplate them in
their naked aspect, but will clothe them with God&#8217;s fatherly love, as with
a robe, and will thus be led forward from temporal favors to eternal life. It
might also be maintained that the argument is from the less to the greater; for
if man&#8217;s intellect is not competent to measure God&#8217;s earthly gifts,
how much less will it reach the height of heaven?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:12.) I have, however, already intimated which interpretation
prefer.</font><br><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Spirit searcheth all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This is added for the
consolation of the pious, that they may rest more securely in the revelation
which they have from the Spirit of God, as though he had said. &#8220;Let<i>
</i>it suffice us to have the Spirit of God as a witness, for there is nothing
in God that is too profound for him to reach.&#8221; For such is the import here
of the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word
searcheth</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>By the <i>deep things </i>you
must<i> </i>understand &#8212; not secret judgments, which we are forbidden to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>search
into</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>but the entire doctrine of
salvation, which would have been to no purpose set before us in the Scriptures,
were it not that God elevates our minds to it by his Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For what man
knoweth?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Two different things he intends
to teach here: <i>first</i>,<i> </i>that the doctrine of the Gospel cannot be
understood otherwise than by the testimony of the Holy Spirit; and
<i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>that those who have a testimony of this nature from the
Holy Spirit, have an assurance as firm and solid, as if they felt with their
hands what they believe, for the Spirit is a faithful and indubitable witness.
This he proves by a similitude drawn from our own
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">:<i>
</i>for every one is conscious of his own thoughts, and on the other hand what
lies hid in any man&#8217;s heart, is unknown to another. In the same way what
is the counsel of God, and what his will, is hid from all mankind, for
&#8220;who<i> </i>hath been his counselor?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451134&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:34.) It is, therefore, a secret recess, inaccessible to mankind; but, if the
Spirit of God himself introduces us into it, or in other words, makes us
acquainted with those things that are otherwise hid from our view, there will
then be no more ground for hesitation, for nothing that is in God escapes the
notice of the Spirit of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This similitude, however, may seem to be not
altogether very appropriate, for as the tongue bears an impress of the mind,
mankind communicate their dispositions to each other, so that they become
acquainted with each other&#8217;s thoughts. Why then may we not understand from
the word of God what is his will? For while mankind by pretenses and falsehoods
in many cases conceal their thoughts rather than discover them, this cannot
happen with God, whose word is undoubted truth, and his genuine and lively
image. We must, however, carefully observe how far Paul designed to extend this
comparison. A man&#8217;s innermost thought, of which others are ignorant, is
perceived by himself alone: if he afterwards makes it known to others, this does
not hinder but that his spirit alone knows what is in him. For it may happen
that he does not persuade: it may even happen that he does not properly express
his own meaning; but even if he attains both objects, this statement is not at
variance with the other &#8212; that his own spirit alone has the true knowledge
of it. There is this difference, however, between God&#8217;s thoughts and those
of men, that men mutually understand each other; but the word of God is a kind
of <i>hidden wisdom</i>,<i> </i>the loftiness of which is not reached by the
weakness of the human <i>intellect</i>.<i> </i>Thus the light shineth in
darkness,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:5,) aye and until the Spirit opens the eyes of the blind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The spirit of a
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Observe, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit of a
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is taken here for the soul, in which
the intellectual faculty, as it is called, resides. For Paul would have
expressed himself inaccurately if he had ascribed this knowledge to man&#8217;s
intellect, or in other words, the faculty itself, and not to the soul, which is
endued with the power of understanding.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now we have received, not the
spirit of the world</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He<i> </i>heightens
by contrast the certainty of which he had made mention. &#8220;The<i> </i>Spirit
of revelation,&#8221; says he, &#8220;which<i> </i>we have received, is not of
the world, so as to be merely creeping upon the ground, so as to be subject to
vanity, or be in suspense, or vary or fluctuate, or hold us in doubt and
perplexity. On the contrary, it is from God, and hence it is above all heavens,
of solid and unvarying truth, and placed above all risk of
doubt.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is a passage that is most abundantly clear, for
refuting that diabolical doctrine of the Sophists as to a constant hesitancy on
the part of believers. For they require all believers to be in doubt, whether
they are in the grace of God or not, and allow of no assurance of salvation, but
what hangs on moral or probable conjecture.<i> </i>In this, however, they
overthrow faith in two respects: for <i>first </i>they would have us be in
doubt, whether we are in a state of grace, and then afterwards they suggest a
<i>second </i>occasion of doubt &#8212; as to final
perseverance.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f120</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Here, however, the Apostle declares in
general terms, that the <i>elect </i>have the Spirit given them, by whose
testimony they are assured that they have been adopted to the hope of eternal
salvation. Undoubtedly, if they would maintain their doctrine, they must of
necessity either take away the Spirit of God from the elect, or make even the
Spirit himself subject to uncertainty. Both of these things are openly at
variance with Paul&#8217;s doctrine. Hence we may know the nature of faith to be
this, that conscience has from the Holy Spirit a sure testimony of the good-will
of God towards it, so that, resting upon this, it does not hesitate to invoke
God as a Father. Thus Paul lifts up our faith above the world, that it may look
down with lofty disdain upon all the pride of the flesh; for otherwise it will
be always timid and wavering, because we see how boldly human ingenuity exalts
itself, the haughtiness of which requires to be trodden under foot by the sons
of God through means of an opposing haughtiness of heroical
magnanimity.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That we may know the things that

</i>is made use of to express more fully the assurance of confidence. Let us
observe, however, that it is not acquired in a natural way, and is not attained
by the mental capacity, but depends entirely on the revelation of the Spirit.
The things that he makes mention of as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>given by

through his death and resurrection &#8212; that being reconciled to God, and

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which things also we speak, not

himself, for he is still employed in commending his ministry. Now it is a high
commendation that he pronounces upon his preaching, when he says of it that it
contains a secret revelation of the most important matters &#8212; the doctrine
of the Holy Spirit, the sum of our salvation, and the inestimable treasures of
Christ, that the Corinthians may know how highly it ought to be prized. In the
meantime he returns to the concession that he had made before &#8212; that his
preaching had not been adorned with any glitter of words, and had no luster of
elegance, but was contented with the simple doctrine of the Holy Spirit. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the learned words of human
wisdom</i><sup> f122</sup></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he means those

are adapted to a pure and simple style, corresponding to the dignity of the

be wanting, we must always take care that the wisdom of God be not polluted with
any borrowed and profane luster. Paul&#8217;s manner of teaching was of such a
kind, that the power of the Spirit shone forth in it single and unattired,
without any foreign aid.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He returns to what he had previously touched upon,
for his object is to remove a stumblingblock which might stand in the way of the
weak &#8212; that there were so many that despised the gospel. He shows that we
ought to make no account of a contempt of such a nature as proceeds from
ignorance, and that it ought, consequently,<i> </i>to<i> </i>be no hindrance in
the way of our going forward in the race of faith, unless perhaps we choose to
shut our eyes upon the brightness of the sun, because it. is not seen by the
blind. It would, however, argue great ingratitude in any individual, when God
bestows upon him a special favor, to reject it, on the ground of its not being

f130</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in the view of all that are wise merely
in the view of man. But whence comes this? It is from their own blindness. In
what respect, then, does this detract from the majesty of the gospel?&#8221; In
short, while ignorant persons depreciate the gospel, because they measure its
value by the estimation in which it is held by men, Paul derives an argument
from this for extolling more highly its dignity. For he teaches that the reason
why it is contemned is that it is unknown, and that the reason why it is unknown
is that it is too profound and sublime to be apprehended by the understanding of
man. What a superior wisdom</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f131</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> this is, which so far transcends all
human understanding, that man cannot have so much as a taste of
it!</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f132</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> While, however, Paul here tacitly
imputes it to the pride of the flesh, that mankind dare to condemn as foolish
what. they do not comprehend, he at the same time shows how great is the
weakness or rather bluntness of the human understanding, when he declares it to
be incapable of spiritual apprehension. For he teaches, that it is not owing
simply to the obstinacy of the human will, but to the impotency, also, of the
understanding, that man does not attain to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>things of the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Had he said that men are not
<i>willing </i>to be wise, <i>that </i>indeed would have been true, but he
states farther that they are not <i>able</i>.<i> </i>Hence we infer, that faith
is not in one&#8217;s own power, but is divinely conferred.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because they are spiritually
discerned</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>That is, the Spirit of God,
from whom the doctrine of the gospel comes, is its only true interpreter, to
open it up to us. Hence in judging of it, men&#8217;s minds must of necessity be
in blindness until they are enlightened by the Spirit of
God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f133</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence infer, that all mankind are by
nature destitute of the Spirit of God: otherwise the argument would be
inconclusive. It is from the Spirit of God, it is true, that we have that feeble
spark of reason which we all enjoy; but at present we are speaking of that
special discovery of heavenly wisdom which God vouchsafes to his sons alone.
Hence the more insufferable the ignorance of those who imagine that the gospel
is offered to mankind in common in such a way that all indiscriminately are
free</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

able to determine what we ought to shun and what to follow.</font><br></div>

all times encompassed with much ignorance, and are in danger of erring: nay
more, even those who come nearest to perfection from time to time fall and
bruise themselves. The answer is easy: Paul does not extend this faculty to
everything, so as to represent all that are renewed by the Spirit of God as
exempt from every kind of error, but simply designs to teach, that the wisdom of
the flesh is of no avail for judging of the doctrine of piety, and that this
right of judgment and authority belong exclusively to the Spirit of God. In so
far, therefore, as any one is regenerated, and according to the measure of grace
conferred upon him, does he judge with accuracy and certainty, and no
farther.</font><br></div>

And I, brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He begins to apply to
the Corinthians themselves, that he had said respecting carnal persons, that
they may understand that the fault was their own &#8212; that the doctrine of
the Cross had not more charms for them. It is probable, that in mercantile minds
like theirs there was too much confidence and arrogance still lingering, so that
it was not without much ado and great difficulty that they could bring
themselves to embrace the simplicity of the gospel. Hence it was, that
undervaluing the Apostle, and the divine efficacy of his preaching, they were
more prepared to listen to those teachers that were subtle and showy, while
destitute of the Spirit.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f145</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence, with the view of beating down so
much the better their insolence, he declares, that they belong to the company of
those who, stupefied by carnal sense, are not prepared to receive the spiritual
wisdom of God. He softens down, it is true, the harshness of his reproach by
calling them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>but at the same time he brings it forward expressly as a matter of reproach
against them, that their minds were suffocated with the darkness of the flesh to
such a degree that it formed a hindrance to his preaching among them. What sort
of sound judgment then must they have, when they are not fit and prepared as yet
even for hearing! He does not mean, however, that they were altogether
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>carnal</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>so as to have not one spark of the Spirit of God &#8212; but that they had
still greatly too much of carnal sense, so that the flesh prevailed over the
Spirit, and did as it were drown out his light. Hence, although they were not
altogether destitute of grace, yet, as they had more of the flesh than of the
Spirit, they are on that account termed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>carnal</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>This sufficiently appears from what he immediately adds &#8212; that they
were </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>babes in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>for they would not have been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>babes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>had they not been begotten, and that begetting is from the Spirit of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Babes in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This term is sometimes taken in
a good sense, as it is by Peter, who exhorts us to be like <i>new-born
babes</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

<div><font face="Palatino">Here, however, it is taken in a bad sense, as
referring to the understanding. For we must be <i>children in malice</i>,<i> but

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have fed you with
milk</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here it is asked, whether Paul
transformed Christ to suit the diversity of his hearers. I answer, that this
refers to the manner and form of his instructions, rather than to the substance
of the doctrine. For Christ is at once <i>milk to babes</i>,<i> </i>and
<i>strong meat to those that are of full age</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
5:13, 14,) the same truth of the gospel is administered to both, but so as to
suit their capacity. Hence it is the part of a wise teacher to accommodate
himself to the capacity of those whom he has undertaken to instruct, so that in
dealing with the weak and ignorant, he begins with first principles, and does
not go higher than <i>they are able to follow</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;410433&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
4:33,) and so that, in short, he drops in his instructions by little and
little,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f147</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> lest it should run over, if poured in
more abundantly. At the same time, those first principles will contain
everything necessary to be known, no less than the farther advanced lessons that
are communicated to those that are stronger. On this point read
Augustine&#8217;s 98th homily on John. This tends to refute the specious pretext
of some, who, while they do but mutter out, from fear of danger, something of
the gospel in an indistinct
manner,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f148</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> pretend to have Paul&#8217;s example
here. Meanwhile, they present Christ at such a distance, and covered over,
besides, with so many disguises, that they constantly keep their followers in
destructive ignorance. I shall say nothing of their mixing up many corruptions,
their presenting Christ not simply in half, but torn to
fragments,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f149</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> their not merely concealing such gross
idolatry, but confirming it also by their own example, and, if they have said
anything that is good, straightway polluting it with numerous falsehoods. How
unlike they are to Paul is sufficiently manifest; for <i>milk </i>is nourishment
and not poison, and nourishment that is suitable and useful for bringing up
children until they are farther advanced.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For ye were not yet able to bear
it</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>That they may not flatter themselves
too much on their own discernment, he first of all tells them what he had found
among them at the beginning, and then adds, what is still more severe, that the
same faults remain among them to this day. For they ought at least, in putting
on Christ, to have put off the flesh; and thus we see that Paul complains that
the success which his doctrine ought to have had was impeded. For if the hearer
does not occasion delay by his slowness, it is the part of a good teacher to be
always going up higher,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f150</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> till perfection has been
attained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For ye are as yet
carnal</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>So long as the flesh, that is to
say, natural corruption, prevails in a man, it has so completely possession of
the man&#8217;s mind, that the wisdom of God finds no admittance. Hence, if we
would make proficiency in the Lord&#8217;s school, we must first of all renounce
our own judgment and our own will. Now, although among the Corinthians some
sparks of piety were emitted, they were kept under by being
choked.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f151</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For since there are among
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The proof is derived from the
effects; for as </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>envying, and
strifes, and divisions</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>are the fruits
of the flesh, wherever they are seen, it is certain that the root is there in
its rigor. Those evils prevailed among the Corinthians; and accordingly he
proves from this that they are <i>carnal</i>.<i> </i>He makes use of the same
argument, too, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480525&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
5:25. <i>If ye live in the Spirit</i>,<i> walk also in the Spirit</i>.<i>
</i>For while they were desirous to be regarded as spiritual, he calls them to
look at their <i>works</i>,<i> </i>by which <i>they denied </i>what with their
mouth they <i>professed</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;560116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:16.) Observe, however, the elegant arrangement that Paul here pursues: for
from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>envying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>spring up <i>contentions</i>,<i> </i>and these, when they have once been
enkindled, break out into deadly sects: but the mother of all these evils is
ambition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Walk as
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>From this it is manifest that the
term <i>flesh </i>is not restricted to the lower appetites merely, as the
Sophists pretend, the seat of which they call sensuality, but is employed to
describe man&#8217;s whole nature. For those that follow the guidance of nature,
are not governed by the Spirit of God. These, according to the Apostle&#8217;s
definition, are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>carnal</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>so that the flesh and man&#8217;s natural disposition are quite synonymous,
and hence it is not without good reason that he elsewhere requires that we be
<i>new creatures in Christ</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
For while one saith</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He now specifies
the particular kind of
contentions,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f152</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and he does this by personating the
Corinthians, that his description may have more force &#8212; that each one
gloried in his particular master, as though <i>Christ </i>were not <i>the one
Master of all</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:8.) Now, where such ambition still prevails, the gospel has little or no
success. You are not, however, to understand that they declared this openly in
express words, but the Apostle reproves those depraved dispositions to which
they were given up. At the same time it is likely, that, as a predilection
arising from ambition is usually accompanied with an empty
talkativeness,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f153</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they openly discovered by their words
the absurd bias of their mind, by extolling their teachers to the skies in
magnificent terms, accompanying this at the same time with contempt of Paul and
those like him.</font><br><br></div>

gloried in, for faith allows of no glorying except in Christ alone. Hence those
that extol men above measure, strip them of their true dignity. For the grand
distinction of them all is, that they are ministers of faith, or, in other
words, that they gain disciples to Christ, not to themselves. Now, though he
appears in this way to depreciate the dignity of ministers, yet he does not
assign it a lower place than it ought to hold. For he says much when he says,
that we receive faith through their ministry. Nay farther, the efficacy of
external doctrine receives here extraordinary commendation, when it is spoken of
as the instrument of the Holy Spirit; and pastors are honored with no common
title of distinction, when God is said to make use of them as his ministers, for
dispensing the inestimable treasure of faith.</font><br></div>

their own efforts, but in so far as they are guided by his hand, as
instruments.&#8221; The rendering that I have given, however, is, in my opinion,
the more correct one. If we adopt it, the statement will be more complete, for
it will consist of two clauses, in this way. In the first place, those are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ministers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>who have devoted their services to Christ, that you might believe in him:
farther, they have nothing of their own to pride themselves upon, inasmuch as
they do nothing of themselves, and have no power to do anything otherwise than
by the gift of God, and every man according to his own measure &#8212; which
shows, that whatever each individual has, is derived from another. In fine, he
unites them all together as by a mutual bond, inasmuch as they require each
other&#8217;s assistance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have planted, Apollos
watered</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He unfolds more clearly the
nature of that ministry by a similitude, in which the nature of the word and the
use of preaching are most appropriately depicted. That the earth may bring forth
fruit, there is need of ploughing and sowing, and other means of culture; but
after all this has been carefully done, the husbandman&#8217;s labor would be of
no avail, did not the Lord from heaven <i>give the increase</i>,<i> </i>by the
breaking forth of the sun, and still more by his wonderful and secret influence.
Hence, although the diligence of the husbandman is not in vain, nor the seed
that he throws in useless, yet it is only by the blessing of God that they are
made to prosper, for what is more wonderful than that the seed, after it has
rotted, springs up again! In like manner, the word of the Lord is seed that is
in its own nature fruitful: ministers are as it were husbandmen, that plough and
sow. Then follow other helps, as for example, irrigation. Ministers, too, act a
corresponding part when, after casting the seed into the ground, they give help
to the earth as much as is in their power, until it bring forth what it has
conceived: but as for making their labor actually productive, <i>that </i>is a
miracle of divine grace &#8212; not a work of human industry.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Observe, however, in this passage, how necessary the
preaching of the word is, and how necessary the continuance of
it.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f158</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It were, undoubtedly, as easy a thing
for God to bless the earth without diligence on the part of men, so as to make
it bring forth fruit of its own accord, as to draw out, or rather press
out</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f159</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> its increase, at the expense of much
assiduity on the part of men, and much sweat and sorrow; but as <i>the Lord hath
so ordained
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460914&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 9:14) that man should labor, and that the earth, on its part, yield
a return to his culture, let us take care to act accordingly. In like manner, it
were perfectly in the power of God, without the aid of men, if it so pleased
him, to produce faith in persons while asleep; but he has appointed it
otherwise, so that faith is produced <i>by hearing</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:17.) That man, then, who, in the neglect of this means, expects to attain
faith, acts just as if the husbandman, throwing aside the plough, taking no care
to sow; and leaving off all the labor of husbandry, were to open his mouth,
expecting food to drop into it from heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>continuance</i><sup>
f160</sup></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>we see what Paul says here
&#8212; that it is not enough that the seed be sown, if it is not brought
forward from time to time by new helps. He, then, who has already received the
seed, has still need of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>watering</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>nor must endeavors be left off, until full maturity has been attained, or in
other words, till life is ended. Apollos, then, who succeeded Paul in the
ministry of the word at Corinth, is said to have

</i>what he had sown.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Neither is he that planteth anything</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It
appears, nevertheless, from what has been already said, that their labor is of
some importance. We must observe, therefore, why it is that Paul thus
depreciates it; and first of all, it is proper to notice that he is accustomed
to speak in two different ways of
ministers,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f161</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as well as of sacraments. For in some
cases he views a minister as one that has been set apart by the Lord for, in the
first instance, regenerating souls, and, afterwards, nourishing them up unto
eternal life, for <i>remitting sins</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;432023&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
20:23,) for renewing the minds of men, for raising up the kingdom of Christ, and
destroying that of Satan. Viewed in that aspect he does not merely assign to him
the duty of <i>planting </i>and <i>watering</i>,<i> </i>but furnishes him,
besides, with the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, that his labor may not be in
vain. Thus</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f162</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in another passage he calls himself a
<i>minister of the Spirit</i>,<i> </i>and <i>not of the letter</i>,<i>
</i>inasmuch as he writes the word of the Lord on men&#8217;s hearts.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In other cases he views a minister as one that is a
servant, not a master &#8212; an instrument, not the hand; and in short as man,
not God. Viewed in that aspect, he leaves him nothing but his labor, and that,
too, dead and powerless, if the Lord does not make it efficacious by his Spirit.
The reason is, that when it is simply the ministry that is treated of, we must
have an eye not merely to man, but also to God, working in him by the grace of
the Spirit &#8212; not as though the grace of the Spirit were invariably tied to
the word of man, but because Christ puts forth his power in the ministry which
he has instituted, in such a manner that it is made evident, that it was not
instituted in vain. In this manner he does not take away or diminish anything
that belongs to Him, with the view of transferring it to man. For He is not
separated from the minister,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f163</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but on the contrary His power is
<i>declared </i>to be efficacious in the minister. But as we sometimes, in so
far as our judgment is depraved, take occasion improperly from this to extol men
too highly, we require to distinguish for the purpose of correcting this fault,
and we must set the Lord on the one side, and the minister on the other, and
then it becomes manifest, how indigent man is in himself, and how utterly devoid
of efficacy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let it be known by us, therefore, that in this
passage ministers are brought into comparison with the Lord, and the reason of
this comparison is &#8212; that mankind, while estimating grudgingly the grace
of God, are too lavish in their commendations of ministers, and in this manner
they snatch away what is God&#8217;s, with the view of transferring it to
themselves. At the same time he always observes a most becoming medium, for when
he says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God giveth the
increase,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he intimates by this, that the
efforts of men themselves are not without success. The case is the same as to
the sacraments, as we shall see
elsewhere.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f164</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence, although our heavenly Father does
not reject our labor in cultivating his field, and does not allow it to be
unproductive, yet he will have its success depend exclusively upon his blessing,
that he may have the entire praise. Accordingly, if we are desirous to make any
progress in laboring, in striving, in pressing forward, let it be known by us,
that we will make no progress, unless he prospers our labors, our strivings, and
our assiduity, in order that we may commend ourselves, and everything we do to
his grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that planteth, and he that
watereth are one</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He shows farther, from
another consideration, that the Corinthians are greatly to blame in abusing,
with a view to maintain their own sects and parties, the names of their
teachers, who in the meantime are, with united efforts, aiming at one and the
same thing, and can by no means be separated, or torn asunder, without at the
same time leaving off the duties of their office.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are
one</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>says he; in other words, they are
so linked together, that their connection does not allow of any separation,
because all ought to have one end in view, and they serve one Lord, and are
engaged in the same work.<i> </i>Hence, if they employ themselves faithfully in
cultivating the Lord&#8217;s field, they will maintain unity; and, by mutual
communication, will help each other &#8212; so far from their names serving as
standards to stir up contendings. Here we have a beautiful passage for exhorting
ministers to concord. Meanwhile, however, he indirectly reproves those ambitious
teachers, who, by giving occasion for contentions, discovered thereby that they
were not the servants of Christ, but the slaves of vain-glory &#8212; that they
did not employ themselves in <i>planting </i>and <i>watering</i>,<i> </i>but in
rooting up and burning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every man will receive his own
reward</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here he shows what is the end
that all ministers should have in view &#8212; not to catch the applause of the
multitude, but to please the Lord. This, too, he does with the view of calling
to the judgment-seat of God those ambitious teachers, who were intoxicated with
the glory of the world, and thought of nothing else; and at the same time
admonishing the Corinthians, as to the worthlessness of that empty applause
which is drawn forth by elegance of expression and vain ostentation. He at the
same time discovers in these words the fearlessness of his conscience, inasmuch
as he ventures to look forward to the judgment of God without dismay. For the
reason why ambitious men recommend themselves to the esteem of the world is,
that they have not learned to devote themselves to God, and that they do not set
before their eyes Christ&#8217;s heavenly kingdom. Accordingly, as soon as God
comes to be seen, that foolish desire of gaining man&#8217;s favor
disappears.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we are fellow-laborers
with God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here is the best argument. It
is the Lord&#8217;s work that we are employed in, and it is to him that we have
devoted our labors: hence, as he is faithful and just, he will not disappoint us
of our reward. That man, accordingly, is mistaken who looks to men, or depends
merely on their remuneration. Here we have an admirable commendation of the
ministry &#8212; that while God could accomplish the work entirely himself, he
calls us, puny mortals,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f165</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to be as it were his coadjutors, and
makes use of us as instruments. As to the perversion of this statement by the
Papists, for supporting their system of free-will, it is beyond measure silly,
for Paul shows here, not what men can effect by their natural powers, but what
the Lord accomplishes through means of them by his grace. As to the exposition
given by some &#8212; that Paul, being God&#8217;s workman, was a fellow-workman
with his colleagues, that is, with the other teachers &#8212; it appears to me
harsh and forced, and there is nothing whatever in the case that shuts us up to
have recourse to that refinement. For it corresponds admirably with the
Apostle&#8217;s design to understand him to mean, that, while it is peculiarly
the work of God to build his temple, or cultivate his vineyard, he calls forth
ministers to be <i>fellow-laborers</i>,<i> </i>by means of whom He alone works;
but, at the same time, in such a way, that they in their turn labor in common
with him. As to the reward of works, consult my
<i>Institutes</i>.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

explained in two ways. They may be taken <i>actively </i>in this sense:
&#8220;You<i> </i>have been planted in the Lord&#8217;s field by the labor of
men in such a way, that our heavenly Father himself is the true Husbandman, and
the Author of this plantation. You have been built up by men in such a way, that
he himself is the true
Master-builder.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f167</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Or, it may be taken in a passive sense,
thus: &#8220;In laboring to <i>till </i>you, and <i>to sow </i>the word of God
among you and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>water</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>it, we have not done this on our own account, or with a view to advantage to
accrue to us, but have devoted our service to the Lord. In our endeavors to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>build you
up,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>we have not been influenced by a
view to our own advantage, but with a view to your being God&#8217;s
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>planting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>building</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>This latter interpretation I rather prefer, for I am of opinion, that Paul
meant here to express the idea, that true ministers labor not for themselves,
but for the Lord. Hence it follows, that the Corinthians were greatly to blame
in devoting themselves to men,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

to God. And, in the first place, he calls them his <i>husbandry</i>,<i>

As a wise master-builder</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It is a most
apt similitude, and accordingly it is frequently met with in the Scriptures, as
we shall see ere long. Here, however, the Apostle declares his fidelity with
great confidence and fearlessness, as it required to be asserted in opposition
not merely to the calumnies of the wicked, but also to the pride of the
Corinthians, who had already begun to despise his doctrine. The more, therefore,
they lowered him, so much the higher does he raise himself up, and speaking as
it were from a pulpit of vast height, he
declares</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f171</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that he had been the first
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>master-builder</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of God among them in laying the foundation, and that he had with <i>wisdom
</i>executed that department of duty, and that it remained that others should go
forward in the same manner, regulating the superstructure in conformity with the
rule of the foundation. Let us observe that these things are said by Paul
<i>first </i>of all for the purpose of commending his doctrine, which he saw was
despised by the Corinthians; and, <i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>for the purpose of
repressing the insolence of others, who from a desire for distinction, affected
a new method of teaching. These he accordingly admonishes to attempt nothing
rashly in God&#8217;s building. Two things he prohibits them from doing: they
must not venture to lay another foundation, and they must not raise a
superstructure that will not be answerable to the foundation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He always takes diligent heed not
to usurp to himself a single particle of the glory that belongs to God, for he
refers all thing&#8217;s to God, and leaves nothing to himself, except his
having been an instrument. While, however, he thus submits himself humbly to
God, he indirectly reproves the arrogance of those who thought nothing of
throwing </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the grace of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>into the
shade,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f172</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> provided only they were themselves held
in estimation. He hints, too, that there was nothing of the <i>grace </i>of the
Spirit in that empty show, for which they were held in esteem, while on the
other hand he clears himself from contempt, on the ground of his having been
under divine influence.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f173</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For other foundation can no
man lay</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This statement consists of two
parts; <i>first</i>,<i> </i>that Christ is the only foundation of the Church;
and <i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>that the Corinthians had been rightly founded upon
Christ through Paul&#8217;s preaching. For it was necessary that they should be
brought back to Christ alone, inasmuch as their ears were tickled with a
fondness for novelty. It was, too, of no small importance that Paul should be
recognized as the principal, and, so to speak, fundamental
<i>master-builder</i>,<i> </i>from whose doctrine they could not draw back,
without forsaking Christ himself. The sum is this &#8212; that the Church must
by all means be founded upon Christ alone, and that Paul had executed this
department of duty so faithfully that nothing could be found to be wanting in
his ministry. Hence, whoever may come after him, can in no other way serve the
Lord with a good conscience, or be listened to as ministers of Christ, than by
studying to make their doctrine correspond with his, and retain the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foundation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>which he has laid. Hence we infer, that those are not faithful workmen for
building up the Church, but on the contrary are <i>scatterers </i>of it,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401230&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
12:30,) who succeed faithful ministers, but do not make it their aim to conform
themselves to their doctrine, and carry forward what has been well commenced, so
as to make it quite manifest</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f174</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that they are attempting no new work.
For what can be more pernicious than by a new manner of teaching to harass
believers, who have been well instructed in pure doctrine, so that they stagger
in uncertainty as to the true foundation. Now the fundamental doctrine, which it
were unlawful to undermine, is, that we learn Christ, for Christ is the
only</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
foundation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of the Church; but there are
many who, while they make use of Christ&#8217;s name in pretense, tear up the
whole truth of God by the
roots.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f175</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us observe, then, in what way the Church is
rightly built upon Christ. It is when he alone is set forth for righteousness,
redemption, sanctification, wisdom, satisfaction and cleansing; in short, for
life and glory; or if you would have it stated more briefly, when he is
proclaimed in such a manner that his office and influence are understood in
accordance with what we found stated in the close of the first chapter.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460130&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:30.) If, on the other hand, Christ is only in some degree
acknowledged, and is called a Redeemer only in name, while in the meantime
recourse is had to some other quarter for righteousness, sanctification and
salvation, he is driven off from the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foundation</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and spurious</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f176</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> stones are substituted in his room. It
is in this manner that Papists act, who rob him of almost all his ornaments,
leaving him scarcely anything but the bare name. Such persons, then, are far
from being founded on Christ. For as Christ is the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foundation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of the Church, because he is the only source of salvation and eternal life
&#8212; because in him we come to know God the Father &#8212; because in him we
have the source of every blessing; if he is not acknowledged as such he is no
longer regarded as the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foundation</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is asked &#8212; &#8220;Is Christ only a part,
or simply the commencement of the doctrine of salvation, as the foundation is
merely a part of the building; for if it were so, believers would have only
their commencement in Christ, and would be perfected without him. Now this Paul
might seem to intimate.&#8221;<i> </i>I answer that this is not the meaning of
the words; otherwise he would contradict himself when he says elsewhere, that
&#8220;in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
<i>knowledge</i>.&#8221;<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:3.) He, then, who has learned Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:20,) is already complete in the whole system of heavenly doctrine. But as
Paul&#8217;s ministry had contemplated rather the founding of the Corinthians
than the raising up among them of the top-stone of the building, he merely shows
here what he had done in respect of his having preached Christ in purity. With
<i>respect to </i>himself therefore, he calls him the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foundation,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>while at the same time he does not thereby exclude him from the rest of the
building. In fine, Paul does not put any kind of doctrine in opposition to the
knowledge<i> </i>of Christ, but on the contrary there is a comparison between<i>
</i>himself and the ministers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now if any man build upon this
foundation</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He pursues still farther the
metaphor. It would not have been enough to have laid the foundation if the
entire superstructure did not correspond; for as it were an absurd thing to
raise a structure of vile materials on a foundation of gold, so it were greatly
criminal to bury Christ under a mass of strange
doctrines.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

stones</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he means doctrine worthy of
Christ, and of such a nature as to be a superstructure corresponding to such a
foundation. Let us not imagine, however, that this doctrine is apart from
Christ, but on the contrary let us understand that we must continue to preach
Christ until the very completion of the building. Only we must observe order, so
as to begin with general doctrine, and more essential articles, as the
foundations, and then go on to admonitions, exhortations, and everything that is
requisite for perseverance, confirmation, and advancement.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As there is an agreement thus far as to Paul&#8217;s
meaning, without any controversy, it follows on the other hand, that by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wood,
stubble</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hay</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>

men&#8217;s brain, and is thrust in upon us as though it were the oracles of
God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f178</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For God will have his Church trained up

deceive, so that the world does not perceive how far each one has labored
faithfully or fraudulently, but what is now as it were buried in darkness must
of necessity come to light, and what is now glorious in the eyes of men, must
before the face of God fall down, and be regarded as
worthless.&#8221;</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the

explanation. The meaning unquestionably is complete without that addition. For
with propriety we give the name of <i>day </i>to the time when darkness and
obscurity are dispelled, and the truth is brought to light. Hence the Apostle
forewarns us, that it cannot always remain a secret who have acted fraudulently
in the work of the Lord, or who have conducted themselves with fidelity, as
though he had said: &#8220;The darkness will not always remain: the light will
one day break forth; which will make all things manifest.&#8221; That day, I
own, is God&#8217;s &#8212; not man&#8217;s, but the metaphor is more elegant if
you read simply &#8212; <i>the</i> <i>day</i>,<i> </i>because Paul in this way
conveys the idea, that the Lord&#8217;s true servants cannot always be
accurately distinguished from false workmen, inasmuch as virtues and vices are
concealed by the darkness of the night. That night, however, will not always
continue. For ambition is blind &#8212; man&#8217;s favor is blind &#8212; the
world&#8217;s applause is blind, but this darkness God afterwards dispels in his
own time. Take notice, that he always discovers the assurance of a good
conscience, and with an unconquerable magnanimity despises perverse judgments;
<i>first</i>,<i> </i>in order that he may call back the Corinthians from popular
applause to a right rule of judgment; and <i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>for the
purpose of confirming the authority of his ministry.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because it will be revealed by
fire.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Paul having spoken of doctrine
metaphorically, now also applies metaphorically the name
of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to the very touchstone of doctrine,
that the corresponding parts of the comparison may harmonize with each other.
The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fire</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>then, here meant is the Spirit of the Lord, who tries by his touchstone what
doctrine resembles
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and what resembles
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stubble</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>The nearer the doctrine of God is brought to this fire, so much the brighter
will be its luster. On the other hand, what has had its origin in man&#8217;s
head will quickly vanish,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f180</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as stubble is consumed in the fire.
There seems also to be an allusion to <i>the day </i>of which he makes mention:
&#8220;Not<i> </i>only will those things which vain ambition, like a dark night,
concealed among the Corinthians, be brought to light by the brightness of the
sun, but there will also be a strength of heat, not merely for drying up and
cleansing away the refuse, but also for burning up everything wrong.&#8221; For
however men may look upon themselves, as forming acute judgments, their
discernment, notwithstanding, reaches no farther than appearance, which, for the
most part, has no solidity. There is nothing but that <i>day to </i>which the
Apostle appeals, that tests everything to the quick, not merely by its
brightness, but also by its fiery flame.</font><br></div>

meaning is, that those are fools who depend on man&#8217;s estimation, so as to

praise and recompense &#8212; when it has stood the test of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>day of the

more, like empty bubbles, they glitter for the moment, until they have come to
be thoroughly tested. Hence it follows, that we must reckon as nothing all the

among the most eminent <i>master-builders</i>,<i> </i>for as soon as the day
breaks in, his whole work must go utterly to nothing, if it is not approved of
by the Lord. This, then, is the rule to which every one&#8217;s ministry
requires to be conformed. Some explain this of doctrine, so
that</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">

f181</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>means simply <i>to perish</i>,<i>

because in the Greek</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue"> qemeliov<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(foundation) is in the masculine gender. They
do not, however, sufficiently attend to the entire context. For Paul in this
passage subjects to trial, not his own doctrine, but that of
others.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f182</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence it were out of place to make
mention at present of the foundation. He has stated a little before, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every man&#8217;s work will be
tried by fire. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He comes afterwards to state an
alternative, which ought not to be extended beyond that general observation. Now
it is certain that Paul spoke there simply of the structure which had been
<i>erected </i>upon the foundation. He has already in the first clause promised
a reward to good
master-builders,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f183</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whose labor shall have been approved of.
Hence the contrast in the second clause suits admirably well &#8212; that those

expected.</font><br></div>

upon Christ, but in consequence of the weakness of the flesh, admit something
that is man&#8217;s, or through ignorance turn aside to some extent from the
strict purity of God&#8217;s word. Such were many of the saints, Cyprian,
Ambrose, Augustine, and the like. Add to these, if you choose, from those of
later times, Gregory and Bernard, and others of that stamp, who, while they had
it as their object to build upon Christ, did nevertheless often deviate from the
right system of building. Such persons, Paul says, could be saved, but on this
condition &#8212; if the Lord wiped away their ignorance, and purged them from
all dross.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the meaning of rim clause

</i>of their labor, and are purged by the mercy of God, as gold is refined in
the furnace. Farther, although God sometimes purges his own people by
afflictions, yet here by the name <i>of fire</i>,<i> </i>I understand the
touchstone of the Spirit, by which the Lord corrects and removes the ignorance
of his people, by which they were for a time held captive. I am aware, indeed,
that, many refer this to the
cross,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

interpretation will please all that are of sound judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It remains, that we give an answer in passing to the
Papists, who endeavor from this passage to prop up Purgatory. &#8220;The

punishment in the presence of God, so as to afford satisfaction to his justice I
pass over their endless fictions in reference to the measure of punishment, and
the means of redemption from them, but I ask, who they are that pass through

themselves to the service of men. He confers upon them distinguished honor in

Corinthians 6:19) repeating the same sentiment, but for another purpose. For in
that passage he treats of chastity; but here, on the other hand, he exhorts them
to have their faith resting on the obedience of Christ alone. The interrogation
gives additional emphasis; for he indirectly intimates, that he speaks to them
of a thing that they knew, while he appeals to them as
witnesses.</font><br></div>

passage we have an explicit testimony for maintaining the divinity of the Holy
Spirit. For if he were a creature, or merely a gift, he would not make us
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>temples of

man, whoever he may be, that corrupts it, will not pass with impunity. The kind
of profanation of which he now speaks, is, when men intrude themselves, so as to
bear rule in the Church in the place of God. For as that faith, which is devoted

a false impression, by arrogating any wisdom to themselves &#8212; by which he
means, that all are under a mistake, who depend upon their own judgment. Now, he
addresses himself, in my opinion, to hearers as well as teachers. For the former
discovered a partiality for those ambitious men, and lent an ear to
them,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

Corinthians 1:20) what he means by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wisdom of this
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>for natural perspicacity is a
gift of God, and the liberal arts, and all the sciences by which wisdom is
acquired, are gifts of God. They are confined, however, within their own limits;
for into God&#8217;s heavenly kingdom they cannot penetrate. Hence they must
occupy the place of handmaid, not of mistress: nay more, they must be looked
upon as empty and worthless, until they have become entirely subject to the word
and Spirit of God. If, on the other hand, they set themselves in opposition to
Christ, they must be looked upon as dangerous pests, and, if they strive to
accomplish anything of themselves, as the worst of all
hindrances.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f198</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wisdom of the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>in Paul&#8217;s acceptation, is
that which assumes to itself authority, and does not allow itself to be
regulated by the word of God, or to be subdued, so as to yield itself up in
entire subjection to him. Until, therefore, matters have come to this, that the
individual acknowledges that he knows nothing but what he has learned from God,
and, giving up his own understanding; resigns himself unreservedly to
Christ&#8217;s guidance, he is wise in the world&#8217;s account, but he is
foolish in the estimation of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For it is written, He taketh the
wise</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He confirms this from <i>two
</i>Scripture proofs, the <i>first </i>of which is taken from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;180513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
5:13, where the wisdom of God is extolled on this ground, that no wisdom of the
world can stand before it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now it is certain, that the Prophet speaks there of
those that are cunning and crafty; but as the wisdom of man is invariably such
without God,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f199</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">it is with
good reason that Paul applies it in this sense, &#8212; that whatever wisdom men
have of themselves is reckoned of no account in the sight of God. The <i>second
</i>is from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;199411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
94:11, where David, after claiming for God alone the office and authority of the
Instructor of all, adds, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
knows the thoughts of all to be vain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Hence, in whatever estimation they are held by us, they are, in the judgment
of God, <i>vain</i>.<i> </i>Here we have an admirable passage for bringing down
the confidence of the flesh, while God from on high declares that everything
that the mind of man conceives and contrives is mere
<i>vanity</i>.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f200</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore let no man glory in
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As there is nothing that is more
<i>vain </i>than man, how little security there is in leaning upon an evanescent
shadow! Hence he infers with propriety from the preceding statement, that we
must not </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glory in
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>inasmuch as the Lord thus takes
away from mankind universally every ground of glorying. At the same time this
inference depends on the whole of the foregoing doctrine, as will appear ere
long. For as we belong to Christ alone, it is with good reason that he teaches
us, that any supremacy of man, by which the glory of Christ is impaired,
involves sacrilege.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All things are
yours.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He proceeds to show what place
and station teachers should
occupy</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f201</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; such as not to detract in any
degree from the authority of Christ, the one Master. As therefore Christ is the
Church&#8217;s sole master, and as he alone without exception is worthy to be
listened to, it is necessary to distinguish between him and others, as even
Christ himself has testified respecting himself,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:8,) and no other is recommended to us by the Father with this honorable
declaration,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f202</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;Hear ye him.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
17:5.) As, therefore, he alone is endowed with authority to rule us by his word,
Paul says that others <i>are ours</i> &#8212; meaning, that they are appointed
to us by God with the view of our making use of them &#8212; not that they
should exercise dominion over our consciences. Thus on the one hand, he shows
that they are not useless, and, on the other hand, he keeps<i> </i>them in their
own place, that they may not exalt themselves in opposition to Christ. What he
adds, as to <i>death</i>,<i> life</i>,<i> </i>and the rest, is hyperbolical, so
far as concerns the passage before us. He had it in view, however, to reason, as
it were, from the greater to the less, in this manner. &#8220;Christ having put
in subjection to us
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>death</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and everything, can we doubt, whether he has not also made men subject to
us, to help us by their ministrations &#8212; not to oppress us by
tyranny.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now if any one takes occasion from this to allege,
that the writings both of Paul and of Peter are subject to our scrutiny,
inasmuch as they were men, and are not exempted from the common lot of others, I
answer, that Paul, while he does not by any means spare himself or Peter,
admonishes the Corinthians to distinguish between the person of the individual,
and the dignity or distinction of office. &#8220;As for myself, viewed as a man,
I wish to be judged of simply as a man, that Christ alone may have distinction
in our ministry.&#8221; This, however, in a general way, we must
hold,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f203</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that all who discharge the office of the
ministry, are <i>ours</i>,<i> </i>from the highest to the lowest, so that we are
at liberty to withhold our assent to their doctrine, until they show that it is
from Christ. For they must all be <i>tried</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 4:1,)and we must yield obedience to them, only when they have
satisfactorily shown themselves to be faithful servants of Christ. Now as to
Peter and Paul, this point being beyond all controversy, and the Lord having
furnished us with amply sufficient evidence, that their doctrine has come forth
from Him, when we receive as an oracle from heaven, and venerate everything that
they have delivered to us, we hear not so much <i>them</i>,<i> </i>as Christ
speaking in them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ is
God&#8217;s</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This subjection relates to
Christ&#8217;s humanity, for by taking upon him our flesh, he assumed &#8220;the
form&#8221; and condition &#8220;of<i> </i>a servant,&#8221; that he might make
himself obedient to his Father in all things.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:7, 8.) And assuredly, that we may cleave to God through him, it is necessary
that he have God as his <i>head</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 11:3.) We must observe, however, with what intention Paul has added
this. For he admonishes us, that the sum of our felicity consists in
this,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f204</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">that we are
united to God who is the chief good, and this is accomplished when we are
gathered together under the <i>head </i>that our heavenly Father has set over
us. In the same sense Christ said to his disciples,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Ye<i> </i>ought to
rejoice, because I go to the
Father,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">for the Father is greater
than I,&#8221;<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431428&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
14:28,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for there he set himself forth as the medium, through
which believers come to the original source of every blessing. It is certain,
that those are left destitute of that signal blessing, who depart from the unity
of the Head.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f205</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence this order of things suits the
connection of the passage &#8212; that those subject themselves to Christ alone,
who desire to remain under God&#8217;s
jurisdiction.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

Let a man so account of us</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As it was a
matter of no little importance to see the Church in this manner torn by corrupt
factions, from the likings or dislikings that were entertained towards
individuals, he enters into a still more lengthened discussion as to the
ministry of the word. Here there are <i>three </i>things to be considered in
their order. In the <i>first </i>place, Paul describes the office of a pastor of
the Church. <i>Secondly</i>,<i> </i>he shows, that it is not enough for any one
to produce a title, or even to undertake the duty &#8212; a faithful
administration of the office being requisite. <i>Thirdly</i>,<i> </i>as the
judgment formed of him by the Corinthians was
preposterous,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f207</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he calls both himself and them to the
judgment-seat of Christ. In the first place, then, he teaches in what estimation
every teacher in the Church ought to be held. In this department he modifies his
discourse in such a manner as neither, on the one hand, to lower the credit of
the ministry, nor, on the other, to assign to man more than is expedient. For
both of these things are exceedingly dangerous, because, when ministers are
lowered, contempt of the word
arises,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f208</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> while, on the other hand, if they are
extolled beyond measure, they abuse liberty, and become &#8220;wanton against
the Lord.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 5:11.) Now the medium observed by Paul consists in this, that he calls
them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ministers of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>by which he intimates, that they
ought to apply themselves not to their own work but to that of the Lord, who has
hired them as his servants, and that they are not appointed to bear rule in an
authoritative manner in the Church, but are subject to Christ&#8217;s
authority</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f209</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; in short, that they are
servants, not masters.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to what he adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stewards of the mysteries of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he expresses hereby the kind of
service. By this he intimates, that their office extends no farther than this,
that they are </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stewards of the
mysteries of God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>In other words, what
the Lord has committed to their charge they deliver over to men from hand to
hand &#8212; as the expression
is</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f210</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; not what they themselves might
choose. &#8220;For<i> </i>this purpose has God chosen them as ministers of his
Son, that he might through them communicate to men his heavenly wisdom, and
hence they ought not to move a step beyond this.&#8221; He appears, at the same
time, to give a stroke indirectly to the Corinthians, who, leaving in the
background the heavenly mysteries, had begun to hunt with excessive eagerness
after strange inventions, and hence they valued their teachers for nothing but
profane learning. It is an honorable distinction that he confers upon the gospel
when he terms its contents </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
mysteries of God. </i></font><font face="Palatino">But as the sacraments are
connected with these mysteries as appendages, it follows, that those who have
the charge of administering the word are the authorized
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stewards</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of them also.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But it is required in
ministers</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f211</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is as though he had said, it
is not enough to be a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>steward</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>if there be not an upright stewardship. Now the rule of an upright
stewardship, is to conduct one&#8217;s self in it with fidelity. It is a passage
that ought to be carefully observed, for we see how
haughtily</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f212</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Papists require that everything that
they do and teach should have the authority of law, simply on the ground of
their being called pastors. On the other hand, Paul is so far from being
satisfied with the mere title, that, in his view, it is not even enough that
there is a legitimate call, unless the person who is called conducts himself in
the office with fidelity. On every occasion, therefore, on which Papists hold up
before us the mask of a name, for the purpose of maintaining the tyranny of
their idol, let our answer be, that Paul requires more than this from the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ministers of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>though, at the same time, the
Pope and his attendant train are wanting not merely in fidelity in the discharge
of the office, but also in the ministry itself, if everything is duly
considered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage, however, militates, not merely against
wicked teachers, but also against all that have any other object in view than
the glory of Christ and the edification of the Church. For every one that
teaches the truth is not necessarily faithful, but, only he who desires from the
heart to serve the Lord and advance Christ&#8217;s kingdom. Nor is it without
good reason that Augustine assigns to <i>hirelings</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
10:12,)a middle place between the <i>wolves </i>and the good teachers. As to
Christ&#8217;s requiring <i>wisdom </i>also on the part of the good
<i>steward</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421242&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
12:42,) he speaks, it is true, in that passage with greater clearness than Paul,
but the meaning is the same. For the <i>faithfulness </i>of<i> </i>which Christ
speaks is uprightness of conscience, which must be accompanied with sound and
prudent counsel. By a faithful minister Paul means one who, with knowledge as
well as uprightness,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f213</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> discharges the office of a good and
faithful minister.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
But with me it is a very small thing</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It
remained that he should bring before their view his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faithfulness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>that the Corinthians might judge of him from this, but, as their judgment
was corrupted, he throws it aside and appeals to the judgment-seat of Christ.
The Corinthians erred in this, that they looked with amazement at foreign masks,
and gave no heed to the true and proper marks of
distinction.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f214</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He, accordingly, declares with great
confidence, that he despises a perverted and blind judgment of this sort. In
this way, too, he, on the one hand, admirably exposes the vanity of the false
Apostles who made the mere applause of men their aim, and reckoned themselves
happy if they were held in admiration; and, on the other hand, he severely
chastises the arrogance</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f215</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of the Corinthians, which was the reason
why they were so much blinded in their judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, it is asked, on what ground it was allowable for
Paul, not merely to set aside the censure of one Church, but to set himself
above the judgment of men? for this is a condition common to all pastors &#8212;
to be judged of by the Church. I answer, that it is the part of a good pastor to
submit both his doctrine and his life for examination to the judgment of the
Church, and that it is the sign of a good conscience<i> </i>not to shun the
light of careful inspection. In this respect Paul, without doubt, was prepared
for submitting himself to the judgment of the Corinthian Church, and for being
called to render an account both of his life and of his doctrine, had there been
among them a proper scrutiny,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f216</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">as he often
assigns them this power, and of his own accord entreats them to be prepared to
judge aright. But when a faithful pastor sees that he is borne down by
unreasonable and perverse affections, and that justice and truth have no place,
he ought to appeal to God, and betake himself to his judgment-seat, regardless
of human opinion, especially when he cannot secure that a true and proper
knowledge of matters shall be arrived at.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If, then, the Lord&#8217;s servants would bear in
mind that they must act in this manner, let them allow their doctrine and life
to be brought to the test, nay more, let them voluntarily present themselves for
this purpose; and if anything is objected against them, let them not decline<i>
to </i>answer. But if they see that they are condemned without being heard in
their own defense, and that judgment is passed upon them without their being
allowed a hearing, let them raise up their minds to such a pitch of magnanimity,
as that, despising the opinions of men, they will fearlessly wait for God as
their judge. In this manner the Prophets of old, having to do with refractory
persons,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f217</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and such as had the audacity to despise
the word of God in their administration of it, required to raise themselves
aloft, in order to tread under foot that diabolical obstinacy, which manifestly
tended to overthrow at once the authority of God and the light of truth. Should
any one, however, when opportunity is given for defending himself, or at least
when he has need to clear himself, appeal to God by way of subterfuge, he will
not thereby make good his innocence, but will rather discover his consummate
impudence.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

men,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nay, I judge not mine own

not venture to judge myself, though I know myself best; how then will you judge
me, to whom I am less intimately known?&#8221; Now he proves that he does not
venture to judge himself by this, that though he is not conscious to himself of
anything wrong, he is not thereby acquitted in the sight of God. Hence he
concludes, that what the Corinthians assume to themselves, belongs exclusively
to God. &#8220;As for me,&#8221;<i> </i>says he, &#8220;when<i> </i>I have
carefully examined myself, I perceive that I am not so clear-sighted as to
discern thoroughly my true character; and hence I leave this to the judgment of
God, who alone call judge, and to whom this authority exclusively belongs. As
for you, then, on what ground will you make pretensions to something
more?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, it were very absurd to reject all kinds
of judgment, whether of individuals respecting themselves, or of one individual
respecting his brother, or of all together respecting their pastor, let it be
understood that Paul speaks here not of the actions of men, which may be
reckoned good or bad according to the word of the Lord, but of the eminence of
each individual, which ought not to be estimated according to men&#8217;s
humors. It belongs to God alone to determine what distinction every one holds,
and what honor he deserves. The Corinthians, however, despising Paul,
groundlessly extolled others to the skies, as though they had at their command
that knowledge which belonged exclusively to God. This is what he previously
made mention of as <i>man</i>&#8217;<i>s day</i> &#8212; when men mount the
throne of judgment, and, as if they were gods, anticipate the day of Christ, who
alone is appointed by the Father as judge, allot to every one his station of
honor, assign to some a high place, and degrade others to the lowest seats. But
what rule of distinction do they observe? They look merely to what appears
openly; and thus what in their view is high and honorable, is in many instances
<i>an abomination in the sight of God</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
16:15.) If any one farther objects, that the ministers of the word may in this
world be distinguished by their works, as trees <i>by their fruits</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400716&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
7:16,) I admit that this is true, but we must consider with whom Paul had to
deal. It was with persons who, in judging, looked to nothing but show and pomp,
and arrogated to themselves a power which Christ., while in this world,
refrained from using &#8212; that of assigning to every one his <i>seat in the
kingdom of God</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402023&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
20:23.) He does not, therefore, prohibit us from esteeming those whom we have
found to be faithful workmen, and pronouncing them to be such; nor, on the other
hand, from judging persons to be bad workmen according to the word of God, but
he condemns that rashness which is practiced, when some are preferred above
others in a spirit of ambition &#8212; not according to their merits, but
without examination of the
case.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am not conscious to myself
of anything faulty.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Let us observe that
Paul speaks here not of his whole life, but simply of the office of apostleship.
For if he had been altogether unconscious to himself of anything
wrong,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f222</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that would have been a groundless
complaint which he makes in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:15, where he laments that <i>the evil which he would not</i>,<i> that he
does</i>,<i> </i>and that he is by sin kept back from giving himself up entirely
to God. Paul, therefore, felt <i>sin dwelling in him</i>,<i> </i>and confessed
it; but as to his apostleship, (which is the subject that is here treated of,)
he had conducted himself with so much integrity and fidelity, that his
conscience did not accuse him as to anything. This is a protestation of no
common character, and of such a nature as clearly shows the piety and sanctity
of his breast;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f223</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and yet he says that <i>he is not
thereby justified</i>.<i> </i>that is, pure, and altogether free from guilt in
the sight of God. Why? Assuredly, because God sees much more distinctly than we;
and hence, what appears to us cleanest, is filthy in his eyes. Here we have a
beautiful and singularly profitable admonition, not to measure the strictness of
God&#8217;s judgment by our own opinion; for we are dim-sighted, but God is
preeminently discerning. We think of ourselves too indulgently, but God is a
judge of the utmost strictness. Hence the truth of what Solomon says
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Every man&#8217;s

21:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Papists abuse this passage for the purpose of shaking
the assurance of faith, and truly, I confess, that if their doctrine were
admitted, we could do nothing but tremble in wretchedness during our whole life.
For what tranquillity could our minds enjoy if it were to be determined from our
works whether we are well-pleasing to God? I confess, therefore, that from the
main foundation of Papists there follows nothing but continual disquietude for
consciences; and, accordingly, we teach that we must have recourse to the free
promise of mercy, which is offered to us in Christ, that we may be fully assured
that we are accounted righteous by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore judge nothing
before the time</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>From this conclusion it
is manifest, that Paul did not mean to reprove every kind of judgment without
exception, but only what is hasty and rash, without examination of the case. For
the Corinthians did not mark with unjaundiced eye the character of each
individual, but, blinded by ambition, groundlessly extolled one and depreciated
another, and took upon themselves to mark out the dignity of each individual
beyond what is lawful for men. Let us know, then, how much is allowed us, what
is now within the sphere of our knowledge, and what is deferred until the day of
Christ, and let us not attempt to go beyond these limits. For there are some
things that are now seen openly, while there are others that lie buried in
obscurity until the day of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who will bring to
light.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If this is affirmed truly and
properly respecting the day of Christ, it follows that matters are never so well
regulated in this world but that many things are involved in darkness, and that
there is never so much light, but that many things remain in obscurity. I speak
of the life of men, and their actions. He explains in the second clause, what is
the cause of the obscurity and confusion, so that all things are not now
manifest. It is because there are wonderful recesses and deepest lurking-places
in the hearts of men. Hence, until the thoughts of the hearts are brought to
light, there will always be darkness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And then shall every one have
praise</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It is as though he had said,
&#8220;You<i> </i>now, O Corinthians, as if you had the adjudging of the
prizes,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f224</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> crown some, and send away others with
disgrace, but this right and office belong exclusively to Christ. You do that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before the
time</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; before it has become manifest who
is worthy to be crowned, but the Lord has appointed a day on which he will make
it manifest.&#8221; This statement takes its rise from the assurance of a good
conscience, which brings us also this advantage, that committing our <i>praises
</i>into the hands of God, we disregard the empty breath of human
applause.</font><br><br></div>

exempted from this evil.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

is, that they be not lifted up with pride on account of their teachers, and do
not abuse their names for the purpose of forming parties, and rending the Church
asunder. Observe, too, that pride or haughtiness is the cause and commencement
of all contentions, when every one, assuming to himself more than he is entitled
to do, is eager to have others in subjection to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The clause
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>above what is
written</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>may be explained in two ways
&#8212; either as referring to Paul&#8217;s writings, or to the proofs from
Scripture which he has brought forward. As this, however, is a matter of small
moment, my readers may be loft at liberty to take whichever they may
prefer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For who distinguisheth
thee?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The meaning is &#8212; &#8220;Let
that man come forward, whosoever he be, that is desirous of distinction, and
troubles the Church by his ambition. I will demand of him who it is that makes
him superior to others? that is, who it is that has conferred upon him the
privilege of being taken out of the rank of the others, and made superior to
others?&#8221; Now this whole reasoning depends on the order which the Lord has
appointed in his Church &#8212; that the members of Christ&#8217;s body may be
united together, and that every one of them may rest satisfied with his own
place, his own rank, his own office, and his own honor. If one member is
desirous to quit his place, that he may leap over into the place of another, and
invade his office, what will become of the entire body? Let us know, then, that
the Lord has so placed us in the Church, and has in such a manner assigned to
every one his own station, that, being under one head, we may be mutually
helpful to each other. Let us know, besides, that we have been endowed with a
diversity of gifts, in order that we may serve the Lord with modesty and
humility, and may endeavor to promote the glory of him who has conferred upon us
everything that we have. This, then, was the best remedy for correcting the
ambition of those who were desirous of distinction &#8212; to call them back to
God, in order that they might acknowledge that it was not according to any
one&#8217;s pleasure that he was placed in a high or a low station, but that
this belonged to God alone; and farther, that God does not confer so much upon
any one as to elevate him to the place of the Head, but distributes his gifts in
such a manner, that He alone is glorified in all things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To distinguish

Pelagians,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

mankind, is not implanted in him by nature, so that it could be ascribed either
to nature or to descent; and farther, that it is not acquired by free will, so
as to bring God under obligation, but flows from his pure and undeserved mercy.
For there can be no doubt that Paul here contrasts the grace of God with the
merit or worthiness of men.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f229</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And what hast
thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>This is a confirmation of the
preceding statement, for that man cannot on good ground extol himself, who has
no superiority above others. For what greater vanity is there than that of
boasting without any ground for it? Now, there is no man that has anything of
excellency from himself; therefore the man that extols himself is a fool and an
idiot. The true foundation of Christian modesty is this &#8212; not to be
self-complacent, as knowing that we are empty and void of everything good
&#8212; that, if God has implanted in us anything that is good, we are so much
the more debtors to his grace; and in fine, that, as Cyprian says, we must glory
in nothing, because there is nothing that is our own.</font><br></div>

think</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>etc. It is uncertain whether he
speaks of himself exclusively, or takes in at the same time Apollos and
Silvanus, for he sometimes calls such persons apostles. I prefer, however, to
understand it of himself exclusively. Should any one be inclined to extend it
farther, I shall have no particular objection, provided only he does not
understand it as Chrysostom does, to mean that the apostles were as if for the
sake of ignominy reserved to the last
place.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f234</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For there can be no doubt that by the
term <i>last</i>,<i> </i>he means those who were admitted to the rank of
apostles subsequently to the resurrection of Christ. Now, he admits that he is
like those who are exhibited to the people when on the eve of being led forth to
death. For such is the meaning of the word <i>exhibited</i> &#8212; <i>as
</i>those who on occasion of a triumph were led
round</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f235</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for the sake of show, and were
afterwards hurried away to prison to be strangled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This he expresses more distinctly by adding, that
they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>were made a
spectacle</i></font><font face="Palatino">. &#8220;This,&#8221;<i> </i>says he,
&#8220;is my condition, that I exhibit to the world a spectacle of my miseries,
like those who having been condemned to fight with wild
beasts,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f236</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or to the games of the gladiators, or to
some other mode of punishment, are brought forth to the view of the people, and
that not before a few spectators, but before the whole
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>world</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221;<i>
</i>Observe here the admirable steadfastness of Paul, who, while he saw himself
to be dealt with by God in this manner, was nevertheless not broken or
dispirited. For he does not impute it to the wantonness of the wicked, that he
was, as it were, led forth with ignominy to the sport of the arena, but ascribes
it wholly to the providence of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The second clause

sense &#8212; &#8220;I am made a sport and spectacle, not merely to earth, but
also to heaven.&#8221; This passage has been commonly explained as referring to
devils, from its seeming to be absurd to refer it to good angels. Paul, however,
does not mean, that all who are witnesses of this calamity are gratified with
such a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spectacle</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>He simply means, that the Lord has so ordered his lot that he seems as
though he had been appointed to furnish sport to the whole

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We are fools for

throughout ironical, and exceedingly pointed, it being unseemly and absurd that
the Corinthians should be in every respect happy and honorable, according to the
flesh, while in the meantime they beheld their master and father afflicted with
the lowest ignominy, and with miseries of every kind. For those who are of
opinion that Paul abases himself in this manner, in order that he may in
earnestness ascribe to the Corinthians those things which he acknowledges
himself to be in want of, may without any difficulty be refuted from the little
clause that he afterwards subjoins. In speaking, therefore, of the Corinthians
as </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wise in

to lay aside that loftiness of spirit, and embrace, as he did, the cross of
Christ with meekness of spirit. He discovers the utmost dexterity in this
respect, that in making mention of those things which had rendered him
contemptible, he affords clear proof of his singular fidelity and indefatigable
zeal for the advancement of the gospel; and, on the other hand, he tacitly
reproves his rivals, who, while they had furnished no such proof, were desirous,
nevertheless, to be held in the highest esteem. In the words themselves there is
no obscurity, except that we must take notice of the distinction between those

by God, by means of the cross, but is also endowed with a disposition to abase
himself willingly. In this, perhaps, he gives a stroke to the false apostles,
who were so effeminate and tender, that they could not bear to be touched even
with your little finger. In speaking of their <i>laboring </i>he adds<i> &#8212;

evil</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

were not less held in contempt by the Corinthians. There is, however, no urgent
reason for regarding what he says as extending to more than himself. The other
term &#8212;</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">
peri&gt;yhma,</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>(offscouring,) denotes filings
or scrapings of any kind, and also the sweepings that are cleared away with a

<div><font face="Palatino">In so far as concerns the meaning of the passage
before us, Paul, with the view of expressing his extreme degradation, says that
he is held in abomination by the whole world, like a man set apart for
expiation,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f249</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and that, like offscourings, he is
nauseous to all. At the same time he does not mean to say by the former
comparison that he is all expiatory victim for sins, but simply means, that in
respect of disgrace and reproaches he differs nothing from the man on whom the
execrations of all are heaped up.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I write not these things to
shame you</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As the foregoing instances of
irony were very pointed, so that they might exasperate the minds of the
Corinthians, he now obviates that dissatisfaction by declaring, that he had not
said these things with a view to cover them with shame, but rather to admonish
them with paternal affection. It is indeed certain that this is the nature and
tendency of a father&#8217;s chastisement, to make his son feel ashamed; for the
first token of return to a right state of mind is the shame which the son begins
to feel on being reproached for his fault. The object, then, which the father
has in view when he chastises his son with reproofs, is that he may bring him to
be displeased with himself. And we see that the tendency of what Paul has said
hitherto, is to make the Corinthians ashamed of themselves. Nay more, we shall
find him a little afterwards
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 6:5) declaring that he made mention of their faults in order that
they may begin to be ashamed. Here, however, he simply means to intimate, that
it was not his design to heap disgrace upon them, or to expose their sins
publicly and openly with a view to their reproach. For he who admonishes in a
friendly spirit, makes it his particular care that whatever there is of shame,
may remain with the individual whom he
admonishes,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f250</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and may in this manner be buried. On the
other hand, the man who reproaches with a malignant disposition, inflicts
disgrace upon the man whom he reproves for his fault, in such a manner as to
hold him up to the reproach of all. Paul then simply affirms that what he had
said, had been said by him, with no disposition to upbraid, or with any view to
hurt their reputation, but, on the contrary, with paternal affection he
admonished them as to what he saw to be defective in them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what was the design of this admonition? It was
that the Corinthians, who were puffed up with mere empty notions, might learn to
glow, as he did, in the abasement of the cross, and might no longer despise him
on those grounds on which he was deservedly honorable in the sight of God and
angels &#8212; in fine, that, laying aside their accustomed haughtiness, they
might set a higher value on those
<i>marks</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f251</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> of Christ
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480617&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:17) that were upon him, than on the empty and counterfeit<i> </i>show of the
false apostles. Let teachers</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f252</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> infer from this, that in reproofs they
must always use such moderation as not to wound men&#8217;s minds with excessive
severity, and that, agreeably to the common proverb, they must mix honey or oil
with vinegar &#8212; that they must above all things take care not to appear to
triumph over those whom they reprove, or to take delight in their disgrace
&#8212; nay more, that they must endeavor to make it understood that they seek
nothing but that their welfare may be promoted. For what good will the
teacher</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f253</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> do by mere bawling, if he does not
season the sharpness of his reproof by that moderation of which I have spoken?
Hence if we are desirous to do any good by <i>correcting </i>men&#8217;s faults,
we must distinctly give them to know, that our reproofs proceed from a friendly
disposition.</font><br></div>

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;234006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

&#8220;As<i> </i>new sons are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>begotten</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

him were not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino">?&#8221;<i>
</i>the answer is easy &#8212; that he is here speaking of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commencement</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of the Church. For although many had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>begotten</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>by the ministry of others, this honor remained to Paul untouched &#8212;
that he had founded the Corinthian Church. Should any one, again, ask,
&#8220;Ought not all pastors to be reckoned
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and if so, why does Paul deprive all others of this title, so as to claim it
for himself exclusively?&#8221; I answer &#8212; &#8220;He speaks here
comparatively.&#8221;<i> </i>Hence, however the title of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>might be applicable to them in other respects, yet in respect of Paul, they
were merely
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>instructors</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>We must also keep in mind what I touched upon a little ago, that he is not
speaking of all, (for as to those who were like himself, as, for example,
Apollos, Silvanus, and Timotheus, who aimed at nothing but the advancement<i>
</i>of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, he would have had no objection to their being so
named, and having the highest honor assigned to them,) but is reproving those
who, by a misdirected ambition, transferred to themselves the glory that
belonged to another. Of this sort were those who robbed Paul of the honor that
was due to him, that they might set themselves off in his
spoils.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And, truly, the condition of the Church universal at
this day is the same as that of the Corinthian Church was at that time. For how
few are there that love the Churches with a <i>fatherly</i>,<i> </i>that is to
say, a disinterested affection, and lay themselves out to promote their welfare!
Meanwhile, there are very many <i>pedagogues</i>,<i> </i>who give out their
services as hirelings, in such a manner as to discharge as it were a mere
temporary office, and in the meantime hold the people in subjection and
admiration.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f260</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">At the same
time, even in that case it is well when there are many <i>pedagogues</i>,<i>
</i>who do good, at least, to some extent by teaching, and do not destroy the
Church by the corruptions of false doctrine. For my part, when I complain of the
multitude of pedagogues, I<i> </i>do not refer to Popish priests, (for I would
not do them the honor of reckoning them in that number,) but those who, while
agreeing with us in doctrine, employ themselves in taking care of their own
affairs, rather than those of Christ. We all, it is true, wish to be reckoned
<i>fathers</i>,<i> </i>and require from others the obedience of sons, but where
is the man to be found who acts in such a manner as to show that he is a
<i>father</i>?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f261</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There remains another question of greater difficulty:
As Christ forbids us to</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">call any one father upon
earth, because we have one Father in heaven,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
23:9,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">how does Paul dare to take to himself the name of<i>
father</i>? I answer, that, properly speaking, God alone is the Father, not
merely of our soul, but also of our flesh. As, however, in so far as concerns
the body, he communicates the honor of his paternal name to those to whom he
gives offspring, while, as to souls, he reserves to himself exclusively the
right and title of Father, I confess that, on this account, he is called in a
peculiar sense </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Father of
spirits</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and is distinguished from
earthly <i>fathers</i>,<i> </i>as the Apostle speaks in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:9. As, however, notwithstanding that it is he alone who, by his own
influence, begets souls, and regenerates and quickens them, he makes use of the
ministry of his servants for this purpose, there is no harm in their being
called <i>fathers</i>,<i> </i>in respect of this ministry, as this does not in
any degree detract from the honor of God. The word, as I have said, is the
spiritual seed. God alone by means of it regenerates our souls by his influence,
but, at the same time, he does not exclude the efforts of ministers. If,
therefore, you attentively consider, what God accomplishes by himself, and what
he designs to be accomplished by ministers, you will easily understand in what
sense he alone is worthy of the name of <i>Father</i>,<i> </i>and how far this
name is applicable to his ministers, without any infringement upon his
rights.</font><br></div>

in respect of his own right, when he <i>exhorts </i>them to this, by way of

Corinthians 11:1.) This limitation must always be observed, so as not to follow
any man, except in so far as he leads us to Christ. We know what he is here
treating of. The Corinthians did not merely shun the abasement of the cross, but
they also regarded their <i>father </i>with contempt, on this account, that,
forgetting earthly glow, he gloried rather in reproaches for Christ; and they
reckoned themselves and others fortunate in having nothing contemptible
according to the flesh. He accordingly admonishes them to devote themselves,
after his example, to the service of Christ, so as to endure all things
patiently.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>

may know what my manner of life is, and whether I am worthy to be imitated,
listen to what Timothy has to say, who will be prepared to be a faithful witness
of these things. Now as there are two things that secure credit to a man&#8217;s
testimony &#8212; a knowledge of the things which he relates, and fidelity
&#8212; he lets them know that Timothy possesses both of these things. For in
calling him his </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dearly beloved
son</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he intimates that he knew him
intimately, and was acquainted with all his affairs; and farther, he speaks of
him as </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faithful in the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He gives also two things in charge
to Timothy<i> &#8212; first</i>,<i> </i>to recall to the recollection of the
Corinthians those things which they should of themselves have had in
remembrance, and in this he tacitly reproves them; and <i>secondly</i>,<i>
</i>to testify to them, how uniform and steady his manner of teaching was in
every place. Now it is probable that he had been assailed by the calumnies of
the false apostles, as though he assumed more authority over the Corinthians
than he did over others, or as though he conducted himself in a very different
way in other places; for it is not without good reason that he wishes this to be
testified to them. It is then the part of a prudent minister so to regulate his
procedure,<i> </i>and to observe such a method of instruction, that no such
objection may be brought against him, but he shall be prepared to answer on the

is the custom of the false apostles &#8212; to take advantage of the absence of
the good, that they may triumph and vaunt without any hindrance. Paul,
accordingly, with the view of reproving their ill-regulated conscience, and
repressing their insolence, tells them, that they cannot endure his presence. It
happens sometimes, it is true, that wicked men, on finding opportunity of
insulting, rise up openly with an iron front against the servants of Christ, but
never do they come forward ingenuously to an equal
combat,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

time perceive how vain their confidence has been.&#8221; He has it not, however,
so much in view to terrify them, as though he would on his arrival thunder forth
against them, but rather presses and bears down upon their consciences, for,
however they might disguise it, they were aware that he was furnished with
divine influence.</font><br></div>

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;590415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
4:15) in planning what they are to do ten years afterwards, while they have not
security for living even a single hour. We are not, it is true, bound by a
constant necessity to the use of such forms of expression, but it is the better
way to accustom ourselves carefully to them, that we may exercise our minds from
time to time in this consideration &#8212; that all our plans must be in
subjection to the will of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will know not the

understand that prating in which the false apostles delighted themselves, for
they excelled in a kind of dexterity and gracefulness of speech, while they were
destitute of the zeal and efficacy of the Spirit. By the term <i>power</i>,<i>
</i>he means that spiritual efficacy, with which those are endowed who dispense
the word of the Lord with
earnestness.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

which they claim for themselves every honor. If they wish to have any honor from

gracefulness and dexterity in teaching is like a body that is elegant and of a
beautiful color, while the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>power</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of which Paul here speaks is like the soul. <i>We </i>have already seen that
the preaching of the gospel is of such a nature, that it is inwardly replete
with a kind of solid majesty. This majesty shows itself, when a minister strives
by means of

rather than of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speech</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
&#8212; </i>that<i> </i>is, when he does not place confidence in his own
intellect, or eloquence, but, furnished with spiritual armor, consisting of zeal
for maintaining the Lord&#8217;s honor &#8212; eagerness for the raising up of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom &#8212; a desire to edify &#8212; the fear of the Lord
&#8212; an invincible constancy &#8212; purity of conscience, and other
necessary endowments, he applies himself diligently to the Lord&#8217;s work.
Without this, preaching is dead, and has no strength, with whatever beauty it
may be adorned. Hence in his second epistle, he says, that in Christ nothing
avails but <i>a new creature
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:17) &#8212; a statement which is to the same purpose. For he would
have us not rest in outward masks, but depend solely on the internal
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>power</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of the Holy Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But while in these words he represses the ambition of
the false apostles, he at the same time reproves the Corinthians for their
perverted judgment, in measuring the servants of Christ by what holds the lowest
place among their excellences. Here we have a remarkable statement, and one that
is not less applicable to us than to them. As to our gospel, of which we are
proud,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f267</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> where is it in most persons except in
the tongue? Where is newness of life? Where is spiritual efficacy? Nor is it so
among the people merely.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f268</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> On the contrary, how many there are,
who, while endeavoring to procure favor and applause from the gospel, as though
it were some profane science, aim at nothing else than to speak with elegance
and refinement! I do not approve of restricting the term <i>power </i>to
miracles, for from the contrast we may readily gather that it has a more
extensive import.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What will
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>The person who divided the Epistles
into chapters ought to have made this the beginning of the <i>fifth </i>chapter.
For having hitherto reproved the foolish pride of the Corinthians, their vain
confidence, and their judgment as perverted and corrupted by ambition, he now
makes mention of the vices with which they were infected, and on account of
which they ought to be ashamed &#8212; &#8220;You are puffed up, as though
everything were on the best possible footing among you, but it were better if
you did with shame and sighing acknowledge the unhappiness of your condition,
for if you persist, I shall be under the necessity of laying aside mildness, and
exercising towards you a paternal severity.&#8221; There is, however, still more
of emphasis in this threatening in which he gives them liberty to choose, for he
declares that it does not depend upon himself whether he shall show himself
agreeable and mild, but that it is their own fault that he is necessitated to
use severity. &#8220;It<i> </i>is for you,&#8221;<i> </i>says he, &#8220;to<i>
</i>choose in what temper you would have me. As for me, I am prepared to be
mild, but if you go on as you have done hitherto, I shall be under the necessity
of taking up the rod.&#8221;<i> </i>He thus takes higher ground, after having
laid claim to <i>fatherly </i>authority over them, for it would have been absurd
to set out with this threatening, without first opening up the way by what he
said, and preparing them for entertaining fears.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rod</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>he means that severity with which a pastor ought to correct his
people&#8217;s faults. He places in contrast with this,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love, and the spirit of
meekness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; </i>not,<i> </i>as though
the father hated the sons whom he chastises, for on the contrary the
chastisement proceeds from love, but because by sadness of countenance and
harshness of words, he appears as though he were angry with his son. To express
myself more plainly &#8212; in one word, a father always, whatever kind of look
he may put on, regards his son with affection, but that affection he manifests
when he teaches him pleasantly and lovingly; but when, on the other hand, being
displeased with his faults, he chastises him in rather sharp terms, or even with
the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rod</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>he puts on the appearance of a person in a passion. As then love does not
appear when severity of discipline is exercised, it is not without good reason,
that Paul here conjoins</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>with a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit of
meekness</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>There are<i> </i>some that
understand the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rod</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to mean excommunication &#8212; but, for my part, though I grant them that
excommunication is a part of that severity with which Paul threatens the
Corinthians, I at the same time extend it farther, so as to include all reproofs
that are of a harsher kind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Observe here what system a good pastor ought to
observe; for he ought of his own accord to be inclined to mildness, with the
view of drawing to Christ, rather than driving. This mildness, so far as in him
lies, he ought to maintain, and never have recourse to bitterness, unless he be
compelled to do so. On the other hand, he must not <i>spare the rod</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;201324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
13:24,) when there is need for it, for while those that are teachable and
agreeable should be dealt with mildly, sharpness requires to be used in dealing
with the refractory and contumacious. We see, too, that the Word of God does not
contain mere doctrine, but contains an intermixture of bitter reproofs, so as to
supply pastors with a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rod</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>For it often happens, through the obstinacy of the people, that those
pastors who are naturally the
mildest</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f269</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are constrained to put on, as it were,
the countenance of another, and act with rigor and
severity.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

originated, as has been observed, in presumption and excessive confidence, he
most appropriately proceeds to make mention of their diseases, the knowledge of
which should have the effect of humbling them. First of all, he shows them what
enormous wickedness it is to allow one of their society to have an illicit
connection with his mother-in-law. It is not certain, whether he had seduced her
from his father as a prostitute, or whether he kept her under pretense of
marriage. This, however, does not much affect, the subject in hand; for, as in
the former case, there would have been an abominable and execrable whoredom, so
the latter would have involved an incestuous connection, abhorrent to all
propriety and natural decency. Now, that he may not seem to charge them on
doubtful suspicions, he says, that the case which he brings forward is well
known and in general circulation. For it is in this sense that I take the
particle </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">o[lwv
</font><font face="Palatino">(generally) as intimating that it was no vague
rumor, but a matter well known, and published everywhere so as to cause great
scandal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From his saying that such a kind of whoredom was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not named even among the

refers to the incest of Reuben,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;013522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
35:22,) who, in like manner, had an incestuous connection with his
mother-in-law. They are accordingly of opinion, that Paul did not make mention
of Israel, because a disgraceful instance of this kind had occurred among them,
as if the annals of the Gentiles did not record many incestuous connections of
that kind! This, then, is an idea that, is quite foreign to Paul&#8217;s
intention; for in making mention of the Gentiles rather than of the Jews, he
designed rather to heighten the aggravation of the crime. &#8220;You,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;permit, as though it were a lawful thing, an enormity, which
would not be tolerated even among the Gentiles &#8212; nay more, has always been
regarded by them with horror, and looked upon as a prodigy of crime.&#8221;
When, therefore, he affirms that it was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not named among the

no such firing had ever existed among them, or was not recorded in their annals,
for even tragedies have been founded upon
it;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f270</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but that it was held in detestation by
the Gentiles, as a shameful and abominable monstrosity, for it is a beastly
lust, which destroys even natural modesty. Should any one ask, &#8220;Is it just
to reproach all with the sin of one individual?&#8221; I answer, that the
Corinthians are accused, not because one of their number has sinned, but
because, as is stated afterwards, they encouraged by connivance a crime that was
deserving of the severest punishment.</font><br></div>

Corinthians 4:7.) Now, however, he attacks them from another quarter.
&#8220;You<i> </i>are,&#8221;<i> </i>says he, &#8220;covered with disgrace: what
ground have you, then, for pride or haughtiness? For there is an amazing
blindness in glorying in the midst of disgrace, in spite, as it were of angels
and men.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and have not rather
mourned</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he argues by way of contrast;
for where there is grief there is no more glorying. It may be asked:
&#8220;Why<i> </i>ought they to have
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mourned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>over another man&#8217;s sin?&#8221; I answer, for two reasons:<i>
first</i>,<i> </i>in consequence of the communion that exists among the members
of the Church, it was becoming that all should feel hurt at so deadly a fall on
the part of one of their number; and <i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>when such an
enormity is perpetrated in a particular Church, the perpetrator of it is all
offender in such a way, that the whole society is in a manner polluted. For as
God humbles the father of a family in the disgrace of his wife, or of his
children, and a whole kindred in the disgrace of one of their number, so every
Church ought to consider, that it contracts a stain of disgrace whenever any
base crime is perpetrated in it. Nay, farther, we see how the anger of God was
kindled against the whole nation of Israel on account of the sacrilege of one
individual &#8212; Achan.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;060701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joshua
7:1.) It was not as though God had been so cruel as to take vengeance on the
innocent for another man&#8217;s crime; but, as in every instance in which
anything of this nature has occurred among a people, there is already some token
of his anger, so by correcting a community for the fault of one individual, he
distinctly intimates that the whole body is infected and polluted with the
contagion of the offense. Hence we readily infer, that it is the duty of every
Church to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mourn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>over the faults of individual members, as domestic calamities belonging to
the entire body. And assuredly a pious and dutiful correction takes its rise in
our being inflamed with holy zeal through displeasure at the offense; for
otherwise severity will be felt to be
bitter.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f271</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he might be taken away from
among you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now brings out more
distinctly what he finds fault with in the Corinthians &#8212; remissness,
inasmuch as they connived at such an abomination. Hence, too, it appears that
Churches are furnished with this
power</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f272</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; that, whatever fault there is
within them, they can correct or remove it by strictness of discipline, and that
those are inexcusable that are not on the alert to have filth cleared away. For
Paul here condemns the Corinthians. Why? Because they had been remiss in the
punishment of one individual. Now he would have accused them unjustly, if they
had not had this power. Hence the power of excommunication is established from
this passage. On the other hand, as Churches have this mode of punishment put
into their hands, those commit
sin,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f273</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as Paul shows here, that do not make use
of it, when it is required; for otherwise he would act unfairly to the
Corinthians in charging them with this fault.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
truly,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc. As the Corinthians were
wanting in their duty, having condemned their negligence, he now shows what
ought to be done. In order that this stain may be removed, they must cast out
this incestuous person from the society of the faithful. He prescribes, then, as
a remedy for the disease, excommunication, which they had sinfully delayed so
long. When he says, that he had,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>while absent in
body</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>already determined this, he
severely reproves in this way the remissness of the Corinthians, for there is
here all implied contrast. It is as though he had said: &#8220;You who are
<i>present </i>ought before this time to have applied a remedy to this disease,
having it every day before your eyes,<i> </i>and yet you do
nothing;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f274</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> while for my part I cannot, even though
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>absent</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>endure it.&#8221;<i> </i>Lest any one should allege that he acted rashly in
forming a judgment when at so great a distance, he declares himself to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>present in
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>meaning by this, that the line
of duty was as plain to him as if he were present, and saw the thing with his
eyes.<i> </i>Now it is of importance to observe what he teaches as to the mode
of excommunication.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When you are gathered
together and my spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; that<i> </i>is,
when ye are </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gathered
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>with me, but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>for they could not meet together
as to bodily presence. He declares, however, that it would be all one as though
he were personally present. It is to be carefully observed, that Paul, though an
Apostle, does not himself, as an individual, excommunicate according to his own
pleasure, but consults with the Church, that the matter may be transacted by
common authority. He, it is true, takes the lead, and shows the way, but, in
taking others as his associates, he intimates with sufficient plainness, that
this authority does not belong to any one individual. As, however, a multitude
never accomplishes anything with moderation or seriousness, if not governed by
counsel, there was appointed in the ancient Church a
Presbytery,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f275</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that is, an assembly of elders, who, by
the consent of all, had the power of first judging in the case. From them the
matter was brought before the people, but it was as a thing already judged
of.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f276</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Whatever the matter may be, it is quite
contrary to the appointment of Christ and his Apostles &#8212; to the order of
the Church, and even to equity itself, that this right should be put into the
hands of any one man, of excommunicating at his pleasure any that he may choose.
Let us take notice, then, that in excommunicating this limitation be observed
&#8212; that this part of discipline be exercised by the common counsel of the
elders, and with the consent of the people, and that this is a remedy in
opposition to tyranny. For nothing is more at variance with the discipline of
Christ than tyranny, for which you open a wide door, if you give one man the
entire power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the name of our
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>For it is not enough that we
assemble, if it be not </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
name of Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>for even the wicked
assemble together for impious and nefarious conspiracies. Now in order that an
assembly may be held in Christ&#8217;s name, two things are requisite:
<i>first</i>,<i> </i>that we begin by calling upon his name; and
<i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>that nothing is attempted but in conformity with his
word. <i>Then </i>only do men make an auspicious commencement of anything that
they take in hand to do, when they with their heart call upon the Lord that they
may be governed by his Spirit, and that their plans may, by his grace, be
directed to a happy issue; and farther, when they <i>ask at his mouth</i>,<i>
</i>as the Prophet speaks,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;233002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
30:2,) that is to say, when, after consulting his oracles, they surrender
themselves and all their designs to his will in unreserved obedience. If this is
becoming even in the least of our actions, how much less ought it to be omitted
in important and serious matters, and least of all, when we have to do with
God&#8217;s business rather than our own? For example, excommunication is an
ordinance of God, and not of men; on any occasion, therefore, on which we are to
make use of it, where shall we begin if not with
God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f277</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In short, when Paul exhorts the
Corinthians to assemble </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
name of Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he does not simply
require them to make use of Christ&#8217;s name, or to confess him with the
mouth, (for the wicked themselves can do that,) but to seek him truly and with
the heart, and farther, he intimates by this the seriousness and importance of
the action.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with the power of our
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>for if the promise is
true,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">As often as two or three
are gathered together in my name,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">I

18:20,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">it follows, that whatever is done in such an assembly
is a work of Christ. Hence we infer, of what importance excommunication, rightly
administered, is in the sight of God, inasmuch as it rests upon the power of
God. For that saying, too, must be accomplished,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, this statement ought to fill
despisers</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f278</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> with no ordinary alarm, so faithful

devout spirit</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f279</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they should go to work in a matter of
such importance. For it is certain that the power of Christ is not tied to the
inclination or opinions of mankind, but is associated with his eternal
truth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To deliver to Satan for the
destruction of the flesh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the
Apostles had been furnished with this power among others, that they could
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deliver over to
Satan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>wicked and obstinate persons, and
made use of him as a scourge to correct them, Chrysostom, and those that follow
him, view these words of Paul as referring to a chastisement of that kind,
agreeably to the exposition that is usually given of another passage, in
reference to Alexander and Hymeneus,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 1:20.) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To deliver over to
Satan</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>they think, means nothing but the
infliction of a severe punishment upon the body. But when I examine the whole
context more narrowly, and at the same time compare it with what is stated in
the Second Epistle, I give up that interpretation, as forced and at variance
with Paul&#8217;s meaning, and understand it simply of excommunication. For
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>delivering over to
Satan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is an appropriate expression for
denoting excommunication; for as Christ reigns <i>in</i> the Church, so Satan
reigns <i>out of </i>the Church, as Augustine, too, has
remarked,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f280</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in his sixty-eighth sermon on the words
of the Apostle, where he explains this
passage.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f281</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As, then, we are received<i> </i>into
the communion of the Church, and remain in it on this condition, that we are
under the protection and guardianship of Christ, I say, that he who is cast out
of the Church is in a manner delivered over to the power of Satan, for he
becomes an alien, and is cast out of Christ&#8217;s kingdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The clause that follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the destruction of the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>is made use of for the purpose of
softening; for Paul&#8217;s meaning is not that the person who is chastised is
given over to Satan to be utterly ruined, or so as to be given up to the devil
in perpetual bondage, but that it is a temporary condemnation, and not only so,
but of such a nature as will be salutary. For as the salvation equally with the
condemnation of the spirit is eternal, he takes the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>condemnation of the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as meaning <i>temporal
</i>condemnation. &#8220;We will condemn him in this world for a time, that the
Lord may preserve him in his kingdom.&#8221; This furnishes an answer to the
objection, by which some endeavor to set aside this exposition, for as the
sentence of excommunication is directed rather against the soul than against the
outward man, they inquire how it can be called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the destruction of the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>My answer, then, is, (as I have
already in part stated,) that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destruction of the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is opposed to <i>the salvation of
the spirit</i>,<i> </i>simply because the former is temporal and the latter is
eternal. In this sense the Apostle in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
5:7, uses the expression <i>the days of Christ</i>&#8217;<i>s flesh</i>,<i>
</i>to mean the course of his mortal life. Now the Church in chastising
offenders with severity, spares them not in this world, in order that God may
spare them.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

because they extolled themselves beyond what is lawful for man, but because they
delighted themselves in their faults. He had previously stripped mankind of all
glory; for he had shown that, as they have nothing of their own, whatever
excellence they may have, they owe the entire praise of it to God alone.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:7.) What he treats of here, however, is not that, God is defrauded
of his right, when mortals arrogate to themselves the praise of their
excellences, but that the Corinthians are guilty of arrant folly in extolling
themselves without any just ground. For they proudly gloried as if everything
had been in a golden style among them, while in the meantime there was so much
among them that was wicked and disgraceful.</font><br></div>

was a matter of little or no importance that they gave encouragement to so great
an evil, he shows the destructive tendency of indulgence and dissimulation in
such a case. He makes use of a proverbial saying, by which he intimates that a
whole multitude is infected by the contagion of a single individual. For this
proverb has in this passage</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

to a general doctrine. For he is no longer speaking of the case of incest, but
exhorts them generally to purity of life, on the ground that we cannot remain in
Christ if we are not cleansed. He is accustomed to do this not infrequently.
When he has made a particular statement, he takes occasion to pass on to general
exhortations. He had made mention of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>leaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:6,) for the corruption of nature takes the precedence in us, previously to our

</i>which we bring with us from the womb, and must perish when we are renewed by
the grace of the Spirit.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f289</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejtu&gt;qh,</font><font face="Palatino">
which occurs between the name <i>Christ </i>and the term which denotes a
sacrifice,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f290</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">may refer
to either. I have taken it as referring to the sacrifice, though this is of no
great importance, as the meaning is not affected. The
verb</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">
eJorta&gt;zwmen,</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which Erasmus rendered
&#8220;Let us celebrate the feast,&#8221; signifies also to partake of the
solemn feast which was observed after the sacrifice had been offered up. This
interpretation appeared to suit better with the passage before us. I have,
accordingly, followed the Vulgate in preference to Erasmus, as this rendering is
more in accordance with the mystery of which Paul treats.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We come now to the subject-matter. Paul, having it in
view to exhort the Corinthians to holiness, shows that what was of old
figuratively represented in the passover, ought to be at this day accomplished
in us, and explains the correspondence which exists between the figure and the
reality. In the first place, as the passover consisted of two parts &#8212; a
sacrifice and a sacred feast &#8212; he makes mention of both. For although some
do not reckon the paschal lamb to have been a sacrifice, yet reason shows that
it was properly a sacrifice, for in that rite the people were reconciled to God
by the sprinkling of blood. Now there is no reconciliation without a sacrifice;
and, besides, the Apostle now expressly confirms if, for he makes use of the
word</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">
qu&gt;esqai,</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which is applicable to
sacrifices,<i> </i>and in other respects, too, the context would not correspond.
The lamb, then, was sacrificed yearly; then followed a feast, the celebration of
which<i> </i>lasted for seven successive days.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b> Now, in the solemnity of this sacred feast

outward passover was to them a figure of the true
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>passover</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>so its appendages were figures of the reality which we at this day possess.
If, therefore, we would wish to feed on Christ&#8217;s flesh and blood, let us

showing that the ancient passover was not merely
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mnhmosunon,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f293</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>a memorial of a past benefit, but
also a sacrament, representing Christ who was to come, from whom we have this

that in <i>Christ </i>is the <i>body </i>of the legal shadows.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:17.) This passage will also be of service for setting aside the sacrilege of
the Papal mass. For Paul does not teach that Christ is offered daily, but that
the sacrifice having been offered up once for all, it remains that the spiritual
feast be celebrated during our whole life.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I wrote to you in an
epistle.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The epistle of which he speaks
is not at this day extant. Nor is there any doubt that many others are lost. It
is enough, however, that those have been preserved to us which the Lord foresaw
would suffice. But this passage, in consequence of its obscurity, has been
twisted to a variety of interpretations, which I do not think it necessary for
me to take up time in setting aside, but will simply bring forward what appears
to me to be its true meaning. He reminds the Corinthians of what he had already
enjoined upon them &#8212; that they should refrain from intercourse with the
wicked. For the word rendered <i>to keep company with</i>,<i> </i>means to be on
terms of familiarity with any one, and to be in habits of close intimacy with
him.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f294</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now, his reminding them of this tends to
expose their remissness, inasmuch as they had been admonished, and yet had
remained inactive.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds an exception, that they may the better
understand that this refers particularly to those that belong to the Church, as
they did not require to be
admonished</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f295</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to avoid the society of the world. In
short, then, he prohibits the Corinthians from holding intercourse with those
who, while professing to be believers, do, nevertheless, live wickedly and to
the dishonor of God. &#8220;Let<i> </i>all that wish to be reckoned brethren,
either live holily and becomingly, or be excommunicated from the society of the
pious, and let all the good refrain from intercourse and familiarity with them.
It were superfluous to speak as to the openly wicked, for you ought of your own
accord to shun them, without any admonition from me.&#8221; This exception,
however, increases the criminality of remissness, inasmuch as they cherished in
the bosom of the Church an openly wicked person; for it is more disgraceful to
neglect those of your own household than to neglect strangers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Since you would have
required.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is as to this clause
especially that interpreters are not agreed. For some say, &#8220;You<i>
</i>must sooner quit Greece.&#8221; Ambrose, on the other hand, says,
&#8220;You<i> </i>must rather die.&#8221; Erasmus turns it into the optative, as
if Paul said, &#8220;Would<i> </i>that it were allowable for you to leave the
world altogether;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f296</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but as you cannot do this, you must at
least quit the society of those who falsely assume the name of Christians, and
in the meantime exhibit in their lives the worst example.&#8221;
Chrysostom&#8217;s exposition has more appearance of truth. According to him,
the meaning is this: &#8220;When I command you to shun fornicators, I do not
mean all such; otherwise you would require to go in quest of another world; for
we must live among thorns so long as we sojourn on earth. This only do I
require, that you do not keep company with fornicators, who wish to be regarded
as brethren, lest you should seem by your sufferance to approve of their
wickedness.&#8221; Thus the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>here, must be taken to mean the present life, as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
17:15.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">I pray not, Father, that
thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest deliver them
from the evil.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Against this exposition a question might be proposed
by way of objection: &#8220;As Paul said this at a time when Christians were as
yet mingled with heathens, and dispersed among them, what ought to be done now,
when all have given themselves to Christ in name? For even in the present day we
must go out of the world, if we would avoid the society of the wicked; and there
are none that are strangers, when all take upon themselves Christ&#8217;s name,
and are consecrated to him by baptism.&#8221; Should any one feel inclined to
follow Chrysostom, he will find no difficulty in replying, to this effect: that
Paul here took for granted what was true &#8212; that, where there is the power
of excommunication, there is an easy remedy for effecting a separation between
the good and the bad, if Churches do their duty. As to strangers, the Christians
at Corinth had no jurisdiction, and they could not restrain their dissolute
manner of life. Hence they must of necessity have quitted the world, if they
wished to avoid the society of the wicked, whose vices they could not
cure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For my own part, as I do not willingly adopt
interpretations which cannot be made to suit the words, otherwise than by
twisting the words so as to suit them, I prefer one that is different from all
these, taking the word rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to go
out</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as meaning <i>to be
separated</i>,<i> </i>and the term <i>world </i>as meaning <i>the pollutions of
the world</i>.<i> </i>&#8220;What need have you of an injunction as to <i>the
children of this world</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
16:8,) for having once for all renounced the world, it becomes you to stand
aloof from their society; for <i>the whole world lieth in the wicked
one</i>.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f297</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 5:19.) If any one is not satisfied with this interpretation, here is still
another that is probable: &#8220;I do not write to you in general terms, that
you should shun the society of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fornicators of this
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>though <i>that </i>you ought to
do, without any admonition from me.&#8221; I prefer, however, the former; and I
am not the first contriver of it, but, while it has been brought forward
previously by others, I have adapted it more fully, if I mistake not, to
Paul&#8217;s thread of discourse. There is,
then,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f298</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> a sort of intentional omission, when he
says that he makes no mention of those that are <i>without</i>,<i> </i>inasmuch
as the Corinthians ought to be already separated from them, that they may know
that even at home</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f299</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they required to maintain this
discipline of avoiding the wicked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If he who is called a
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>In the Greek there is a
participle</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f300</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> without a
verb.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f301</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Those that view this as referring to
what follows, bring out here a forced meaning, and at variance with Paul&#8217;s
intention. I confess, indeed, that that is a just
sentiment,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f302</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and worthy of being particularly noticed
&#8212; that no one can be punished by the decision of the Church, but one whose
sin has become matter of notoriety; but these words of Paul cannot be made to
bear that meaning. What he means, then, is this: &#8220;If any one is reckoned a
brother among you, and at the same time leads a wicked life, and such as is
unbecoming a Christian, keep aloof from his society.&#8221; In short, being
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>a brother, means here a false profession, which has no corresponding
reality. Farther, he does not make a complete enumeration of crimes, but merely
mentions five or six by way of example, and then afterwards, under the
expression <i>such an one</i>,<i> </i>he sums up the whole; and he does not
mention any but what fall under the knowledge of men. For inward impiety, and
anything that is secret, does not fall within the judgment of the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is uncertain, however, what he means by an
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>idolater</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>For how can he be devoted to idolatry who has made a profession of Christ?
Some are of opinion that there were among the Corinthians at that time some who
received Christ but in half, and in the mean time were involved, nevertheless,
in corrupt superstition, as the Israelites of old, and afterwards the Samaritans
maintained a kind of worship of God, but at the same time polluted it with
wicked superstitions. For my part, I rather understand it of those who, while
they held idols in contempt, gave, nevertheless, a pretended homage to the
idols, with the view of gratifying the wicked. Paul declares that such persons
ought not to be tolerated in the society of Christians; and not without good
reason, inasmuch as they made so little account of trampling God&#8217;s glory
under foot. We must, however, observe the circumstances of the case &#8212;
that, while they had a Church there, in which they might worship God in purity,
and have the lawful use of the sacraments, they came into the Church in such a
way as not to renounce the profane fellowship of the wicked. I make this
observation, in order that no one may think that we ought to employ equally
severe measures against those who, while at this day dispersed under the tyranny
of the Pope, pollute themselves with many corrupt rites. These indeed, I
maintain, sin generally in this respect, and they ought, I acknowledge, to be
sharply dealt with, and diligently
urged,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f303</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that they may learn at length to
consecrate themselves wholly to Christ; but I dare not go so far as to reckon
them worthy of excommunication, for their case is
different.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f304</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With such an one not even to take
food.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the first place, we must
ascertain whether he addresses here the whole Church, or merely individuals. I
answer, that this is said, indeed, to individuals, but, at the same time, it is
connected with their discipline in common; for the power of excommunicating is
not allowed to any individual member, but to the entire body. When, therefore,
the Church has excommunicated any one, no believer ought to receive him into
terms of intimacy with him; otherwise the authority of the Church would be
brought into contempt, if each individual were at liberty to admit to his table
those who have been excluded from the table of the Lord. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>partaking of
food</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>here, is meant either living
together, or familiar association in meals. For if, on going into an inn, I see
one who has been excommunicated sitting at table, there is nothing to hinder me
from dining with him; for I have not authority to exclude him. What Paul means
is, that, in so far as it is in our power, we are to shun the society of those
whom the Church has cut off from her communion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Roman antichrist, not content with this severity,
has burst forth into interdicts, prohibiting any one from helping one that has
been excommunicated to food, or fuel, or drink, or any other of the supports of
life.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f305</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now, <i>that </i>is not strictness of
discipline, but tyrannical and barbarous cruelty, that is altogether at variance
with Paul&#8217;s intention. For he means not that he should be <i>counted as an
enemy</i>,<i> but as a brother</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;530315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 3:15;) for in putting this public mark of disgrace upon him, the
intention is, that he may be filled with shame, and brought to repentance. And
with this dreadful cruelty, if God is pleased to permit, do they rage even
against the innocent.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f306</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now, granting that there are sometimes
those who are not undeserving of this punishment, I affirm, on the other hand,
that this kind of interdict</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f307</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is altogether unsuitable to an
ecclesiastical court.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For what have I to do to judge
them that are without</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>There is nothing
to hinder us from judging these also &#8212; nay more, even devils themselves
are not exempt from the judgment of the word which is committed to us. But Paul
is speaking here of the jurisdiction that belongs peculiarly to the Church.
&#8220;The<i> </i>Lord has furnished us with this power, that we may exercise it
upon those who belong to his household. For this chastisement is a part of
discipline which is confined to the Church, and does not extend to strangers. We
do not therefore pronounce upon them their condemnation, because the Lord has
not subjected them to our cognizance and jurisdiction, in so far as that
chastisement and censure are concerned. We are, therefore, constrained to leave
them to the judgment of God.&#8221; It is in this sense that Paul says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God will judge
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>because he allows them to wander
about</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

mother-in-law. For as to those who understand the expression to mean &#8212;
&#8220;Put away <i>evil </i>or <i>wickedness</i>,&#8221;<i> </i>they are refuted
by the Greek<i> </i>words made use of by Paul, the article
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">)
being in the masculine gender, But what if you should view it as referring to
the devil, who, undoubtedly in the person of a wicked and unprincipled

meaning is approved of, Paul shows how important it
is</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

Chrysostom compares the rigor of the law with the mildness of the gospel,
inasmuch as Paul was satisfied with excommunication in case of an offense for
which the law required the punishment of death, but for this there is no just
ground. For Paul is not here addressing judges that are armed with the sword,
but an unarmed multitude</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

by bringing their disputes before the tribunals of the wicked, they by this
means made the gospel contemptible, and exposed it to derision. The <i>second
</i>is, that while Christians ought to endure injuries with patience, they
inflicted injury on others, rather than allow themselves to be subjected to any

disgrace is brought upon the gospel, and the name of Christ is held up as it
were to the scoffings of the ungodly. For the ungodly, at the instigation of
Satan, are always eagerly on the
watch</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f316</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for opportunities of finding occasion of
calumny against the doctrine of godliness. Now believers, when they make them
parties in their disputes, seem as though they did on set purpose furnish them
with a handle for reviling. A <i>second </i>reason may be added &#8212; that we
treat our brethren disdainfully, when we of our own accord subject them to the
decisions of unbelievers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here it may be objected: &#8220;As<i> </i>it
belongs to the office of the magistrate, and as it is peculiarly his province to
administer justice to all, and to decide upon matters in dispute, why should not
even unbelievers, who are in the office of magistrate, have this authority, and,
if they have it, why are we prevented from maintaining our rights before their
tribunals?&#8221; I answer, that Paul does not here condemn those who from
necessity have a cause before unbelieving
judges,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f317</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as when a person is summoned to a court;
but those who, of their own accord, bring their brethren into this situation,
and harass them, as it were, through means of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unbelievers</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>while it is in their power to employ another remedy. It is wrong, therefore,
to institute of one&#8217;s own accord a law-suit against <i>brethren
</i>before<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unbelieving</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>judges. If, on the other hand, you are summoned to a court, there is no harm
in appearing there and maintaining your cause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Know ye not that the
saints.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here we have an argument from
the less to the greater; for Paul, being desirous to show that injury is done to
the Church of God when judgments on matters of dispute connected with earthly
things are carried before unbelievers, as if there were no one in the society of
the godly that was qualified to judge, reasons in this strain: &#8220;Since<i>
</i>God has reckoned the saints worthy of such honor, as to have appointed them
to be judges of the whole world, it is unreasonable that they should be shut out
from judging as to small matters, as persons not qualified for it.&#8221;<i>
</i>Hence it follows, that the Corinthians inflict injury upon themselves, in
resigning into the hands of unbelievers the
honor</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f318</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that has been conferred upon them by
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What is said here as to <i>judging the world

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:7.) But the former signification accords better with the Apostle&#8217;s
design, for unless you take the <i>judging </i>here spoken of in its proper
acceptation, the reasoning will not hold.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But even in this
sense</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f319</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it may seem not to have much weight, for
it is as if one should say&#8217; &#8220;The<i> </i>saints are endowed with
heavenly wisdom, which immeasurably transcends all human doctrines: therefore
they can judge better as to the stars than astrologers.&#8221; Now this no one
will allow, and the ground of objection is obvious &#8212; because piety and
spiritual doctrine do not confer a knowledge of human arts. My answer here is
this, that between expertness in judging and other arts there is this
difference, that while the latter are acquired by acuteness of intellect and by
study, and are learned from
masters,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f320</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the former depends rather on equity and
conscientiousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f321</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;lawyers will judge better and
more confidently than an illiterate Christian: otherwise the knowledge of law is
of no advantage.&#8221; I answer, that their advice is not here excluded, for if
the determination of any obscure question is to be sought from a knowledge of
the laws, the Apostle does not hinder Christians from applying to
lawyers.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f322</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What he finds fault with in the
Corinthians is simply this, that they carry their disputes before unbelieving
judges, as if they had none in the Church that were qualified to pass judgment,
and farther, he shows how much superior is the judgment that God has assigned to
his believing people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The words rendered <i>in you </i>mean here, in my
opinion, <i>among you</i>.<i> </i>For whenever believers meet in one place,
under the auspices of Christ,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f323</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> there is already in their assembly a
sort of image of the future judgment, which will be perfectly brought to light
on the last day. Accordingly Paul says, that the world is judged in the Church,
because <i>there </i>Christ&#8217;s tribunal is erected, from which he exercises
his authority.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f324</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Know ye not that we shall judge angels</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i>
</i>This passage is taken in different ways. Chrysostom states that some
understood it as referring to
priests,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f325</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but this is exceedingly far-fetched.
Others understand it of the angels in heaven, in this sense &#8212; that the
angels are subject to the judgment of God&#8217;s word, and may be judged by us,
if need be, by means of that word, as it is said in the Epistle to the Galatians
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">If an angel from heaven
bring any other gospel, let him be accursed.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians
1:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor does this exposition appear at first view
unsuitable to the thread of Paul&#8217;s discourse; for if all whom God has
enlightened by his word are endowed with such authority, that through means of
that word they judge not only men but angels too, how much more will they be
prepared to judge of small and trivial matters? As, however, Paul speaks here in
the future tense, as referring to the last day, and as his words convey the idea
of an actual judgment, (as the common expression is,) it were preferable, in my
opinion, to understand him as speaking of
apostate</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f326</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> angels. For the argument will be not
less conclusive in this way: &#8220;Devils, who sprang from so illustrious an
origin, and even now, when they have fallen from their high estate, are immortal
creatures, and superior to this corruptible world, shall be judged by us. What
then? Shall those things that are subservient to the belly be exempted from our
judgment?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If you have judgments then as
to things pertaining to this life</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>We
must always keep in view what causes he is treating of; for public trials are
beyond our province, and ought not to be transferred to our disposal; but as to
private matters it is allowable to determine without the cognizance of the
magistrate. As, then, we do not detract in any degree from the authority of the
magistrate by having recourse to arbitration, it is not without good reason that
the Apostle enjoins it upon Christians to refrain from resorting to profane,
that is, unbelieving judges. And lest they should allege that they were deprived
of a better remedy, he directs them to choose out of the Church arbiters, who
may settle causes agreeably and equitably. Farther, lest they should allege that
they have not a sufficient number of qualified persons, he says that the meanest
is competent to discharge this office. There is, therefore, no detracting here
from the dignity of the office of magistrates, when he gives orders that their
office be committed to contemptible persons, for this (as I have already said)
is stated by anticipation, as though he had said: &#8220;Even<i> </i>the lowest
and meanest among you will discharge this office better than those unbelieving
judges to whom you have recourse. So far are you from necessity in this
way.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Chrysostom comes near this interpretation, though he
appends to it something additional; for he is of opinion, that the Apostle meant
to say, that, even though the Corinthians should find no one among themselves
who had sufficient wisdom for judging, they must nevertheless make choice of
some, of whatever stamp they were. Ambrose touches neither heaven nor
earth.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f327</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I think I have faithfully brought out
the Apostle&#8217;s intention &#8212; that the lowest among believers was
preferred by him to unbelievers, as to capacity of judging. There are some that
strike out a quite different meaning, for they understand the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kaqizete
</font><font face="Palatino">to be in the present tense &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You set them to
judge</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those that are least esteemed in
the Church</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>they understand profane
persons.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f328</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This, however, is more ingenious than
solid, for that were a poor designation of
unbelievers.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f329</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Besides, the form of expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if you
have</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>would not suit so well with a
reproof, for the expression would have required rather to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>while you
have,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for that <i>condition </i>takes
away from the force of it. Hence I am the more inclined to think, that a remedy
for the evil is here prescribed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That this statement, however, was taken up wrong by
the ancients, appears from a certain passage in Augustine. For in his book
&#8212; &#8220;On the Work of Monks,&#8221; where he makes mention of his
employments, he declares that among his numerous engagements, the most
disagreeable of all was, that he was under the necessity of devoting a part of
the day to secular affairs, but that he at the same time endured it patiently,
because the Apostle</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f330</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> had imposed upon him this necessity.
From this passage, and from a certain epistle, it appears that the bishops were
accustomed to sit at certain hours to settle disputes, as if the Apostle had
been referring to them here. As, however, matters always become worse, there
sprang from this error, in process of time, that jurisdiction which the
officials of the bishops assume to themselves in money matters. In that ancient
custom there are two things that are deserving of reproof &#8212; that the
bishops were involved in matters that were foreign to their office; and that
they wronged God in making his authority and command a pretext for turning aside
from their proper calling. The evil, however, was in some degree excusable, but
as for the profane custom, which has come to prevail in the Papacy, it were the
height of baseness to excuse or defend it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I speak to your
shame</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The meaning is &#8212; &#8220;If
other considerations do not influence you, let it at least be considered by you,
how disgraceful it is to you that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there is not so much as one among

amicably among
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
&#8212; </i>an<i> </i>honor which you assign to <i>unbelievers</i>.<i> </i>Now
this passage is not inconsistent with the declaration which we met with above,
when he stated that he did not make mention of their faults with the view of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shaming
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:14,) for instead of this, by putting them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shame</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in this manner, he calls them back from
disgrace,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f331</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and shows that he is desirous to promote
their honor. He does not wish them, then, to form so unfavorable an opinion of
their society, as to take away from all their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>an honor which they allow to</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now indeed there is utterly a
fault.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here we have the <i>second
</i>part of the reproof, which contains a general doctrine; for he now reproves
them, not on the ground of their exposing the gospel to derision and disgrace,
but on the ground of their going to law with each other. This, he says, is a
<i>fault</i>.<i> </i>We must, however, observe the propriety of the term which
he employs. For
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">h[tthma</font><font face="Palatino"><i>

down</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f332</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by injuries, and cannot bear anything it
comes afterward to be applied to vices of any kind, as they all arise from
weakness and deficiency in
fortitude.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f333</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What Paul, then, condemns in the
Corinthians is this &#8212; that they harassed one another with law-suits. He
states the reason of it &#8212; that they were not prepared to bear injuries
patiently. And, assuredly, as the Lord commands us
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400544&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:44;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:21) not to be overcome by evils, but on the contrary to overcome injuries by
acts of kindness, it is certain, that those who cannot control themselves so as
to suffer injuries patiently, commit sin by their impatience. If contention in
law-suits among believers is a token of that impatience, it follows that it is
<i>faulty</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this way, however, he seems to discard entirely
judgments as to the affairs of individuals. &#8220;Those are altogether in the
wrong who go to law. Hence it will not be allowable in any one to maintain his
rights by having recourse to a magistrate.&#8221; There are some that answer
this objection in this way &#8212; that the Apostle declares that where there
are law-suits </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there
is</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>utterly a
fault</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>because, of necessity, the one or
the other has a bad cause. They do not, however, escape by this sophistry,
because he says that they are <i>in fault</i>,<i> </i>not merely when they
inflict injury, but also when they do not patiently endure it. For my own part,
my answer is simply this &#8212; having a little before given permission to have
recourse to arbiters, he has in this shown, with sufficient clearness, that,
Christians are not prohibited from prosecuting their rights moderately, and
without any breach of love. Hence we may very readily infer, that his being so
severe was owing to his taking particularly into view the circumstances of the
case. And, undoubtedly, wherever there is frequent recourse to law-suits, or
where the parties contend with each other pertinaciously with rigor of
law,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f334</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it is in that case abundantly plain,
that their minds are immoderately inflamed with wrong dispositions, and are not
prepared for equity and endurance of wrongs, according to the commandment of
Christ. To speak more plainly, the reason why Paul condemns law-suits is, that
we ought to suffer injuries with patience. Let us now see whether any one can
carry on a law-suit without impatience; for if it is so, to go to law will not
be wrong in all cases, but only</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">
ejpi&lt; to&lt; polu&gt;<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8212; for the
most part</i>.<i> </i>I confess, however, that as men&#8217;s manners are
corrupt, impatience, or lack of patience (as they speak) is an almost
inseparable attendant on lawsuits. This, however, does not hinder your
distinguishing between the thing itself and the improper accompaniment. Let us
therefore bear in mind, that Paul does not condemn law-suits on the ground of
its being a wrong thing in itself to maintain a good cause by having recourse to
a magistrate, but because it is almost invariably accompanied with corrupt
dispositions; as, for example, violence, desire of revenge, enmities, obstinacy,
and the like.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is surprising that this question has not been more
carefully handled by ecclesiastical writers. Augustine has bestowed more pains
upon it than the others, and has come nearer the
mark;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f335</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but even he is somewhat obscure, though
there is truth in what he states. Those who aim at greater clearness in their
statements tell us that we must distinguish between public and private revenge;
for while the magistrate&#8217;s vengeance is appointed by God, those who have
recourse to it do not rashly take vengeance at their own hand, but have recourse
to God as an Avenger.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f336</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This, it is true, is said judiciously
and appropriately; but we must go a step farther; for if it be not allowable
even to desire vengeance from God, then, on the same principle, it were not
allowable to have recourse to the magistrate for vengeance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I acknowledge, then, that a Christian man is
altogether prohibited from revenge, so that he must not exercise it, either by
himself, or by means of the magistrate, nor even desire it. If, therefore, a
Christian man wishes to prosecute his rights at law, so as not to offend God, he
must, above all things, take heed that he does not bring into court any desire
of revenge, any corrupt affection of the mind, or anger, or, in fine, any other
poison. In this matter love will be the best
regulator.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f337</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it is objected, that it very rarely happens that
any one carries on a law-suit entirely free and exempt from every corrupt
affection, I acknowledge that it is so, and I say farther, that. it is rare to
find a single instance of an upright litigant; but it is useful for many reasons
to show that the thing is not evil in itself, but is rendered corrupt by abuse:
<i>First</i>,<i> </i>that it may not seem as if God had to no purpose appointed
courts of justice;<i> Secondly</i>,<i> </i>that the pious may know how far their
liberties extend, that they may not take anything in hand against the dictates
of conscience. For it is owing to this that many rush on to open contempt of
God, when they have once begun to transgress those
limits;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f338</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>Thirdly</i>,<i> </i>that they may be
admonished, that they must always keep within bounds, so as not to pollute by
their own misconduct the remedy which the Lord has permitted them to employ;
<i>Lastly</i>,<i> </i>that the audacity of the wicked may be repressed by a pure
and uncorrupted zeal, which could not be effected, if we were not allowed to
subject them to legal punishments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But ye do injury.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">Hence we see for what reason he has inveighed
against them with so much bitterness &#8212; because there prevailed among them
such a base desire of gain, that they did not even refrain from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>injuring</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>one another. He premised a little before, with the view of exposing the
magnitude of the evil, that those are not Christians who know not to endure
injuries. There is, then, an amplification here, founded on a comparison: for if
it is wrong not to <i>bear </i>injuries patiently, how much worse is it to
<i>inflict </i>them?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that your
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here is another aggravation of
the evil; for if those are doubly culpable who defraud strangers, it is
monstrous for <i>brother </i>to be cheated or despoiled by <i>brother</i>.<i>
</i>Now all of us are brethren that call upon <i>one Father in heaven</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:9.) At the same time, if any one acts an unprincipled part towards strangers,
Paul does not palliate the crime; but he teaches that the Corinthians were
utterly blinded in making sacred brotherhood a matter of no
moment.</font><br></div>

</i>he means those who do not, repent of their sins, but obstinately persist in
them, is too manifest to require that it should be stated. The Apostle himself,
too, afterwards expresses this in the words employed by him, when he says that
the Corinthians formerly <i>were such</i>.<i> </i>The wicked, then,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do inherit the kingdom of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>but it is only in the event of
their having been first converted to the Lord in true repentance, and having in
this way ceased to be wicked. For although conversion is not the ground of
pardon, yet we know that none are reconciled to God but those who repent. The
interrogation, however, is emphatic, for it intimates that he states nothing but
what they themselves know, and is matter of common remark among all pious
persons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be not
deceived</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He takes occasion from one
vice to speak of many. I am of opinion, however, that he has pointed out those
vices chiefly which prevailed among the Corinthians. He makes use of three terms
for reproving those lascivious passions which, as all historical accounts
testify, reigned, nay raged, to an extraordinary height in that city. For it was
a city that abounded in wealth, (as has been stated elsewhere.) It was a
celebrated mart, which was frequented by merchants from many nations. Wealth has
luxury as its attendant &#8212; the mother of unchastity and all kinds of
lasciviousness. In addition to this, a nation which was of itself prone to
wantonness, was prompted to it by many other corruptions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The difference between
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fornicators</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>adulterers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is sufficiently well known. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>effeminate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>persons I understand those who, although they do not openly abandon
themselves to impurity, discover, nevertheless, their unchastity by
blandishments of speech, by lightness of gesture and apparel, and other
allurements. The fourth description of crime is the most abominable of all
&#8212; that monstrous pollution which was but too prevalent in
Greece.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He employs three terms in reproving injustice and
injuries. He gives the name of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thieves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

secret artifice. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By

harpies</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

and devour. With the view of giving his discourse a wider range, he afterwards
adds all
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covetous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>persons too. Under the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>drunkards</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>you are to understand him as including those who go to excess in eating. He
more particularly reproves
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>revilers</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>because, in all probability, that city was full of gossip and slanders. In
short, he makes mention chiefly of those vices to which, he saw, that city was
addicted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, that his threatening may have more weight,
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be not
deceived</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>by which expression he
admonishes them not to flatter themselves with a vain hope, as persons are
accustomed, by extenuating their offenses, to inure themselves to contempt of
God. No poison, therefore, is more dangerous than those allurements which
encourage us in our sins. Let us, therefore, shun, not as the songs of the
Sirens,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f341</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but as the deadly bites of Satan, the
talk of profane persons, when turning the judgment of God and reproofs of sins
into matter of jest. Lastly, we must also notice here the propriety of the
word</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue"> klhronomein<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>&#8212; to inherit</i>;<i> </i>which shows
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the kingdom of
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is the <i>inheritance of
sons</i>,<i> </i>and therefore comes to us through the privilege of
adoption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And such were
ye.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some add a term of speciality:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Such were some of
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>as in Greek the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tine&lt;v</font><font face="Palatino">
is added; but I am rather of opinion that the Apostle speaks in a general way. I
consider that term to be redundant, in accordance with the practice of the
Greeks, who frequently make use of it for the sake of ornament, not by way of
restriction. We must not, however, understand him as putting all in one bundle,
so as to attribute all these vices to each of them, but he simply means to
intimate, that no one is altogether free from these vices, until he has been
renewed by the Spirit. For we must hold this, that man&#8217;s nature
universally contains the seed of all evils, but that some vices prevail and
discover themselves more in some than in others, according as the Lord brings
out to view the depravity of the flesh by its fruits.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus Paul, in the first chapter of his Epistle to the
Romans, piles up many different kinds of vices and crimes, which flow from
ignorance of God, and that ingratitude, of which he had shown all unbelievers to
be guilty,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:21-32) &#8212; not that every unbeliever is infected with all these vices, but
that all are liable to them, and no one is exempt from them all. For he who is
not an adulterer, sins in some other way. So also in the third chapter he brings
forward as applicable to the sons of Adam universally those declarations
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">their throat is an open
sepulcher: their feet are swift to shed blood: their tongue is deceitful or
poisonous,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
3:13-15)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8212; not that all are sanguinary and cruel, or
that all are treacherous or revilers; but that, previously to our being formed
anew by God, one is inclined to cruelty, another to treachery, another to
impurity, another to deceit; so that there is no one in whom there does not
exist some trace of the corruption common to all; and we are all of us, to a
man, by an internal and secret affection of the mind, liable to all diseases,
unless in so far as the Lord inwardly restrains them from breaking forth
openly.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f342</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The simple meaning, therefore, is this,
that prior to their being regenerated by grace, some of the Corinthians were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covetous</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>others
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>adulterers</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>others
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>extortioners</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>others
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>effeminate</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>others
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>revilers</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>but now, being made free by Christ, they were such no
longer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The design of the Apostle, however, is to humble
them, by calling to their remembrance their former condition; and, farther, to
stir them up to acknowledge the grace of God towards them. For the greater the
misery is acknowledged to be, from which we have escaped through the
Lord&#8217;s kindness, so much the more does the magnitude of his grace shine
forth. Now the commendation of grace is a
fountain</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f343</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of exhortations, because we ought to
take diligent heed, that we may not make void the kindness of God, which ought
to be so highly esteemed. It is as though he had said: &#8220;It<i> </i>is
enough that God has drawn you out of that mire in which you were formerly
sunk;&#8221;<i> </i>as Peter also says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The time past is
sufficient to have fulfilled the
lusts</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">of the Gentiles.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Peter 4:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But ye are
washed</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He makes use of three terms to
express one and the same thing, that he may the more effectually deter them from
rolling back into the condition from which they had escaped. Hence, though these
three terms have the same general meaning, there is, nevertheless, great force
in their very variety. For there is an implied contrast between
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>washing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and defilement &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctification</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and pollution &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>justification</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and guilt. His meaning is, that having been once
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>justified</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>they must not draw down upon themselves a new condemnation &#8212; that,
having been <i>sanctified</i>,<i> </i>they must not pollute themselves anew
&#8212; that, having been <i>washed</i>,<i> </i>they must not disgrace
themselves with new defilements, but, on the contrary, aim at purity, persevere
in true holiness, and abominate their former pollutions. And hence we infer what
is the purpose for which God reconciles us to himself by the free pardon of our
sins. While I have said that one thing is expressed by three terms, I do not
mean that there is no difference whatever in their import, for, properly
speaking, God justifies us when he frees us from condemnation, by not imputing
to us our sins; he cleanses us, when he blots out the remembrance of our sins.
Thus these two terms differ only in this respect, that the one is simple, while
the other is figurative; for the term <i>washing </i>is metaphorical,
Christ&#8217;s blood being likened to water. On the other hand, he sanctifies by
renewing our depraved nature by his Spirit. Thus sanctification is connected
with regeneration. In this passage, however, the Apostle had simply in view to
extol, with many commendations, the grace of God, which has delivered us from
the bondage of sin, that we may learn from this how much it becomes us to hold
in abhorrence everything that stirs up against us God&#8217;s anger and
vengeance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the name of the Lord
Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> etc</i>.<i> </i>With propriety and
elegance he distinguishes between different offices. For the blood of Christ is
the procuring cause of our cleansing: righteousness and sanctification come to
us through his death and resurrection. But, as the cleansing effected by Christ,
and the attainment of righteousness, are of no avail except to those who have
been made partakers of those blessings by the influence of the Holy Spirit, it
is with propriety that he makes mention of the Spirit in connection with Christ.
Christ, then, is the source of all blessings to us from him we obtain all
things; but Christ himself, with all his blessings, is communicated to us by the
Spirit. For it is by faith that we receive Christ, and have his graces applied
to us. The Author of faith is the Spirit.</font><br><br></div>

the connection of these things,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f345</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as they appear to be somewhat foreign to
the Apostle&#8217;s design. For my own part, without mentioning the different
interpretations, I shall state what, in my opinion, is the most satisfactory. It
is probable, that the Corinthians even up to that time retained much of their
former licentiousness, and had still a savor of the morals of their city. Now
when vices stalk abroad with
impunity,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f346</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> custom is regarded as law, and then
afterwards vain pretexts are sought for by way of excuse; an instance of which
we have in their resorting to the pretext of Christian liberty, so as to make
almost everything allowable for themselves to do. They reveled in excess of
luxury. With this there was, as usual, much pride mixed up. As it was an outward
thing, they did not think that there was any sin involved in it: nay more, it
appears from Paul&#8217;s words that they abused liberty so much as to extend it
even to fornication. Now therefore, most appropriately, after having spoken of
their vices, he discusses those base pretexts by which they flattered themselves
in outward sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, indeed, certain, that he treats here of
outward things, which God has left to the free choice of believers, but by
making use of a term expressive of universality, he either indirectly reproves
their unbridled licentiousness, or extols God&#8217;s boundless liberality,
which is the best directress to us of moderation. For it is a token of excessive
licentiousness, when persons do not, of their own accord, restrict themselves,
and set bounds to themselves, amidst such manifold abundance. And in the
<i>first </i>place, he limits
liberty</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f347</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by two exceptions; and
<i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>he warns them, that it does not by any means extend to
fornication. These words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All

understood as spoken in name of the Corinthians,

ajnqupofora&lt;n,</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>(by anticipation,) as
though he had said, I am aware of the reply which you are accustomed to make,
when desirous to avoid reproof for outward vices. You pretend that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all things are

limitation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But all things are not
expedient</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here we have the <i>first
</i>exception, by which he restricts the use of liberty &#8212; that they must
not abandon themselves to licentiousness, because respect must be had to
edification.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f348</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The meaning is, &#8220;It<i> </i>is not
enough that this or that is allowed us, to be made use of indiscriminately; for
we must consider what is profitable to our brethren, whose edification it
becomes us to study. For as he will afterwards point out at greater length,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461023&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:23, 24,) and as he has already shown in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:13, etc., every one has liberty
inwardly</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

edification.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will not be brought under the
power of anything</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here we have a
<i>second </i>restriction &#8212; that we are constituted lords of all things,
in such a way, that we ought not to bring ourselves under bondage to anything;
as those do who cannot control their appetites. For I understand the
word</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue"> tinov
</font><font face="Palatino">(any) to be in the neuter gender, and I take it as
referring, not to persons, but to things, so that the meaning is this:
&#8220;We<i> </i>are lords of all things; only we must not abuse that lordship
in such a way as to drag out a most miserable bondage, being, through
intemperance and inordinate lusts, under subjection to outward things, which
ought to be under subjection to us.&#8221; And certainly, the excessive
moroseness of those who grudge to yield up anything for the sake of their
brethren, has this effect, that they unadvisedly put halters of necessity around
their own necks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>

things indifferent; for there can be no doubt that this was done, because it was
very generally looked upon as a lawful thing. Hence Paul says now, There is a
difference between

contrary or opposite, inasmuch as it is consecrated to Christ, and it is
impossible that Christ should be conjoined with fornication. What he<i>
</i>adds<i> &#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the
Lord for the body</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>is not without

shows from Christ&#8217;s condition how unseemly fornication is for a Christian
man; for Christ having been <i>received </i>into the heavenly glow, what has he
in common with the pollutions of this world? <i>Two </i>things, however, <i>are
</i>contained in these words. The <i>first </i>is, that it is unseemly and
unlawful, that our body, which is consecrated to Christ, should be profaned by
fornication, inasmuch as Christ himself has been raised up from the dead, that
he might enter on the possession of the heavenly glory. The <i>second </i>is,
that it is a base thing to prostitute our

that he speaks here of the <i>last </i>resurrection only, while in that passage
he speaks of the <i>first </i>also, or in other words, of the grace of the Holy
Spirit, by which we are fashioned again to a new life. As, however, the

For that expression, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the body is
for the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>might, owing to its
brevity, be somewhat obscure. Hence he says, as if with the view of explaining
it, that Christ is joined with us and we with him in such a way, that we become
one body with him. Accordingly, if I have connection with an harlot, I tear
Christ in pieces, so far as it is in my power to do so; for it is impossible for

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Know ye not that he that is

fully the greatness of the injury that is done to Christ by the man that has

design the quotation which he subjoins from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010224&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
2:24. For if he quotes it to prove that two persons who commit fornication
together become </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he turns it aside from its true
meaning to what is quite foreign to it. For Moses speaks there not of a base and
prohibited cohabitation of a man and a woman, but of the marriage connection
which God blesses. For he shows that that bond is so close and indissoluble,
that it surpasses the relationship which subsists between a father and a son,
which, assuredly, can have no reference to fornication. This consideration has
led me sometimes to think, that this quotation is not brought forward to confirm
the immediately preceding statement, but one that is more remote, in this way
&#8212; &#8220;Moses says, that by the marriage connection husband and wife
become </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>but <i>he that is jointed to the
Lord </i>becomes not merely one flesh, but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one

him.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f357</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">And in this
way the whole of this passage would tend to magnify the efficacy and dignity of
the spiritual marriage which subsists between us and Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If, however, any one does not altogether approve of
this exposition, as being rather forced, I shall bring forward another. For as
fornication is the corruption of a divine institution, it has some resemblance
to it; and what is affirmed respecting the former, may to some extent be applied
to the latter; not that it may be honored with the praises due to the
former,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f358</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but for the purpose of expressing the
more fully the heinousness of the sin. The expression, therefore, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they two become one
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>is applicable in the true and
proper sense to married persons only; but it is applied to fornicators, who are
joined in a polluted and impure fellowship, meaning that contagion passes from
the one to the other.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f359</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For there is no absurdity in saying that
fornication bears some resemblance to the sacred connection of marriage, as
being a corruption of it, as I have said; but the former has a curse upon it,
and the other a blessing. Such is the correspondence between things that are
contrasted in an antithesis. At the same time, I would prefer to understand it,
in the first instance, of marriage, and then, in an improper
sense,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f360</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of fornication, in this way &#8212;
&#8220;God pronounces husband and wife to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>in order that neither of them may
have connection with another flesh; so that the adulterer and adulteress do,
also, become </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and involve themselves in an
accursed connection. And certainly this is more simple, and agrees better with
the context.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that is joined to the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He has added this to show that our
connection with Christ is closer than that of a husband and wife, and that the
former, accordingly, must be greatly preferred before the latter, so that it
must be maintained with the utmost chastity and fidelity. For if he who is
joined to a woman in marriage ought not to have illicit connection with an
harlot, much more heinous were this crime in believers, who are not merely
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>with Christ, but also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one

conduct, he now shows how much we ought to abhor
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fornication</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>setting before us the enormity of its wickedness and baseness. Now he shows
its greatness by comparison &#8212; that this sin alone, of all sins, puts a
brand of disgrace upon the body. The body, it is true, is defiled also by theft,
and murder, and drunkenness, in accordance with those statements<i>
&#8212;</i></font><br></div>

ingenious than solid. Besides, they do not escape even in this way, because that
same thing, too, might be affirmed of idolatry equally with fornication. For he
who prostrates himself before an idol, sins against connection with Christ.
Hence I explain it in this way, that he does not altogether deny that there are
other vices, in like manner, by which our body is dishonored and disgraced, but
that his meaning is simply this &#8212; that defilement does not attach itself
to our body from other vices in the same

</i>that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Lord has bought us

emphasis implied in the term <i>temple</i>;<i> </i>for as the Spirit of God
cannot take up his abode in a place that is profane, we do not give him a
habitation otherwise than by consecrating ourselves to him as <i>temples</i>.<i>
</i>It is a great honor that God confers upon us when he <i>desires to dwell

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye are not your

</i>argument &#8212; that we are not at our own disposal, that we should live
according to our own pleasure. He proves this from the fact that the Lord has
purchased us for himself, by paying the price of our redemption. There is a
similar statement in

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">To this end Christ died

<div><font face="Palatino">Now the word rendered <i>price </i>may be taken in
two ways; either simply, as we commonly say of anything that it has cost a
price,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f364</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> when we mean that it has not been got
for nothing; or, as used instead of the
adverb</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue"> timi&gt;wv<b>
</b></font><font face="Palatino"><i>at a dear rate</i>,<i> </i>as we are
accustomed to say of things that have cost us much. This latter view pleases me
better. In the same way Peter says,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The sum is
this,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

that the Corinthians took a liberty to themselves in outward things, that it was
necessary to restrain and bridle. The reproof therefore is this he allows that
the body is subject to God no less than the soul, and that accordingly it is
reasonable that both be devoted to his glory. &#8220;As it is befitting that the
mind of a believer should be pure, so there must be a corresponding outward
profession also before men, inasmuch as the power of both is in the hands of
God, who has redeemed both.&#8221; With the same view he declared a little ago,
that not only our souls but our bodies also are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>temples of the Holy
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that we may not think that we
discharge our duty to him aright, if we do not devote ourselves wholly and
entirely to his service, that he may by his word regulate even the outward
actions of our

<div><font face="Palatino">As he had spoken of fornication, he now appropriately
proceeds to speak of marriage which is the remedy for avoiding fornication. Now
it appears, that, notwithstanding the greatly scattered state of the Corinthian
Church, they still retained some respect for Paul, inasmuch as they consulted
him on doubtful points. What their questions had been is uncertain, except in so
far as we may gather them from his reply. This, however, is perfectly well
known, that immediately after the first rise of the Church, there crept into it,
through Satan&#8217;s artifice, a superstition of such a kind, that a large
proportion of them, through a foolish admiration of
celibacy,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f367</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> despised the sacred connection of
marriage; nay more, many regarded it with abhorrence, as a profane thing. This
contagion had perhaps spread itself among the Corinthians also; or at least
there were idly-disposed spirits, who, by immoderately extolling celibacy,
endeavored to alienate the minds of the pious from marriage. At the same time,
as the Apostle treats of many other subjects, he intimates that he had been
consulted on a variety of points. What is chiefly of importance is, that we
listen to his doctrine as to each of them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is good for a
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The answer consists of two parts. In the
<i>first</i>, he teaches that it were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good</i></font><font face="Palatino">
for every one to abstain from connection with a woman, provided it was in his
power to do so. In the <i>second</i>, he subjoins a correction to this effect,
that as many cannot do this, in consequence of the weakness of their flesh,
these persons must not neglect the remedy which they have in their power, as
appointed for them by the Lord. Now we must observe what he means by the word
good, when he declares that it is good to abstain from marriage, that we may not
conclude, on the other hand, that the marriage connection is therefore evil
&#8212; a mistake which Jerome has fallen into, not so much from ignorance, in
my opinion, as from the heat of controversy. For though that great man was
endowed with distinguished excellences, he labored, at the same time, under one
serious defect, that when disputing he allowed himself to be hurried away into
great extravagancies, so that he did not keep within the bounds of truth. The
inference then which he draws is this &#8220;It<i> </i>is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good not to touch a
woman</i></font><font face="Palatino">:<i> </i>it is therefore <i>wrong </i>to
do so.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f368</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Paul, however, does not make use of the
word <i>good </i>here in such a signification as to be opposed to what is evil
or vicious, but simply points out what is expedient on account of there being so
many troubles, vexations, and anxieties that are incident to married persons.
Besides, we must always keep in view the limitation which he subjoins. Nothing
farther, therefore, can be elicited from Paul&#8217;s words than this &#8212;
that it is indeed expedient and profitable for a man not to be bound to a wife,
provided he can do otherwise. Let us explain this by a comparison. Should any
one speak in this way: &#8220;It<i> </i>were <i>good </i>for a man not to eat,
or to drink, or to sleep&#8221; &#8212; he would not thereby condemn eating, or
drinking, or sleeping, as things that were wrong &#8212; but as the time that is
devoted to these things is just
so</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f369</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> much taken from the soul, his meaning
would be, that we would be happier if we could be free from these hindrances,
and devote ourselves wholly</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f370</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to meditation on heavenly things. Hence,
as there are in married life many impediments which keep a man entangled, it
were on that account <i>good </i>not to be connected in
marriage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here another question presents itself, for these
words of Paul have some appearance of inconsistency with the words of the Lord,
in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
2:18, where he declares, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it
is not good for a man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to be without a
wife. What the Lord there pronounces to be <i>evil </i>Paul here declares to be
<i>good</i>.<i> </i>I answer, that in so far as a wife is <i>a help </i>to<i>
</i>her husband, so as to make his life happy, that is in accordance with
God&#8217;s institution; for in the beginning God appointed it so, that the man
without the woman was, as it were, but half a man, and felt himself destitute of
special and necessary assistance, and the wife is, as it were, the completing of
the man. Sin afterwards came in to corrupt that institution of God; for in place
of so great a blessing there has been substituted a grievous punishment, so that
marriage is the source and occasion of many miseries. Hence, whatever evil or
inconvenience there is in marriage, that arises from the corruption of the
divine institution. Now, although there are in the meantime some remains still
existing of the original blessing, so that a single life is often much more
unhappy than the married life; yet, as married persons are involved in many
inconveniences, it is with good reason that Paul teaches that it would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good for a
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to abstain. In this way, there is no
concealment of the troubles that are attendant upon marriage; and yet, in the
meantime, there is no countenance given to those profane jests which are
commonly in vogue with a view to bring it into discredit, such as the following:
that a wife is a necessary evil, and that a wife is one of the greatest evils.
For such sayings as these have come from Satan&#8217;s workshop, and have a
direct tendency to brand with disgrace God&#8217;s holy institution; and
farther, to lead men to regard marriage with abhorrence, as though it were a
deadly evil and pest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum is this, that we must remember to distinguish
between the pure ordinance of God and the punishment of sin, which came in
subsequently. According to this distinction, it was in the beginning
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good for a
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>without any exception, to be joined
to a wife, and even yet, it is <i>good </i>in such a way, that there is in the
meantime a mixture of bitter and sweet, in consequence of the curse of God. To
those, however, who have not the gift of continency, it is a necessary and
salutary remedy in accordance with what follows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But to avoid
fornication</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He now commands, that those
who are liable to the vice of incontinency should have recourse to the remedy.
For though it may seem that the statement is universal, it ought, nevertheless,
to be restricted to those who feel themselves urged by necessity. As to this,
every one must judge for himself. Whatever difficulty, therefore, is perceived
to be in marriage, let all that cannot resist the promptings of their flesh,
know that this commandment has been enjoined upon them by the Lord. But it is
asked &#8212; &#8220;Is this the only reason for entering into matrimony, that
we may cure incontinency?&#8221;<i> </i>I answer, that this is not Paul&#8217;s
meaning; for as for those that have the gift of abstinence from marriage, he
leaves <i>them </i>at liberty,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f371</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> while he commands others to provide
against their infirmity by marrying. The sum is this &#8212; that the question
is not as to the reasons for which marriage has been instituted, but as to the
persons for whom it is necessary. For if we look to the first institution, it
could not be a remedy for a disease which had as yet no existence, but was
appointed for begetting offspring; but after the fall, this second purpose was
added.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The husband to the
wife.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now prescribes the rules to be
observed in the marriage connection, or he teaches what is the duty of husband
and wife. And in the first place he lays down a general doctrine as to mutual
benevolence &#8212; that the husband love his wife, and the wife her husband;
for as to the interpretation which others give to the expression <i>due
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>benevolence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
&#8212; </i>duty<i> </i>of marriage &#8212; I do not know how far it is
suitable. The reason that inclines them to this view is, that it is immediately
added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The husband has not power
of his own body</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>etc.; but it will suit
better to regard that as an inference drawn from the preceding statement.
Husband and wife, therefore, are bound to mutual benevolence: hence it follows,
that they have, neither the one nor the
other,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the power of their own
body.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But it may be asked, why the
Apostle here puts them upon a level, instead of requiring from the wife
obedience and subjection. I answer, that it was not his intention to treat of
all their duties, but simply of the mutual obligation as to the marriage bed. In
other things, therefore, husband and wife differ, both as to duty and as to
authority in this respect the condition of both is alike &#8212; as to the
maintaining of conjugal fidelity. For this reason, also, polygamy
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tolugami&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>is again condemned; for if this is an invariable condition of marriage, that
the husband surrenders </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the power
of his own body,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and gives it up to his
wife, how could he afterwards connect himself with another, as if he were
free?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Defraud ye not one the
other</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Profane persons might think that
Paul does not act with sufficient modesty in discoursing in this manner as to
the intercourse of a husband with his wife; or at least that it was unbecoming
the dignity of an Apostle. If, however, we consider the reasons that influenced
him, we shall find that he was under the necessity of speaking of these things.
In the first place, he knew how much influence a false appearance of sanctity
has in beguiling devout minds, as we ourselves know by experience. For Satan
dazzles us with an appearance of what is right, that we may be led to imagine
that we are polluted by intercourse with our wives, and leaving off our calling,
may think of pursuing another kind of life. Farther, he knew how prone every one
is to self-love, and devoted to his own gratification. From this it comes, that
a husband, having had his desire gratified, treats his wife not merely with
neglect, but even with disdain; and there are few that do not sometimes feel
this disdain of their wives creep<i> </i>in upon them. It is for these reasons
that he treats so carefully of the mutual obligations of the married life.
&#8220;If<i> </i>at any time it comes into the minds of married persons to
desire an unmarried life, as though it were holier, or if they are tempted by
irregular desires,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f372</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> let them bear in mind that they are
bound by a mutual connection.&#8221; The husband is but the one half of his
body, and so is it, also, as to the wife. Hence they have not liberty of choice,
but must on the contrary restrain themselves with such thoughts as these:
&#8220;Because the one needed help from the other, the Lord has connected us
together, that we may assist each other.&#8221; Let each then be helpful to each
other&#8217;s necessity, and neither of them act as if at his or her own
disposal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unless by mutual
consent</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He requires
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mutual
consent,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in the first place, because the
question is not as to the continency of one merely, but of two; and besides, he
immediately adds two other exceptions. The <i>first </i>is, that it be done only
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for a
time,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as perpetual continency is not in
their power, lest if they should venture to make an attempt beyond their power,
they might fall before Satan&#8217;s stratagems. The <i>second </i>is, that they
do not abstain from conjugal intercourse, on the ground of that abstinence being
in itself a good and holy work, or as if it were the worship of
God,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f373</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but that they may be at leisure for
better employments. Now though Paul had taken such pains in guarding this, yet
Satan prevailed so far as to
drive</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f374</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> many to unlawful divorce, from a corrupt
desire for an unmarried life. The husband, leaving his wife, fled to the desert,
that he might please God better by living as a monk. The wife, against her
husband&#8217;s will, put on the veil &#8212; the badge of celibacy. Meanwhile
they did not consider that by violating their marriage engagement they broke the
Lord&#8217;s covenant, and by loosing the marriage tie, they cast off the
Lord&#8217;s yoke.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This vice,<i> </i>it is true, was corrected in some
measure by the ancient canons; for they prohibited a husband from leaving his
wife against her will, on pretense of continency; and in like manner a wife from
refusing to her husband the use of her body. In this, however, they erred
&#8212; that they permitted both together to live in perpetual celibacy, as if
it were lawful for men to decree anything that is contrary to the Spirit of God.
Paul expressly commands, that married persons do not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>defraud each other, except for a
time</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The bishops give permission to
leave off the use of marriage for ever. Who does not see the manifest
contrariety? Let no one, therefore, be surprised, that we make free to dissent
on this point from the ancients, who, it is evident, deviated from the clear
statements of the word of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye may have leisure for
fasting and prayer.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We must take notice,
that Paul does not speak here of every kind of<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fasting</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>or every kind of prayer. That sobriety and temperance, which ought to be
habitual on the part of Christians, is a kind
of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> fasting.
Prayer</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>too, ought to be not merely
daily, but even continual. He speaks, however, of that kind of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fasting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>which is a solemn expression of penitence, with the view of deprecating
God&#8217;s anger, or by which believers prepare themselves for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prayer</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>when they are undertaking some important business. In like manner, the kind
of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prayer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>that he speaks of is such as requires a more intense affection of the
mind.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f375</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For it sometimes happens, that. we
require (leaving off everything else) to<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fast</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pray</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i>
</i>as when any calamity is impending, if it appears to be a visitation of
God&#8217;s wrath; or when we are involved in any difficult matter, or when we
have something of great importance to do, as, for example, the ordaining of
pastors.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f376</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Now it is with propriety that the Apostle
connects these two things, because
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fasting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is a preparation for <i>prayer</i>,<i> </i>as Christ also connects them,
when he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">This kind of devils goeth
not out but by fasting and prayer.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401721&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
17:21.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, therefore, Paul says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that ye may be at
leisure</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>the meaning is, that having
freed ourselves from all impediments, we may apply ourselves to this one thing.
Now if any one objects, that the use of the marriage bed is an evil thing,
inasmuch as it hinders
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prayer</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>the answer is easy &#8212; that it is not on that account worse than meat
and drink, by which
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fasting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is hindered. But it is the part of believers to consider wisely <i>when
</i>it is time to eat and drink, and <i>when </i>to fast. It is also the part of
the same wisdom to have intercourse with their wives when it is seasonable, and
to refrain from that intercourse when they are called to be engaged
otherwise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And come together again, that Satan
tempt you not</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here he brings forward
the reason, from ignorance of which the ancients have fallen into error, in
rashly and inconsiderately approving of a vow of perpetual continency. For they
reasoned in this manner: &#8220;If<i> </i>it is good for married persons
sometimes to impose upon themselves <i>for a time </i>a voluntary continency
with </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mutual
consent</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>then, if they impose this upon
themselves for ever, it will be so much the better.&#8221; But then, they did
not consider how much danger was involved in this, for we give Satan an occasion
for oppressing us, when we attempt anything beyond the measure of our
weakness.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f377</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;But<i> </i>we must resist
Satan.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f378</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What if arms and shield be wanting?
&#8220;They must be sought from the Lord,&#8221; say they. But in vain shall we
beseech the Lord to assist us in a rash attempt. We must, therefore, carefully
observe the clause<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for your
incontinency</i></font><font face="Palatino">:<i> </i>for we are exposed to
Satan&#8217;s temptations in consequence of the infirmity of our flesh. If we
wish to shut them out, and keep them back, it becomes us to oppose them by the
remedy, with which the Lord has furnished us. Those, therefore, act a rash part,
who give up the use of the marriage bed. It is as if they had made an agreement
with God as to perpetual
strength.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

taking their stand upon a precept of the kind that he had prescribed, loosen
unduly the restraints of lust,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f380</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he adds a limitation &#8212; that he had
written these things on account of their infirmity &#8212; that they may bear in
mind that marriage is a remedy for unchastity, lest they should inordinately
abuse the advantage of it, so as to gratify their desire by every means; nay
more, without measure or modesty. He has it also in view to meet the cavils of
the wicked, that no one might have it in his power to object in this way:
&#8220;What!<i> </i>are you afraid that husbands and wives will not of their own
accord be sufficiently inclined to carnal delight that you prompt them to
it?&#8221; For even the Papists, those little
saints,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f381</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are offended with this doctrine, and
would gladly have a contest with Paul, on the ground of his keeping married
persons in mutual cohabitation, and not allowing them to turn aside to a life of
celibacy. He assigns, then, a reason for his doctrine, and declares, that he had
not recommended connubial intercourse to married persons with the view of
alluring them to delight, or as though he took pleasure in commanding it, but
had considered what was required by the infirmity of those that he is
addressing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Foolish
zealots</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f382</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for celibacy make a wrong use of both
clauses of this verse; for as Paul says that he speaks
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by
permission</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>they infer from this, that
there is therefore something wrong in conjugal intercourse, for where there is
need of pardon,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f383</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> there must be sin. Farther, from his
saying that he speaks </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not by
commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>they infer, that it is,
therefore, a holier thing to leave off the use of marriage and turn to celibacy.
To <i>the former</i>,<i> </i>I answer, that as there is, I acknowledge, an
inordinate excess in all human affections, I do not deny that there is as to
this matter an irregularity,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajtaxi&gt;a,</font><font face="Palatino">)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f384</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which, I allow, is
vicious.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f385</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">Nay more,
this affection, I allow, is beyond others violent, and next to brutish. But, on
the other hand, I also maintain, that whatever there is of vice or baseness, is
so covered over by the honorableness of marriage, that it ceases to be a vice,
or at least is not reckoned a fault by God, as Augustine elegantly discourses in
his book &#8220;On the advantage of Marriage,&#8221; and frequently in other
places. You may then take it briefly
thus:</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f386</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> conjugal intercourse is a thing that is
pure, honorable and holy, because it is a pure institution of God: the
immoderate desire with which persons burn is a fault arising from the corruption
of nature; but in the case of believers marriage is a veil, by which that fault
is covered over, so that it no longer appears in the sight of God. To the
<i>second </i>I answer: as the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is properly applied to those things which relate to the duties of
righteousness, and things in themselves pleasing to God, Paul on this account
says that he does not speak <i>by
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>He has, however, sufficiently shown previously, that the remedy, which he
had enjoined, must necessarily be made use of.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I should wish, that
all.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is connected with the
exposition of the foregoing statement; for he does not fail to intimate, what is
the more convenient way, but he wishes every one to consider what has been given
him.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f387</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Why, then, has he, a little before,
spoken </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not by way of
commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>It is for this reason, that
he does not willingly constrain them to marry, but rather desires that they may
be free from that necessity. As this, however, is not free to all, he has
respect to infirmity. If this passage had been duly weighed, that perverse
superstition connected with the desire of celibacy, which is the root and cause
of great evils, would never have gained a footing in the world. Paul here
expressly declares, that every one has not a free choice in this matter, because
virginity is a special gift, that is not conferred upon all indiscriminately.
Nor does he teach any other doctrine than what Christ himself does, when he
says, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">all men are not capable
of receiving this
saying.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
19:11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul, therefore, is here an interpreter of our
Lord&#8217;s words, when he says that this power has not been given to all
&#8212; that of living without marriage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, in the meantime, has been done? Every one,
without having any regard to his <i>power</i>,<i> </i>has, according to his
<i>liking</i>,<i> </i>vowed perpetual continency. Nor has the error as to this
matter been confined to the common people and illiterate persons; for even the
most eminent doctors, devoting themselves unreservedly to the commendation of
virginity, and forgetting human infirmity, have overlooked this admonition of
Paul &#8212; nay rather, of Christ himself. Jerome, blinded by a zeal, I know
not of what sort, does not simply fall, but rushes headlong, into false views.
Virginity, I acknowledge, is an excellent gift; but keep it in view, that it is
a <i>gift</i>.<i> </i>Learn, besides, from the mouth of Christ and of Paul, that
it is not common to all, but is given only to a few. Guard, accordingly, against
rashly devoting what is not in your own power, and what you will not obtain as a
gift, if forgetful of your calling you aspire beyond your
limits.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time the ancients erred even in their
estimate of virginity, for they extol it as if it were the most excellent of all
virtues, and wish it to be regarded as the worship of
God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f388</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Even in this there is a dangerous error;
and now follows another &#8212; that, after celibacy had begun to be so much
esteemed, many, vying with each other, rashly rowed perpetual continency, while
scarcely the hundredth part of them were endowed with the power and gift. Hence,
too, <i>a third </i>sprung up &#8212; that the ministers of the Church were
forbidden to enter into marriage, as a kind of life unbecoming the holiness of
their order.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f389</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As for those who, despising marriage,
rashly vowed perpetual continency, God punished their presumption, first, by the
secret flames of lust;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f390</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and then afterwards, by horrible acts of
filthiness. The ministers of the Churches being prohibited from lawful marriage,
the consequence of this tyranny was, that the Church was robbed of very many
good and faithful ministers; for pious and prudent men would not ensnare
themselves in this way. At length, after a long course of time, lusts, which had
been previously kept under, gave forth their abominable odor. It was reckoned a
small matter for those, in whom it would have been a capital crime to have a
wife, to maintain with impunity concubines, that is, prostitutes; but no house
was safe from the impurities of the priests. Even that was reckoned a small
matter; for there sprung up monstrous enormities, which it were better to bury
in eternal oblivion than to make mention of them by way of
example.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I say, then, to the
unmarried.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This depends on what goes
before, and is a sort of inference from it. He had said that the gifts of God
are variously distributed &#8212; that continency is not in the power of all,
and that those who have it not ought to have recourse to the remedy. He now
directs his discourse to <i>virgins</i>,<i> </i>to all that are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unmarried</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>widows</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and he allows that an unmarried life ought to be desired by them, provided
they have the power; but that regard must always be had by each individual to
the power that he possesses. The sum is this, that an unmarried life has many
advantages, and that these are not to be despised, provided every one measures
himself according to his own size and
measure.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f392</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence,<i> </i>though virginity should be
extolled even to the third heavens, this, at the same time, always remains true
&#8212; that it does not suit all, but only those who have a special <i>gift
</i>from God. For as to the objection that is brought forward by Papists &#8212;
that in baptism, also, we promise to God purity of life, which it is not in our
power to perform, the answer is easy &#8212; that in that we promise nothing but
what God requires from all his people, but that continency is a special gift,
which God has withheld from many. Hence those who make a vow of continency, act
precisely as if any unlearned and illiterate person were to set himself off as a
prophet, or teacher, or interpreter of languages.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also notice carefully the word
<i>continue</i>;<i> </i>for it is possible for a person to live chastely in a
state of celibacy for a time, but there must be in this matter no determination
made for tomorrow. Isaac was unmarried until he was thirty years of age, and
passed in chastity those years in which the heats of irregular desire are most
violent; yet afterwards he is called to enter into the married life. In Jacob we
have a still more remarkable instance. Hence the Apostle would wish those who
are at present practicing chastity, to continue in it and persevere; but as they
have no security for the continuance<i> </i>of the gift, he exhorts all to
consider carefully what has been <i>given </i>them. This passage, however, shows
that the Apostle was at that time unmarried; for as to the inference drawn by
Erasmus, that he was married, because he makes mention of himself in connection
with married persons, it is frivolous and silly; for we might, on the same
principle, infer that he was a
widower,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f393</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because he speaks of himself in
connection with widows.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f394</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now the words intimate, that at that
time he was unmarried; for I do not give any countenance to the conjecture, that
he had put away his wife somewhere, and had of his own accord abandoned the use
of the marriage bed. For where, in that case, had been the
injunction,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f395</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>Come together again without
delay</i>?<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:5.) It would certainly be an absurdity to say, that he did not
obey his own precepts, and did not observe the law which he imposed upon others.
It is, however, a singular token of modesty, that, while he is himself endowed
with the gift of <i>continency</i>,<i> </i>he does not require others to bind
themselves to his rule, but allows them that remedy for infirmity which he
dispenses with. Let us, then, imitate his example, so that if we excel in any
particular gift, we do not rigorously insist upon it on the part of others, who
have not as yet reached that height.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if they cannot
contain</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>While he advises to abstain
from marriage, he always speaks conditionally<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if it can be done, if there
is ability</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>but where the infirmity of
the flesh does not allow of that liberty, he expressly enjoins marriage as a
thing that is not in the least doubtful. For this is said
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by way of
commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that no one may look upon
it as mere advice. Nor is it merely fornicators that he restrains, but those
also who are defiled in the sight of God by inward lust; and assuredly he that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cannot
contain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>tempts God, if he neglects the
remedy of marriage. This matter requires &#8212; not advice, but strict
prohibition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For it is
better</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>There is not strictly a
comparison here, inasmuch as lawful <i>marriage is honorable in all
things</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
13:4,) but, on the other hand, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
burn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is a thing that is exceedingly
wrong. The Apostle, however, has made use of a customary form of expression,
though not strictly accurate, as we commonly say: &#8220;It is better to
renounce this world that we may, along with Christ, enjoy the inheritance of the
heavenly kingdom, than to perish miserably in carnal delights.&#8221; I mention
this, because Jerome constructs upon this passage a childish
sophism</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f396</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; that marriage is good, inasmuch
as it is not so great an evil as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
burn</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>I would say, if it were a matter
of sport, that he foolishly amuses himself, but in a matter so weighty and
serious, it is an impious scoff, unworthy of a man of judgment. Let it then be
understood, that marriage is a good and salutary remedy, because
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
burn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is a most base abomination in the
sight of God. We must, however, define what is meant by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burning</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i>
</i>for many are stung with fleshly desires, who, nevertheless, do not require
forthwith to have recourse to marriage. And to retain Paul&#8217;s metaphor, it
is one thing </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
burn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and another to feel heat. Hence
what Paul here calls
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burning</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>is not a mere slight feeling, but a boiling with lust, so that you cannot
resist. As, however, some flatter themselves in vain, by imagining that they are
entirely free from blame, if they do not yield assent to impure desire, observe
that there are three successive steps of temptation. For in some cases the
assaults of impure desire have so much power that the will is overcome: <i>that
</i>is the worst kind of <i>burning</i>,<i> </i>when the heart is inflamed with
lust. In some instances, while we are stung with the darts of the flesh, it is
in such a manner that we make a stout resistance, and do not allow ourselves to
be divested of the true love of chastity, but on the contrary, abhor all base
and filthy affections.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence all must be admonished, but especially the
young, that whenever they are assailed by their fleshly inclinations, they
should place the fear of God in opposition to a temptation of this sort, cut off
all inlets to unchaste thoughts, entreat the Lord to give them strength to
resist, and set themselves with all their might to extinguish the flames of
lust. If they succeed in this struggle, let them render thanks unto the Lord,
for where shall we find the man who does not experience some molestation from
his flesh? but if we bridle its violence, before it has acquired the mastery, it
is well. For we do not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burn</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>though we should feel a disagreeable heat &#8212; not that there is nothing
wrong in that feeling of heat, but acknowledging before the Lord, with humility
and sighing,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f397</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> our weakness, we are meanwhile,
nevertheless, of good courage. To sum up all, so long as we come off victorious
in the conflict, through the Lord&#8217;s grace, and Satan&#8217;s darts do not
make their way within, but are valiantly repelled by us, let us not become weary
of the conflict.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is an intermediate kind of
temptation</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f398</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; when a man does not indeed admit
impure desire with the full assent of his mind, but at the same time is inflamed
with a blind impetuosity, and is harassed in such a manner that he cannot with
peace of conscience call upon God. A temptation, then, of such a kind as hinders
one from calling upon God in purity, and disturbs peace of conscience, is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burning</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>such as cannot be extinguished except by marriage. We now see, that in
deliberating as to this, one must not merely consider whether he can preserve
his body free from pollution: the mind also must be looked to, as we shall see
in a little.</font><br></div>

condition of marriage &#8212; its being an indissoluble tie. Accordingly, he

and were not punished among the Jews by the law of Moses.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let

together by an indissoluble bond. It is surprising, however, that he does not
make an exception, at least in case of adultery; for it is not likely that he
designed to curtail in anything the doctrine of Christ. To me it appears clear,
that the reason why he has made no mention of this
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f399</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is, that as he is discoursing of these
things only in passing, he chose rather to send back the Corinthians to the
Lord&#8217;s permission or prohibition, than to go over everything in detail.
For when persons intend to teach anything in short compass, they content
themselves with a general statement. Exceptions are reserved for a minutcr and
more extended and particular discussion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as to what he subjoins &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not I, but the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; he<i> </i>intimates by this
correction, that what he teaches here is taken from the law of God. For other
things that he taught he had also from the revelation of the Spirit; but he
declares that God is the author of this, in respect of its being expressly taken
from the law of God. If you inquire as to the particular passage, you will
nowhere find it in so many words; but as Moses in the beginning testifies, that
the connection between a husband and wife is so sacred, that for the sake of
it</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">a man ought to leave his
father and mother.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010224&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
2:24.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is easy to gather from this, how inviolable a
connection it is. For by right of nature a son is bound to his father and
mother, and cannot shake off that yoke.<i> </i>As the connection of marriage is
preferred to that bond, much less ought <i>it </i>to be
dissolved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if she
depart</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>That this is not to be
understood of those who have been put away for adultery, is evident from the
punishment that followed in that case; for it was a capital crime even by the
Roman laws, and almost by the common law of nations. But as husbands frequently
divorced their wives, either because their manners were not congenial, or
because their personal appearance did not please them, or because<i> </i>of some
offense;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f400</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and as wives, too, sometimes deserted
their husbands on account of their cruelty, or excessively harsh and
dishonorable treatment, he says that marriage is not dissolved by divorces or
dissensions of that nature. For it is an agreement that is consecrated by the
name of God, which does not stand or fall according to the inclination of men,
so as to be made void whenever we may choose. The sum is this: other contracts,
as they depend on the mere inclination of men, are in like<i> </i>manner
dissolved by that same inclination; but those who are connected by marriage are
no longer free, so as to be at liberty, if they change their mind, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>break in pieces the
pledge,</i><sup> f401</sup></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>(as the
expression is,) and go each of them elsewhere in quest of a new connection. For
if the rights of nature cannot be dissolved, much less can this, which, as we
have said already, is preferred before the principal tie of
nature.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as to his commanding the wife, who is separated
from her husband, to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remain
unmarried</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he does not mean by this that
separation is allowable, nor does he give permission to the wife to live apart
from her husband; but if she has been expelled from the house, or has been put
away, she must not think that even in that case she is set free from his power;
for it is not in the power of a husband to dissolve marriage. He does not
therefore give permission here to wives to withdraw, of their own accord, from
their husbands, or to live away from their husband&#8217;s establishment, as if
they were in a state of widowhood; but declares, that even those who are not
received by their husbands, continue to be bound, so that they cannot take other
husbands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what if a wife is wanton, or otherwise
incontinent? Would it not be inhuman to refuse her the remedy, when, constantly
burning with desire? I answer, that when we are prompted by the infirmity of our
flesh, we must have recourse to the remedy; after which it is the Lord&#8217;s
part to bridle and restrain our affections by his Spirit, though matters should
not succeed according to our desire. For if a wife should fall into a protracted
illness, the husband would, nevertheless, not be justified in going to seek
another wife. In like manner, if a husband should, after marriage, begin to
labor under some distemper, it would not be allowable for his wife to change her
condition of life. The sum is this &#8212; God having prescribed lawful marriage
as a remedy for our incontinency, let us make use of it, that we may not, by
tempting him, pay the penalty of our rashness. Having discharged this duty, let
us hope that he will give us aid should matters go contrary to our
expectations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the rest I
say</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>By</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the
rest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he means those who are exceptions,
so that the law, common to others, is not applicable to them; for an unequal
marriage is on a different footing, when married persons differ among themselves
in respect of religion; Now this question he solves in two clauses. The <i>first
</i>is, that the believing party ought not to withdraw from the unbelieving
party, and ought not to seek divorce, unless she is put away. The <i>second
</i>is, that if an unbeliever put away his wife on account of religion, a
<i>brother </i>or a <i>sister </i>is, by such rejection, freed from the bond of
marriage. But why is it that Paul speaks of himself as the author of these
regulations, while they appear to be somewhat at variance with what he had, a
little before, brought forward, as from the Lord? He does not mean that they are
from himself in such a way as not to be derived from the Spirit of God; but, as
there was nowhere in the law or in the Prophets any definite or explicit.
statement on this subject, he anticipates in this way the calumnies of the
wicked, in claiming as his own what he was about to state. At the same time,
lest all this should be despised as the offspring of man&#8217;s brain, we shall
find him afterwards declaring, that his statement are not the contrivances of
his own understanding. There is, however, nothing inconsistent with what goes
before; for as the obligation and sanctity of the marriage engagement depend
upon God, what connection can a pious woman any longer maintain with an
unbelieving husband, after she has been driven away through hatred of
God?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>He obviates an objection, which might occasion anxiety to believers. The
relationship of marriage is singularly close, so that the wife is the half of
the man &#8212; so that <i>they two are one flesh</i> &#8212;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 6:16) &#8212; so that <i>the husband is the head of the wife</i>;<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490523&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
5:23;) and she is her husband&#8217;s partner in everything; hence it seems
impossible that a believing husband should live with an ungodly wife, or the
converse of this, without being polluted by so close a connection. Paul
therefore declares here, that marriage is, nevertheless, sacred and pure, and
that we must not be apprehensive of contagion, as if the wife would contaminate
the husband. Let us, however, bear in mind, that he speaks here not of
contracting marriages, but of maintaining those that have been already
contracted; for where the matter under consideration is, whether one should
marry an unbelieving wife, or whether one should marry an unbelieving husband,
then that exhortation is in point &#8212;</font><br></div>

choice; hence the advice given is different.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">While this <i>sanctification </i>is taken in various
senses, I refer it simply to marriage, in this sense &#8212; It might seem
(judging from appearance) as if a believing wife contracted infection from an
unbelieving husband, so as to make the connection unlawful; but it is otherwise,
for the piety of the one has more effect in sanctifying marriage than the
impiety of the other in polluting it. Hence<i> </i>a believer may, with a pure
conscience,<i> </i>live with an unbeliever, for in respect of the use and
intercourse<i> </i>of the marriage bed, and of life generally, he is sanctified,
so as not to infect the believing party with his impurity. Meanwhile this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctification</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is of no benefit to the unbelieving party; it only serves thus far, that the
believing party is not contaminated by intercourse with him, and marriage itself

things are impure</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;560115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:15,) because they pollute by their impurity even the best and choicest of
God&#8217;s creatures. Hence it is that they pollute marriage itself, because
they do not acknowledge God as its Author, and therefore they are not capable of
true sanctification, and by an evil conscience abuse marriage. It is a mistake,
however, to conclude from this that it differs nothing from fornication; for,
however impure it is to them, it is nevertheless pure in itself, inasmuch as it
is appointed by God, serves to maintain decency among men, and restrains
irregular desires; and hence it is for these purposes approved by God, like
other parts of political order. We must always, therefore, distinguish between
the nature of a thing and the abuse of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Else were your
children</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It is an argument taken from
the effect &#8212; &#8220;If your marriage were impure, then the children that
are the fruit of it would be impure; but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they are
holy</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>hence the marriage also is holy.
As, then, the ungodliness of one of the parents does not hinder the children
that are born from being holy, so neither does it hinder the marriage from being
pure.&#8221; Some grammarians explain this passage as referring to a civil
sanctity, in respect of the children being reckoned legitimate, but in this
respect the condition of unbelievers is in no degree worse. That exposition,
therefore, cannot stand. Besides, it is certain that Paul designed here to
remove scruples of conscience, lest any one should think (as I have said) that
he had contracted defilement. The passage, then, is a remarkable one, and drawn
from the depths of theology; for it teaches, that the children of the pious are
set apart from others by a sort of exclusive privilege, so as to be reckoned
<i>holy </i>in<i> </i>the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But how will this statement correspond with what he
teaches elsewhere &#8212; that <i>we are all by nature children of wrath</i>;<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:3;) or with the statement of David &#8212; <i>Behold I was conceived in
sin</i>,<i> etc</i>.<i> </i>(Psalms 51:7.) I answer, that there is a universal
propagation of sin and damnation throughout the seed of Adam, and all,
therefore, to a man, are included in this curse, whether they are the offspring
of believers or of the ungodly; for it is not as regenerated by the Spirit, that
believers beget children after the flesh. The natural condition, therefore, of
all is alike, so that they are liable equally to sin and to eternal death. As to
the Apostle&#8217;s assigning here a peculiar privilege to the children of
believers, this flows from the blessing of the covenant, by the intervention of
which the curse of nature is removed; and those who were by nature unholy are
consecrated to God by grace. Hence Paul argues, in his Epistle to the Romans,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:16,) that the whole of Abraham&#8217;s posterity are holy, because God had
made a covenant. of life with him &#8212; <i>If</i> <i>the root be holy</i>,<i>
</i>says he, <i>then the branches are holy also</i>.<i> </i>And God calls all
that were descended from Israel his sons&#8217; now that the partition is broken
down, the same covenant of salvation that was entered into with the seed of
Abraham </font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f402</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is communicated to us. But if the
children of believers are exempted from the common lot of mankind, so as to be
set apart to the Lord, why should we keep them back from the sign? If the Lord
admits them into the Church by his word, why should we refuse them the sign? In
what respects the offspring of the pious are holy, while many of them become
degenerate, you will find explained in the tenth and eleventh chapters of the
Epistle to the Romans; and I have handled this point there.</font><br></div>

for ill that case the unbelieving party makes a divorce with God rather than

strictly accurate, as he ascribes to man what belongs to God; but there is no

connects it with their service in such a manner, that what he does he speaks of
as being done by them, and hence, too, he sometimes ascribes to them the honor
which is due to himself alone. Let us, however, bear in mind, that we have

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>calling</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>he takes occasion, from a particular instance, to make a digression for a
little into a general exhortation, as he is wont to do in many instances; and,
at the same time, he confirms, by different examples, what he had said
respecting marriage. The sum is this, that in external things you must not
rashly abandon the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>calling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>on which you have once entered by the will of God. And he begins with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>circumcisions</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>respecting which many at that time disputed. Now, he says that with God it
makes no difference whether you are a Gentile or a Jew. Hence he exhorts every
one to be contented with his condition. It must always be kept in view, that he
treats only of lawful modes of life, which have God as their approver and
author.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Circumcision is
nothing</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>While this similitude was
suited to the subject in hand, it appears to have been designedly made use of
with the view of reproving, in passing, the superstition and haughtiness of the
Jews. For, as the Jews gloried in circumcision, it was possible that many might
feel dissatisfied with the want of it, as if their condition were the worse on
that account. Paul, therefore, places both conditions upon a level, lest,
through hatred of the one, the other should be foolishly desired. These things,
however, must be understood as referring to the time when circumcision was at
length abolished; for, if he had had an eye to the covenant of God, and his
commandment, he would, without doubt, have estimated it higher. In another
passage, it is true, he makes light of <i>the letter of circumcision</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450227&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:27,) and declares that it is of no account in the sight of God; but here, as
he simply contrasts circumcision with uncircumcision, and makes both alike, it
is certain that he speaks of it as a matter of indifference and of no moment.
For the abolishing of it has this effect &#8212; that the mystery which had been
previously conveyed under it, does not now any longer belong to it: nay more, it
is now no longer a sign, but a thing of no use. For baptism has come in the
place of the symbol used under the law on this footing, that it is enough that
we be circumcised by the Spirit of Christ, while our old man is buried with
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the keeping of the
commandments</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As this was one of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commandments</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>so long as the Church was bound to legal ceremonies, we see that it is taken
for granted, that circumcision had been abolished by the advent of Christ, so
that the <i>use </i>of it, indeed, was allowed among the ignorant and weak, but
<i>advantage </i>in it &#8212; there was none. For Paul speaks of it here as a
thing of no moment: &#8220;As<i> </i>these are outward things, let them not take
up your attention, but devote yourself rather to piety and the duties which God
requires, and which are alone precious in his sight.&#8221; As to the
circumstance that Papists bring forward this passage for the purpose of
overthrowing justification by faith, it is utterly childish; for Paul is not
disputing here as to the ground of justification, or the way in which we obtain
it, but simply as to the object to which the aim of believers ought to be
directed. &#8220;Do not occupy yourselves to no purpose in things of no profit,
but, on the contrary, exercise yourselves in duties that are well pleasing to
God.&#8221;</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every man in the calling in

other things are derived, &#8212; that every one should be contented with his
<i>calling</i>,<i> </i>and pursue it, instead of seeking to betake himself to
anything else. A <i>calling </i>in Scripture means a lawful mode of life, for it
has a relation to God as <i>calling

statement</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f308A

wicked or vicious. But here it is asked, whether Paul means to establish any
obligation,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f309A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">for it might seem as though the words
conveyed this idea, that every one is bound to his <i>calling</i>,<i> </i>so
that he must not abandon it. Now it were a very hard thing if a
tailor</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f310A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">were not at liberty to learn another trade,
or if a merchant were not at liberty to betake himself to farming. I answer,
that this is not what the Apostle intends, for he has it simply in view to
correct that inconsiderate eagerness, which prompts some to change their
condition without any proper reason, whether they do it from superstition, or
from any other motive. Farther, he calls every one to this rule also &#8212;
that they bear in mind what is suitable to their <i>calling</i>.<i> </i>He<i>
</i>does not, therefore, impose upon any one the necessity of continuing in the
kind of life which he has once taken up, but rather condemns that restlessness,
which prevents an individual from remaining in his condition with a peaceable
mind</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f311A

exhorts servants to be of good cheer, and not be cast down, as if servitude were

owing to the providence of God that there are different ranks and stations in
the world, but also, that a regard to them is enjoined by his
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if thou mayest even be made

could attain <i>even </i>to liberty, it would be more advantageous for
you.&#8221;<i> </i>It is uncertain, however, whether he continues his discourse

case,</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">
gene&gt;sqai</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>would here mean simply <i>to
be</i>.<i> </i>Either meaning suits sufficiently well, and they amount to the

advantageous than servitude. If he is speaking to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>servants</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>his meaning will be this &#8212; While I exhort you to be free from anxiety,
I do not hinder you from <i>even </i>availing yourselves of liberty, if an
opportunity presents itself to you. If he is addressing himself to those that
are <i>free</i>,<i> </i>it will be a kind of concession, as though he had said
&#8212; I exhort servants to be of good courage, though a state of freedom is
preferable,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f313A

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called in the Lord, being a
servant</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>is to be chosen out of the rank
of servants, and made a partaker of the grace of Christ. Now this statement is
designed to furnish consolation to servants, and, at the same time, to beat down
the haughtiness of those that are free-born. As servants feel their situation
irksome, in respect of their being mean and despicable, it is of importance that
the bitterness of servitude be alleviated by some consolation. Those, on the
other hand, that are free, need to be restrained, in order that they may not be
unduly elated on account of their more honorable condition, and be<i> </i>lifted
up with pride. The Apostle does both; for he teaches, that as the liberty of the
spirit is greatly preferable to the liberty of the flesh, servants ought to feel
the unpleasantness of their condition the more tolerable, when they take into
view that inestimable gift with which they have been endowed; and, on the other
hand, that those who are free ought not to be puffed up, inasmuch as their
condition in the principal respect is not superior to that of servants. We must
not, however, infer from this, that those that are free are made inferior to
servants, or that political order is subverted. The Apostle saw what suited
both. Those that were free required (as I have said) to be restrained, that they
might not in a wanton manner triumph over servants. To servants, on the other
hand, some consolation required to be administered, that they might not be
disheartened. Now these things tend rather to confirm political order, while he
teaches that the inconvenience<i> </i>of the flesh is compensated by a spiritual
benefit.</font><br></div>

as we do when we are subject to their corrupt desires.&#8221; This admonition
was very necessary at that time, when servants were driven by threats and
stripes, and even fear of death, to obey every kind of command without selection
or exception, so that they reckoned the procuring of prostitutes, and other
crimes of that nature, to be duties belonging to servants, equally with
honorable employment&#8217;s. It is, therefore, not without reason that Paul
makes this exception &#8212; that they are not to yield obedience in things base
and wicked. Would that this were thoroughly and entirely impressed upon the
minds of all! There would not, in that case, be so many that prostitute
themselves to the lusts of men, as if exposed for sale. As for us, let us bear
in mind, that we belong to him who has redeemed us.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He says that <i>he gives advice</i>,<i> </i>not as if

decision, that no one may think himself at liberty to reject it, if he chooses.
For he declares that he does not speak simply as a man, but as a faithful
teacher of the Church, and an Apostle of Christ. According to his custom, he
declares himself to be indebted for this to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the mercy of

purity and <i>faithfulness</i>.<i> </i>For it is not enough for a teacher to be
conscientious, if he has not also prudence and acquaintance with the
truth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I think therefore that this
is good.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>While I translate this passage
of Paul&#8217;s writings differently from Erasmus or the Vulgate, I at the same
time do not differ from them as to its meaning. They divide Paul&#8217;s words
in such a way, that the same thing is repeated twice. I, on the other hand, make
it simply one proposition, and not without authority, for I follow ancient and
approved manuscripts, which make it all one sentence, with merely a <i>colon
</i>between. The meaning is this: &#8220;I think it expedient on account of the
necessity, with which the saints are always harassed in this life, that all
should enjoy the liberty and advantage of celibacy, as this would be of
advantage to them.&#8221; There are some, however, that view the term
<i>necessity </i>as referring to the age of the Apostle, which was, undoubtedly,
full of trouble to the pious: but he appears to me to have had it rather in view
to express the disquietude with which the saints are incessantly harassed in the
present life. I view it, therefore, as extending to all ages, and I understand
it in this way, that the saints are often, in this world, driven hither and
thither, and are exposed to many and various
tempests,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f318A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">so that their condition appears to be
unsuitable for marriage. The phrase <i>so to be</i>,<i> </i>signifies to remain
unmarried, or to abstain from marriage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Art thou bound to a
wife?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Having stated what would be most
advantageous, he adds at the same time, that we ought not to be so much
influenced by the advantages of celibacy, that one that is bound by the tie of
marriage should shake off the connection. It is therefore a restriction upon the
preceding statement, lest any one, influenced by his commendation of celibacy,
should turn his thoughts to it, and despise marriage, forgetful of his necessity
or of his <i>calling</i>.<i> </i>Now in these words he does not merely forbid
the breaking up of the connection of marriage, but also represses the dislikes
that are wont to creep in, that every one may continue to live with his wife
willingly and cheerfully.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Art thou loosed from a
wife?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This second clause must be taken
with a reservation, as is manifest from the entire context. He does not, then,
allow to all the choice of perpetual celibacy, but only to those to whom it is
given. Let no one, therefore, who is not constrained by any necessity, rashly
ensnare himself, for liberty ought not to be lightly thrown
away.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f319A
</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if thou shouldest even
marry.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As there was a danger of
one&#8217;s thinking from the preceding statement, that he tempted God, if he
knowingly and willingly bound himself to marriage, (as that would be to renounce
his liberty,) he removes this scruple; for he gives liberty to widows to marry,
and says, that those that marry do not sin. The word <i>even </i>also seems to
be emphatic &#8212; to intimate, that even though there be no positive necessity
urging to it, the unmarried are not prohibited from marrying whenever they may
see fit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if a virgin
marry</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Whether this is an amplification,
or simply an illustration, this, in the first place, is beyond all controversy,
that Paul designed to extend the liberty of marriage to all. Those who think
that it is an amplification, are led to think so by this, that it seems to
approach nearer to a fault, and is more open to reprehension, or at least has.
more occasion of shame, to loose the virgin girdle (as the ancients express
themselves) than, upon the death of a husband, to enter into a second marriage.
The argument then would be this: &#8220;If it is lawful for a virgin to marry,
much more may widows.&#8221; I am rather of opinion, that he makes both equal in
this way: &#8220;As<i> </i>it is allowable for a virgin, so is it for widows
also.&#8221; For second marriages among the ancients were not without some mark
of reproach, as they adorned those matrons, who had contented themselves with
one marriage during their whole life, with a chaplet of
chastity</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f320A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8212; an honor that tended to reflect
reproach upon those that had married repeatedly. And it is a well known saying
of Valerius,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f321A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">that &#8220;it<i> </i>betokens a legitimate
excess</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f322A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">when a second marriage is desired.&#8221; The
Apostle, therefore, makes virgins and widows alike as to liberty of
marriage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nevertheless such shall have
trouble</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in the flesh. He frequently
repeats the reason why he leans more to the side of celibacy in his
exhortations, lest he should seem to prefer the one condition to the other on
its own account, rather than on account of its consequences. He says, that there
are many troubles that are connected with the married life, and that on that
account he wishes all to be free from marriage, who desire to be exempt from
troubles. When he says, that they will have
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trouble of the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he means, that the anxieties and
distresses in which married persons are involved arise from the affairs of the
world. The</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>therefore, is taken here to mean
the outward man. To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spare</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>means to <i>indulge</i>,<i> </i>or to wish them to be exempted from the
troubles that are connected with marriage. &#8220;I<i> </i>am desirous to make
provision for your infirmity, that you may not have trouble: now marriage brings
with it many troubles. This is the reason why I should wish you not to require
to marry &#8212; that you may be exempt from all its evils.&#8221; Do not,
however, infer from this that Paul reckons marriage to be a necessary evil for
those troubles of which he speaks do not arise so much from the nature of
marriage, as from the corruption of it, for they are the fruits of original
sin.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because the time is
short</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>etc. Again he discourses
respecting the holy use of marriage, for the purpose of repressing the
wantonness of those who, when they have married, think of nothing but the
delights of the flesh. They have no remembrance of God. Hence he exhorts
believers not to give way to unbridled desire in such a way, that marriage
should have the effect of plunging them into the world. Marriage is a remedy for
incontinency. It has really the effect, if it be used with moderation. He
therefore exhorts married persons to live together chastely in the fear of the
Lord. This will be effected, if marriage is made use of by them, like other
helps of this earthly life, having their hearts directed upwards to meditation
on the heavenly life. Now, he draws his argument from the shortness of human
life: &#8220;This life,&#8221; says he, &#8220;which<i> </i>we are now spending
is frail, and of short duration. Let us not therefore be held entangled by it.
Let <i>those </i>accordingly </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who
have wives, be as though they had none</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221;
Every one, it is true, has this philosophy in his mouth, but few have it truly
and in good earnest impressed upon their minds. In my first translation, I had
followed a manuscript, to which (as I afterwards discovered) not one of the many
others gave any countenance. I have accordingly deemed it proper to insert the
particle <i>because</i>, to<i> </i>make the meaning more apparent, and in
accordance also with the reading in some ancient copies. For as in those cases
in which we are deliberating as to anything, we look to the future rather than
to the past, he admonishes us as to the shortness of the time that is to
come.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As though they had
none</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>All things that are connected with
the enjoyment of the present life are sacred gifts of God, but we pollute them
when we abuse them. If the reason is asked, we shall find it to be this, that we
always dream of continuance in the world, for it is owing to this that those
things which ought to be helps in passing through it become hindrances to hold
us fast. Hence, it is not without good reason, that the Apostle, with the view
of arousing us from this stupidity, calls us to consider the shortness of this
life, and infers from this, that we ought to <i>use </i>all the things of this
world, as </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if we did not
use</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>them. For the man who considers that
he is a stranger in the world uses the things of this world as if they were
another&#8217;s &#8212; that is, as things that are lent us for a single day.
The sum is this, that the mind of a Christian ought not to be taken up with
earthly things, or to repose in them; for we ought to live as if we were every
moment about to depart from this life. By <i>weeping </i>and
<i>rejoicing</i>,<i> </i>he means adversity and prosperity; for it is customary
to denote causes by their
effects.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f324A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">The Apostle, however, does not here command
Christians to part with their possessions, but simply requires that their minds

representations, in which, on the curtain being drawn up in a single moment, a

spectators in astonishment, are immediately withdrawn from their view. I do not
see why it is that Erasmus has preferred the term <i>habitus </i>(form.) He

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460725&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:25,) but had not as yet fully explained, and in the outset he
pronounces, as he is wont, a commendation upon celibacy, and then afterwards
allows every one the liberty of choosing what he may consider to suit him best.
It is not, however, without good reason that he returns so frequently to
proclaim the advantages of celibacy, for he saw that the burdens of matrimony
were far from light. The man who can exempt himself from them, ought not to
refuse such a benefit, and it is of advantage for those who resolve to marry, to
be forewarned of those inconveniences, that they may not afterwards, on meeting
with them unexpectedly, give way to despondency. This we see happens to many,
for having promised themselves unmixed honey, on being disappointed in that
expectation, they are very readily cast down by the slightest
mishap.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f329A

<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, he has previously made use of the term

</i>it may admit of doubt whether they have a different signification, or not. I
am of opinion that the <i>trouble </i>referred to is what arises from things of
a distressing nature, such as loss of children, widowhood, quarrels, and little
differences, (as lawyers
speak,)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f330A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">many occasions of dislike, faults of
children, difficulty in bringing up a family, and the like.<i> </i>The
<i>anxieties</i>,<i> </i>on the other hand, are, in my opinion, connected with
things that are joyful, as for example marriage fooleries, jests, and other
things with which married persons are taken
up.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f331A

exemption from anxieties that he desires in behalf of Christians &#8212; that
they may devote to the Lord all their thoughts and aims. This, he says, belongs
to celibacy; and therefore he desires all to enjoy this liberty. He does not
mean, however, that it is invariably so in unmarried life, as experience shows
it to be quite otherwise in priests, monks, and nuns, than whose celibacy
nothing can be conceived to be farther from God. Add to this the many base
fornicators who abstain from marriage for the very purpose of having greater
liberty for the indulgence of lust, and that their vice may not appear. Where
there is <i>burning</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:9,) no love of God can exist. But Paul&#8217;s meaning is this
&#8212; that an unmarried person is free, and is not hindered from thinking of
the things of God. The pious make use of this liberty. Others turn everything to
their own destruction.</font><br></div>

God,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f332A

answer, that the Apostle speaks only of a portion of the thoughts, as though he
had said: &#8220;They<i> </i>have one eye directed to the Lord, but in such a
way as to have the other directed to their wife; for marriage is like a burden,
by which the mind of a pious man is weighed down, so that he does not move
God-ward with so much alacrity.&#8221; Let us always, however, bear in mind,
that these evils do not belong to marriage, but proceed from the depravity of
men. Hence the calumnies of
Jerome,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f333A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">who scrapes together all these things for the
purpose of bringing marriages into disrepute, fall. For, were any one to condemn
agriculture, merchandise, and other modes of life, on this ground, that amidst
so many corruption&#8217;s of the world, there is not one of them that is exempt
from certain evils, who is there that would not smile at his folly? Observe,
then, that whatever evil there is in marriage, has its origin somewhere else;
for at this day a man would not have been turned away from the Lord by the
society of his wife, if he had remained in a state of innocence,<i> </i>and had
not corrupted the holy institution of God; but a wife would have been a
<i>help-meet to </i>him in everything good, as she was created for that end.

<div><font face="Palatino">But some one will say: &#8220;If<i> </i>anxieties
that are faulty and blameworthy are invariably connected with marriage, how is
it possible for married persons to call upon God, and serve him, with a pure
conscience?&#8221; I answer, that there are <i>three </i>kinds of anxieties.
There are some that are evil and wicked in themselves, because they spring from
distrust. Of these Christ speaks in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400625&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
6:25: There are others that are necessary, and are not displeasing to God; as,
for example, it becomes the father of a family to be concerned for his wife and
children, and God does not mean that we should be mere stumps, so as to have no
concern as to ourselves. The <i>third </i>class are a mixture of the two former;
when we are anxious respecting those things as to which we ought to feel
anxiety, but feel too keenly excited, in consequence of that excess which is
natural to us. Such anxieties, therefore, are not by any means wrong in
themselves, but they are corrupt, in consequence of
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ataxia</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>that is to say, undue excess. And the Apostle did not intend merely to
condemn here those vices by which we contract guilt in the sight of God, but he
desires in a general way, that we may be freed from all impediments, so as to be
wholly at leisure for the service of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And is
divided.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is surprising how there has
come to be so much diversity upon this passage. For the common Greek version is
so widely different from the old Latin translation, that the diversity cannot be
ascribed to mistake or inadvertence, in the way in which a mistake often happens
in a single letter or a single word. Now the Greeks commonly read it literally,
&#8220;He<i> </i>that is married thinks of the things of the world, how he may
please his wife: a married woman and a virgin are divided: She that is
unmarried, thinketh of the things of the Lord,&#8221; etc. And
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>being
divided</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>they understand as meaning <i>to
differ</i>,<i> </i>as if it had been said: &#8220;There is a great difference
between a married woman and a virgin; for the one is at leisure to attend to the
things of God exclusively, while the other is taken up with various
matters.&#8221; But as this interpretation is somewhat at variance with the
simple meaning of the word, I do not approve of it, especially as the meaning of
the other reading (which is found also in some Greek manuscripts) is more
suitable and less forced. We may, accordingly, understand it in this manner
&#8212; that a man who is married is

it, if the mind is so disposed. When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that she may be holy in body and

well pleasing to God that does not extend to the <i>soul </i>as well as to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>body</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>Would to God that those who prate in such haughty terms as to continency,
did but understand that they have to do with God! They would not be so confident
in their contendings with us. At the same time, there are none in the present
day who dispute on the subject of continency in more magnificent style than
those who are openly and in the most shameless manner guilty of fornication. But
though they should conduct themselves ever so honorably in the sight of men,
that is nothing, if they do not keep<i> </i>their minds pure and exempt from all

commended celibacy, and being afraid that some of his readers might be led away
by such commendations, and might straightway say within themselves what the
Apostles said in reply to Christ &#8212; <i>It</i> <i>is good</i>,<i>

<div><font face="Palatino">And here you have two things worthy of observation.
The <i>first </i>is, for what purpose celibacy is to be desired &#8212; not on
its own account, nor on the ground of its being a state that is nearer to
perfection, but that we may cleave to God without distraction &#8212; <i>that
</i>being the one thing that a Christian man ought exclusively to look to during
his whole life. The <i>second </i>thing is, that no snare must be put upon
men&#8217;s consciences,<i> </i>so as to keep back any one from marriage, but
that every one must have liberty allowed him. It is well known what grievous
errors have been fallen into on both these points. As to the <i>second
</i>point, those assuredly have been bolder than Paul, who have not shrunk from
passing a law respecting celibacy, with the view of prohibiting the whole of the
clergy from matrimony. The same may be said of those who have made vows of
perpetual continency, which are snares by which not a few myriads of souls have
been drawn into endless ruin. Hence, if the Holy Spirit has spoken by the mouth
of Paul, Papists cannot clear themselves from the crime of <i>fighting against
God</i>,<i>

directs his discourse to parents, who had children under their authority. For
having heard the praises of celibacy, and having heard also of the
inconveniences of matrimony, they might be in doubt, whether it were at all a
kind thing to involve their children in so many miseries, lest it should seem as
if <i>they </i>were to blame for the troubles that might befall them. For the

any one. In <i>the first </i>part of the statement he speaks as to the giving of

parents, which ought to be held sacred, as having its origin in the common
rights of nature. Now if in other actions of inferior moment no liberty is
allowed to children, without the authority of their parents, much less is it
reasonable that they should have liberty given them in the contracting of
marriage. And that has been carefully enacted by civil law, but more especially
by the law of God. So much the more detestable, then, is the wickedness of the
Pope, who, laying aside all respect, either for Divine or human laws, has been
so daring as to free children from the yoke of subjection to their parents. It
is of importance, however, to mark the reason. This, says he, is on account of
the dignity of the sacrament. Not to speak of the ignorance of making marriage a
sacrament, what honor is there, I beseech you, or what dignity, when, contrary
to the general feeling of propriety in all nations, and contrary to God&#8217;s
eternal appointment, they take off all restraints from the lusts of young
persons, that they may, without any feeling of shame, sport
themselves,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

limitation is the proper rule &#8212; that children allow themselves to be
governed by their parents, and that they, on the other hand, do not drag their
children by force to what is against their inclination, and that they have no
other object in view, in the exercise of their authority, than the advantage of

before expressed. For if power be wanting on the part of the
daughter,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f351A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">the father acts an exceedingly bad part if he
endeavors to keep her back from marriage, and would be no longer a father to
her, but a cruel tyrant. The sum of the whole discussion amounts to this &#8212;
that celibacy is better than marriage, because it has more liberty, so that
persons can serve God with greater freedom; but at the same time, that no
necessity ought to be imposed, so as to make it unlawful for individuals to
marry, if they think proper; and farther, that marriage itself is a remedy
appointed by God for our
infirmity,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f352A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">which all ought to use that are not endowed
with the gift of continency. Every person of sound judgment will join with me in
acknowledging and confessing, that the whole of Paul&#8217;s doctrine on this
point is comprehended in these <i>three </i>articles.</font><br><br></div>

bound</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He had previously spoken
indiscriminately of husbands and wives, but as wives, on account of the modesty
of their sex, might seem to have less liberty, he has thought it necessary to
give in addition some special directions in reference to them. He now,
therefore, teaches that women are not less at liberty than men to marry a second
time, on their becoming widows.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f353A</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We have already mentioned above, that
those who desired a second marriage were branded with the reproach of
intemperance, and that, with the view of putting some kind of slight upon them,
those who had been contented with being once married, were wont to be presented
with the &#8220;chaplet of chastity.&#8221; Nay more, this first opinion had, in
course of time, become prevalent among Christians; for second marriages had no
blessing pronounced upon them, and some Councils prohibited the clergy from
being present on such occasions. The Apostle here condemns tyranny of that sort,
and declares, that no hindrance ought to be thrown in the way of widows&#8217;
marrying, if they think proper.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is of little consequence, and so far as the sense
is concerned it matters nothing, whether we say that the wife is bound
<i>legi</i>,<i> </i>(<i>to </i>the law,) in the dative, or <i>lege</i>,<i>
</i>(<i>by </i>the law,) in the ablative. For it is the law that declares the
connection between husband and wife to be indissoluble. If, however, you read it
in the dative, the term will convey the idea of authority or
obligation.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f354A</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now he reasons from contraries; for if
a woman is bound to her husband for life, she is, then, set at liberty by his
death. After she has been set at liberty,

is acted by certain fanatics, who, from this little word, make it their endeavor

destitute of thought and intelligence, or, in other words, of their
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Only in the

the purpose of admonishing them in passing, that they ought not to yoke
themselves with the irreligious, or to covet their society. This, I acknowledge,
is true, but I am of opinion that more is meant that they should do this in a
religious way, and in the fear of the
Lord,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

of itself a virtue? No; but because it will have less to distract, and is more
exempt from earthly cares. As to what he adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to my
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he does not mean by this
expression that his opinion was doubtful; but it is as if he had said that such
was his <i>decision </i>as to this question; for he immediately adds that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he has the Spirit of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>which is sufficient to give full
and perfect authority. There appears, at the same time, to be somewhat of irony
when he says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
think</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>For as the false apostles were
ever and anon boasting in high-sounding terms of their having the Spirit of God,
for the purpose of arrogating to themselves authority, and in the meantime
endeavored to derogate from that of Paul, he says that he thinks that <i>he

<div><font face="Palatino">He now passes on to another question, which he had
merely touched upon in the sixth chapter, without fully discussing. For when he
had spoken of the avarice of the Corinthians, and had drawn that discussion to a
close with this statement &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither covetous, nor
extortioners, nor fornicators, etc., shall inherit the kingdom of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he passed on to speak of the
liberty of Christians &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All
things are lawful for me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He had taken occasion
from this to speak of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fornication</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and from that, of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>marriage</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>Now, therefore, he at length follows out what he had touched upon as to
things intermediate &#8212; how we ought to restrain our liberty in intermediate
things. By intermediate things, I mean those that are neither good nor bad in
themselves, but indifferent, which God has put in our power, but in the use of
which we ought to observe moderation, that there may be a difference between
liberty and licentiousness. In the outset, he selects one instance,
distinguished above all the others, as to which the Corinthians grievously
offended &#8212; their having been present on occasion of the sacred banquets,
which were held by idolaters in honor of their gods, and eating indiscriminately
of the meats that were offered to them. As this gave much occasion of offense,
the Apostle teaches them that they rashly perverted the liberty granted them by
the Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Concerning things offered
unto idols.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He begins with a concession,
in which he voluntarily grants and allows to them everything that they were
prepared to demand or object. &#8220;I<i> </i>see what your pretext is: you make
Christian liberty your pretext. You hold out that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>you have
knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and that there is not one of
you that is so ignorant as not to know that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there is but one
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I grant all this to be true, but of
what avail is that knowledge which is ruinous to the brethren?&#8221; Thus,
then, he grants them what they demand, but it is in such a way as to show that
their excuses are empty and of no avail.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Knowledge puffeth
up</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He shows, from the effects, how
frivolous a thing it is to boast of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>when <i>love </i>is wanting. &#8220;Of<i> </i>what avail is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>that is of such a kind as <i>puffs us up </i>and elates us, while it is the
part of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>edify</i></font><font face="Palatino">?&#8221;
This passage, which otherwise is somewhat obscure, in consequence of its
brevity, may easily be understood in this way &#8212; &#8220;Whatever is devoid
of <i>love </i>is of no account in the sight of God; nay more, it is displeasing
to him, and much more so what is openly at variance with <i>love</i>.<i> </i>Now
that,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of which you boast, O ye Corinthians, is altogether opposed to
<i>love</i>,<i> </i>for it </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>puffs
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>men with pride, and leads to contempt
of the brethren, while <i>love </i>is concerned for the welfare of brethren, and
exhorts us to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>edify</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>them. Accursed, then, be that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>which makes men proud, and is not regulated by a desire of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>edifying</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul, however, did not mean, that this is to be
reckoned as a fault attributable to <i>learning</i> &#8212; that<i> </i>those
who are learned are often self-complacent, and have admiration of themselves,
accompanied with contempt of others. Nor did he understand this to be the
natural tendency of learning &#8212; to produce arrogance, but simply meant to
show what effect
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>has in an individual, that has not the fear of God, and love of the
brethren; for the wicked abuse all the gifts of God, so as to exalt, themselves.
Thus riches, honors, dignities, nobility, beauty, and other things of that
nature, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>puff
up</i></font><font face="Palatino">; because men, elated through a mistaken
confidence in these things, very frequently become
insolent.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f358A</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Nor is it always so; for we see that
many who are rich and beautiful, and abounding in honors, and distinguished for
dignity and nobility, are, nevertheless, of a modest disposition, and not at all
tainted with pride. And even when it does happen to be so, it is, nevertheless,
not proper that we should put the blame upon what we know to be gifts of God;
for in the <i>first </i>place that were unfair and unreasonable; and farther, by
putting the blame upon things that are not blameworthy, we would exempt the
persons themselves from blame, who alone are in fault. My meaning is this
&#8212; &#8220;If riches <i>naturally tend </i>to make men proud, then a rich
man, if proud, is free from blame, for the evil arises from
riches.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must, therefore, lay it down as a settled
principle, that knowledge is good in itself; but as piety is its only
foundation,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f359A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">it; becomes empty and useless in wicked men:
as love is its true seasoning, where <i>that </i>is wanting it is tasteless. And
truly, where there is not that thorough knowledge of God which humbles us, and
teaches us to do good to the brethren, it is not so much
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>as an empty notion of it, even in those that are reckoned the most learned.
At the same time, knowledge is not by any means to be blamed for this, any more
than a sword, if it falls into the hands of a madman. Let this be considered as
said</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f360A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">with a view to certain fanatics, who
furiously declaim against all the liberal arts and sciences, as if their only
use were to <i>puff </i>men <i>up</i>,<i> </i>and were not of the greatest
advantage as helps in common
life.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f361A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Now those very persons, who defame them in
this style, are ready to burst with pride, to such an extent as to verify the

ignorance.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if any man
thinketh</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>That man <i>thinketh that he
knoweth something</i>,<i> </i>who is delighted with the opinion that he
entertains of his own knowledge, and despises others, as if he were far above
them. For Paul does not here condemn knowledge, but that ambition and
haughtiness which ungodly men contract in consequence of it. Otherwise he does
not exhort us to be sceptical, so as to be always hesitating and hanging in
doubt, and he does not approve of a false and counterfeit modesty, as if it were
a good thing to think that we are ignorant of what we do know. That man,
therefore, who </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thinketh that he
knoweth something</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or, in other words,
who is insolent from an empty notion of his own knowledge, so that he prefers
himself before others, and is self-conceited,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he knoweth nothing yet as he
ought to know</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>For the beginning of all
true knowledge is acquaintance with God, which produces in us humility and
submission; nay more, it prostrates us entirely instead of elating us. But where
pride is, <i>there </i>is ignorance of
God</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f362A

which he shows what is especially commendable in Christians, and even renders
knowledge, and all other endowments worthy of commendation, if we <i>love
God</i>;<i> </i>for if it is so, we will also love our neighbors in him. By this
means all our actions will be properly regulated, and consequently approved by
God. He shows, therefore, from consequences, that no learning is commendable
that is not dipped in the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>because that alone secures, that
whatever endowments we have are approved by him, as it is said in the second

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Concerning, therefore, the eating of those
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He now returns to the statement
with which he had set out, and speaks more plainly in reference to the pretext
made use of by the Corinthians. For as the whole of the evil took its rise from
this root &#8212; that they were pleased with themselves, and despised others,
he condemns, in general, that contemptuous knowledge which is not seasoned with
love. Now, however, he explains particularly, what is the kind of knowledge on
which they valued themselves &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an
idol</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is an empty figment of the human
brain, and must therefore be reckoned as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nothing</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i>
</i>and accordingly, that the consecration, that is gone through in name of the
idol, is a foolish imagination, and of no importance, and that a Christian man,
therefore, is not polluted, who, without reverence for the idol, eats of things
offered to idols. This is the sum of the excuse, and it is not set aside by Paul
as false, (for it contains excellent doctrine,) but because they abused it, in
opposition to <i>love</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the words, Erasmus reads thus &#8212; &#8220;An
idol has no existence.&#8221; I prefer the rendering of the old translation
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>An idol is
nothing</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>For the argument is this
&#8212; that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an idol is
nothing</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>inasmuch as there is but one
God; for it follows admirably &#8212; &#8220;If there is no other God besides
our God, then an idol is an empty dream, and mere vanity.&#8221; When he says
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and there is none other
God but one</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>I understand the
conjunction <i>and </i>as meaning <i>because</i>.<i> </i>For the reason why an
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>idol is
nothing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is, that it must be estimated
according to the thing that it represents. Now it is appointed for the purpose
of representing God: nay more, for the purpose of representing false gods,
inasmuch as there is but one God, who is invisible and incomprehensible. The
reason, too, must be carefully observed &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>An idol is nothing because there
is no God but one;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for he is the
invisible God, and cannot be represented by a visible sign, so as to be
worshipped through means of it. Whether, therefore, idols are erected to
represent the true God, or false gods, it is in all cases a perverse
contrivance. Hence Habakkuk calls idols <i>teachers of lies</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;350218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
2:18,) because they deal falsely in pretending to give a figure or image of God,
and deceive men under a false title. Hence
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oujden
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>nothing</i>)<i> </i>refers not to essence, but
to quality &#8212; for an idol is made of some substance &#8212; either silver,
or wood, or stone; but as God does not choose to be represented in this way, it
is vanity and <i>nothing </i>as to meaning and use.</font><br></div>

<i>called </i>here, to mean &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>renowned in the estimation of
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He has also made use of a general
division, when he says in </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heaven

mention of as being </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>are the heavenly hosts, as the
Scripture terms the sun, moon, and the other stars. How very far they are,
however, from being entitled to divine honors, Moses shows from this, that they
were created for our use. The sun is our servant; the moon is our handmaid. How
absurd, therefore, it is to render to them divine honors! By the gods that are
on <i>earth</i>,<i> </i>are properly meant, in my opinion, men and women for
whom religious worship has been
appointed.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f363A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">For, as Pliny observes, those who had
deserved well of mankind had their memory consecrated by religion, so as to be
worshipped as deities &#8212; Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Mercury, and Apollo, who
were mortal men, but were, after death, exalted to the rank of deities; and,
more recently, Hercules, Romulus, and at length the Cesars &#8212; as if it were
in the power of mankind to make deities at their pleasure, while they cannot
give to themselves either life or immortality. There are also other gods that
are terrestrial, taken either from cattle or from brute creatures, as, for
example, among the Egyptians, the ox, the serpent, the cat, the onion, the
garlic; and, among the Romans, the
boundary-stone,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f364A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">and the stone Vesta. They are gods, then,
only in name; but Paul says that he does not stop to notice deifications of this
sort.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f365A

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But to us there is but one
God, the Father</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Though Paul says these
things by anticipation, he repeats the excuse made by the Corinthians, in such a
way as at the same time to convey instruction. For, from what is more especially
peculiar to God, he proves that there is but one God: &#8220;Whatever<i> </i>has
its origin from what is foreign to itself, is not eternal, and, consequently, is
not God. All things have their origin from one Being: he alone, therefore, is
God.&#8221; Again &#8212; &#8220;<i>He </i>is assuredly God who gives existence
to all, and from whom all things flow, as from the supreme source; but there is
only
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>from whom all things flow, and hence
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there is but one
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221;<i> </i>When he adds &#8212; and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we in
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv
aujto&gt;n,</font><font face="Palatino">) he<i> </i>means, that we subsist in
God, as it was by him that we were once created. For this clause might, indeed,
seem to have another signification &#8212; that as we have our beginning from
him, so we ought to devote our life to him as its end; and it is used in this
sense in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:39. Here, however, it is taken for
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn
aujtw~|</font><font face="Palatino">, which is commonly made use of by the
Apostles. His meaning, therefore, is, that as we were once created by God, so it
is by his power that we are preserved in our present condition. That this is its
meaning, is evident from what he affirms respecting Christ immediately
afterwards &#8212; that we are <i>by him</i>.<i> </i>For he designed to ascribe
the same operation to the Father and to the Son, adding, however, the
distinction which was suitable to the Persons. He says, then, that we subsist
<i>in</i> the Father, and that it is <i>by </i>the Son, because the Father is
indeed the foundation of all existence; but, as it is by the Son that we are
united to him, so he communicates to us through him the reality of
existence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>These things are affirmed
respecting Christ relatively, that is, in relationship to the Father. For all
things that are God&#8217;s are assuredly applicable to Christ, when no mention
is made of persons; but as the person of the Father is here brought into
comparison with the person of the Son, it is with good reason that the Apostle
distinguishes what is peculiar to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Son of God, after having been manifested in
the flesh, received from the Father dominion and power over all things, that he
might reign alone in heaven and on earth, and that the Father might exercise his
authority through his hands. For this reason our Lord is spoken of as
one.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f366A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">But in respect of dominion being ascribed to
him alone, this is not to be taken as meaning that worldly
distinctions</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f367A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">are abolished. For Paul speaks here of
spiritual dominion, while the governments of the world are political; as when he
said a little before &#8212; <i>there are many that are called lords</i> &#8212;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:5) &#8212; he meant that, not of kings, or of others who excel in
rank and dignity, but of idols or demons, to whom foolish men ascribe
superiority and rule. While, therefore, our religion acknowledges but one Lord,
this is no hindrance in the way of civil governments having many lords, to whom
honor and respect are due in that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But there is not in all that
knowledge.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He refutes, in a single word,
all that he had previously brought forward in their name, showing that it is not
enough that they know that what, they do is right, if they have not at the same
time a regard to their brethren. When he said above &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We know that we all have
knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:1,) he referred to those whom he reproved for abusing their
liberty. Now, on the other hand, he calls them to consider, that there are many
weak and ignorant persons associated with them, to whom they ought to
accommodate themselves. &#8220;You have, it is true, a correct judgment in the
sight of God, and if you were alone in the world, it would be as lawful for you
to eat of things offered to idols, as of any other kinds of food. But consider
your brethren, to whom you are debtors. You have knowledge; they are ignorant,.
Your actions ought to be regulated not merely according to your knowledge, but
also according to their ignorance.&#8221; This reply is particularly deserving
of notice; for there is nothing to which we are more
prone</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f368A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">than this, that every one follows his own
advantage, to the neglect of that of others. Hence we feel prepared to rest in
our own judgment, and do not consider, that the propriety of those works that we
do in the sight of men depends not merely on our own conscience, but also on
that of our brethren.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Some with conscience of the
idol</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This is their ignorance, that they
were still under the influence of some superstitious notion, as if there were
some virtue in the idol, or some virtue in a wicked and idolatrous consecration.
Paul, however, does not speak of idolaters, who were entire strangers to pure
religion, but of ignorant persons who had not been sufficiently instructed, to
understand that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an idol is
nothing</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and therefore that the
consecration, which was gone through in name of the idol, is of no importance.
Their idea, therefore, was this: &#8220;As<i> </i>an idol is something, the
consecration which is gone through in its name is not altogether vain, and hence
those meats are not pure, that have been once dedicated to idols.&#8221; Hence
they thought, that, if they ate of them, they contracted some degree of
pollution, and were, in a manner, partakers with the idol. This is the kind of
<i>offense </i>that Paul reproves in the Corinthians &#8212; when we induce weak
brethren, by our example, to venture upon anything against their
conscience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their
conscience</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>God would have us try or
attempt nothing but what we know for certain is agreeable to him. Whatever,
therefore, is done with a doubting conscience, is, in consequence of doubts of
that kind, faulty in the sight of God. And this is what he says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451423&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:23,) <i>Whatsoever is not of faith is sin</i>.<i> </i>Hence the truth of the
common saying, that &#8220;those build for hell, who build against their
conscience.&#8221; For as the excellence of actions depends on the fear of God
and integrity of conscience, so, on the other hand, there is no action, that is
so good in appearance, as not to be polluted by a corrupt affection of the mind.
For the man, who ventures upon anything in opposition to conscience, does
thereby discover some contempt of God; for it is a token that we fear God, when
we have respect to his will in all things. Hence you are not without contempt of
God, if you so much as move a finger while uncertain, whether it may not be
displeasing to him. As to <i>meats</i>,<i> </i>there is another thing to be
considered, for they are not <i>sanctified </i>to<i> </i>us otherwise than <i>by
the word</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540405&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:5.) If that word is wanting, there remains nothing but pollution
&#8212; not that the creatures of God are polluted, but because man&#8217;s use
of them is impure. In fine, as men&#8217;s hearts are purified by faith, so
without faith there is nothing that is pure in the sight of
God.</font><br><br></div>

Meat recommendeth us not to God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This
was, or may have been, another pretext made use of by the Corinthians &#8212;
that the worship of God does not consist in meats, as Paul himself teaches in
his Epistle to the Romans,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:17,) that <i>the kingdom of God is not meat or drink</i>.<i> </i>Paul
answers: &#8220;We<i> </i>must at the same time take<i> </i>care that our
liberty does not do injury to our neighbors.&#8221; In this he tacitly
acknowledges, that in the sight of God it matters not what kinds of food we
partake of, because he allows us the free use of them, so far as conscience is
concerned; but that this liberty, as to the external use of it, is made subject
to love. The argument of the Corinthians, therefore, was defective, inasmuch as
they inferred the whole from a part, for in the use of them a regard to the
claims of love is included. It is, therefore, certain, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>meat recommendeth us not to
God;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and Paul acknowledges this, but he
states this exception, that love is recommended to us by God, which it were
criminal to overlook.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither if we eat, are we the
better.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He does not speak of improvement
as to the stomach; for the man who has dined has a better filled stomach than
the man who goes fasting; but he means, that we have neither more nor less of
righteousness from eating or from abstaining. Besides, he does not speak of
every kind of abstinence, or of every kind of eating. For excess and luxury are
in themselves displeasing to God, while sobriety and moderation are
well-pleasing to him. But let it be understood by us, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the kingdom of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>which is spiritual, does not
consist in these outward observances, and therefore, that things indifferent are
in themselves of no importance in the sight of God. While he brings this forward
in the person of others by
<i>anthypophora</i>,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f369A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">he at the same time admits that it is true,
for it is taken from his own doctrine, which we touched upon a little
ago.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take heed that your
liberty</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He<i> </i>leaves their liberty
untouched, but moderates the use of it thus far &#8212; that it may not give
occasion of stumbling to the weak. And he expressly desires that regard be had
to the weak, that is, to those who are not, yet thoroughly confirmed in the
doctrine of piety, for as they are wont to be regarded with contempt, it is the
will and command of the Lord, that regard should be had to them. In the
meantime, he hints that strong giants, who may be desirous tyrannically to
subject our liberty to their humor, may safely be let
alone,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f370A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">because we need not fear giving offense to
those who are not drawn into sin through infirmity, but eagerly catch at
something to find fault with. What he means by

stumbling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>we shall see
herelong.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any one see

how much liberty the Corinthians allowed themselves; for when the wicked made a
kind of sacred banquet for their idols, they did not
hesitate</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f371A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">to go to it, to eat of the sacrifice along
with them. Paul now shows what evil resulted from this. In the <i>first
</i>clause, instead of the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who hast
knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>I have rendered the
expression thus &#8212; though<i> thou shouldest have</i>;<i> </i>and in the

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who is
weak</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>I have introduced the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>notwithstand</i>ing</font><font face="Palatino">.
This I found it necessary to do for the clearing up of Paul&#8217;s meaning. For
he makes a concession, as if he had said: &#8220;Be it so, that thou hast
knowledge; he who seeth thee, though he is not endowed with knowledge, is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>notwithstanding</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>confirmed by thine example to venture upon the same thing, while he would
never have taken such a step if he had not had one to take the lead. Now when he
has one to imitate, he thinks that he has a sufficient excuse in the
circumstance that he is imitating another, while in the meantime he is acting
from an evil conscience.&#8221; For
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>weakness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>here means ignorance, or scruple of conscience. I am aware, at the same
time, in what way others explain it; for they understand <i>the occasion of
stumbling </i>to<i> </i>be this &#8212; when ignorant persons, induced by
example, imagine that in this way they perform some kind of religious service to
God, but this idea is quite foreign to Paul&#8217;s meaning. For he reproves
them, as I have said,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f371b</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because they emboldened the ignorant to hurry on, contrary to conscience, to
attempt what they did not think it lawful for them to do. To be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>built
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>means here &#8212; to be
<i>confirmed</i>.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f372A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Now that is a ruinous kind of

an evil it is, that mankind commonly think so little of &#8212; that of
venturing upon anything with a doubtful or opposing conscience. For the object
to which our whole life ought to be directed, is the will of the Lord. This,
therefore, is the one thing that vitiates all our actions, when we disregard
it.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f373A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">This we do, not merely by an outward action,
but even by a thought of the mind, when we allow ourselves in anything in
opposition to conscience, even though the thing be not evil in itself. Let us
bear in mind, therefore, that whenever we take a step in opposition to
conscience, we are on the high road to ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I read, however, the sentence interrogatively, thus:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall he perish through thy
knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>as though he had said:
&#8220;Is<i> </i>it reasonable that thy knowledge should give occasion of ruin
to thy brother? Is it for this reason that thou knowest what is right, that thou
mayest cause another&#8217;s ruin!&#8221; He makes use of the term
<i>brother</i>,<i> </i>in order to expose their pride as unfeeling, in this way:
&#8220;It<i> </i>is true that the person whom you despise is <i>weak</i>,<i>
</i>but still he is your <i>brother</i>,<i> </i>for God has adopted him. You act
a cruel part, therefore, in having no concern for your brother.&#8221; There is,
however, still greater force in what follows &#8212; that even those that are
ignorant or weak have been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>redeemed with the blood of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>for nothing were more unseemly
than this, that while Christ did not hesitate to die, in order that the weak
might not perish, we, on the other hand, reckon as nothing the salvation of
those who have been redeemed with so great a price. A memorable saying, by which
we are taught how precious the salvation of our brethren ought to be in our
esteem, and not merely that of all, but of each individual in particular,
inasmuch as the blood of Christ was poured out for each
individual!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When ye sin so against the

one that is weak is the price of Christ&#8217;s blood, that man who, for the
sake of a very small portion of meat, hurries back again to death the brother
who has been redeemed by Christ, shows how contemptible the blood of Christ is
in his view. Hence contempt of this kind is an open insult to Christ. In what
way a weak conscience may be wounded has been already explained &#8212; when it
is <i>built up </i>in what is evil
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

more severely their disdainful liberty, he declares, that we ought not merely to
refrain from a single banquet rather than injure a <i>brother</i>,<i> </i>but
ought to give up the eating of meats during our whole life. Nor does he merely
prescribe what ought to be done, but declares that he would himself act in this
way. The expression, it is true, is hyperbolical, as it is scarcely possible
that one should refrain from eating flesh during his whole life, if he remain in

but his meaning is, that he would rather make no use of his liberty in any
instance, than be an </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>occasion of
offense </i></font><font face="Palatino">to the weak. For participation is in no
case lawful, unless it be regulated by the rule of love. Would that this were
duly pondered by those who make everything subservient to their own advantage,
so that they cannot endure to give up so much as a hair&#8217;s-breadth of their
own right for the sake of their brethren; and that they would attend not merely
to what Paul teaches, but also to what he marks out by his own example! How
greatly superior he is to us! When <i>he</i>,<i> </i>then, makes no hesitation
in subjecting himself thus far to his brethren, which of us would not submit to
the same condition?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, however difficult it is to act up to this
doctrine, so far as the meaning is concerned, his easy, were it not that some
have corrupted it by foolish glosses, and others by wicked calumnies. Both
classes err as to the meaning of the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offend</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>For they understand the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to mean, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>incurring the hatred
or displeasure of men</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or what is nearly
the same thing,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> doing what
displeases them, or is not altogether agreeable to
them</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>But it appears very manifestly
from the context, that it means simply to hinder a brother by bad example (as an
obstacle thrown in his way) from the right course, or to give him occasion of
falling. Paul, therefore, is not here treating of the retaining of the favor of
men, but of the assisting of the weak, so as to prevent their falling, and
prudently directing them, that they may not turn aside from the right path. But
(as I have said) the former class are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foolish</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>while the latter are also <i>wicked </i>and impudent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Those are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foolish</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>who allow Christians scarcely any use of things indifferent, lest they
should
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>superstitious persons. &#8220;Paul,&#8221;<i> </i>say they,
&#8220;prohibits<i> </i>here everything that may give occasion of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offense</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>Now to eat flesh on Friday will not fail to give
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offense</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and hence we must abstain from it, not merely when there are some weak
persons present, but in every case without exception, for it is possible that
they may come to know of it.&#8221;<i> </i>Not to speak of their
misinterpretation of the word rendered
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>occasion of
offense</i></font><font face="Palatino">, they fall into a grievous blunder in
not considering that Paul here inveighs against those who impudently abuse their
knowledge in the presence of the weak, whom they take no pains to
instruct.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence there will be no occasion for reproof, if
instruction has been previously given. Farther, Paul does not command us to
calculate, whether there may be an occasion of offense in what we do, except
when the danger is present to our view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I come now to the other class. These are pretended
followers of Nicodemus,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f375A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">who under this pretext conform themselves to
the wicked by participating in their idolatry, and not contented with justifying
what they do amiss, are desirous also to bind others to the same necessity.
Nothing could be said with greater plainness to condemn their perverse
dissimulation than what Paul here teaches &#8212; that all who by their example
allure the weak to idolatry, commit a grievous outrage against God as well as
men. Yet they eagerly shield themselves from this by endeavoring to show that
superstitions ought to be cherished in the hearts of the ignorant, and that we
ought to lead the way before them to idolatry, lest a free condemnation of
idolatry should
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>them. Hence I will not do them the honor of dwelling upon a refutation of
their impudence. I simply admonish my readers to compare Paul&#8217;s times with
ours, and judge from this whether it is allowable to be present at mass, and
other abominations, giving so much

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Am I not
free</i>?</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He confirms by facts what he had
stated immediately before, &#8212; that he would rather never taste of flesh
during his whole life, than give occasion of stumbling to a brother, and, at the
same time, he shows that he requires nothing more from them than what he had
himself practiced. And, assuredly, natural equity requires that whatever law is
imposed by any one upon others, should be submitted to by himself. More
especially a Christian teacher should impose upon himself this necessity, that
he may have it always in his power to confirm his doctrine by an exemplary life.
We know by experience, that it is a very unpleasant thing that Paul required
from the Corinthians &#8212; to refrain, for the sake of their brethren, from
making use of the liberty that was allowed them. He could scarcely have demanded
this, if he had not taken the lead and shown them the way. And he had, it is
true, promised that he would do this, but, as he might not be believed by all on
his simply promising for the future, he makes mention of what he had already
done. He brings forward a remarkable instance, in respect of his having denied
himself the liberty which he might otherwise have used, purely in order that he
might give the false Apostles no occasion for calumniating. He had preferred to
earn his food with his own hands, rather than be supported at the expense of the
Corinthians, to whom he administered the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He treats, however, at great length of the right of
the Apostles to receive food and clothing. This he does, partly for the purpose
of stirring them up the more to forego many things for the sake of their
brethren after his example, because they were unduly tenacious in the retaining
of their own rights, and partly for the purpose of exposing more fully in view
the unreasonableness of calumniators, who took occasion for reviling from what
was anything but blameworthy. He speaks, also, interrogatively, in order to
press the matter home more closely. The question &#8212; Am
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I not
free?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is of a general nature. When he
adds &#8212; Am </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I not an
Apostle</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>he specifies a particular kind
of liberty. &#8220;If<i> </i>I am an Apostle of Christ, why should my condition
be worse than that of others?&#8221; Hence he proves his liberty on the ground
of his being an Apostle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have I not seen Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>He expressly adds this, in order
that he may not be reckoned inferior in any respect, to the other Apostles, for
this one thing the malevolent and envious bawled out on all occasions &#8212;
that he had received from the hands of men whatever he had of the gospel,
inasmuch as he had never seen Christ. And, certainly, he had not had converse
with Christ while he was in the world, but Christ had appeared to him after his
resurrection. It was not a smaller privilege, however, to have seen Christ in
his immortal glory, than to have seen him in the abasement of mortal flesh. He
makes mention, also, afterwards of this vision,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:8,) and mention is made of it twice in the Acts,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440903&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
9:3, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;442206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
22:6.) Hence this passage tends to establish his call, because, although he had
not been set apart as one of the twelve, there was no less authority in the
appointment which Christ published from heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are not ye my
work</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>He now, in the <i>second
</i>place, establishes his Apostleship from the effect of it, because he had
gained over the Corinthians to the Lord by the gospel. Now this is a great thing
that Paul claims for himself, when he calls their conversion <i>his work</i>,<i>
</i>for it is in a manner a new creation of the soul. But how will this
correspond with what we had above &#8212; that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">he that planteth is
nothing, and he that watereth is
nothing?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 3:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I answer, that as God is the efficient cause, while
man, with his preaching, is an instrument that can do nothing of itself, we must
always speak of the efficacy of the ministry in such a manner that the entire
praise of the work may be reserved for God alone. But in some cases, when the
ministry is spoken of, man is compared with God, and then that statement holds
good &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that planteth is
nothing, and he that watereth is nothing</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i>
</i>for what can be left to a man if he is brought into competition with God?
Hence Scripture represents ministers as nothing in comparison with God; but when
the ministry is simply treated of without any comparison with God, then, as in
this passage, its efficacy is honorably made mention of, with signal encomiums.
For, in that case, the question is not, what man can do of himself without God,
but, on the contrary, God himself, who is the author, is conjoined with the
instrument, and the Spirit&#8217;s influence with man&#8217;s labor. In other
words, the question is not, what man himself accomplishes by his own power, but
what God effects through his hands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I am not an Apostle to
others</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The sum of this tends to the
establishing of his authority among the Corinthians, so as to place it beyond
all dispute. &#8220;If there are those,&#8221; says he, &#8220;who<i> </i>have
doubts as to my Apostleship, to you, at least, it ought to be beyond all doubt,
for, as I planted your Church by my ministry, you are either not believers, or
you must necessarily recognize me as all Apostle. And that he may not seem to
rest in mere words, he states that the reality itself was to be
seen,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f378A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">because God had sealed his Apostleship by the
faith of the Corinthians. Should any one, however, object, that this suits the
false Apostles too, who gather disciples to themselves, I answer, that pure
doctrine is above all things required, in order that any one may have a
confirmation of his ministry in the sight of God from its effect. There is
nothing, therefore, here to furnish impostors with matter of congratulation, if
they have deceived any of the populace, nay, even nations and kingdoms, by their
falsehoods. Although in some cases persons are the occasion of spreading the
kingdom of Christ, who, nevertheless, <i>do not preach the gospel
sincerely</i>,<i> </i>as is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
1:16, it is not without good reason that Paul infers from the fruit of his
labor, that he is divinely commissioned: for the structure of the Corinthian
Church was such, that the blessing of God could easily be seen shining forth in
it, which ought to have served as a confirmation of Paul&#8217;s
office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My defense.

present in hand, it appears also to have been his intention to beat down, in
passing, the calumnies of those who clamored against his call, as if he had been
one of the ordinary class of ministers. &#8220;I<i> </i>am accustomed,&#8221;<i>
</i>says he, &#8220;to<i> </i>put you forward as my shield, in the event of any
one detracting from the honor of my Apostleship.&#8221; Hence it follows, that
the Corinthians are injurious and inimical to themselves, if they do not
acknowledge him as such, for if their faith was a solemn attestation of
Paul&#8217;s Apostleship, and his

them,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f381A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">for Paul ate and drank, but not at the
expense of the Church. This, then, was one liberty that he dispensed with. The
other was, that he had not a wife &#8212; to be maintained, also, at the public
expense. Eusebius infers from these words that Paul was married, but had left
his wife somewhere, that she might not be a burden to the Churches, but there is
no foundation for this, for he might bring forward this, even though unmarried.
In honoring a Christian wife with the name of <i>sister</i>,<i> </i>he
intimates, first of all, by this, how firm and lovely ought to be the connection
between a pious pair, being held by a double tie. Farther he hints at the same
time what modesty and honorable conduct ought to subsist between them. Hence,
too, we may infer, how very far marriage is from being unsuitable to the
ministers of the Church. I pass over the fact, that the Apostles made use of it,
as to whose example we shall have occasion to speak ere long, but Paul here
teaches, in general terms, what is allowable for all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even as the other
Apostles.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In addition to the
Lord&#8217;s permission, he mentions the common practice of others. And with the
view of bringing out more fully the waiving of his right, he proceeds step by
step. In the first place, he brings forward the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Apostles</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>He then adds, &#8220;Nay,<i> </i>even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the brethren of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>themselves also make use of it
without hesitation &#8212; nay more, Peter himself, to whom the first place is
assigned by consent of all, allows himself the same liberty.&#8221; By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the brethren of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he means John and James, who
<i>were accounted pillars</i>,<i> </i>as he states elsewhere.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
2:9.) And, agreeably to what is customary in Scripture, he gives the name of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to those who were connected with Him by relationship.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, if any one should think to establish Popery from
this, he would act a ridiculous part. We confess that Peter was acknowledged as
first among the Apostles, as it is necessary that in every<i> </i>society there
should always be some one to preside over the others, and they were of their own
accord prepared to respect<i> </i>Peter for the eminent endowments by which he
was distinguished, as it is proper to esteem and honor all that excel in the
gifts of God&#8217;s grace.<i> </i>That preeminence, however, was not lordship
&#8212; nay more, it had nothing resembling lordship. For while he was eminent
among the others, still he was subject to them as his colleagues. Farther, it is
one thing to have pre-eminence in one Church, and quite another, to claim for
one&#8217;s self a kingdom or dominion over the whole world. But indeed, even
though we should concede everything as to Peter, what has this to do with the
Pope? For as Matthias succeeded Judas,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
1:26,) so some Judas might succeed<i> </i>Peter. Nay more, we see that during a
period of more than nine hundred years among his successors, or at least among
those who boast that they are his successors, there has not been one who was one
whit better than Judas. This, however, is not the <i>place </i>to treat of these
points. Consult my Institutes. (Volume 3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">One thing farther must here be noticed, that the
Apostles had no horror of marriage, which the Papal clergy so much abominate, as
unbecoming the sanctity of their order. But it was after their time that that
admirable discovery was made, that the priests of the Lord are polluted if they
have intercourse with their lawful wives; and, at length matters came to such a
pitch, that Pope Syricius did not hesitate to call marriage &#8220;<i>a
pollution of the flesh</i>,<i> </i>in which no one can please God.&#8221; What
then must become of the poor Apostles, who continued in that pollution until
death? Here, however, they have contrived a refined subtilty to effect their
escape; for they say that the Apostles gave up the use of the mar-ridge bed, but
<i>led about </i>their wives with them, that they might receive the fruits of
the gospel, or, in other words, support at the public expense. As if they could
not have been maintained by the Churches, unless they wandered about from place
to place; and farther, as if it were a likely thing that they would run hither
and thither of their own accord, and without any necessity, in order that they
might live in idleness at the public expense! For as to the explanation given by
Ambrose, as referring to other persons&#8217; wives, who followed the Apostles
for the purpose of hearing their doctrine, it is exceedingly
forced.</font><br></div>

harshness, rendered it in the pretense. Now, by <i>three </i>comparisons, and
these, too, taken from common life, he makes it out that it was allowable for
him to live, if he chose, at the public expense of the Church, to show that he
assumes nothing to himself but what human nature itself teaches us is
reasonable. The <i>first </i>is taken from military law, for soldiers are wont
to have their provisions furnished to them at the public expense. The <i>second
</i>is taken from vine-dressers, for the husbandman plants a vine &#8212; not to
throw away his pains, but to gather the fruit. The <i>third </i>is taken from
keepers of cattle, for the shepherd does not lay out his labor for nothing, but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eats of the milk of the
flock</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; that<i> </i>is, he is supported
from the produce. As natural equity points out this as reasonable, who will be
so unjust as to refuse sustenance to the pastors of the Church? While it may
happen, that some serve as soldiers at their own expense, as, for example, the
Romans in ancient times, when no tribute was as yet paid, and there were no
taxes,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f383A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">this does not militate against Paul&#8217;s
statement, for he simply takes his argument from common and everywhere received

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Say I these things as a
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>Lest any one should cavil, and say
that in the things of the Lord the case is different, and therefore that he had
to no purpose brought forward so many comparisons, he now adds, that the very
same thing is commanded by the Lord. To speak
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as a

according to the perverse judgment of the flesh, (as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:5.) Here, however, it means &#8212; bringing forward only those things that
are in common use among men, and are merely current (as they speak) in a human
court. Now, that God himself designed that the labors of men should be
remunerated by wages, he proves from this, that he prohibits the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>muzzling of the mouth of the ox
that treadeth out the corn;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and with the
view of applying it to the subject in hand, he says, that God was not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>concerned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as to oxen, but rather had regard to men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the first place, it may be asked, Why has he more
particularly selected this proof, while he had in the law passages that were
much clearer? as for example,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;052415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
24:15,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The wages of the hireling
shall not remain with thee over night.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one, however, will take a nearer view, he will
acknowledge that there is more force in this quotation, in which the Lord
requires cattle to be taken care of, for from this it is inferred, from the less
to the greater, how much equity he requires among men, when he wishes that it
should be shown to brute animals. When he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God does not take care for
oxen</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>you are not to understand him as
meaning to exclude oxen from the care of God&#8217;s Providence, inasmuch as he
does not overlook even the least sparrow.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400626&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
6:26, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401029&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:29.) Nor is it as if he meant to expound that precept allegorically, as some
hair-brained spirits take occasion from this to turn everything into allegories.
Thus they turn dogs into men, trees into angels, and turn all scripture into a
laughing-stock.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul&#8217;s meaning is simple &#8212; that, when the
Lord enjoins humanity to oxen, he does not do it for the sake of oxen, but
rather from a regard to men, on whose account, too, the very oxen were created.
That compassion, therefore, towards oxen should be a stimulus to us to stir up
to the exercise of humanity among us, as Solomon says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;201210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
12:10,)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The righteous man hath a
care over his beast,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">but the bowels
of the wicked are cruel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let it then be understood by you, that God is not
<i>so </i>concerned for oxen, as to have had merely a regard to oxen in making
that law, for he had mankind in view, and wished to accustom them to equity,
that they might not defraud the workman of his hire. For it is not the ox that
has the principal part in plowing or treading out the corn, but man, by whose
industry the ox himself is set to work. Hence, what he immediately adds &#8212;
He </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that ploweth, should plow in
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>etc. is an exposition of the
precept, as if he had said, that it extends generally to any kind of recompense
for labor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because he that ploweth ought to
plow in hope.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is a twofold reading
in this passage, even in the Greek manuscripts, but the one that is more
generally received is &#8212; <i>He that thrasheth</i>,<i> in hope of partaking
of his hope</i>.<i> </i>At the same time, the one that does not repeat the term
<i>hope </i>twice in the second clause appears simpler, and more
natural.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f384A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hence, if I were at liberty to choose, I
would prefer to read it thus: <i>He that ploweth should plow in hope</i>,<i> and
he that thrasheth in hope of participating</i>.<i> </i>As, however, the most of
the Greek manuscripts agree in the former reading, and as the meaning remains
the same, I have not ventured to make change upon it. Now he expounds the
preceding injunction, and hence he says, that it is an unjust thing that the
husbandman should lay out his pains to no purpose in plowing and thrashing, but
that the end of his labor is the hope of receiving the fruits. As it is so, we
may infer, that this belongs to oxen also, but Paul&#8217;s intention was to
extend it farther, and apply it principally to men. Now, the husbandman is said
to be <i>a </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>partaker of his
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>when he enjoys the produce which
he has obtained when reaping, but hoped for when plowing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If we have sown unto you
spiritual things</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>There was one cavil
remaining &#8212; for it might be objected, that labors connected with this life
should without doubt have food and clothing as their reward; and that plowing
and thrashing yield fruit, of which those that labor in these things are
partakers; but that it is otherwise with the gospel, because its fruit is
spiritual; and hence the minister of the word, if he would receive fruit
corresponding to his labor, ought to demand nothing that is carnal. Lest any
one, therefore, should cavil in this manner, he argues from the greater to the
less. &#8220;Though<i> </i>food and clothing are not of the same nature with a
minister&#8217;s labors, what injury do you sustain, if you recompense what is
inestimable with a thing that is small and contemptible? For in proportion to
the superiority of the soul above the body, does the word of the Lord excel
outward sustenance,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f385A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">inasmuch as it is the food of the
soul.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If others assume this power over
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Again he establishes his own right
from the example of others. For why should he alone be denied what others
assumed as their due? For as no one labored more than he among the Corinthians,
no one was more deserving of a reward. He does not, however, make mention of
what he has done, but of what he would have done in accordance with his right,
if he had not of his own accord refrained from using it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But we have not used this
power.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He returns now to the point on
which the matter hinges &#8212; that he had of his own accord given up that
power which no one could refuse him, and that he was prepared rather
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to suffer all
things,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>than by the use of his liberty
throw any impediment in the way of the progress of the gospel. He wishes,
therefore, that the Corinthians should, after his example, keep this end in view
&#8212; to do nothing that would hinder or retard the progress of the gospel;
for what he declares respecting himself it was their duty to perform according
to their station; and he confirms here what he had said previously &#8212; that
we must consider what is <i>expedient</i>.<i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Know ye
not,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Apart from the question that he
discusses, he appears to have dwelt the longer in taking notice of this point,
with the view of reproaching the Corinthians indirectly for their malignity in
allowing the ministers of Christ to be reviled in a matter that was so
justifiable. For if Paul had not of his own accord refrained from using his
liberty, there was a risk of the progress of the gospel being obstructed. Never
would the false Apostles have gained that point, had not ingratitude, to which
the Corinthians were already prone, opened up the way for their calumnies. For
they ought to have repelled them sharply; but instead of this they showed
themselves excessively credulous, so that they would have been prepared to
reject the gospel, if Paul had used his right. Such contempt of the gospel, and
such cruelty towards their Apostle, deserved to be more severely reproved; but
Paul, having found another occasion, touches upon it indirectly and mildly, with
his usual modesty, that he may admonish them without affronting
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again he makes use of a new comparison, to prove that
he had not used the power that he had from the Lord. Nor does he any longer
borrow examples from any other source, but shows that this has been appointed by
the Lord &#8212; that the Churches should provide for the support of their
ministers. There are some that think that there are <i>two </i>comparisons in
this passage, and they refer the<i> former </i>to the Lord&#8217;s priests, and
the <i>latter </i>to those that acted as priests to the heathen gods. I am,
however, rather of opinion that Paul expresses, as he is accustomed, the same
thing by different terms. And, truly, it would have been a weak argument that
was derived from the practice of the heathens, among whom the revenues of the
priesthood were not devoted to food and clothing, but to magnificent dresses,
royal splendor, and profuse luxury. These would, therefore, have been things too
remote. I do not call it in question, however, that he has pointed out different
kinds of ministerial offices; for there were priests of a higher order, and
there were afterwards Levites, who were inferior to them, as is well known; but
that is not much to the point.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum is this &#8212; &#8220;The Levitical priests
were ministers of the Israelitish Church; the Lord appointed <i>them
</i>sustenance from their ministry; hence in ministers of the Christian Church
the same equity must be observed at the present day. Now the ministers of the
Christian Church are those that preach the gospel.&#8221; This passage is quoted
by Canonists, when they wish to prove that idle bellies must be fattened up, in
order that they may perform their
masses;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f387A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">but how absurdly, I leave it to children
themselves to judge. Whatever is stated in the Scriptures as to the support to
be given to ministers, or the honor that is to be put upon them, they
immediately seize hold of it, and twist. it to their own advantage. For my part,
however, I simply admonish my readers to consider attentively Paul&#8217;s
words. He argues that pastors, who labor in the preaching of the gospel, ought
to be supported, because the Lord in ancient times appointed sustenance for the
priests, on the ground of their serving the Church. Hence a distinction must be
made between the ancient priesthood and that of the present day. Priests under
the law were set apart to preside over the sacrifices, to serve the altar, and
to take care of the tabernacle and temple. Those at the present day are set
apart to preach the word and to dispense the sacraments. The Lord has appointed
no sacrifices for his sacred ministers to be engaged
in;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f388A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">there are no altars for them to stand at to
offer sacrifices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence appears the absurdity of those who apply this
comparison, taken from sacrifices, to anything else than to the preaching of the
gospel. Nay farther, it may be readily inferred from this passage, that all
Popish priests, from the head himself to the lowest member, are guilty of
sacrilege, who devour the revenues appointed for true ministers, while they do
not in any way discharge their duty. For what ministers does the Apostle order
to be maintained? Those that apply themselves to the preaching of the gospel.
What right then have <i>they </i>to claim for themselves the revenues of the
priesthood?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f389A

in opposition to the false apostles, when they endeavored to find a pretext for
reviling, as will appear more fully from what follows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable statement, from which we learn,
in the first place, what, as to ministers, is the nature, and what the closeness
of the tie that is involved in their calling, and farther, what the pastoral
office imports and includes. Let not the man, then, who has been once <i>called
</i>to it, imagine that he is any longer at liberty to withdraw when he chooses,
if, perhaps, he is harassed with vexatious occurrences,<i> </i>or weighed down
with misfortunes, for he is devoted to the Lord and to the Church, and bound by
a sacred tie, which it were criminal to break asunder. As to the <i>second

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reward</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

my part, I understand the man who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>does this thing
willingly,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to be the man who acts with
such cheerfulness, that, being intent upon edifying, as his one object of
desire, he declines nothing that he knows will be profitable to the Church; as,
on the other hand, he terms those
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unwilling</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>who in their actings submit, indeed, to necessity, but act grudgingly,
because it is not from inclination. For it always happens that the man who
undertakes any business with zeal, is also prepared of his own accord to submit
to everything, which, if left undone, would hinder the accomplishment of the
work. Thus Paul, being one that acted
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>willingly</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>did not teach in a mere perfunctory manner, but left nothing undone that he
knew to be fitted to promote and further his doctrine. <i>This </i>then was his

labor</i></font><font face="Palatino">,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f395A </font></sup><font face="Palatino">and <i>this </i>his ground of
g<i>lorying</i> &#8212; that<i> </i>he did with readiness of mind forego his
right in respect of his applying himself to the discharge of his office
willingly and with fervent zeal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if unwillingly, a dispensation
is committed to me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In whatever way
others explain these words, the natural meaning, in my opinion, is this &#8212;
that God does not by any means approve of the service done by the man who
performs it grudgingly, and, as it were, with a reluctant mind. Whenever,
therefore, God has enjoined anything upon us, we are mistaken, if we think that
we have discharged it aright, when we perform it <i>grudgingly</i>;<i> </i>for
the Lord requires that his servants be <i>cheerful</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 9:7,) so as to delight in obeying him, and manifest their
cheerfulness by the promptitude with which they act. In short, Paul means, that
he would act in accordance with his calling, only in the event of his performing
his duty willingly and cheerfully.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What then is my reward?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He infers from what goes before, that he has a
ground of glorying; in this, that he labored gratuitously in behalf of the
Corinthians, because it appears from this, that he applied himself willingly to
the office of teaching, inasnmuch as he vigorously set himself to obviate all
the hindrances in the way of the gospel; and not satisfied with merely teaching,
endeavored to further the doctrine of it by every method. This then is the sum.
&#8220;I<i> </i>am under the necessity of preaching the gospel: if I do it not,
wo is unto me, for I resist God&#8217;s calling. But it is not enough to preach,
unless I do it willingly; for he who fulfils the commandment of God unwillingly,
does not act, as becomes him, suitably to his office. But if I obey God
willingly, it will in that case be allowable for me to glory. Hence it was
necessary for me to make the gospel
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>without
charge</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that I might glory on good
ground.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Papists endeavor from this passage to establish their
contrivance as to works of
<i>supererogation</i>.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f396A
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Paul,&#8221;<i> </i>they say,
&#8220;would<i> </i>have fulfilled the duties of his office by preaching the
gospel, but he adds something farther over and above. Hence he does something
beyond what he is bound to do, for he distinguishes between what is done
willingly and what is done from necessity.&#8221; I answer, that Paul, it is
true, went a greater length than the ordinary calling of pastors required,
because he refrained from taking pay, which the Lord allows pastors to take. But
as it was a part of his duty to provide against every occasion of offense that
he foresaw, and as he saw, that the course of the gospel would be impeded, if he
made use of his liberty, though that was out of the ordinary course, yet I
maintain that even in that case<i> </i>he rendered to God nothing more than was
due. For I ask: &#8220;Is<i> </i>it not the part of a good pastor to remove
occasions of offense, so far as it is in his power to do so?&#8221; I ask again,
&#8220;Did Paul do anything else than this?&#8221;<i> </i>There is no ground,
therefore, for imagining that he rendered to God anything that he did not owe to
him, inasmuch as he did nothing but what the necessity of his office (though it
was an extraordinary necessity) demanded. Away, then, with that wicked
imagination,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f397A

replete with diabolical pride.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

perverted to bear that meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The error of Papists is refuted in a general way in
this manner: Whatever works are comprehended under the law, are falsely termed
works of <i>supererogation</i>,<i> </i>as is manifest from the words of Christ.

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">When ye have done all
things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done
what we were bound to do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we acknowledge that no work is good and
acceptable to God, that is not included in God&#8217;s law. This <i>second
</i>statement I prove in this way: There are two classes of good works; for they
are all reducible either to the service of God or to love. Now nothing belongs
to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the service of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is not included in this summary:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt love the Lord with all
thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>There is also no duty of
<i>love </i>that is not required in that precept &#8212; <i>Love thy neighbor as
thyself</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411230&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
12:30, 31.) But as to the objection that is brought forward by Papists, that it
is possible for one to be acceptable,<i> </i>if he devotes the <i>tenth </i>part
of his income, and infer from this, that if he goes so far as to devote the
<i>fifth </i>part, he does a work of <i>supererogation</i>,<i> </i>it is easy to
remove away this subtilty. For that the deeds of the pious are approved, is not
by any means owing to their perfection, but it is because the imperfection and
deficiency are not reckoned to their account. Hence even if they were doing an
hundred-fold more than they do, they would not, even in that case, exceed the
limits of the duty that they owe.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may not abuse my
power.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From this it appears, that such a
use of our liberty as gives occasion of offense, is an uncontrolled liberty and
abuse. We must keep, therefore, within bounds, that we may not give occasion of
offense. This passage also confirms more fully what I just now touched upon,
that Paul did nothing beyond what the duty of his office required, because it
was not proper that the liberty, that was allowed him by God, should be in any
way abused.</font><br></div>

<i>second</i>.<i> </i>He has as yet shown only by one particular instance how
carefully he had accommodated himself to the weak. Now he subjoins a general
statement, and afterwards enumerates several instances. The <i>general
</i>observation is this &#8212; that while he was not under the power of any
one, he lived as if he had been subject to the inclination of all, and of his
own accord subjected himself to <i>the weak</i>,<i> </i>to whom he was under no
subjection. The <i>particular </i>instances are these &#8212; that among the
Gentiles he lived as if he were a Gentile, and among the Jews he acted as a Jew:
that is, while among Jews he carefully observed the ceremonies<i> </i>of the
law, he was no less careful not to give occasion of offense to the Gentiles by
the observance of them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds the particle <i>as</i>,<i> </i>to intimate
that his liberty was not at all impaired on that account, for, however he might
accommodate himself to men, he nevertheless remained always like himself
inwardly in the sight of God. To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>become all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is to assume all appearances, as
the case <i>may </i>require, or to put on different characters, according to the
diversity among individuals. As to what he says respecting his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>being without
law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and <i>under the law</i>,<i> </i>you
must understand it simply in reference to the ceremonial department; for the
department connected with morals was common to Jews and Gentiles alike, and it
would not have been allowable for Paul to gratify men to that extent. For this
doctrine holds good only as to things indifferent, as has been previously
remarked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though not without law to

be taken in a wrong sense, he had added, by way of correction, that he had
always kept in view one law &#8212; that of subjection to Christ. By this too he
hints that odium was excited against him groundlessly and unreasonably, as if he
called men to an unbridled licentiousness, while he taught exemption from the
bondage of the Mosaic law. Now he calls it expressly
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the law of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>in order to wipe away the
groundless reproach, with which the false apostles branded the gospel, for he

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the weak I became as
weak</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Now again he employs a general
statement, in which he shows to what sort of persons he accomodated himself, and
with what design. He judaized in the presence of the Jews, but not before them
all, for there were many headstrong persons, who, under the influence of
Pharisaical pride or malice, would have wished that Christian liberty were
altogether taken away. To those persons he would never have been so
accommodating, for Christ would not have us care for persons of that
sort.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now his <i>design </i>was, that he might bring them
to Christ &#8212; not that he might promote his own advantage, or retain their
good will. To these things a <i>third </i>must be added &#8212; that it was only
in things indifferent, that are otherwise in our choice,<i> </i>that he
accommodated himself to the weak. Now, if we consider how great a man Paul was,
who stooped thus far, ought we not to feel ashamed &#8212; we who are next to
nothing in comparison with him &#8212; if, bound up in self, we look with
disdain upon the weak, and do not deign to yield up a single point to them? But
while it is proper that we should accommodate ourselves to the weak, according
to the Apostle&#8217;s injunction, and that, in things indifferent, and with a
view to their edification, those act an improper part, who, with the view of
consulting their own ease, avoid those things that would offend men, and the
wicked,<i> </i>too, rather than the weak. Those, however, commit a two-fold
error, who do not distinguish between things indifferent and things unlawful,
and accordingly do not hesitate, for the sake of pleasing men, to engage in
things that the Lord has prohibited. The crowning point, however, of the evil is
this &#8212; that they abuse this statement of Paul to excuse their wicked
dissimulation. But if any one will keep in view these three things that I have
briefly pointed out, he will have it easily in his power to refute those
persons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must observe, also, the word that he makes use of
in the concluding clause;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f401A</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for he shows for what purpose he
endeavors to <i>gain </i>all &#8212; with a view to their salvation. At the same
time, he here at length modifies the general statement, unless perhaps you
prefer the rendering of the old translation, which is found even at this day in
some Greek manuscripts.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

it is not enough to have once entered on the Lord&#8217;s way, if they do not

particular,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f412</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but in so far as was required by the
subject in hand, within which he confines himself &#8212; how far they ought to
yield to the weakness of the brethren. Now he argues from the less to the
greater, that it is an unseemly thing if we grudge to give up our right,
inasmuch as the pugilists eating their
coliphium,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f413</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and that sparingly and not to the full,

crown of leaves that quickly fades, what value ought we to set upon a crown of
immortality? Let us not, therefore, think it hard to give up a little of our
right. It is well known that wrestlers were contented with the most frugal diet,

rather appears to me, however, that his object is to direct the course of
believers straight forward toward the goal, that it may not be wavering and
devious. &#8220;The Lord exercises us here in the way of running and wrestling,
but he sets before us the object at which we ought to aim, and prescribes a sure
rule for our wrestling, that we may not weary ourselves in vain.&#8221; Now he
takes in both the similitudes that he had employed. &#8220;I know,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;<i>whither</i> I am running, and, like a skillful wrestler, I am
anxious that I may not miss my aim.&#8221; Those things ought to kindle up and

<div><font face="Palatino">What he had previously taught by two similitudes, he
now confirms by examples. The Corinthians grew wanton, and gloried, as if they
had served out their time,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f419</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or at least had finished their course,
when they had scarcely left the starting-point. This vain exultation and
confidence he represses in this manner &#8212; &#8220;As I see that you are
quietly taking your ease at the very outset of your course,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I would not have you
ignorant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of what befell the people of
Israel in consequence of this, that their example may arouse you.&#8221; As,
however, on examples being adduced, any point of difference destroys the force
of the comparison, Paul premises, that there is no such dissimilarity between us
and the Israelites, as to make our condition different from theirs. Having it,
therefore, in view to threaten the Corinthians with the same vengeance as had
overtaken them, he begins in this manner &#8212; &#8220;Beware of glorying in
any peculiar privilege, as if you were in higher esteem than they were in the
sight of God.&#8221; For they were favored with the same benefits as we at this
day enjoy; there was a Church of God among them, as there is at this day among
us; they had the same sacraments, to be tokens to them of the grace of
God;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

this &#8212; &#8220;If God spared not them, neither will he spare you, for your
condition is similar.&#8221; That similarity he proves from this &#8212; that
they had been honored with the same tokens of God&#8217;s grace, for the
sacraments are badges by which the c of God is distinguished. He treats first of
baptism, and teaches that the cloud, which protected the Israelites in the
desert from the heat of the sun, and directed their course, and also their
passage through the sea, was to them as a baptism he says, also, that in the
manna, and the water flowing from the rock, there was a sacrament which
corresponded with the sacred Supper.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv</font><font face="Palatino">
to be used here instead of
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn</font><font face="Palatino">,
agreeably to the common usage of Scripture, because we are assuredly baptized in
the name of Christ, and not of any mere man, as he has stated in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:13, and that for two reasons. These are, <i>first</i>,<i>
</i>because we are by baptism
initiated</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f423</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> into the doctrine of Christ alone; and,
<i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>because his name alone is invoked, inasmuch as baptism
is founded on his influence alone. They were, therefore,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>baptized in
Moses</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that is, under his guidance or
ministry, as has been already stated. How?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the cloud and in the
sea.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>&#8220;They were, then, baptized
twice,&#8221; some one will say. I answer, that there are <i>two </i>signs made
mention of, making, however, but <i>one </i>baptism, corresponding to
ours.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, however, a more difficult question presents
itself. For it is certain, that the advantage of those gifts, which Paul makes
mention of, was temporal.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f424</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cloud</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>protected them from the heat of the sun, and showed them the way: these are
outward advantages of the present life. In like manner, their passage through
the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>was attended with this effect, that they got clear off from Pharaoh&#8217;s
cruelty, and escaped from imminent hazard of death. The advantage of <i>our
</i>baptism, on the other hand, is spiritual. Why then does Paul turn earthly
benefits into sacraments, and seek to find some spiritual
mystery</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f425</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in them? I answer, that it was not
without good reason that Paul sought in miracles of this nature something more
than the mere outward advantage of the flesh. For, though God designed to
promote his people&#8217;s advantage in respect of the present life, what he had
mainly in view was, to declare and manifest himself to be their God, and under
<i>that</i>,<i> </i>eternal salvation is comprehended.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cloud</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>in various instances,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f426</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is called the symbol of his presence.
As, therefore, he declared by means of it, that he was present with them, as his
peculiar and chosen people, there can be no doubt that, in addition to an
earthly advantage, they had in it, besides, a token of spiritual life. Thus its
use was twofold, as was also that of the passage through the sea, for a way was
opened up for them through the midst of the sea, that they might escape from the
hand of Pharaoh; but to what was this owing, but to the circumstance, that the
Lord, having taken them under his guardianship and protection, determined by
every means to defend them? Hence, they concluded from this, that they were the
objects of God&#8217;s care, and that he had their salvation in charge. Hence,
too, the Passover, which was instituted to celebrate the remembrance<i> </i>of
their deliverance, was nevertheless, at the same time, a sacrament of Christ.
How so? Because God had, under a temporal benefit, manifested himself as a
Savior. Any one that will attentively consider these things, will find that
there is no absurdity in Paul&#8217;s words. Nay more, he will perceive both in
the spiritual substance and in the visible sign a most striking correspondence
between the baptism of the Jews, and ours.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is however objected again, that we do not find a
word of all this.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f427</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This I admit, but there is no doubt,
that God by his Spirit supplied the want of outward preaching, as we may see in
the instance of the brazen serpent, which was, as Christ himself testifies, a
spiritual sacrament,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:14,) and yet not a word has come down to us as to this
thing,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f428</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but the Lord revealed to believers of
that age, in the manner he thought fit, the secret, which would otherwise have
remained hid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The same spiritual
meat</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He now makes mention of the other
sacrament, which corresponds to the Holy Supper of the Lord. &#8220;The<i>
</i>manna,&#8221; says he, &#8220;and<i> </i>the water that flowed forth from
the rock, served not merely for the food of the body, but also for the spiritual
nourishment of souls.&#8221; It is true, that both were means of sustenance for
the body, but this does not hinder their serving also another purpose. While,
therefore, the Lord relieved the necessities of the body, he, at the same time,
provided for the everlasting welfare of souls. These two things would be easily
reconciled,<i> </i>were there not a difficulty presented in Christ&#8217;s
words,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430631&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
6:31,) where he makes the manna the corruptible food of the belly, which he
contrasts with the true food of the soul. That statement appears to differ
widely from what Paul says here. This knot, too, is easily solved. It is the
manner of scripture, when treating of the sacraments, or other things, to speak
in some cases according to the capacity of the hearers, and in that case it has
respect not to the nature of the thing, but to the mistaken idea of the hearers.
Thus, Paul does not always speak of circumcision<i> </i>in the same way, for
when he has a view to the appointment of God in it, he says, that it was <i>a
seal of the righteousness of the faith</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:11,) but when he is disputing with those who gloried in an outward and bare
sign, and reposed in it a mistaken confidence of salvation, he says, that it is
a token of condemnation, because men bind themselves by it <i>to keep the whole
law</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
5:2, 3.) For he takes merely the opinion that the false apostles had of it,
because he contends, not against the pure institution of God, but against their
mistaken view. In this way, as the carnal multitude preferred Moses to Christ,
because he had fed the people in the desert for forty years, and looked to
nothing in the manna but the food of the belly, (as indeed they sought nothing
else,) Christ in his reply does not explain what was meant by the manna, but,
passing over everything else, suits his discourse to the idea entertained by his
hearers. &#8220;Moses is held by you in the highest esteem, and even in
admiration, as a most eminent Prophet, because he filled the bellies of your
fathers in the desert. For this one thing you object against me: I am accounted
nothing by you, because I do not supply you with food for the belly. But if you
reckon corruptible food of so much importance, what ought you to think of the
life-giving bread, with which souls are nourished up unto eternal
life?.&#8221;<i> </i>We see then that the Lord speaks there &#8212; not
according to the nature of the thing, but rather according to the apprehension
of his hearers.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f429</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Paul, on the other hand, looks here
&#8212; not to the ordinance of God, but to the abuse of it by the
wicked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, when he says that the fathers ate
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the same spiritual
meat,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he shows, <i>first</i>,<i>
</i>what is the virtue and efficacy of the Sacraments, and, <i>secondly</i>,<i>
</i>he declares, that the ancient Sacraments of the Law had the same virtue as
ours have at this day. For, if the manna was spiritual food, it follows, that it
is not bare emblems that are presented to us in the Sacraments, but that the
thing represented is at the same time truly imparted, for God is not a deceiver
to feed us with empty fancies.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f430</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">A sign, it
is true, <i>is </i>a sign, and retains its essence, but, as Papists act a
ridiculous part, who dream of transformations, (I know not of what sort,) so it
is not for us to separate between the reality and the emblem which God has
conjoined. Papists confound the reality and the sign: profane men, as, for
example, Suenckfeldius, and the like, separate the signs from the realities. Let
us maintain a middle course,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f431</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or, in other words, let us observe the
connection appointed by the Lord, but still keep them distinct, that we may not
mistakingly transfer to the one what belongs to the other.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It remains that we speak of the <i>second </i>point
&#8212; the resemblance between the ancient signs and ours. It is a well-known
dogma of the schoolmen &#8212; that the Sacraments of the ancient law were
emblems of grace, but ours confer it. This passage is admirably suited for
refuting that error, for it shows that the reality of the Sacrament was
presented to the ancient people of God no less than to us. It is therefore a
base fancy of the Sorbonists, that the holy fathers under the law had the signs
without the reality. I grant, indeed, that the cleftleacy of the signs is
furnished to us at once more clearly and more abundantly from the time of
Christ&#8217;s manifestation in the flesh than it was possessed by the fathers.
Thus there is a difference between us and them only in degree, or, (as they
commonly say,) of &#8220;more<i> </i>and less,&#8221;<i> </i>for we receive more
fully what they received in a smaller measure. It is not as if they had had bare
emblems, while we enjoy the
reality.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f432</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some explain it to mean, that
they</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f433</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>ate the same meat </i>together among
themselves, and do not wish us to understand that there is a comparison between
us and them; but these do not consider Paul&#8217;s object. For what does he
mean to say here, but that the ancient people of God were honored with the same
benefits with us, and were partakers of the same sacraments, that we might not,
from confiding in any peculiar privilege, imagine that we would be exempted from
the punishment which they endured? At the same time, I should not be prepared to
contest the point with any one; I merely state my own opinion. In the meantime,
I am well aware, what show of reason is advanced by those who adopt the opposite
interpretation &#8212; that it suits best with the similitude made use of
immediately before &#8212; that all the Israelites had the same race-ground
marked out for them, and all started from the same point: all entered upon the
same course: all were partakers of the same hope, but many were shut out from
the reward. When, however, I take everything attentively into consideration, I
am not induced by these considerations to give up my opinion; for it is not
without good reason that the Apostle makes mention of two sacraments merely,
and, more particularly, baptism. For what purpose was this, but to contrast them
with us? Unquestionably, if he had restricted his comparison to the body of that
people, he would rather have brought forward circumcision, and other sacraments
that were better known and more distinguished, but, instead of this, he chose
rather those that were more obscure, because they served more as a contrast
between us and them. Nor would the application that he subjoins be otherwise so
suitable &#8212; &#8220;All things that happened to them are examples to us,
inasmuch as we there see the judgments of God that are impending over us, if we
involve ourselves in the same crimes.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That rock was
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>So he absurdly pervert these
words of Paul, as if he had said, that Christ was the spiritual rock, and as if
he were not speaking of that rock which was a visible sign, for we see that he
is expressly treating of outward signs. The objection that they make &#8212;
that the rock is spoken of as <i>spiritual</i>,<i> </i>is a frivolous one,
inasmuch as that epithet is applied to it simply that we may know that it was a
token of a spiritual mystery. In the mean time, there is no doubt, that he
compares our sacraments with the ancient ones. Their <i>second </i>objection is
more foolish and more childish &#8212; &#8220;How could a rock,&#8221; say they,
&#8220;that stood firm in its place, <i>follow </i>the Israelites?&#8221;
&#8212; as if it were not abundantly manifest, that by the word <i>rock </i>is
meant the stream of water, which never ceased to accompany the people. For Paul
extols</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f434</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the grace of God, on this account, that
he commanded the water that was drawn out from the rock to flow forth wherever
the people journeyed, as if the rock itself had followed them. Now if
Paul&#8217;s meaning were, that Christ is the spiritual foundation of the
Church, what occasion were there for his using the past
tense?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f435</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is abundantly manifest, that
something is here expressed that was peculiar to the fathers. Away, then, with
that foolish fancy by which contentious men choose rather to show their
impudence, than admit that they are sacramental forms of
expression!</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f436</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have, however, already stated, that the reality of
the things signified was exhibited in connection with the ancient sacraments.
As, therefore, they were emblems of Christ, it follows, that Christ was
connected with them, not locally, nor by a natural or substantial union, but
sacramentally. On this principle the Apostle says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the rock was
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>for nothing is more common than
metonymy in speaking of sacraments. The name of the thing, therefore, is
transferred here to the sign &#8212; not as if it were strictly applicable, but
figuratively, on the ground of that connection which I have mentioned. I touch
upon this, however, the more slightly, because it will be more largely treated
of when we come to the 11th Chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There remains another question. &#8220;Seeing<i>
</i>that we now in the Supper eat the body of Christ, and drink his blood, how
could the Jews be partakers of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the same spiritual meat and
drink,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>when there was as yet no flesh of
Christ that they could eat?&#8221; I answer, that though his flesh did not as
yet exist, it was, nevertheless, food for them. Nor is this an empty or
sophistical subtilty, for their salvation depended on the benefit of his death
and resurrection. Hence, they required to receive the flesh and the blood of
Christ, that they might participate in the benefit of redemption. This reception
of it was the secret work of the Holy Spirit, who wrought in them in such a
manner, that Christ&#8217;s flesh, though not yet created, was made efficacious
in them. He means, however, that they ate in their own way, which was different
from ours,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f437</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and this is what I have previously
stated, that Christ is now presented to us more fully, according to the measure
of the revelation. For, in the present day, the eating is substantial, which it
could not have been then &#8212; that is, Christ feeds us with his flesh, which
has been sacrificed for us, and appointed as our food, and from this we derive
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But many of
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> We </i>have now the reason why the
Apostle has premised these things &#8212; that we might not claim for ourselves
any dignity or excellence above them, but might walk in humility and fear, for
thus only shall we secure, that we have not been favored in vain with the light
of truth, and with such an abundance of gracious benefits. &#8220;God,&#8221;<i>
</i>says he, &#8220;had chosen them all as his people, but many of them fell
from grace. Let us, therefore, take heed, lest the same thing should happen to
us, being admonished by so many examples, for God will not suffer <i>that </i>to
go unpunished in <i>us</i>, which he punished so severely in
<i>them</i>.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here again it is objected: &#8220;If<i> </i>it is
true, that hypocrites and wicked persons in that age ate
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spiritual
meat</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>do unbelievers in the present day
partake of the reality in the sacraments?&#8221; Some, afraid lest the unbelief
of men should seem to detract from the truth of God, teach that the reality is
received by the wicked along with the sign. This fear, however, is needless, for
the Lord offers, it is true, to the worthy and to the unworthy what he
represents, but all are not capable of receiving it. In the meantime, the
sacrament does not change its nature, nor does it lose anything of its efficacy.
Hence the manna, in relation to God, was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spiritual
meat</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>even to unbelievers, but because
the mouth of unbelievers was but carnal, they did not eat what was given them.
The fuller discussion, however, of this question I reserve for the 11th
Chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they were
overthrown.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Proof is here furnished, by

them, so that they are a lesson to us, that we may not provoke the anger of God
as they did. &#8220;God,&#8221; says he, &#8220;in punishing them has set before
us, as in a picture, his severity, that, instructed by their example, we may

in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;041104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
11:4, etc., though others refer it to what is recorded in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;042664&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
26:64. The people, after having been for some time fed with manna, at length
took a dislike to it, and began to desire other kinds of food, which they had
been accustomed to partake of in Egypt. Now they sinned in two ways, for they
despised the peculiar gift of God, and they eagerly longed after a variety of
meats and delicacies, contrary to the will of God. The Lord, provoked by this
lawless appetite, inflicted upon the people a grievous blow. Hence the place was
called the</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">graves of
lust,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">The Lord by this example testified how much he hates
those lusts that arise from dislike of his gifts, and from our lawless appetite,

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither be ye

that is recorded in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;023207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
32:7, etc. For when Moses made a longer stay upon the mountain than the unseemly
fickleness of the people could endure, Aaron was constrained to make a calf, and
set it up as an object of worship. Not that the people wished to change their
God, but rather to have some visible token of God&#8217;s presence, in
accordance with their carnal apprehension. God, in punishing at that time this
idolatry with the greatest severity, showed by that example how much he abhors
idolatry.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As it is written, The people sat
down</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This passage is rightly
interpreted by few, for they understand intemperance among the people to have
been the occasion of
wantonness,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f441</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in accordance with the common proverb,
&#8220;Dancing comes after a full
diet.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f442</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But Moses speaks of a sacred feast, or
in other words, what they celebrated in honor of the idol. Hence <i>feasting
</i>and <i>play </i>were two appendages of idolatry. For it was customary, both
among the people of Israel and among the rotaries of superstition, to have a
feast in connection with a sacrifice, as a part of divine worship, at which no
profane or unclean persons were allowed to be present. The Gentiles, in addition
to this, appointed sacred games in honor of their idols, in conformity with
which the Israelites doubtless on that occasion worshipped their
calf,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f443</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for such is the presumption of the human
mind, that it ascribes to God whatever pleases itself Hence the Gentiles have
fallen into such a depth of infatuation as to believe, that their gods are
delighted with the basest spectacles, immodest dances, impurity of speech, and
every kind of obscenity. Hence in imitation of them the Israelitish people,
having observed their sacred banquet, rose up to celebrate the games, that
nothing might be wanting in honor of the idol. This is the true and simple
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here it is asked, why the Apostle makes mention
of the feast and the games, rather than of adoration, for this is the chief
thing in idolatry, while the other two things were merely appendages. The reason
is, that he has selected what best suited the case of the Corinthians. For it is
not likely, that they frequented the assemblies of the wicked, for the purpose
of prostrating themselves before the idols, but partook of their feasts, held in
honor of their deities, and did not keep at a distance from those base
ceremonies, which were tokens of idolatry. It is not therefore without good
reason that the Apostle declares, that their particular form of offense is
expressly condemned by God. He intimates, in short, that no part of
idolatry</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f444</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> can be touched without contracting
pollution, and that those will not escape punishment from the hand of God, who
defile themselves with the outward tokens of idolatry.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither let us commit
fornication</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Now he speaks of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fornication</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>in respect of which, as appears from historical accounts, great
licentiousness prevailed among the Corinthians, and we may readily infer from
what goes before, that those who had professed themselves to be Christ&#8217;s
were not yet altogether free from this vice. The punishment of this vice, also,
ought to alarm us, and lead us to bear in mind, how loathsome impure lusts are
to God, for there perished in one day twenty-three thousand, or as Moses says,
twenty-four. Though they differ as to number, it is easy to reconcile them, as
it is no unusual thing, when it is not intended to number exactly and minutely
each head,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f445</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to put down a number that comes near it,
as among the Romans there were those that received the name of
<i>Centumviri</i>,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f446</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>(The <i>Hundred</i>,)<i>
</i>while in reality there were two above the hundred. As there were, therefore,
about twenty-four thousand that were overthrown by the Lord&#8217;s hand &#8212;
that is, above twenty-three, Moses has set down the number <i>above </i>the
mark, and Paul, the number <i>below </i>it, and in this way there is in reality
no difference. This history is recorded in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;042509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
25:9.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There remains, however, one difficulty here &#8212;
why it is that Paul attributes this punishment to fornication, while Moses
relates that the anger of God was aroused against the people on this account
&#8212; that they had initiated themselves in the sacred rites of
Baalpeor.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f447</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But as the defection began with
fornication, and the children of Israel fell into that impiety, not so much from
being influenced by religious
considerations,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f448</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as from being allured by the enticements
of harlots, everything evil that followed from it ought to be attributed to
fornication. For Balaam had given this counsel, that the Midianites should
prostitute their daughters to the Israelites, with the view of estranging them
from the true worship of God. Nay more, their excessive blindness, in allowing
themselves to be drawn into
impiety</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f449</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by the enticements of harlots, was the
punishment of lust. Let us learn, accordingly, that fornication is no light
offense, which was punished on that occasion by God so severely and indeed in a
variety of ways.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither let us tempt
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This part of the exhortation
refers to the history that is recorded in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;042106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
21:6. For the people, having become weary of the length of time, began to
complain of their condition, and to expostulate with God &#8212; &#8220;Why has
God deceived us,&#8221; etc. This murmuring of the people Paul speaks of as a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tempting</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i>
</i>and not without good reason, for <i>tempting </i>is opposed to patience.
What reason was there at that time why the people should rise up against God,
except this &#8212; that, under the influence of base
desire,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f450</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they could not wait in patience the
arrival of the time appointed by the Lord? Let us, therefore, take notice, that
the fountain of that evil against which Paul here warns us is impatience, when
we wish to go before God, and do not give ourselves up to be ruled by Him, but
rather wish to bind him to our inclination and laws. This evil God severely
punished in the Israelitish people. Now he remains always like himself &#8212; a
just Judge. Let us therefore not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tempt</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>him, if we would not have experience of the same
punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable passage in proof of the eternity
of Christ; for the cavil of Erasmus has no force &#8212; &#8220;Let us not tempt
Christ, as some of them tempted <i>God</i>;&#8221;<i> </i>for to supply the word
<i>God </i>is extremely forced.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f451</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Nor is it to be wondered that Christ is
called the Leader of the Israelitish people. For as God was never propitious to
his people except through that Mediator, so he conferred no benefit except
through his hand. Farther, the angel who appeared at first to Moses, and was
always present with the people during their journeying, is frequently called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hwhy</font><font face="Palatino">,
Jehovah.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f452</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us then regard it as a settled
point, that that angel was the Son of God, and was even then the guide of the
Church of which he was the Head. As to the term <i>Christ</i>,<i> </i>from its
having a signification that corresponds with his human nature, it was not as yet
applicable to the Son of God, but it is assigned to him by the communication of
properties, as we read elsewhere, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the Son of Man came down

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither murmur
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Others understand this to be the
murmuring that arose, when the twelve, who had been sent to spy out the land,
disheartened, on their return, the minds of the people. But as that murmuring
was not punished suddenly by any special chastisement from the Lord, but was
simply followed by the infliction of this punishment &#8212; that<i> </i>all
were excluded from the possession of the land, it is necessary to explain this
passage otherwise. It was a most severe punishment, it is true, to be shut out
from entering the land,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f453</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but the words of Paul, when he says that
they were</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
destroyed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destroyer</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>express another kind of chastisement. I refer it, accordingly, to the
history, which is recorded in the sixteenth chapter of Numbers. For when God had
punished the pride of Korah and Abiram, the people raised a tumult against Moses
and Aaron, as if they had been to blame for the punishment which the Lord had
inflicted. This madness of the people God punished by sending down fire from
heaven, which swallowed up many of them &#8212; upwards of fourteen thousand. It
is, therefore, a striking and memorable token of God&#8217;s wrath against
rebels and seditious persons, that murmur against him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Those persons, it is true,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>murmured</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>against Moses; but as they had no ground for insulting him, and had no
occasion for being incensed against him, unless it was that he had faithfully
discharged the duty which had been enjoined upon him by God, God himself was
assailed by that murmuring. Let us, accordingly, bear in mind that we have to do
with God, and not with men, if we rise up against the faithful ministers of God,
and let us know that this
audacity</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f454</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">will not go
unpunished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destroyer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>you may understand the Angel, who executed the judgment of God. Now he
sometimes employs the ministry of bad angels, sometimes of good, in punishing
men, as appears from various passages of Scripture. As Paul here does not make a
distinction between the one and the other, you may understand it of
either.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now all these things happened
as types.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He again repeats it &#8212;
that all these things happened to the Israelites, that they might be types<i>

our <i>eyes</i>.<i> </i>I am well aware, that others philosophize on these words
with great refinement, but I think that I have fully expressed the
Apostle&#8217;s meaning, when I say, that by these examples, like so many
pictures, we are instructed what judgments of God are impending over idolaters,
fornicators, and other contemners of God. For they are lively pictures,
representing God as angry on account of such sins. This exposition, besides
being simple and accurate, has this additional advantage, that it blocks up the
path of certain madmen,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f455</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who wrest this passage for the purpose
of proving, that among that ancient people there was nothing done but what was
shadowy. First of all, they assume that that people is a figure of the Church.
From this they infer, that everything that God promised to them, or accomplished
for them &#8212; all benefits, all
punishments,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f456</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> only prefigured what required to be
accomplished in reality after Christ&#8217;s advent. This is a most pestilential
frenzy, which does great injury to the holy fathers, and much greater still to
God. For that people was a figure of the Christian Church, in such a manner as
to be at the same time a true Church. Their condition represented ours in such a
manner that there was at the same time, even then, a proper condition of a
Church. The promises given to them shadowed forth the gospel in such a way, that
they had it included in them. Their sacraments served to prefigure ours in such
a way, that they were nevertheless, even for that period, true sacraments,
having a present efficacy. In fine, those who at that time made a right use,
both of doctrine, and of signs, were endowed with the same spirit of faith as we
are. These madmen, therefore, derive no support from these words of Paul, which
do not mean that the things that were done in that age were types, in such a way
as to have at that time no reality, but a mere empty show. Nay more, they
expressly teach us, (as we have explained,) that those things which may be of
use </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for our
admonition</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>are there set forth before
us, as in a picture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are written for our
admonition</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This second clause is
explanatory of the former; for it was of no importance to the Israelites, but to
us exclusively, that these things should be committed to
record.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f457</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It does not, however, follow from this,
that these inflictions were not true chastisements from God, suited for their
correction at that time, but as God then inflicted his judgments, so he designed
that they should be kept everlastingly in remembrance for our instruction. For
of what advantage were the history of them to the dead; and as to the living,
how would it be of advantage to them, unless they repented, admonished by the
examples of others? Now he takes for granted the principle, as to which all
pious persons ought to be agreed &#8212; that there is nothing revealed in the
Scriptures, that is not profitable to be known.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Upon whom the ends of the world are
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">te&gt;lh</font><font face="Palatino">
(ends) sometimes means
<i>mysteries</i>;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f458</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and that signification would not
suit in with this passage. I follow, however, the common rendering, as being
more simple. He says then, that the ends of all ages hare come upon us, inasmuch
as the fullness of all things is suitable to this age, because it is now the
last times. For the kingdom of Christ is the main object of the Law and of all
the Prophets. But this statement of Paul is at variance with the common opinion
&#8212; that God, while more severe under the Old Testament, and always ready
and armed for the punishment of crimes, has now begun to be exorable, and more
ready to forgive. They explain, also, our being under the law of grace, in this
sense &#8212; that we have God more placable than the ancients had. But what
says Paul? If God inflicted punishment upon them, he will not the more spare
you. Away, then, with the error, that God is now more remiss in exacting the
punishment of crimes! It must, indeed, be acknowledged, that, by the advent of
Christ, God&#8217;s goodness has been more openly and more abundantly poured
forth towards men; but what has this to do with impunity for the abandoned, who
abuse his grace?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f459</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This one thing only must be noticed, that in the
present day the mode of punishment is different; for as God of old was more
prepared to reward the pious with outward tokens of his blessing, that he might
testify to them his fatherly love, so he showed his wrath more by corporal
punishments. <i>Now</i>,<i> </i>on the other hand, in that fuller revelation
which we enjoy, he does not so frequently inflict visible punishments, and does
not so frequently inflict corporal punishment even upon the wicked. You will
find more on this subject in my
Institutes.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore let him that thinketh
he standeth</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The Apostle concludes from
what goes before, that we must not glory in our beginnings or progress, so as to
resign ourselves to carelessness and
inactivity.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f461</font></sup><font face="Palatino">For the Corinthians gloried in their
condition in such a way, that, forgetting their weakness, they fell into many
crimes. This was a false confidence of such a kind as the Prophets frequently
reprove in the Israelitish people. As, however, Papists wrest this passage for
the purpose of maintaining their impious doctrine respecting faith, as having
constantly doubt connected with
it,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f462</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> let us observe that there are two kinds
of assurance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>one</i> is that which rests on the promises of
God, because a pious conscience feels assured that God will never be wanting to
it; and, relying on this unconquerable persuasion, triumphs boldly and
intrepidly over Satan and sin, and yet, nevertheless, keeping in mind its own
infirmity, casts itself</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f463</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> upon God, and with carefulness and
anxiety commits itself to him. This kind of assurance is sacred, and is
inseparable from faith, as appears from many passages of Scripture, and
especially
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450833&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:33.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>other</i> arises from negligence, when men,
puffed up with the gifts that they have, give themselves no concern, as if they
were beyond the reach of danger, but rest satisfied with their condition. Hence
it is that they are exposed to all the assaults of Satan. This is the kind of
assurance which Paul would have the Corinthians to abandon, because he saw that
they were satisfied with themselves under the influence of a silly conceit. He
does not, however, exhort them to be always anxiously in doubt as to the will of
God, or to tremble from uncertainty as to their salvation, as Papists
dream.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f464</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In short, let us bear in mind, that Paul
is here addressing persons who were puffed up with a base confidence in the
flesh, and represses that assurance which is grounded upon men &#8212; not upon
God. For after commending the Colossians for the solidity or <i>steadfastness of
their faith</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:5,) he exhorts them to be</font><br></div>

remain firm, and to be built up
and</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">confirmed in the faith.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No temptation has taken you.<sup>
</sup></i><sup>f465</sup></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Let others take
their own way of interpreting this. For my part, I am of opinion that it was
intended for their consolation, lest on hearing of such appalling instances of
the wrath of God, as he had previously related, they should feel discouraged,
being overpowered with alarm. Hence, in order that his exhortation might be of
advantage, he adds, that there is room for repentance. &#8220;There<i> </i>is no
reason why you should despond; for I have not had it in view to give you
occasion for despair, nor has anything happened to you but what is common to
men.&#8221;<i> </i>Others are of opinion that he rather chides their cowardice
in giving way, on being so slightly
tried;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f466</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and unquestionably the word rendered
<i>human </i>is sometimes taken to mean
moderate.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f467</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The meaning, then, according to them
would be this: &#8220;Did<i> </i>it become you thus to give way under a slight
trial?&#8221; But as it agrees better with the context, if we consider it as
consolation, I am on this account rather inclined to that view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But God is
faithful</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As he exhorted them to be of
good courage as to the past, in order that he might stir them up to repentance,
so he also comforts them as to the future with a sure hope, on the ground that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God would not suffer them to be
tempted beyond their strength.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He
exhorts them, however, to look to the Lord, because a temptation, however slight
it may be, will straightway overcome us, and all will be over with us, if we
rely upon our own strength. He speaks of the Lord, as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faithful</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>not merely as being true to his promises, but as though he had said. The
Lord is the sure guardian of his people, under whose protection you are safe,
for he never leaves his people destitute. Accordingly, when he has received you
under his protection, you have no cause to fear, provided you depend entirely
upon him. For certainly this were a species of deception, if he were to withdraw
his aid in the time of need, or if he were, on seeing us weak and ready to sink
under the load, to lengthen out our trials still
farther.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f468</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now God helps us in two ways, that we may not be
overcome by the temptation; for he supplies us with strength, and he sets limits
to the temptation. It is of the <i>second </i>of these ways that the Apostle
here chiefly speaks. At the same time, he does not exclude the former &#8212;
that God alleviates temptations, that they may not overpower us by their weight.
For he knows the measure of our power, which he has himself conferred. According
to that, he regulates our temptations. The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>temptation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>I take here as denoting, in a general way,<i> </i>everything that allures
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore, my beloved,
flee,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>etc. The Apostle now returns to
the particular question, from which he had for a little digressed, for, lest
bare doctrine should have little effect among them, he has introduced those
general exhortations that we have read, but now he pursues the discussion on
which he had entered &#8212; that it is not allowable for a Christian man to
connect himself with the superstitions of the wicked, so as to take part in
them.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Flee</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>says he,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> from
idolatry</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>In the first place, let us
observe what meaning he attaches to the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Idolatry</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>He certainly did not suspect the Corinthians of such a degree of ignorance
or carelessness</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f469</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as to think, that they worshipped idols
in their heart. But as they made no scruple of frequenting the assemblies of the
wicked, and observing along with them certain rites instituted in honor of
idols, he condemns this liberty taken by them, as being a very bad example. It
is certain, then, that when he here makes mention of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>idolatry</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>he, speaks of what is outward, or, if you prefer it, of the
profession</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f470</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of idolatry. For as God is said to be
worshipped by the bending of the knee,<i> </i>and other tokens of reverence,
while the principal and genuine worship of him is inward, so is it also as to
idols, for the case holds the same in things opposite. It is to no purpose that
very many in the present day endeavor to excuse outward
actions</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f471</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> on this pretext, that the heart is not
in them, while Paul convicts of idolatry those very acts, and assuredly with
good reason. For, as we owe to God not merely the secret affection of the heart,
but also outward adoration, the man who offers to an idol an appearance of
adoration takes away so much of the honor due to God. Let him allege as he may
that his heart is quite away from it. The action itself is to be seen, in which
the honor that is due to God is transferred to an idol.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I speak as to wise
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As he was about to take his
argument from the mystery of the Supper, he arouses them by this little preface,
that they may consider more attentively the magnitude of the
thing.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f472</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8220;I<i>
</i>do not address mere novices. You understand the efficacy of the sacred
Supper in it we are ingrafted into the Lord&#8217;s body. How unseemly a thing
is it then, that you should enter into fellowship with the wicked, so as to be
united in one body.<i> </i>At the same time, he tacitly reproves their want of
consideration in this respect, that, while accurately instructed in the school
of Christ, they allowed themselves in gross vice, as to which there was no
difficulty in forming an opinion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The cup of
blessing</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>While the sacred Supper of
Christ has two elements &#8212; bread and wine &#8212; he begins with the
second. He calls it, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the cup of
blessing</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>as having been set apart for a
mystical benediction.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

bless</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>as meaning to <i>give
thanks</i>.<i> </i>I acknowledge,<i> </i>indeed, that it is sometimes employed
in this sense, but never in the construction that Paul has here made use of, for
the idea of Erasmus, as to supplying a
preposition,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bless the
cup,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then, is to set it apart for this
purpose, that it may be to us an emblem of the blood of Christ. This is done by
the word of promise, when believers meet together according to Christ&#8217;s
appointment to celebrate the remembrance of his death in this Sacrament. The
consecration, however, which the Papists make use of, is a kind of sorcery
derived from heathens,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f475</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which has nothing in common with the
pure rite observed by Christians. Everything, it is true, that we eat <i>is

witness,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540405&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:5;) but that <i>blessing </i>is for a different purpose &#8212; that
our use of the gifts of God may be pure, and may tend to the glory of their
Author, and to our advantage. On the other hand, the design of the mystical
<i>blessing </i>in the Supper is, that the wine may be no longer a common
beverage, but set apart for the spiritual nourishment of the soul, while it is
an emblem of the blood of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul says, that the <i>cup </i>which has been in this

&#8212; the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
comnunion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of the blood of the Lord. It
is asked, in what sense? Let contention be avoided, and there will be nothing of
obscurity. It is true, that believers are united together by Christ&#8217;s
blood, so as to become one body. It is also true, that a unity of this kind is
with propriety termed
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">koinwni&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(<i>communion</i>.)<i> </i>I make the same acknowledgment as to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

immediately adds, as it were, by way of explanation &#8212; that we
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all become one body, because we
are together partakers of the same bread</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>But whence, I pray you,<i> </i>comes that
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">koinwni&gt;a
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>communion</i>)<i> </i>between us, but from
this, that we are united to Christ in such a way, that</font><br></div>

5:30.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For we must first of all be incorporated (so to
speak) into Christ, that we may be united to each other. In addition to this,
Paul is not disputing at present merely in reference to a mutual fellowship
among men, but as to the spiritual union between Christ and believers, with the
view of drawing from this, that it is an intolerable sacrilege for them to be
polluted by fellowship with idols. From the connection of the passage,
therefore, we may conclude, that
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">koinwni&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>the <i>communion of the blood </i>is that connection which we have with the
blood of Christ, when he engrafts all of us together into his body, that he may
live in us, and we in him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, when the cup is called a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>participation</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>the expression, I acknowledge, is figurative, provided that the truth held
forth in the figure is not taken away, or, in other words, provided that the
reality itself is also present, and that the soul has as truly
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commununion in
the</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> blood</i>,<i> </i>as we drink wine with
the mouth. But Papists could not say this, that <i>the cup of blessing is a
participation in the blood of Christ</i>,<i> </i>for the Supper that they
observe is mutilated and torn: if indeed we can give the name of the Supper to
that strange ceremony which is a patchwork of various human contrivances, and
scarcely retains the slightest vestige of the institution of our Lord. But,
supposing that everything else were as it ought to be, this one thing is at
variance with the right use of the Supper &#8212; the keeping back of the whole
of the people from partaking of the cup, which is the half of the
Sacrament.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The bread which we
break</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>From this it appears, that it was
the custom of the ancient Church to break one loaf, and distribute to every one
his own morsel, in order that there might be presented more clearly to the view
of all believers their union to the one body of Christ. And that this custom was
long kept up appears from the testimony of those who flourished in the three
centuries that succeeded the age of the Apostles. Hence arose the superstition,
that no one dared to touch the bread with his hand, but each one had it put into
his mouth by the priest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we are one
bread.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have already stated above, that
it was not Paul&#8217;s particular design here to exhort us to love, but he
mentions this by the way, that the Corinthians may understand that we must, even
by external profession, maintain that unity which subsists between us and
Christ, inasmuch as we all assemble together to receive the symbol of that
sacred unity. In this second part of the statement, he makes mention only of the
one part of the Sacrament, and it is the manner of Scripture to describe by
Synecdoche</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

readers, in passing, as to this, lest any less experienced person should be put
off his guard by the foolish cavil that is brought forward by certain sycophants

the people of the one half of the Sacrament.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>

a kind of fellowship with God. For the law of Moses admits no one to a feast
upon a sacrifice, but the man who has duly prepared himself. I speak not of
priests merely, but of those among the common people who eat of the remains of
the sacrifice. Hence it follows, that all who eat of the flesh of the sacrificed
victim, are </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>partakers with the
altar</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that is, of the sanctification,
with which God has set apart his Temple, and the sacred rites that are performed
in it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This expression
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>after the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>may seem to be added in order
that the Corinthians, on comparing the two, might set a higher value on the
efficacy of our Supper. &#8220;If there was so much virtue in the ancient
figures and in those rudiments of youthful education, how much more must we
reckon that there is in our mysteries, in which God shines forth much more fully
upon us!&#8221; At the same time, it is more simple, in my opinion, to say that
Paul intended merely by this mark to distinguish the Jews that were still under
the law from those that had been converted to Christ. Now there was a contrast
that remained to be made &#8212; that if the sacred rites appointed by God
sanctify those who observe them, pollution, on the other hand, is contracted
from the sacred rites rendered to
idols.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f477</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For it is God alone that sanctifies, and
hence all strange gods pollute.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

mysteries</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

follows, that the wicked are in like manner introduced by their superstitious
rites into fellowship</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

proceeding to this, answers by an

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What do I say
then?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It might seem at first view as if
the Apostle either argued inconclusively, or ascribed to idols something of
existence and of power. Now it might readily be objected &#8212; &#8220;What
comparison is there between the living God and idols? God connects us with
himself by the sacraments. Be it so. How comes it that idols, which are
<i>nothing</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460804&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 8:4,) have so much power, as to be able to do the like? Do you think
that <i>idols are anything</i>,<i> </i>or can do anything?&#8221; He answers,
that he does not look to the idols
themselves;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f482</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but rather has in view the intention of
those who sacrifice to idols. For that was the source of the pollution that he
had indirectly pointed out. He confesses, therefore, that an idol is nothing. He
confesses that it is a mere delusion when the Gentiles take it upon them to go
through solemn rites of
dedication,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f483</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and that the creatures of God are not
polluted by such fooleries. But as the design of them is superstitious and
condemnable, and as the work is base, he infers, that all who connect themselves
with them as associates, are involved in pollution.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the things <sup>f484</sup>
that the Gentiles sacrifice.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To complete
the answer, a negative must be understood in this way: &#8220;I do not say that
<i>an idol is anything</i>,<i> </i>nor do I imagine it to be endued with any
virtue, but I say that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Gentiles sacrifice to the devil and not to
gods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>those things which they do
sacrifice, and hence I estimate the work by their wicked and impious
superstition. For we must always look to the intention with which a thing is
done. He, then, who connects himself with them, declares that he has fellowship
with them in the same impiety.&#8221; He proceeds accordingly with what he had
commenced: &#8220;If<i> </i>we had to do with God only, those things would be
nothing, but, in relation to men, they become faulty; because no one sits down
to an idol feast, who does not declare himself to be a worshipper of the
idol.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some, however, understand the term <i>demons </i>here
as meaning the imaginary deities of the Gentiles, agreeably to their common way
of speaking of them; for when they speak of <i>demons </i>they meant inferior
deities, as, for example,
heroes,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f485</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and thus the term was taken in a good
sense. Plato, in a variety of instances, employs the term to denote
<i>genii</i>,<i> </i>or angels.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f486</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> That meaning, however, would be quite
foreign to Paul&#8217;s design, for his object is to show that it is no light
offense to have to do with actions that have any appearance of putting honor
upon idols. Hence it suited his purpose, not to extenuate, but rather to magnify
the impiety that is involved in it. How absurd, then, it would have been to
select an honorable term to denote the most heinous wickedness! It is certain
from the Prophet Baruch, (4:7,) that <i>those things that are sacrificed to
idols are sacrificed to devils</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;053217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:17;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;199605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
96:5.) In that passage in the writings of the Prophet, the Greek translation,
which was at that time in common use, has
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">daimo&gt;nia</font><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; <i>demons</i>,<i> </i>and this is its common use in Scripture. How much
more likely is it then, that Paul borrowed what he says from the Prophet, to
express the enormity of the evil, than that, speaking after the manner of the
heathen, he extenuated what he was desirous to hold up to utter
execration!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may seem, however, as if these things were
somewhat at variance with what I stated a little ago &#8212; that Paul had an
eye to the intention of idolaters, for it is not their intention to worship
devils, but imaginary deities of their own framing. I answer, that the two
things are quite in harmony, for when men become so <i>vain in their
imaginations
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:21) as to render divine honor to creatures, rather than to the one God, this
punishment is in readiness for them &#8212; that they serve Satan. For they do
not find that &#8220;middle
place&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f487</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that they are in search of, but Satan
straightway presents himself to them, as an object of adoration, whenever they
have turned their back upon the true God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I would not that
ye.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If the term <i>demon </i>were used
in an indifferent sense, how spiritless were Paul&#8217;s statement here, while,
instead of this, it has the greatest weight and severity against idolaters! He
subjoins the reason &#8212; because no one can have fellowship at the same time
with God and with idols. Now, in all sacred observances, there is a profession
of fellowship. Let us know, therefore, that we are then, and then only, admitted
by Christ to the sacred feast of his body and blood, when we have first of all
bid farewell to every thing
sacrilegious.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f488</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For the man who would enjoy the one,
must renounce the other. O thrice miserable the condition of
those</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f489</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who, from fear of displeasing men, do
not hesitate to pollute themselves with unlawful superstitions! For, by acting
in this way, they voluntarily renounce fellowship with Christ, and obstruct
their approach to his health-giving table.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do we provoke the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>Having laid down the doctrine, he
assumes a more vehement tone, from observing, that what was a most atrocious
offense against God was regarded as nothing, or, at least, was looked upon as a
very trivial error. The Corinthians wished the liberty that they took to be
reckoned excusable, as there is not one of us that willingly allows himself to
be found fault with, but, on the contrary, we seek one subterfuge after another,
under which to shelter ourselves. Now Paul says, and not without reason, that in
this way we wage war against God; for nothing does God more require from us than
this &#8212; that we adhere strictly to everything that he declares in his word.
Do not those, then, who use
subterfuges,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f490</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in order that they may be at liberty to
transgress the commandment of God, arm themselves openly against God? Hence that
curse which the Prophet denounces against all those who call <i>evil</i>,<i>
good</i>,<i> </i>and<i> darkness</i>,<i> light</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
5:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are we
stronger</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>He warns them how dangerous a
thing it is to <i>provoke God</i> &#8212; because<i> </i>no one can do this but
to his own ruin.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f491</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Among men the chance of war, as they
speak, is doubtful, but to contend with God is nothing short of voluntarily
courting destruction. Accordingly, if we fear to have God as an enemy, let us
shudder at the thought of framing excuses for manifest sins, that is, whatever
stand opposed to his word. Let us, also, shudder at the thought of calling in
question those things that he has himself pronounced upon &#8212; for this is
nothing less than to rise up against heaven after the manner of the
giants.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f492

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All things are lawful for
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Again he returns to the right of
Christian liberty, by which the Corinthians defended themselves, and sets aside
their objection by giving the same explanation as before. &#8220;To eat of meats
that were sacrificed, and be present at the banquet, was an outward thing, and
therefore was in itself lawful.&#8221; Paul declares that he does not by any
means call this in question, but he replies, that we must have a regard to
edification. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All things are
lawful for me</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but all things are not
profitable</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that is, for our neighbors,
for no one, as he immediately adds, ought to seek his own advantage exclusively,
and if anything is not profitable to the brethren, it must be abstained from.
He, in the next place, expresses the kind of advantage &#8212; when it
<i>edifies</i>,<i> </i>for we must not have respect merely to the advantage of
the flesh. &#8220;What<i>
</i>then?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f493</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Does a thing that is in other respects
permitted by God, come on this account to be unlawful &#8212; if it is not
expedient for our neighbor. Then in that <i>case </i>our liberty would be placed
under subjection to men.&#8221;<i> </i>Consider attentively Paul&#8217;s words,
and you will perceive that liberty, nevertheless, remains unimpaired, when you
accommodate yourself to your neighbors, and that it is only the use of it that
is restricted, for he acknowledges that it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lawful</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>but says that it ought not to be made use of, if it does not
<i>edify</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let no one seek his
own.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He handles the same subject in the
14th Chapter of the Romans. <i>Let no one please himself</i>,<i> but endeavor to
please his brethren for their edification</i>.<i> </i>This is a precept that is
very necessary, for we are so corrupted by nature, that every one consults his
own interests, regardless of those of his brethren. Now, as the law of love
calls upon us to <i>love our neighbors as ourselves</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402239&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
22:39,) so it requires us to consult their welfare. The Apostle, however, does
not expressly forbid individuals to consult their own advantage, but he requires
that they should not be so devoted to their own interests, as not to be prepared
to forego part of their right, as often as the welfare of their brethren
requires this.</font><br></div>

has spoken above of dissembling in connection with idolatry, or, at least, as to
those actions which the Corinthians could not engage in, without professing
themselves to be the associates of the wicked in their superstitions. He now
requires them, not merely to abstain from all professions of idolatry, but also
to avoid carefully all occasions of offense, which are wont to arise from the
indiscriminate use of things indifferent. For, although there was but one kind

earth</i><sup> f498</sup><i> is the
Lord&#8217;s</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>there is nothing in the
world that is not sacred and pure. We must always keep in view, what the
question is of which the Apostle treats. It might be doubted, whether the
creatures of God were polluted by the sacrifices of the wicked. Paul says they
are not, inasmuch as the rule and possession of the whole earth remain always in
the hands of God. Now, what things the Lord has in his hands, he preserves by
his power, and consequently sanctifies them. The sons of God, therefore, have
the pure use of everything, because they receive them no otherwise than from the
hand of God.</font><br></div>

use of by the Prophet to denote the abundance of blessings, with which the earth
is furnished and adorned by the Lord. For if the earth were stripped of trees,
herbs, animals, and other things, it would be like a house devoid of furniture
and every kind of utensil: nay more, it would be mutilated and disfigured.
Should any one object, that the earth is cursed on account of sin, the answer is
easy &#8212; that he has an eye to its pure and perfect nature, because Paul is
speaking of believers, to whom all things are sanctified through
Christ.</font><br></div>

to this effect, that if a believer has been warned, that what is set before him
has been offered to an idol, and sees that there is a danger of offense being
given, he sins against the brethren if he does not abstain. He shows then, in
short, that care must be taken not to hurt weak consciences.</font><br></div>

does not altogether approve of it, and that it would be better if they declined,
but as it is a thing indifferent, he does not choose to forbid it absolutely.
And, certainly, there could be nothing better than to keep at a distance from
such snares &#8212; not that those are expressly to be condemned, who
accommodate themselves to men only in so far as conscience
permits,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

thy conscience remains, nevertheless, free, because it is exempted from that

but because the Lord orders it so, and it is our duty. Is it not reasonable,
too, that we should for the same reason accommodate ourselves to weak brethren

God? Farther, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the end of the

individuals, and to no circumstances of time or place.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For why is my

speaks in this way of himself, or whether he makes this objection in the name of
the Corinthians. If we take it as spoken in his own name, it will be a
confirmation of the preceding statement. &#8220;In<i> </i>restricting yourself,
for the sake of another man&#8217;s conscience, your liberty is not thereby made
subject to him.&#8221; If in the name of the Corinthians, the meaning will be
this: &#8220;You<i> </i>impose upon us an unjust law, in requiring that our
liberty should stand or fall at the caprice of others.&#8221; I am of opinion,
that Paul says this of himself, but explains it in another way, for hitherto I
have been stating the views of others. To be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judged</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>then, I explain here as meaning &#8212; to be <i>condemned</i>,<i>
</i>agreeably to the common acceptation of the word in Scripture. Paul warns us
of the danger that must ensue, if we make use of our liberty unreservedly, so as
to give occasion of offense to our neighbors &#8212; that they will <i>condemn
</i>it. Thus, through our fault, and our unreasonableness, the consequence will
be, that this special benefit from God will be <i>condemned</i>.<i> </i>If we do
not guard against this danger, we corrupt our liberty by our abuse of it. This
consideration, then, tends very much to confirm Paul&#8217;s
exhortation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>

that it should be reckoned to my account as a vice?&#8221; We cannot, it is
true, prevent the wicked from reviling, us, nor even the weak from being
sometimes displeased with us; but Paul here reproves the forwardness of those,
who of their own accord give occasion of offense, and hurt weak consciences,
when neither necessity or expediency calls for it. He would have us, then, make
a good use of our benefits,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f503</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">that the
weak may not have occasion of reviling from our inconsiderate use of

so small a matter they should not be so careful to avoid blame, he teaches that
there is no part of our life, and no action so
minute,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f504</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that it ought not to be directed to the
glory of God, and that we must take care that, even in eating and drinking, we
may aim at the advancement of it. This statement is connected with what goes
before; for if we are eagerly desirous of the glory of God, as it becomes us to
be, we will never allow, so far as we can prevent it, his benefits to lie under
reproach. It was well expressed anciently in a common proverb, that we must not
<i>live to eat</i>;<i> </i>but <i>eat to
live</i>.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f505</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Provided the end of living be at

in a manner sacred to God, inasmuch as it will be set apart for his
service.</font><br></div>

which it becomes us to have an eye<i> </i>to &#8212; the rule of love. A desire,
then, for the glory of God, holds the <i>first </i>place; a regard to our
neighbor holds the <i>second</i>.<i> </i>He makes mention of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jews and
Gentiles</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>not merely because the Church
of God consisted of those two classes, but to teach us that we are debtors to

variance with the word of the Lord &#8212; as if it were allowable, for the sake
of our neighbor, to venture farther than the Lord permits us. It is, however,
more than certain, that Paul accommodated himself to men only in things
indifferent, and in things lawful in themselves. Farther, the end must be
carefully observed &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that

chapters are divided, inasmuch as this sentence is disjoined from what goes
before, with which it ought to have been connected, and is joined to what
follows, with which it has no connection. Let us view this, then, as the close
of the preceding chapter. Paul had there brought forward his own example in
confirmation of his doctrine. Now, in order that the Corinthians may understand
that this would be becoming in them, he exhorts them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>imitate</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

<i>first</i>,<i> </i>that he prescribes nothing to others that he had not first
practiced himself; and, <i>secondly</i>,<i> </i>that he directs himself and
others to Christ as the only pattern of right acting. For while it is the part
of a good teacher to enjoin nothing in words but what he is prepared to practice
in action, he must not, at the same time, be so austere, as straightway to
require from others everything that he does himself, as is the manner of the
superstitious. For everything that they contract a liking for they impose also
upon others, and would have their own example to be held absolutely as a rule.
The world is also, of its own accord, inclined to a misdirected imitation,

strive to copy whatever they see done by persons of great influence. We see,
however how many evils have been introduced into the Church by this absurd
desire of imitating all the actions of the saints, without exception. Let us,
therefore, maintain so much the more carefully this doctrine of Paul &#8212;
that we are to follow men, provided they take Christ as their grand model,

another subject-to instruct the Corinthians, what decorum ought to be observed
in the sacred assemblies. For as a man&#8217;s dress or gesture has in some
cases the effect of disfiguring, and in others of adorning him, so all actions
are set off to advantage by decorum, and are vitiated by the want of it. Much,
therefore, depends upon decorum

barbarism will be incurred, if we do not preserve dignity in the Church, by
conducting ourselves honorably and becomingly? Hence he prescribes some things
that are connected with public order, by which sacred assemblies are rendered
honorable. But in order to prepare them the more for obedience, he commends, in
the outset, their obedience in the past, inasmuch as they observed his
ordinances; for inasmuch as he <i>had begotten </i>that Church to the Lord,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:15,) he had delivered to them a certain system, by which it was to
be governed. By retaining this, the Corinthians gave reason to hope, that they
would also in future be docile.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is surprising, however, that, while he now bestows
upon them this commendation, he had previously blamed them for many things. Nay
more, if we consider the state of the Church, such as has been previously
described, they were far from deserving this praise. I answer, that there were
some that were infected with those vices which he had previously reproved, and
indeed, some with one, others with another; but, in the meantime, the form which
he had prescribed to them had been retained by the entire body. For there is
nothing of inconsistency in saying, that very many sins, and of various kinds,
prevail among a particular people &#8212; some cheating, others plundering
&#8212; some envying, others quarrelling, and another class guilty of
fornication &#8212; while, at the same time, in respect of the public form of
the Church, the institutions of Christ and his Apostles are
maintained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This will appear more clearly when we come to see
what Paul means by
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">parado&gt;seiv</font><font face="Palatino">;<i>
</i>(traditions;)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f512</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and independently of this, it is
necessary to speak of this word, for the purpose of replying to Papists, who arm
themselves with this passage for the purpose of defending their traditions. It
is a common maxim among them, that the doctrine of the Apostles consists partly
of writings and partly of traditions. Under this <i>second </i>department they
include not merely certain foolish superstitions, and puerile ceremonies, with
which they are stuffed, but also all kinds of gross abomination, directly
contrary to the plain word of God, and their tyrannical laws, which are mere
torments to men&#8217;s consciences. In this way there is nothing that is so
foolish, nothing so absurd &#8212; in fine, nothing so monstrous, as not to have
shelter under this pretext, and to be painted over with this varnish. As Paul,
therefore, makes mention here of <i>traditions</i>,<i> </i>they seize, as they
are accustomed to do, upon this little word, with the view of making Paul the
author of all those abominations, which we set aside by plain declaration of
Scripture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I do not deny, that there were certain
traditions</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f513</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of the Apostles that were not committed
to writing, but I do not admit that they were parts of doctrine, or related to
things necessary for salvation. What then? They were connected with order and
government. For we know that every Church has liberty to frame for itself a form
of government that is suitable and profitable for it, because the Lord has not
prescribed anything definite. Thus Paul, the first founder of the Corinthian
Church, had also framed for its regulation pious and seemly enactments &#8212;
that <i>all things might be done decently and in order</i>,<i> </i>as he
afterwards enjoins.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461440&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:40.) But what has this to do with those silly trifles of
ceremonies, which are to be seen in
Popery?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

consciences? What has it to do with so many monstrous rites of idolatry? For the
foundation of all right enactment was this: to observe the moderation that Paul
made use of &#8212; not to compel persons to follow their
enactments,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

having had the audacity to criticize everything agreeably to their own humor, to
demand obedience from all is exceedingly absurd. Farther, we must know that Paul
commends their obedience in the past, in order that he may render them docile
also for the time to come.</font><br></div>

f518</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The error of the Corinthians was the
occasion of his showing, what part it was becoming to act in this matter. With
the view of proving, that it is an unseemly thing for women to appear in a
public assembly with their heads uncovered, and, on the other hand, for men to
pray or prophesy with their heads <i>covered</i>,<i> </i>he sets out with
noticing the arrangements that are divinely established.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as Christ is subject to God as
his head, so is the man subject to Christ, and the woman to the
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>We shall afterwards see, how he
comes to infer from this, that women ought to have their heads covered. Let us,
for the present, take notice of those four gradations which he points out. God,
then, occupies the <i>first </i>place: Christ holds the <i>second </i>place. How
so? Inasmuch as he has in our flesh made himself subject to the Father, for,
apart from this, being of one essence with the Father, he is his equal. Let us,
therefore, bear it in mind, that this is spoken of Christ as mediator. He is, I
say, inferior to the Father, inasmuch as he assumed our nature,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he might be the first-born
among many brethren.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is somewhat more of difficulty in what follows.
Here the man is placed in an intermediate position between Christ and the woman,
so that Christ is not the head of the woman. Yet the same Apostle teaches us
elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480328&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:28,) that <i>in Christ there is neither male nor female</i>.<i> </i>Why then
does he make a distinction here, which in that passage he does away with? I
answer, that the solution of this depends on the connection in which the
passages occur. When he says that there is no difference between the man and the
woman, he is treating of Christ&#8217;s spiritual kingdom, in which individual
distinctions</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f519</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are not regarded, or made any account
of; for it has nothing to do with the body, and has nothing to do with the
outward relationships of mankind, but has to do solely with the mind &#8212; on
which account he <i>declares </i>that there is no difference, even between
<i>bond </i>and <i>free</i>.<i> </i>In the meantime, however, he does not
disturb civil order or honorary distinctions, which cannot be dispensed with in
ordinary life. Here, on the other hand, he reasons respecting outward propriety
and decorum &#8212; which is a part of ecclesiastical polity. Hence, as regards
spiritual connection in the sight of God, and inwardly in the conscience, Christ
is the head of the man and of the woman without any distinction, because, as to
that, there is no regard paid to male or female; but as regards external
arrangement and political decorum, the man follows Christ and the woman the man,
so that they are not upon the same footing, but, on the contrary, this
inequality exists. Should any one ask, what connection marriage has with Christ,
I answer, that Paul speaks here of that sacred union of pious persons, of which
Christ is the officiating
priest,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f520</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and He in whose name it is
consecrated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Every man praying</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here there are two
propositions. The first relates to the <i>man</i>,<i> </i>the other to the
<i>woman</i>.<i> </i>He says that the <i>man </i>commits an offense against
Christ his head, if he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prays or
prophesies with his head covered.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Why
so? Because he is subject to Christ, with this understanding, that he is to hold
the first place in the government of the house &#8212; for the father of the
family is like a king in his own house. Hence the glory of God shines forth in
him, in consequence of the authority with which he is invested. If he covers his
head, he lets himself down from that preeminence which God had assigned to him,
so as to be in subjection. Thus the honor of Christ is infringed upon. For
example,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f521</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If the person whom the prince has
appointed as his lieutenant, does not. know how to maintain his proper
station,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f522</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and instead of this, exposes his dignity
to contempt on the part of persons in the lowest station, does he not bring
dishonor upon his prince? In like manner, if the <i>man </i>does not keep his
own station &#8212; if he is not subject to Christ in such a way as to preside
over his own family with authority, he obscures, to that extent, the glory of
Christ, which shines forth in the well regulated order of marriage. The
<i>covering</i>,<i> </i>as we shall see ere long, is all emblem of authority
intermediate and interposed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prophesying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>I take here to mean &#8212; declaring the mysteries of God for the
edification of the hearers, (as afterwards in 1 Corinthians 14.) as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>praying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>means preparing a form of prayer, and taking the lead, as it were, of all
the people &#8212; which is the part of the public
teacher,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f523</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for Paul is not arguing here as to every
kind of prayer, but as to solemn prayer in public. Let us, however, bear in
mind, that in this matter the error is merely in so far as decorum is violated,
and the distinction of rank which God has established, is broken in upon. For we
must not be so scrupulous as to look upon it as a criminal thing for a
teacher<i> </i>to have a cap on his head, when addressing the people from the
pulpit. Paul means nothing more than this &#8212; that it should appear that the
man has authority, and that the woman is under subjection, and this is secured
when the man uncovers his head in the view of the Church, though he should
afterwards put on his cap again from fear of catching cold. In fine, the <i>one
</i>rule to be observed here is </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to
pre&gt;pon</font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; <i>decorum</i>.<i> </i>If

Every woman praying or prophesying</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here
we have the <i>second </i>proposition &#8212; that women ought
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to have their heads
covered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>when they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pray</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

head by showing his liberty, so the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>woman</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>by showing her subjection. Hence, on the other hand, if the woman uncovers
her head, she shakes off subjection &#8212; involving contempt of her husband.
It may seem, however, to be superfluous for Paul to forbid the woman to prophesy
with her head uncovered, while elsewhere he wholly</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">prohibits women from
speaking in the
Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1

<div><font face="Palatino">It would not, therefore, be allowable for them to
prophesy even with a covering upon their head, and hence it follows that it is
to no purpose that he argues here as to a covering. It may be replied, that the
Apostle, by here condemning the one, does not commend the other. For when he
reproves them for prophesying with their head uncovered, he at the same time
does not give them permission to prophesy in some other way, but rather delays
his condemnation of that vice to another passage, namely in 1 Corinthians 14. In
this reply there is nothing amiss, though at the same time it might suit
sufficiently well to say, that the Apostle requires women to show their modesty
&#8212; not merely in a place in which the whole Church is assembled, but also
in any more dignified assembly, either of matrons or of men, such as are
sometimes convened in private houses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For it is all one as if she were
shaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now maintains from other
considerations, that it is unseemly for women to have their heads bare.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nature
itself</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>says he, abhors it. To see a
woman shaven is a spectacle that is disgusting and monstrous. Hence we infer
that the woman </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has her hair given
her for a covering</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Should any one now
object, that her hair is enough, as being a natural covering, Paul says that it
is <i>not</i>,<i> </i>for it is such a covering as requires another thing to be
made use of for covering <i>it</i>.<i> </i>And hence a conjecture is drawn, with
some appearance of probability &#8212; that women who had beautiful hair were
accustomed to uncover their heads for the purpose of showing off their beauty.
It is not, therefore, without good reason that Paul, as a remedy for this vice,
sets before them the opposite idea &#8212; that they be regarded as remarkable
for unseemliness, rather than for what is an incentive to
lust.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

</i>however, of which he is now speaking, relates to the order of marriage, and
hence it belongs to the present life, and is not connected with conscience. The
simple solution is this &#8212; that he does not treat here of innocence and
holiness, which are equally becoming in men and women, but of the distinction,
which God has conferred upon the man, so as to have superiority over the woman.
In this superior order of dignity the glory of God is seen, as it shines forth
in every kind of superiority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The woman is the glory of the

him,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

&#8212; to God&#8217;s eternal law, which has made the female sex subject to the
authority of men. On this account all women are born, that they may acknowledge
themselves inferior in consequence of the superiority of the male sex. Otherwise

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;390207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
2:7 calls priests <i>angels of God</i>,<i> </i>some are of opinion that Paul
speaks of <i>them</i>;<i> </i>but the ministers of the word have nowhere that
term applied to them by itself &#8212; that is, without something being added;
and the meaning would be too forced. I understand it, therefore, in its proper
signification. But it is asked, why it is that he would have women have their
heads covered </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because of the
angels</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; for<i> </i>what has this to do
with them? Some answer: &#8220;Because<i> </i>they are present on occasion of
the prayers of believers, and on this account are spectators of unseemliness,
should there be any on such occasions.&#8221; But what need is there for
philosophizing with such refinement? We know that angels are in attendance,
also, upon Christ as their head, and minister to
him.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f532</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">When,
therefore, women venture upon such liberties, as to usurp for themselves the
token of authority, they make their baseness manifest to the angels. This,
therefore, was said by way of amplifying, as if he had said, &#8220;If<i>
</i>women uncover their heads, not only Christ, but all the angels too, will be
witnesses of the outrage.&#8221; And this interpretation suits well with the
Apostle&#8217;s design. He is treating here of different ranks. Now he says
that, when women assume a higher place than becomes them, they gain this by it
&#8212; that they discover their impudence in the view of the angels of
heaven.</font><br></div>

check upon men, that they may not insult over
women;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f533</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and partly as a consolation to women,
that they may not feel dissatisfied with being under subjection. &#8220;The<i>
</i>male sex (says he) has a distinction over the female sex, with this
understanding, that they ought to be connected together by mutual benevolence,
for the one cannot do without the other. If they be separated, they are like the
mutilated members of a mangled body. Let them, therefore, be connected with each

conveniently live unmarried, despise the whole sex, and do not consider that

human race. They ponder the meaning of that statement &#8212; <i>God created

the weaker sex. Pious women, in like manner, reflect upon their
obligation.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

ruling her, and let the woman perform to the man the office of the body in
respect of assisting him, and that not merely in the married state, but also in
celibacy; for I do not speak of cohabitation merely, but also of civil offices,
for which there is occasion even in the unmarried state.&#8221; If you are
inclined rather to refer this to the whole sex in general, I do not object to
this, though, as Paul directs his discourse to individuals, he appears to point
out the particular duty of each.</font><br></div>

the man has superiority &#8212; that the woman was taken out of him, there will
be, in like manner, this motive to friendly connection &#8212; that the male sex
cannot maintain and preserve itself without the aid of women. For this remains a
settled point &#8212; that <i>it is not good for man to be alone</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

propagation, because human beings are propagated not by men alone, but by men

needful help to the man, inasmuch as a solitary life is not expedient for man.

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But all things of

made inferior to the more distinguished sex. Otherwise they will both of them
throw off the yoke of God, who has not without good reason appointed this
distinction of ranks. Farther, when it is said that the man and the woman, when
they are wanting in their duty to each other, are rebels against the authority

barbers began to be employed at Rome &#8212; about the time of Africanus the

hair shorn had not yet come into use in the provinces of Gaul or in Germany. Nay
more, it would have been reckoned an unseemly thing for men, no less than for
women, to be shorn or shaven; but as in Greece it was reckoned all unbecoming
thing for a man to allow his hair to grow long, so that those who did so were
remarked as effeminate, he reckons as <i>nature </i>a custom that had come to be
confirmed.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

quarrelling, should rather be restrained by authority than confuted by
lengthened disputations. For you will never have an end of contentions, if you
are disposed to contend with a combative person until you have vanquished him;
for though vanquished a hundred times, he would argue still. Let us therefore

<div><font face="Palatino">His reproof of the fault previously noticed was but a
mild and gentle admonition, because the Corinthians sinned in ignorance, so that
it was proper that they should readily be forgiven. Paul, too, had praised them
in the outset, because they had faithfully <i>kept his enactments</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

offended more grievously in some things, and not through
ignorance.</font><br></div>

better, but as to this I do not contend. There is an antithesis between this
clause and the beginning of this chapter. &#8220;While<i> </i>I have praised
you, do not think that it is unqualified commendation; for I have something to
find fault with, as it is worthy of severe reproof.&#8221; This, however, in my
opinion, does not refer exclusively to the Lord&#8217;s Supper, but also to
other faults of which he makes mention. Let this then be taken as a general
statement, that the Corinthians are reproved, because they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came together not for the better
but for the worse.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Particular effects of
this evil will be brought forward afterwards.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He finds fault with them, then, in the <i>first

secondly</i>,<i> </i>that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come together for the
worse</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The <i>second</i>,<i> </i>it is
true, is the more serious, but even the <i>first </i>is not to be endured, for
if we consider what is transacted in the Church, there ought never to be a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>coming
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>without some fruit.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>the doctrine of God is listened to, prayers are offered up, the Sacraments
are administered. The fruit of the Word is, when confidence in God and fear of
him are increased in us &#8212; when progress is made in holiness of life
&#8212; when we put off more and more the <i>old man</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:9) &#8212; when we advance in <i>newness of life</i>,<i> </i>etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:4.) The Sacraments have a tendency to exercise us in piety and love. The
prayers, too, ought to be of use for promoting all these purposes. In addition
to this, the Lord works efficaciously by his Spirit, because he wills not that
his ordinances should be vain. Hence if the sacred assemblies are of no benefit
to us, and we are not made better by them, it is our ingratitude that is to
blame, and therefore we deserve to be reproved. For the effect of our conduct
is, that those things, which, from their own nature, and from God&#8217;s
appointment, ought to have been salutary, become unprofitable.</font><br></div>

yet it almost always follows the other, for if we derive no advantage from

worse</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by them. It usually happens, too,
that negligence gives birth to many corruptions, especially on this account,
that those who do not observe the natural use of things usually fall erelong
into hurtful inventions.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

extensive signification, and certainly it is not likely that he would employ
terms so improper and unsuitable for the purpose of exposing that
abuse.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f546</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For as to their alleging that he has
expressed himself in more severe terms, with the view of exposing more fully the
heinousness of the offense, I would readily grant this, if the meaning
corresponded. It is, then, a reproof of a general kind &#8212; that they were
not of one accord as becomes Christians, but every one was so much taken up with
his own interests, that he was not prepared to accommodate himself to others.
Hence arose that abuse, as to which we shall see in a little &#8212; hence
sprung ambition and pride, so that every one exalted himself and despised others
&#8212; hence sprung carelessness as to edification &#8212; hence sprung
profanation of the gifts of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>partly believes

charged them all with this heinous crime, and might accordingly complain, that
they were groundlessly accused. In the meantime, however, he intimates that this

such as he could not altogether discredit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heresies</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>with the view of amplifying the more, as we may infer, too, from the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>also</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>for it is added for the sake of amplification.
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">prov
au]xhsin</font><font face="Palatino">.)<i> </i>It is well known in what sense
the ancients used those two
terms,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f547</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and what distinction they made between
Heretics and Schismatics.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f548</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>Heresy </i>they made to consist in
disagreement as to doctrine, and <i>schism</i>,<i> </i>on the contrary, in
alienation of affection, as when any one withdrew from the Church from envy, or
from dislike of the pastors, or from ill nature. It is true, that the Church
cannot but be torn asunder by false doctrine, and thus heresy is the root and
origin of schism, and it is also true that envy or pride is the mother of almost
all heresies, but at the same time it is of advantage to distinguish in this way
between these two terms.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us see in what sense Paul employs them. I
have already expressed my disapprobation of those who explain. heresy as meaning
the setting up of a separate table, inasmuch as the rich did not partake of
their Supper along with the poor; for he had it in view to point out something
more hateful. But without mentioning the opinions of others, I take <i>schism
</i>and <i>heresy </i>here in the way of less and greater. Schisms, then, are
either secret grudges &#8212; when we do not see that agreement which ought to
subsist among the pious &#8212; when inclinations at variance with each other
are at work &#8212; when every one is mightily pleased with his own way, and
finds fault with everything that is done by others.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Heresies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>are when the evil proceeds to such a pitch that open hostility is
discovered, and persons deliberately divide themselves into opposite parties.
Hence, in order that believers might not feel discouraged on seeing the
Corinthians torn with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>divisions</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>the Apostle turns round this occasion of offense in an opposite direction,
intimating that the Lord does rather by such trials make proof of his
people&#8217;s constancy. A lovely consolation! &#8220;So far, says he, should
we be from being troubled, or cast down, when we do not see complete unity in
the Church, but on the contrary some threatenings of separation from want of
proper agreement, that even if sects should start
up,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f549</font></sup><font face="Palatino">we ought to remain firm and constant. For
in this way hypocrites are detected &#8212; in this way, on the other hand, the
sincerity of believers is tried. For as this gives occasion for discovering the
fickleness of those who were not rooted in the Lord&#8217;s Word, and the
wickedness of those who had assumed the appearance of good men, so the good
afford a more signal manifestation of their constancy and
sincerity.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But observe what Paul says &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there must
be,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for he intimates by this expression,
that this state of matters does not happen by chance, but by the sure providence
of God, because he has it in view to try his people, as gold in the furnace, and
if it is agreeable to the mind of God, it is, consequently, expedient. At the
same time, however, we must not enter into thorny disputes, or rather into
labyrinths as to a fatal necessity. We know that there never will be a time when
there will not be many reprobates. We know that they are governed by the spirit
of Satan, and are effectually drawn away to what is evil. We know that Satan, in
his activity, leaves no stone unturned with the view of breaking up the unity of
the Church. From this &#8212; not from fate &#8212; comes that necessity of
which Paul makes mention.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f550</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We know, also, that the Lord, by his
admirable wisdom, turns Satan&#8217;s deadly machinations so as to promote the
salvation of believers.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f551</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence comes that design of which he
speaks &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the good may
shine forth more conspicuously</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>for we
ought not to ascribe this advantage to <i>heresies</i>,<i> </i>which, being
evil, can produce nothing but what is evil, but to God, who, by his infinite
goodness, changes the nature of things, so that those things are salutary to the
elect, which Satan had contrived for their ruin. As to Chrysostom&#8217;s
contending that the particle <i>that
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">i]na</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>denotes not the cause, but the event, it is of no great moment. For the
cause is the secret counsel of
God,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f552</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by which things that are evil are
overruled in such a manner, as to have a good issue. We know, in fine, that the
wicked are impelled by Satan in such a manner, that they both act and are acted
upon with the consent of their
wills.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f553</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence they are without
excuse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is not to eat the
Lord&#8217;s supper</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He now reproves the
abuse that had crept in among the Corinthians as to the Lord&#8217;s Supper, in
respect of their mixing up profane banquets with the sacred and spiritual feast,
and that too with contempt of the poor. Paul says, that in this way it is not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Lord&#8217;s
supper</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is partaken of &#8212; not
that a single abuse altogether set aside the sacred institution of Christ, and
reduced it to nothing, but that they polluted the sacrament by observing it in a
wrong way. For we are accustomed to say, in common conversation, that a thing is
not done at all, if it is not done aright. Now this was no trivial abuse, as we
shall afterwards see. If you understand the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as meaning, <i>is not
allowable</i>,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f554</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the meaning<i> </i>will amount to
the same thing &#8212; that the Corinthians were not in a state of preparation
for partaking of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Lord&#8217;s</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>supper, as being in so
divided a state. What I stated a little ago, however, is more simple &#8212;
that he condemns that profane admixture, which had nothing in it akin to the
Lord&#8217;s Supper.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For every one of you taketh

truly wonderful, and next to a
miracle,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f555</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that Satan could have accomplished so
much in so short a time. We are, however, admonished by this instance, how much
antiquity, without reason on its side, can effect, or, in other words, how much
influence a long continued custom has, while not sanctioned by a single
declaration of the word of God. This, having become customary, was looked upon
as lawful. Paul was then at hand to interfere. What then must have been the
state of matters after the death of the Apostles? With what liberty Satan must
have sported himself.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f556</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Yet here is the great strength of
Papists: &#8220;The thing is ancient &#8212; it was done long ago &#8212; let
it, therefore, have the weight of a revelation from
heaven.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is uncertain, however, what was the origin of this
abuse, or what was the occasion of its springing up so soon. Chrysostom is of
opinion, that it originated in the
love-feasts,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f557</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpo&lt; tw~n
ajgapw~n</font><font face="Palatino">) and that, while the rich had been
accustomed</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f558</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to bring with them from their houses the
means of feasting with the poor indiscriminately and in common, they afterwards
began to exclude the poor, and to guzzle over their delicacies by themselves.
And, certainly, it appears from Tertullian, that that custom was a very ancient
one.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f559</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now they gave the name of
<i>Agapae</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f560</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to those common entertainments,
which they contrived among themselves, as being tokens of fraternal affection,
and consisted of alms. Nor have I any doubt, that it took its rise from
sacrificial rites commonly observed both by Jews and Gentiles. For I observe
that Christians, for the most part, corrected the faults connected with those
rites, in such a manner, as to retain at the same time some resemblance. Hence
it is probable, that, on observing that. both Jews and Gentiles added a feast to
their sacrifice, as an appendage to it, but that both of them sinned in respect
of ambition, luxury, and intemperance, they
instituted</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f561</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> a kind of banquet, which might accustom
them rather to sobriety and
frugality,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f562</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and might, at the same time, be in
accordance with a spiritual entertainment in respect of mutual fellowship. For
in it the poor were entertained at the expense of the rich, and the table was
open to all. But, whether they had from the very first fallen into this profane
abuse, or whether an institution, otherwise not so objectionable, had in this
way degenerated in process of time, Paul would have them in no way mix up this
spiritual banquet with common feasts. &#8220;This,<i> </i>indeed, looks well
&#8212; that the poor along with the rich partake in common of the provisions
that have been brought, and that the rich share of their abundance along with
the needy, but nothing ought to have such weight with us as to lead us to
profane the holy sacrament.&#8221;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F563</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And one is
hungry</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This was one evil in the case,
that while the rich indulged themselves sumptuously, they appeared, in a manner,
to reproach the poor for their poverty. The inequality he describes
hyperbolically, when he says, that some are <i>drunken </i>and others are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hungry</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>for some had the means of stuffing themselves well, while others had slender
fare. Thus the poor were exposed to the derision of the rich, or at least they
were exposed to shame. It was, therefore, an unseemly spectacle, and not in
accordance with the <i>Lord</i>&#8217;<i>s supper</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have ye not
houses</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>From this we see that the
Apostle was utterly dissatisfied with this custom of feasting, even though the
abuse formerly mentioned had not existed.: For, though it seems allowable for
the whole Church to partake at one common table, yet this, on the other hand, is
wrong &#8212; to convert a sacred assembly to purposes foreign to its nature. We
know for what exercises a Church should assemble &#8212; to hear doctrine, to
pour forth prayers, and sing hymns to God, to observe the
sacraments,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f564</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to make confession of their faith, and
to engage in pious observances, and other exercises of piety. If anything else
is done there, it is out of place. Every one has his own house appointed him for
eating and drinking, and hence that is an unseemly thing in a sacred
assembly.</font><br></div>

abuse that was so manifest. He presses them still further, by asking &#8212;
&#8220;What else could I do? Will you say that you are unjustly reproved?&#8221;
Some manuscripts connect the words <i>in</i> <i>this </i>with the verb that
follows &#8212; in this way: <i>Shall I praise you</i>?<i> In this I do not
praise you</i>.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">Hitherto he has been exposing the
abuse;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f566</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> now he proceeds to show what is the
proper method of rectifying it. For the institution of Christ is a sure rule, so
that if you turn aside from it but a very little, you are out of the right
course. Hence, as the Corinthians had deviated from this rule, he calls them
back to it. It is a passage that ought to be carefully observed, as showing that
there is no remedy for correcting and purging out abuses, short of a return to
God&#8217;s pure institution. Thus the Lord himself &#8212; when he was
discoursing respecting marriage,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401903&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
19:3,) and the Scribes brought forward custom, and also the permission given by
Moses &#8212; simply brings forward his Father&#8217;s institution, as being an
inviolable law. When we do this at the present day, the Papists cry out, that we
are leaving nothing untouched.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f567</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We openly demonstrate, that it is not in
one point merely that they have degenerated from our Lord&#8217;s first
institution, but that they have corrupted it in a thousand ways. Nothing is more
manifest than that their Mass is diametrically opposed to the sacred Supper of
our Lord. I go farther &#8212; we show in the plainest manner, that it is full
of wicked abominations: hence there is need of reformation. We demand &#8212;
what it appears Paul had recourse to &#8212; that our Lord&#8217;s institution
be the common rule, to which we agree on both sides to make our appeal. This
they oppose with all their might. Mark then the nature of the controversy at
this day in reference to the Lord&#8217;s Supper.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Supper</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>

handing it over.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

Thus, bidding adieu to human laws, the authority of Christ will be maintained in
its stability.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That night in which he was
betrayed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This circumstance as to time
instructs us as to the design of the sacrament &#8212; that the benefit of
Christ&#8217;s death may be ratified in us. For the Lord might have some time
previously committed to the Apostles this
covenant-seal,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f569</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but he waited until the time of his
oblation, that the Apostles might see soon after accomplished in reality in his
body, what he had represented to them in the <i>bread </i>and the
<i>wine</i>.<i> </i>Should any one infer from this,. that the Supper ought,
therefore, to be celebrated at night and after a bodily repast, I answer, that,
in what our Lord did, we must consider what there is that he would have to be
done by us. It is certain, that he did not mean to institute a kind of nightly
festival, like that in honor of
Ceres,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f570</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and farther, that it was not his design
to invite his people to come to this spiritual banquet with a well-filled
stomach. Such actions of Christ as are not intended for our imitation, should
not be reckoned as belonging to his
institution.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f571</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In this way, there is no difficulty in
setting aside that subtilty of Papists, by which they shift
off</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f572</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> what I have already stated as to the
duty of maintaining and preserving Christ&#8217;s institution in its simplicity.
&#8220;We<i> </i>will, therefore,&#8221; say they, &#8220;<i>not </i>receive the
Lord&#8217;s Supper except at night, and we will therefore take it &#8212; not
when fasting, but after having dined.&#8221; All this, I say, is mere trifling;
for it is easy to distinguish what our Lord did, in order that we might imitate
it, or rather what he did with the view of commanding us to do the
like.</font><br></div>

gratitude.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take, eat, this is my

consider attentively</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f575</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> what he sets before us, and allow
nothing to pass unobserved, inasmuch as he says nothing but what is exceedingly
necessary to be known, and worthy of the closest attention. In the first place,
we must take notice, that Christ here distributes the bread among the Apostles,
that all may partake of it in common, and thus every one may <i>receive </i>his
portion, that there may be an equal participation among all. Accordingly, when
there is not a table in common prepared for all the pious &#8212; where they are
not invited to the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>breaking of
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in common, and where, in fine,
believers do not mutually participate, it is to no purpose that the name of the
<i>Lord</i>&#8217;<i>s Supper </i>is laid claim to.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But for what
purpose</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f576</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are the people called to mass, unless it
be that they may <i>come </i>away empty from an unmeaning
show?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f577</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It has, therefore, nothing in unison
with the supper. Hence, too, we infer that Christ&#8217;s promise is no more
applicable to the mass than to the feast of the
Salii;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f578</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for when Christ promises that he will
give us <i>his body</i>,<i> </i>he at the same time commands us to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>take and eat of the
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Hence, unless we obey this
command, it is to no purpose that we glory in his promise. To explain this more
familiarly in other words &#8212; the promise is annexed to the commandment in a
conditional way, as it were: hence it has its accomplishment only if the
condition also is accomplished. For example, it is written, <i>Call upon
me</i>;<i> I will answer thee</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;190101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
1:15.) It is our part to obey the command of God, that he may accomplish for us
what he promises; otherwise we shut ourselves out from the accomplishment of
it.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f579</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What do Papists do? They neglect participation, and
consecrate the bread for a totally different purpose, and in the meantime they
boast that they have the Lord&#8217;s body. While, by a wicked divorce,
they</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">put asunder those things
which Christ has joined
together,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
19:6,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">it is manifest that their boasting is vain. Hence,
whenever they bring forward the clause &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is my
body,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>we must retort upon them the one
that immediately precedes it &#8212; <i>Take and eat</i>.<i> </i>For the meaning
of the words is: &#8220;By participating in the breaking of bread, according to
the order and observance which I have prescribed, you shall be participants also
in my body.&#8221; Hence, when an individual eats of it by himself, the promise
in that case goes for nothing. Besides, we are taught in these words what the
Lord would have us do. <i>Take</i>,<i> </i>says he. Hence those that offer a
sacrifice to God have some other than Christ as their authority, for we are not
instructed in these words to perform a sacrifice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what do Papists say as to their mass? At first
they were so impudent as to maintain, that it was truly and properly called a
sacrifice. Now, however, they admit that it is indeed a commemorative sacrifice,
but in such a way, that the benefit of redemption is, through means of their
daily oblation,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f580</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> applied to the living and the dead.
However that may <i>be</i>,<i> </i>they present the appearance of a
sacrifice.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f581</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In the first place, there is rashness in
this, as being without any command from Christ; but there is a still more
serious error involved in it &#8212; that, while Christ appointed the Supper for
this purpose, that we might <i>take and eat</i>,<i> </i>they pervert it to a
totally different use.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is my
body</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>I shall not recount the unhappy
contests that have tried the Church in our times as to the meaning of these
words. Nay rather, would to God that we could bury the remembrance of them in
perpetual oblivion! I shall state, first of all, <i>sincerely </i>and <i>without
disguise</i>,<i> </i>and then farther, I shall state <i>freely </i>(as I am wont
to do) what my views are. Christ calls the bread <i>his body</i>;<i> </i>for I
set aside, without any disputation, that absurd contrivance, that our Lord did
not exhibit the bread to the Apostles, but his body, which they beheld with
their eyes, for it immediately follows &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This cup is the New Testament in
my blood</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Let us regard it then as
beyond all controversy that Christ is here speaking of the bread. Now the
question <i>is</i> &#8212; &#8220;In what sense?&#8221; That we may elicit the
true meaning, we must hold that the expression is figurative; for, assuredly, to
deny this is exceedingly
dishonest.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f582</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Why then is the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>body</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>applied to the bread? All, I think, will allow that it is for the same
reason that John calls the Holy Spirit a <i>dove</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430132&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:32.) Thus far we are agreed. Now the reason why the Spirit was so called was
this &#8212; that he had appeared in the form of a dove. Hence the name of the
Spirit is transferred to the visible sign. Why should we not maintain that there
is here a similar instance of metonymy, and that the term <i>body </i>is applied
to the bread, as being the sign and symbol of it? If any are of a different
opinion they will forgive me; but it appears to me to be an evidence of a
contentious spirit, to dispute pertinaciously on this point. I lay it down,
then, as a settled point, that there is here a sacramental form of
expression,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f583</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in which the Lord gives to the sign the
name of the thing signified.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now proceed farther, and inquire as to the
reason of the metonymy. Here I reply, that the name of the thing signified is
not applied to the sign simply as being a representation of it, but rather as
being a symbol of it,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f584</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by which the reality is presented to us.
For I do not allow the force of those comparisons which some borrow from profane
or earthly things; for there is a material <i>difference </i>between them and
the sacraments of our Lord. The statue of Hercules is called <i>Hercules</i>,<i>
</i>but what have we there but a bare, empty representation? On the other hand
the Spirit is called a <i>dove</i>,<i> </i>as being a sure pledge of the
invisible presence of the Spirit. Hence the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is <i>Christ</i>&#8217;<i>s body</i>,<i> </i>because it assuredly testifies,
that the body which it represents is held forth to us, or because the Lord, by
holding out to us that symbol, gives us at the same time his own body; for
Christ is not a deceiver, to mock us with empty
representations.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f585</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence it is regarded by me as beyond all
controversy, that the reality is here conjoined with the sign; or, in other
words, that we do not less truly become participants in Christ&#8217;s body in
respect of spiritual efficacy, than we partake of the bread.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now discuss the manner. Papists hold forth to
us their system of transubstantiation: they allege that, when the act of
consecration has been gone through, the substance of the bread no longer exists,
and that nothing remains but the
accidents.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f586</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> To this contrivance we oppose &#8212;
not merely the plain words of Scripture, but the very nature of the sacraments.
For what is the meaning of the <i>supper</i>,<i> </i>if there is no
correspondence between the visible sign and the spiritual reality? They would
have the sign to be a false and delusive appearance of bread. What then will the
thing signified be, but a mere imagination? Hence, if there must be a
correspondence between the sign and its reality, it is necessary that the bread
be real &#8212; not imaginary &#8212; to represent Christ&#8217;s real body.
Besides, Christ&#8217;s body is here given us not simply, but <i>as food</i>.<i>
</i>Now it is not by any means the color of the bread that nourishes us, but the
substance. In fine, if we would have reality in the thing itself, there must be
no deception in the sign.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Rejecting then the dream of Papists, let us see in
what manner Christ&#8217;s body is given to us. Some explain, that it is given
to us, when we are made partakers of all the blessings which Christ has procured
for us in his body &#8212; when, I say, we by faith embrace Christ as crucified
for us, and raised up from the dead, and in this way are effectually made
partakers of all his benefits. As for those who are of this opinion, I have no
objection to their holding such a view. As for myself, I <i>acknowledge</i>,<i>
</i>that it is only when we obtain Christ himself, that we come to partake of
Christ&#8217;s benefits. He is, however, <i>obtained</i>,<i> </i>I affirm, not
only when we believe that he was made an offering for us, but when he dwells in
us &#8212; when he is one with us &#8212; when we are <i>members of his
flesh</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490530&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
5:30,) &#8212; when, in fine, we are incorporated with him (so to speak) into
one life and substance. Besides, I attend to the import of the words, for Christ
does not simply present to us the benefit of his death and resurrection, but the
very body in which he suffered and rose again. I conclude, that Christ&#8217;s
body is <i>really</i>,<i> </i>(as the common expression is,) &#8212; that is,
<i>truly </i>given to us in the Supper, to be wholesome food for our souls. I
use the common form of expression, but my meaning is, that our souls are
nourished by the substance of the body, that we may truly be made one with him,
or, what amounts to the same thing, that a life-giving virtue from
Christ&#8217;s flesh is poured into us by the Spirit, though it is at a great
distance from us, and is not mixed with
us.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f587</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There now remains but one difficulty &#8212; how is
it possible that his body, which is in heaven, is given to us here upon earth?
Some imagine that Christ&#8217;s body is infinite, and is not confined to any
one space, but <i>fills heaven and earth</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;242324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:24,) like his Divine essence. This fancy is too absurd to require refutation.
The Schoolmen dispute with more refinement as to his glorious body. Their whole
doctrine, however, reduces itself to this &#8212; that Christ is to be sought
after in the bread, as if he were included in it. Hence it comes, that the minds
of men behold the bread with wonderment, and adore it in place of Christ. Should
any one ask them whether they adore the bread, or the appearance of it, they
will confidently agree that they do not, but, in the mean time, when about to
adore Christ, they turn to the bread. They turn, I say, not merely with their
eyes, and their whole body, but even with the thoughts of the heart. Now what is
this but unmixed idolatry? But that participation in the body of Christ, which,
I affirm, is presented to us in the Supper, does not require a local presence,
nor the descent of Christ, nor infinite
extension,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f588</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> nor anything of that nature, for the
Supper being a heavenly action, there is no absurdity in saying, that Christ,
while remaining in heaven, is received by us. For as to his communicating
himself to us, <i>that </i>is effected through the secret virtue of his Holy
Spirit, which can not merely bring together, but join in one, things that are
separated by distance of place, and far remote.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, in order that we may be capable of this
participation, we must rise heavenward. Here, therefore, faith must be our
resource, when all the bodily senses have failed. When I speak of
<i>faith</i>,<i> </i>I do not mean any sort of opinion, resting on human
contrivances, as many, boasting of faith on all occasions, run grievously wild
on this point. What then? You see bread &#8212; nothing more &#8212; but you
learn that it is a symbol</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f589</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of Christ&#8217;s body. Do not doubt
that the Lord accomplishes what his words intimate &#8212; that the body, which
thou dost not at all behold, is given to thee, as a spiritual repast. It seems
incredible, that we should be nourished by Christ&#8217;s flesh, which is at so
great a distance from us. Let us bear in mind, that it is a secret and wonderful
work of the Holy Spirit, which it were criminal to measure by the standard of
our understanding. &#8220;In the meantime, however, drive away gross
imaginations, which would keep thee from looking beyond the bread. Leave to
Christ the true nature of flesh, and do not, by a mistaken apprehension, extend
his body over heaven and earth: do not divide him into different parts by thy
fancies, and do not adore him in this place and that, according to thy carnal
apprehension. Allow him to remain in his heavenly glory, and aspire thou
thither,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f590</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that he may thence communicate himself
to thee.&#8221; These few things will satisfy those that are sound and modest.
As for the curious, I would have them look somewhere else for the means of
satisfying their appetite.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which is broken for
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Some explain this as referring to
the distribution of the bread, because it was necessary that Christ&#8217;s body
should remain entire, as it had been predicted,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021246&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
12:46,) A <i>bone of him shall not be broken</i>.<i> </i>As for myself &#8212;
while I acknowledge that Paul makes an allusion to the breaking of bread, yet I
understand the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>broken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as used here for <i>sacrificed</i> &#8212; not, indeed, with strict
propriety, but at the same time without any absurdity. For although
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no bone was
broken</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>yet the body itself having been
subjected, first of all, to so many tortures and inflictions, and afterwards to
the punishment of death in the most cruel form, cannot be said to have been
uninjured. This is what Paul means by its being
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>broken</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>This, however, is the <i>second </i>clause of the promise, which ought not
to be passed over slightly. For the Lord does not present his body to us simply,
and without any additional consideration, but as having been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sacrificed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>for us. The <i>first </i>clause, then, intimates, that the body is presented
to us: this <i>second </i>clause teaches us, what advantage we derive from it
&#8212; that we are partakers of redemption, and the benefit of his sacrifice is
applied to us. Hence the Supper is a mirror which represents to us Christ
crucified, so that no one can profitably and advantageously receive the supper,
but the man who <i>embraces </i>Christ crucified.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do this in remembrance of
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence the Supper is a memorial,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mnhmo&gt;sunon</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f591</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)<i> </i>appointed as a help to our
weakness; for if we were sufficiently mindful of the death of Christ, this help
would be unnecessary. This is common to all sacraments, for they are helps to
our weakness. What is the nature of that remembrance which Christ would have us
cherish with regard to him, we shall hear presently. As to the inference,
however, which some draw from this &#8212; that Christ is not present in the
Supper, because a <i>remembrance </i>applies to something that is absent; the
answer is easy &#8212; that Christ is absent from it in the sense in which the
Supper is a commemoration. For Christ is not visibly present, and is not beheld
with our eyes, as the symbols are which excite our remembrance by representing
him. In short, in order that he may be present with us, he does not change his
place, but communicates to us from heaven the virtue of his flesh, as though it
were present.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The cup, when he had

that there was some interval of time between the distribution of the <i>bread
</i>and that of the <i>cup</i>,<i> </i>and it does not quite appear from the
Evangelists whether the whole of the transaction was
continuous.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f593</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This, however, is of no great moment,
for it may be that the Lord delivered in the meantime some address, after
distributing the bread, and before giving the cup. As, however, he did or said
nothing that was not in harmony with the sacrament, we need not say that the
administration of it was disturbed or interrupted. I would not, however, render
it as Erasmus does &#8212; <i>supper</i>,<i> being ended</i>,<i> </i>for, in a
matter of so great importance, ambiguity ought to be avoided.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This cup is the New

<i>cup</i>,<i> </i>is applicable also to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bread</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i>
</i>and thus, by this form of expression, he intimates what he had before stated
more briefly &#8212; that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
bread is the body.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For it is so to us,
that it may be a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>testament in his
body</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that is, a covenant, which has
been once confirmed by the offering up of his body, and is now confirmed by
eating, when believers feast upon that sacrifice. Accordingly, while Paul and
Luke use the <i>words</i> &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>testament in the
blood,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Matthew and Mark employ the
<i>expression</i> &#8212; <i>blood of the testament</i>,<i> </i>which amounts to
the same thing. For the blood was poured out to reconcile us to God, and now we
drink of it in a spiritual sense, that we may be partakers of reconciliation.
Hence, in the Supper, we have both a covenant, and a confirmatory pledge of the
covenant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I shall speak in the Epistle to the Hebrews, if the
Lord shall allow me opportunity, as to the
word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

that sacraments receive that name, from being <i>testimonies to </i>us of the
divine will, to confirm</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f594</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it in our minds. For as a covenant is
entered into among men with solemn rites, so it is in the same manner that the
Lord deals with us. Nor is it without strict propriety that this term is
employed; for in consequence of the connection between the word and the sign,
the covenant of the Lord is really included in the sacraments, and the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>has a reference or relation to us. This will be of no small importance for
understanding the nature of the sacraments; for if they are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covenants</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>then they contain promises, by which consciences may be roused up to an
assurance of salvation. Hence it follows, that they are not merely outward signs

faith.</font><br></div>

merely to the Apostles, and not to the common people &#8212; it is exceedingly
childish, and is easily refuted from this passage &#8212; for Paul here
addresses himself to men and women indiscriminately, and to the whole body of
the Church. He declares that he </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For as often as ye shall

remembrance ought to be cherished &#8212; that is, with thanksgiving. not that
the remembrance consists wholly in confession with the mouth; for the chief
thing is, that the efficacy of Christ&#8217;s death be scaled in our
consciences; but this knowledge should stir us up to a confession in respect of
praise, so as to declare before men what we feel inwardly before God. The Supper
then is (so to speak)a kind of memorial, which must always remain in the Church,
until the last coming of Christ; and it has been appointed for this purpose,
that Christ may put us in mind of the benefit of his death, and that we may
recognize it</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f596</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> before men. Hence it has the name of the
Eucharist.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f597</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If, therefore, you would celebrate the
Supper aright, you must bear in mind, that a profession of your faith is
required from you. Hence we see how shamelessly those mock God, who boast that
they have in the mass something of the nature of the Supper. For what is the
mass? They confess (for I am not speaking of Papists, but of the pretended
followers of Nicodemus) that it is full of abominable superstitions. By outward
gesture they give a pretended approval of them. What kind of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>showing forth of the death of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is this? Do they not rather
renounce it?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Until he
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As we always need a help of this
kind, so long as we are in this world, Paul intimates that this commemoration
has been given us in charge, until Christ come to judgment. For as he is not
present with us in a visible form, it is necessary for us to have some symbol of
his presence, by which our minds may exercise themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore he who shall eat
this bread unworthily.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If the Lord
requires gratitude from us in the receiving of this sacrament &#8212; if he
would have us acknowledge his grace with the heart, and publish it with the
mouth &#8212; that man will not go unpunished, who has put insult upon him
rather than honor; for the Lord will not allow his commandment to be despised.
Now, if we would catch the meaning of this declaration, we must know what it is
to <i>eat unworthily</i>.<i> </i>Some restrict it to the Corinthians, and the
abuse that had crept in among them, but I am of opinion that Paul here,
according to his usual manner, passed on from the particular case to a general
statement, or from one instance to an entire class. There was one fault that
prevailed among the Corinthians. He takes occasion from this to speak of every
kind of faulty administration or reception of the Supper.
&#8220;<i>God</i>,&#8221;<i> </i>says he, &#8220;<i>will </i>not allow this
sacrament to be profaned without punishing it severely.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eat
unworthily,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then, is to pervert the pure
and right <i>use </i>of it by our
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abuse</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of it. Hence there are various degrees of this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unworthiness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>so to speak; and some offend more grievously, others less so. <i>Some
fornicator</i>,<i> </i>perhaps, or <i>perjurer</i>,<i> </i>or
<i>drunkard</i>,<i> </i>or <i>cheat</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 5:11,) intrudes himself without repentance. As such downright
contempt is a token of wanton insult against Christ, there can be no doubt that
such a person, whoever he is, receives the Supper to his own destruction.
Another, perhaps, will come forward, who is not addicted to any open or flagrant
vice, but at the same time not so prepared in heart as became him. As this
carelessness or negligence is a sign of irreverence, it is also deserving of
punishment from God. As, then, there are various degrees of <i>unworthy
participation</i>,<i> </i>so the Lord punishes some more slightly; on others he
inflicts severer punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this passage gave rise to a question, which some
afterwards agitated with too much keenness &#8212; whether the <i>unworthy
</i>really partake of the Lord&#8217;s body? For some were led, by the heat of
controversy, so far as to say, that it was received indiscriminately by the good
and the bad; and many at this day maintain pertinaciously, and most clamorously,
that in the first Supper Peter received no more than Judas. It is, indeed, with
reluctance, that I dispute keenly with any one on this point, which is (in my
opinion) not an essential one; but as others allow themselves, without reason,
to pronounce, with a magisterial air, whatever may seem good to them, and to
launch out thunderbolts upon every one that mutters anything to the contrary, we
will be excused, if we calmly adduce reasons in support of what we reckon to be
true.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I hold it, then, as a settled point, and will not
allow myself to be driven from it, that Christ cannot be disjoined from his
Spirit. Hence I maintain, that his body is not received as dead, or even
inactive, disjoined from the grace and power of his Spirit. I shall not occupy
much time in proving this statement. Now in what way could the man who is
altogether destitute of a living faith and repentance, having nothing of the
Spirit of Christ,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f598</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> receive Christ himself? Nay more, as he
is entirely under the influence of Satan and sin, how will he be capable of
receiving Christ? While, therefore, I acknowledge that there are some who
receive Christ truly in the Supper, and yet at the same time
<i>unworthily</i>,<i> </i>as is the case with many weak persons, yet I do not
admit, that those who bring with them a mere historical
faith,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f599</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> without a lively feeling of repentance
and faith, receive anything but the sign. For I cannot endure to maim
Christ,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f600</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and I shudder at the absurdity of
affirming that he gives himself to be eaten by the wicked in a lifeless state,
as it were. Nor does Augustine mean anything else when he says, that the wicked
receive Christ merely in the sacrament, which he expresses more clearly
elsewhere, when he says that the other Apostles
ate</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the
bread</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; <i>the Lord</i>;<i> </i>but Judas
only the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bread of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f601</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here it is objected, that the efficacy of the
sacraments does not depend upon the worthiness of men, and that nothing is taken
away from the promises of God, or falls to the ground, through the wickedness of
men. This I acknowledge, and accordingly I add in express terms, that
Christ&#8217;s body is presented to the wicked no less than to the good, and
this is enough so far as concerns the efficacy of the sacrament and the
faithfulness of God. For God does not there represent in a delusive manner, to
the wicked, the body of his Son, but presents it in reality; nor is the bread a
bare sign to them, but a faithful pledge. As to their rejection of it, that does
not impair or alter anything as to the nature of the sacrament.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It remains, that we give a reply to the statement of
Paul in this passage. &#8220;Paul represents the unworthy as guilty, inasmuch as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they do not discern the
Lord&#8217;s body</i></font><font face="Palatino">:<i> </i>it follows, that they
receive his body.&#8221; I deny the inference; for though they reject it, yet as
they profane it and treat it with dishonor when it is presented to them, they
are deservedly held guilty; for they do, as it were, cast it upon the ground,
and trample it under their feet. Is such sacrilege trivial? Thus I see no
difficulty in Paul&#8217;s words, provided you keep in view what God presents
and holds out to the wicked &#8212; not what they receive.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>examination</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>that ought to be to which Paul exhorts us. Papists make it consist in
auricular confession. They order all that are to receive the Supper, to examine
their life carefully and anxiously, that they may unburden all their sins in the
ear of the priest. Such is <i>their
</i>preparation!</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f602</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I maintain, however, that this holy
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>examination</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

persons,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

with reflection for a few hours, and making the priest &#8212; such as he is

It is an
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>examination</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

accord with the legitimate use of the sacred Supper.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">You see here a method that is most easily
apprehended. If you would wish to use aright the benefit afforded by Christ,
bring faith and repentance. As to these two things, therefore, the trial must be
made, if you would come duly prepared. Under repentance I include love; for the
man who has learned to renounce himself, that he may give himself up wholly to
Christ and his service, will also, without doubt, carefully maintain that unity
which Christ has enjoined. At the same time, it is not a perfect faith or
repentance that is required, as some, by urging beyond due bounds, a perfection
that can nowhere be found, would shut out for ever from the Supper every
individual of mankind. If, however, thou aspirest after the righteousness of God
with the earnest desire of thy mind, and, trembled under a view of thy misery,
dost wholly lean upon Christ&#8217;s grace, and rest upon it, know that thou art
a worthy guest to approach the table &#8212; <i>worthy </i>I mean in this
respect, that the Lord does not exclude thee, though in another point of view

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this
cause</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>etc. After having treated in a
general way of <i>unworthy eating</i>,<i> </i>and of the kind of punishment that
awaits those who pollute this sacrament, he now instructs the Corinthians as to
the chastisement which they were at that time enduring. It is not known whether
a pestilence was raging there at that time, or whether they were laboring under
other kinds of disease. However it may have been as to this, we infer from
Paul&#8217;s words, that the Lord had sent some scourge upon them for their
correction. Nor does Paul merely conjecture, that it is on that account that
they are punished, but he affirms it as a thing that was perfectly well known by
him. He says, then, that <i>many lay sick</i> &#8212; that many were kept long
in a languishing condition, and that many had died, in consequence of that abuse
of the Supper, because they had offended God. By this he intimates, that by
diseases and other chastisements from God, we are admonished to think of our
sins; for God does not afflict us without good reason, for he takes no pleasure
in our afflictions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The subject is a copious and ample one; but let it
suffice to advert to it here in a single word. If in Paul&#8217;s times an
ordinary abuse of the Supper</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f609</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> could kindle the wrath of God against
the Corinthians, so that he punished them thus severely, what ought we to think
as to the state of matters at the present day? We see, throughout the whole
extent of Popery, not merely horrid profanations of the Supper, but even a
sacrilegious abomination set up in its room. In the <i>first </i>place, it is
prostituted to <i>filthy lucre
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:8) and merchandise. <i>Secondly</i>,<i> </i>it is maimed, by taking
away the use of the cup. <i>Thirdly</i>,<i> </i>it is changed into another
aspect,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f610</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by its having become customary for one
to partake of his own feast separately, participation being done
away.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f611</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>Fourthly</i>,<i> </i>there is
<i>there </i>no explanation of the meaning of the sacrament, but a mumbling that
would accord better with a magical incantation, or the detestable <i>sacrifices
</i>of the Gentiles, than with our Lord&#8217;s institution. <i>Fifthly</i>,<i>
</i>there is an endless number of ceremonies, abounding partly with trifles,
partly with superstition, and consequently manifest pollutions.
<i>Sixthly</i>,<i> </i>there is the diabolical invention of sacrifice, which
contains an impious blasphemy against the death of Christ. <i>Seventhly</i>,<i>
</i>it is fitted to intoxicate miserable men with carnal <i>confidence</i>,<i>
</i>while they present it to God as if it were an expiation, and think that by
this charm they drive off everything hurtful, and that without faith and
repentance. Nay more, while they trust that they are armed against the devil and
death, and are fortified against God by a sure defense, they venture to sin with
much more freedom,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f612</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and become more obstinate.
<i>Eighthly</i>,<i> </i>an idol is <i>there </i>adored in the room of Christ. In
short, it is filled with all kinds of
abomination.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f613</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nay even among ourselves, who have the pure
administration of the Supper restored to
us,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f614</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in virtue of a return, as it were, from
captivity,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f615</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> how much irreverence! How much hypocrisy
on the part of many! What a disgraceful mixture, while, without any
discrimination, wicked and openly abandoned persons intrude themselves, such as
no man of character and decency would admit to common
intercourse!</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f616</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And yet after all, we wonder how it
comes that there are so many wars, so many pestilences, so many failures of the
crop, so many disasters and calamities &#8212; as if the cause were not
manifest! And assuredly, we must not expect a termination to our calamities,
until we have removed the occasion of them, by correcting our
faults.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For if we would judge
ourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here we have another
remarkable statement &#8212; that God does not all of a sudden become enraged
against us, so as to inflict punishment immediately upon our sinning, but that,
for the most part, it is owing to our carelessness, that he is in a manner
constrained to punish us, when he sees that we are in a careless and drowsy
state, and are flattering ourselves in our
sins.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f617</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence we either avert, or mitigate
impending punishment, if we first call ourselves to account, and, actuated by a
spirit of repentance, deprecate the anger of God by inflicting punishment
voluntarily upon ourselves.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f618</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In short, believers anticipate, by
repentance, the judgment of God, and there is no other remedy, by which they may
obtain absolution in the sight of God, but by voluntarily
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>condemning
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">You must not, however, apprehend, as Papists are
accustomed to do, that there is here a kind of transaction between us and God,
as if, by inflicting punishment upon ourselves of our own accord, we rendered
satisfaction to him, and did, in a manner, redeem ourselves from his hand. We do
not, therefore, anticipate the judgment of God, on the ground of our bringing
any compensation to appease him. The reason is this &#8212; because God, when he
chastises us, has it in view to shake us out of our drowsiness, and arouse us to
repentance. If we do this of our own accord, there is no longer any reason, why
he should proceed to inflict his judgment upon us. If, however, any one, after
having begun to feel displeased with himself, and meditate repentance, is,
nevertheless, still visited with God&#8217;s chastisements, let us know that his
repentance is not so valid or sure, as not to require some chastisement to be
sent upon him, by which it may be helped forward to a fuller development. Mark
how repentance wards off the judgment of God by a suitable remedy &#8212; not,
however, by way of compensation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But when we are
judged</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here we have a consolation that
is exceedingly necessary; for if any one in affliction thinks that God is angry
with him, he will rather be discouraged than excited to repentance. Paul,
accordingly, says, that God is angry with believers in such a way as not in the
meantime to be forgetful of his mercy: nay more, that it is on this account
particularly that he punishes them &#8212; that he may consult their welfare. It
is an inestimable consolation</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f619</font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212;
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">that the punishments by which our sins are
chastened are evidences, not of God&#8217;s anger for our destruction, but
rather of his paternal love, and are at the same time of assistance towards our
salvation, for God is angry with us as his sons, whom he will not leave to
perish.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he <i>says</i> &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that we may not be condemned with
the world</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he intimates two things. The
<i>first </i>is, that the children of this world, while they sleep on quietly
and securely in their delights,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f620</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are fattened up, like hogs, for <i>the
day of slaughter</i>.<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;241203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
12:3.) For though the Lord sometimes invites the wicked, also, to repentance by
his chastisements, yet he often passes them over as
strangers,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f621</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and allows them to rush on with
impunity, until they <i>have filled up the measure </i>of their final
condemnation.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;011516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:16.) This privilege, therefore, belongs to believers exclusively &#8212; that
by punishments they are called back from destruction. The <i>second </i>thing is
this &#8212; that chastisements are necessary remedies for believers, for
otherwise they, too, would rush on to everlasting
destruction,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f622</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> were they not restrained by temporal
punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These considerations should lead us not merely to
patience, so as to endure with equanimity the troubles that are assigned to us
by God, but also to gratitude, that, giving thanks to God our Father, we may
resign ourselves</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f623</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to his discipline by a willing
subjection. They are also useful to us in various ways; for they cause our
afflictions to be salutary to us, while they train us up for mortification of
the flesh, and a pious abasement &#8212; they accustom us to obedience to God
&#8212; they convince us of our own weakness, they kindle up in our minds
fervency in prayer &#8212; they exercise hope, so that at length whatever there
is of bitterness in them is all swallowed up in spiritual joy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>33.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore, my
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>From the discussion of a
general doctrine, he returns to the particular subject with which he had set
out, and comes to this conclusion, that equality must be observed in the
Lord&#8217;s Supper, that there may be a real participation, as there ought to
be, and that they may not celebrate every one his own supper; and farther, that
this sacrament ought not to be mixed up with common feasts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The rest I will set in order
when I come</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It is probable, that there
were some things in addition, which it would be of advantage to put into better
order, but as they were of less importance, the Apostle delays the correction of
them until his coming among them. It may be, at the same time, that there was
nothing of this nature; but as one knows better what is necessary when he is
present to see, Paul reserves to himself the liberty of arranging matters when
present, according as occasion may require. Papists arm themselves against us
with this buckler, too, for defending their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mass</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>For they interpret <i>this </i>to be the <i>setting in order </i>which Paul
here promises &#8212; as if he would have taken the
liberty</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f624</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of overturning that eternal appointment
of Christ, which he here so distinctly approves of! For what resemblance does
the mass bear to Christ&#8217;s institution? But away with such trifles, as it
is certain that Paul speaks only of outward decorum. As this is put in the power
of the Church, so it ought to be arranged according to the condition of times,
places, and
persons.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

Now concerning spiritual things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He goes
on to correct another fault. As the Corinthians abused the gifts of God for
ostentation and show, and love was little, if at all, regarded, he shows them
for what purpose believers are adorned by God with spiritual gifts &#8212; for
the edification of their brethren. This proposition, however, he divides into
two parts; for, in the <i>first </i>place, he teaches, that God is the author of
those gifts, and, <i>secondly, </i>having established this, he reasons as to
their design. He proves from their own experience, that those things in which
they gloried, are bestowed upon men through the exercise of God&#8217;s favor;
for he reminds them how ignorant they were, and stupid, and destitute of all
spiritual light, previously to God&#8217;s calling them. Hence it appears, that
they had been furnished with them &#8212; not by nature, but through God&#8217;s
unmerited benignity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the words; when he says &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I would not that ye should be
ignorant,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>we must supply the expression
&#8212; as </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to what is
right</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>as to what is your duty,
</i>or some similar expression; and by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spiritual
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he means <i>spiritual gifts,
</i>as to which we shall have occasion to see afterwards. In what follows there
is a twofold reading; for some manuscripts have simply
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">o[ti</font><font face="Palatino">
others add
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">o[te</font><font face="Palatino">.
The former means <i>because &#8212; </i>assigning a reason: the latter means
<i>when; </i>and this latter reading suits much better. But besides this
diversity, the construction is in other respects confused; but still, the
meaning is evident. Literally, it is this &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye know, that when ye were
Gentiles, after dumb idols, according as ye were led,
following</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have, however, faithfully
given Paul&#8217;s meaning. By <i>dumb idols </i>he means &#8212; having neither
feeling nor motion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us learn from this passage how great is the
blindness of the human mind: when it is without the illumination of the Holy
Spirit, inasmuch as it stands in amazement at <i>dumb
idols,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f625</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and cannot rise higher in
searching after God; nay more, it is <i>led </i>by Satan as if it were a
brute.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f626</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He makes use of the term <i>Gentiles
</i>here, in the same sense as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:12.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ye were at one time
Gentiles, says he, without
God,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">strangers to the hope of

<div><font face="Palatino">Perhaps, too, he reasons by way of contrast. What
if</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f627</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they should now show themselves to be
less submissive to God, after his having taken them under his care, to be

forward and compliant, in following the suggestions of Satan!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore I give you to
know.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Having admonished them from their
own experience, he sets before them a general doctrine, which he deduces from
it; for what the Corinthians had experienced in themselves is common to all
mankind &#8212; to wander on in
error,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f628</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> previously to their being brought back,
through the kindness of God, into the way of truth. Hence it is necessary that
we should be directed by the Spirit of God, or we shall wander on for ever. From
this, too, it follows, that all things that pertain to the true knowledge of
God, are the gifts of the Holy Spirit,. He at the same time derives an argument
from opposite causes to opposite effects.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No one, speaking by the Spirit of
God, can revile Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>so, on the other

Christ, but by the Spirit of Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>say that Jesus is

To </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>say that Jesus is the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is to speak of him in honorable
terms and with reverence, and to extol his majesty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here it is asked &#8212; &#8220;As the wicked
sometimes speak of Christ in honorable and magnificent terms, is this an
indication that they have the Spirit of God?&#8221; I answer &#8212; &#8220;They
undoubtedly have, so far as that effect is concerned; but the gift of
regeneration is one thing, and the gift of bare intelligence, with which Judas
himself was endowed, when he preached the gospel, is quite another.&#8221;
Hence, too, we perceive how great our weakness is, as we cannot so much as move
our tongue for the celebration of God&#8217;s praise, unless it be governed by
his Spirit. Of this the Scripture, also, frequently reminds us, and the saints
everywhere acknowledge that unless the Lord open their mouths, they are not fit
to be the heralds of his praise. Among others, Isaiah says &#8212; I am a man of
unclean lips, etc.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now there are diversities of
gifts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The symmetry of the
Church</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f629</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> consists, so to speak, of a manifold
unity,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f630</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that is, when the variety of gifts is
directed to the same object, as in music there are different sounds, but suited
to each other with such an adaptation, as to produce concord. Hence it is
befitting that there should be a distinction of gifts as well as of offices, and
yet all harmonize in one. Paul, accordingly, in the 12th chapter of Romans,
commends this variety, that no one may, by rashly intruding himself into
another&#8217;s place, confound the distinction which the Lord has established.
Hence he orders every one to be contented with his own gifts, and cultivate the
particular department that has been assigned to
him.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f631</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He prohibits them from going beyond
their own limits by a foolish ambition. In fine, he exhorts that every one
should consider how much has been given him, what measure has been allotted to
him, and to what he has been called. Here, on the other hand, he orders every
one to bring what he has to the common heap, and not keep back the gifts of God
in the way of enjoying every one his own, apart from the
others,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f632</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but aim unitedly at the edification of
all in common. In both passages, he brings forward the similitude of the human
body, but, as may be observed, on different accounts. The sum of what he states
amounts to this &#8212; that gifts are not distributed thus variously among
believers, in order that they may be used apart, but that in the division there
is a unity, inasmuch as one Spirit is the source of all those gifts, one God is
the Lord of all administrations, and the author of all exercises of power. Now
God, who is the beginning, ought also to be the end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This passage ought to be
carefully observed in opposition to
fanatics,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f633</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who think that the name Spirit means
nothing essential, but merely the gifts or actions of divine power. Here,
however, Paul plainly testifies, that there is <i>one </i>essential power of
God, whence all his works proceed. The term Spirit, it is true, is sometimes
transferred by metonymy to the gifts themselves. Hence we read of the Spirit of
knowledge &#8212; of judgment &#8212; of fortitude &#8212; of
modesty.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f634</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Paul, however, here plainly testifies
that judgment, and knowledge, and gentleness, and all other gifts, proceed from
<i>one </i>source. For it is the office of the Holy Spirit to put forth and
exercise the power of God by conferring these gifts upon men, and distributing
them among them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The ancients made use of this
testimony in opposition to the Arians, for the purpose of maintaining a Trinity
of persons. For there is mention made here of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Spirit, secondly of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and <i>lastly </i>of God, and to
these Three, one and the same operation is ascribed. Thus, by the name
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>they understood Christ. But for my part, though I have no objection to its
being understood in this way, I perceive, at the same time, that it is a weak
argument for stopping the mouths of Arians; for there is a correspondence
between the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>administrations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
The
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>administrations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>says Paul, <i>are different, </i>but there is only one God whom we must
serve, whatever
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>administration</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>we discharge. This antithesis, then, shows what is the simple meaning, so
that to confine it to Christ is rather forced.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One God that

</i>the Greek term is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejnergh&gt;mata</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>a term which contains an allusion to the verb <i>worketh, </i>as in Latin
<i>effectus </i>(an effect) corresponds with the verb <i>effectus </i>(to
effect.) Paul&#8217;s meaning is, that although believers may be endowed with
different powers, they all take their rise from one and the same power on the
part of God. Hence the expression employed here<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>worketh all things in all
&#8212; does</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>not refer to the general
providence of God, but to the liberality that he exercises towards us, in
bestowing upon every one some gift. The sum is this &#8212; that there is
nothing in mankind that is good or praiseworthy but what comes from God alone.
Hence it is out of place here to agitate the question &#8212; in what manner God
acts in Satan and in reprobates.</font><br></div>

points out the purpose for which God has appointed his gifts, for he does not
confer them upon us in vain, nor does he intend that they shall serve the
purpose of ostentation. Hence we must inquire as to the purpose for which they
are conferred. As to this Paul answers &#8212; (<i>with a view to utility)
&#8212; </i></font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pro&lt;v to&lt;

of God does there
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>manifest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

second interpretation suits better. The view taken by Chrysostom is rather harsh
and forced &#8212; that this term is
used,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

</i>therefore, in my opinion, means <i>acquaintance with sacred things &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>take

f637</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is employed here to mean a special faith, as we shall afterwards see from the
context. A special faith is of such a kind as does not apprehend Christ wholly,
for redemption, righteousness, and sanctification, but only in so far as
miracles are performed in his name. Judas had a faith of this kind, and he
wrought miracles too by means of it. Chrysostom distinguishes it in a somewhat
different manner, calling it the faith of miracles, not of
doctrines.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f638</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This, however, does not differ much from
the interpretation previously mentioned. By the <i>gift of

inclined, however, to think, that what is meant is the influence which is
exercised against devils, and also against hypocrites. When, therefore, Christ
and his Apostles by authority restrained devils, or put them to flight, that was
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejne&gt;rghma</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

13:11,) and when Peter struck Ananias and Sapphira dead upon the spot with a
single word. The gifts of <i>healing </i>and of miracles, therefore, serve to
manifest the goodness of God, but this last, his severity for the destruction of
Satan.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<i>something</i>.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440536&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
5:36.) I speak not of that natural wisdom, by which we are regulated in judging.
It was a special illumination, with which some were endowed by the gift of God.
The use of it was this that they might not be imposed upon by masks, of mere
pretences,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f642</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but might by that spiritual judgment
distinguish, as by a particular mark, the true ministers of Christ from the
false.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There was a difference between the <i>knowledge of
tongues, </i>and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>interpretation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of them, for those who were endowed with the former were, in many cases, not
acquainted with the language of the nation with which they had to deal. The
<i>interpreters</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f643</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>rendered foreign tongues into the
native language. These endowments they did not at that time acquire by labor or
study, but were put in possession of them by a wonderful revelation of the
Spirit.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One and the same spirit

those act amiss who, having no concern as to participation, break asunder that
holy harmony, that is fitly adjusted in all its parts, only when under the
guidance of the same Spirit, all conspire toward one and the same object. He
again calls the Corinthians to unity, by reminding them that all have derived
from one fountain whatever they possess, while he instructs them, at the same
time, that no one has so much as to have enough within himself, so as not to
require help from others. For this is what he means by these
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>words &#8212; distributing to
every one severally as he willeth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The
Spirit of God, therefore, distributes them among us, in order that we may make
all contribute to the common advantage. To no one does he give all, lest any
one, satisfied with his particular portion, should separate himself from others,
and live solely for himself. The same idea is intended in the adverb
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>severally</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:4; but it is for a different purpose, as I have already stated above. In that
passage, he exhorts every one to be satisfied with his own calling, and not to
invade another&#8217;s territory; as ambition, curiosity, or some other
disposition, induces many to take in hand more than is expedient. Here, however,
he exhorts believers to cleave to each other in a mutual distribution of gifts,
as they were not conferred upon them by God that every one should enjoy his own
separately, but that one should help another. It is usual, however, for any
society of men, or congregation, to be called a <i>body, </i>as one city
constitutes a <i>body, </i>and so, in like manner, one senate, and one people.
Monenius Agrippa,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f646</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> too, in ancient times, when desirous to
conciliate the Roman people, when at variance with the senate, made use of an
apologue, not very unlike the doctrine of Paul
here.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f647</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Among Christians, however, the case is
very different; for they do not constitute a mere political body, but are the
spiritual and mystical body of Christ, as Paul himself afterwards adds. (1
Corinthians11:27.) The meaning therefore <i>is</i> &#8212; &#8220;Though the
members of the body are various, and have different functions, they are,
nevertheless, linked together in such a manner that they coalesce in
one.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f648</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We, accordingly, who are members of
Christ, although we are endowed with various gifts, ought, notwithstanding, to
have an eye to that connection which we have in Christ.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So also is
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The name of Christ is used here
instead of the Church, because the similitude was intended to apply not to
God&#8217;s only-begotten Son, but to us. It is a passage that is full of choice
consolation, inasmuch as he calls the Church
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for Christ</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f649</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> confers upon us this honor &#8212; that
he is willing to be esteemed and recognised, not in himself merely, but also in
his members. Hence the same Apostle says elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:23,) that the Church is his
<i>completion,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f650</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as though he would, if separated

himself in one part of his writings &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Since we are <i>in

<div><font face="Palatino">In this, then, our consolation lies &#8212; that, as
he and the Father are one, so we are one with him. Hence it is that his name is

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we are all baptized by one
Spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here there is a proof brought
forward from the effect of baptism. <i>&#8220;We </i>are,&#8221; says he,
<i>&#8220;engrafted </i>by baptism into Christ&#8217;s body, so that we are by a
mutual link bound together as members, and live one and the same life. Hence
every one, that would remain in the Church of Christ, must necessarily cultivate
this fellowship.&#8221; He speaks, however, of the baptism of believers, which
is efficacious through the grace of the Spirit, for, in the case of many,
baptism is merely in the letter &#8212; the symbol without the reality; but
believers, along with the sacrament, receive the reality. Hence, with respect to
God, this invariably holds good &#8212; that baptism is an engrafting into the
body of Christ, for God in that ordinance does not represent anything but what
he is prepared to accomplish, provided we are on our part capable of it. The
Apostle, also, observes here a most admirable medium, in teaching that the
nature of baptism is &#8212; to connect us with Christ&#8217;s body. Lest any
one, however, should imagine, that this is effected by the outward symbol, he
adds that it is the work of the Holy Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whether Jews or
Greeks.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He specifies these instances, to
intimate, that no diversity of condition obstructs that holy unity which he
recommends. This clause, too, is added suitably and appropriately, for envy
might at that time arise from two sources &#8212; because the <i>Jews </i>were
not willing that the Gentiles should be put upon a level with them; and, where
one had some excellence above others, with the view of maintaining his
superiority, lie withdrew himself to a distance from his
brethren.</font><br></div>

rather to be, that we are made to drink through the influence, as he had said
before, of the Spirit of Christ, than that we have drunk into the same Spirit.
It is uncertain, however, whether he speaks here of Baptism or of the Supper. I
am rather inclined, however, to understand him as referring to the Supper, as he
makes mention of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>drinking</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>for I have no doubt that he intended to make an allusion to the similitude
of the sign. There is, however, no correspondence between
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>drinking</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and baptism. Now, though the cup forms but the half of the Supper, there is
no difficulty arising from that, for it is a common thing in Scripture to speak
of the sacraments by
synecdoche.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f651</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Thus he mentioned above in the tenth
chapter (1 Corinthians10:17) simply the <i>bread, </i>making no mention of the
cup. The meaning, therefore, will be this &#8212; that participation in the cup
has an eye to this &#8212; that we drink, all of us, of the same cup. For in
that ordinance we drink of the life-giving blood of Christ, that we may have
life in common with him &#8212; which we truly have, when he lives in us by his
Spirit. He teaches, therefore, that believers, so soon as they are initiated by
the baptism of Christ, are already imbued with a desire of cultivating mutual
unity,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f652</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and then afterwards, when they receive
the sacred Supper, they are again conducted by degrees to the same unity, as
they are all refreshed at the same time with the same drink.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b> This is a bringing out still farther
<i>(</i></font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpexergasi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino"><i>)
</i>of the preceding statement, or in other words, an exposition of it, with
some amplification, with the view of placing in a clearer light, what he had
previously stated in a few words. Now all this accords with the apologue of
Menenius Agrippa. &#8220;Should a dissension break out in the body, so that the
feet would refuse to discharge their office to the rest of the body, and the
belly in like manner, and the eyes, and the hands, what would be the effect?
Would not the result be &#8212; the destruction of the whole body?&#8221; At the
same time Paul here insists more particularly on this one point &#8212; that
each member ought to rest satisfied with its own place and station, and not envy
the others, for he institutes a comparison between the more distinguished
members, and those that have less dignity. For the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eye</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>has a more honorable place in the body than the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>than the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foot</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>But if our hands were, from a feeling of envy, to refuse to discharge their
office, would nature endure this? Would the hand be listened to, when wishing to
be separated from the body?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To be not of the
body,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>means here &#8212; to have no
communication with the other members, but to live for itself, and to seek only
its own advantage. &#8220;Would<i> </i>it then,&#8221; says Paul, &#8220;be<i>
</i>allowable for the hand to refuse to do its once to the other members, on the
ground of its bearing envy to the eyes?&#8221;<i> </i>These things are said of
the natural body, but they must be applied to the members of the Church, lest
ambition or misdirected emulation and envy should be the occasion of bad feeling
among us,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f653</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so as to lead one that occupies an
inferior station to grudge to afford his services to those above
him.</font><br></div>

aside a foolish aiming at equality, by showing the impossibility of it.
&#8220;If<i> </i>all the members,&#8221; says he, &#8220;desire the honor that
belongs to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eye</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the consequence will be, that the whole body will perish; for it is
impossible that the body should remain safe and sound, if the members have not
different functions, and a mutual correspondence between them. Hence equality
interferes with the welfare of the body, because it produces a confusion that
entails present ruin. What madness, then, would it be, should one member,
instead of giving way to
another,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f654</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> conspire for its own ruin and that of
the body!&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But now God hath
placed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here we have another argument,
taken from the appointment of God. &#8220;It has pleased God, that the body
should consist of various members, and that the members should be endowed with
various offices and gifts. That member, therefore, which will not rest satisfied
with its own station, will wage war with God after the manner of the
giants.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f655</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us, therefore, be subject to the
arrangement which God has appointed, that we may not, to no purpose, resist his

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If all were one
member</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He means, that God has not acted
at random, or without good reason, in assigning different gifts to the members
of the body; but because it was necessary that it should be so, for the
preservation of the body; for if this symmetry were taken away, there would be
utter confusion and derangement. Hence we ought to submit ourselves the more
carefully to the providence of God, which has so suitably arranged everything
for our common advantage. <i>One member </i>is taken here to mean a mass, that
is all of one shape, and not distinguished by any variety; for if God were to
fashion our body into a mass of this kind, it would be a useless
heap.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

body</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He repeats this the oftener,
because the stress of the whole question lies here &#8212; that the unity of the
body is of such a nature as cannot be maintained but by a diversity of members;
and that, while the members differ from each other in offices and functions, it
is in such a way as to have a mutual connection with each other for the
preservation of the one body. Hence no body can retain its standing without a
diversified symmetry of the members, that we may know to consult public as well
as private advantage, by discharging, every one, the duty of his own
station.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the eye cannot say to the
hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hitherto he has been showing, what
is the office of the less honorable members &#8212; to discharge their duty to
the body, and not envy the more distinguished members. <i>Now, </i>on the other
hand, he enjoins it upon the more honorable members, not to despise the inferior
members, which they cannot dispense with. The <i>eye </i>excels the <i>hand,
</i>and yet cannot despise it, or insult over it, as though it were useless; and
he draws an argument from utility, to show that it ought to be thus &#8212;
&#8220;Those members, that are less esteemed, are the more necessary: hence,
with a view to the safety of the body, they must not be despised.&#8221; He
makes use of the term <i>weaker </i>here, to mean <i>despised, </i>as in another
passage, when he says that he <i>glories in his infirmities,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;471209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 12:9,) he expresses, under this term, those things which rendered
him contemptible and abject.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which are less
honorable.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here we have a <i>second
</i>argument &#8212; that the dishonor of one member turns out to the common
disgrace of the whole body, as appears from the care that we take to cover the
parts that are </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>less
honorable</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. &#8220;Those </i>parts that are
<i>comely,&#8221; </i>says he, <i>&#8220;do </i>not require adventitious
ornament; but the parts that involve shame, or are less comely, are cared for by
us with greater concern. Why so? but because their shame would be the common
disgrace of the whole body.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To invest with
honor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is to put on a covering for the
sake of ornament, in order that those members may be honorably concealed, which
would involve shame if

had stated once before, (1 Corinthians11:18,) but more explicitly, &#8212; that
God has appointed this symmetry, and that with a view to the advantage of the
whole body, because it cannot otherwise maintain its standing. &#8220;For<i>
</i>whence comes it, that all the members are of their own accord concerned for
the honor of a less comely member, and agree together to conceal its shame? This
inclination has been implanted in them by God, because without this adjustment
<i>a schism in the body </i>would quickly break out. Hence it appears that the
body is not merely shattered, and the order of nature perverted, but the
authority of God is openly set at naught, whenever any one assumes more than

be <i>honored, </i>here, is taken in a large sense, as meaning, to be <i>in
prosperity and happiness. </i>Nothing, however, is better fitted to promote
harmony than this community of interest, when every one feels that, by the

others; but let him consider that there is nothing so diminutive as to be of no
use &#8212; as, in truth, even the least among the pious brings forth fruit,
according to his slender capacity, so that there is no useless member in the

<div><font face="Palatino">He has in the beginning of the chapter spoken of
<i>gifts: </i>now he begins to treat of <i>offices, </i>and this order it is
proper that we should carefully observe, For the Lord did not appoint ministers,
without first endowing them with the requisite gifts, and qualifying them for
discharging their duty. Hence we must infer, that those are fanatics, and
actuated by an evil spirit, who intrude themselves into the Church, while
destitute of the necessary qualifications, as many boast that they are under the
influence of the Spirit, and glory in a secret call from God, while in the
meantime they are unlearned and utterly ignorant. The natural order, on the
other hand, is this &#8212; that gifts come before the office to be discharged.
As, then, he has taught above, that everything that an individual has received
from God, should be made subservient to the common good, so now he declares that
offices are distributed in such a manner, that all may together, by united
efforts, edify the Church, and each individual according to his
measure.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>First,
Apostles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He does not enumerate all the
particular kinds, and there was no need of this, for he merely intended to bring
forward some examples. In the fourth Chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:11,) there is a fuller enumeration of the offices, that are required for the
continued government of the Church. The reason of this I shall assign there, if
the Lord shall permit me to advance so far, though even there he does not make
mention of them all. As to the passage before us, we must observe, that of the
offices which Paul makes mention of, some are perpetual, others temporary. Those
that are perpetual, are such as are necessary for the government of the Church;
those that are temporary, are such as were appointed at the beginning for the
founding of the Church, and the raising up of Christ&#8217;s kingdom; and these,
in a short time afterwards, ceased.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the <i>first </i>class belongs the office of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Teacher</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>office</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Apostle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for the Lord created the Apostles, that they might spread the gospel
throughout the whole world, and he did not assign to each of them certain limits
or parishes, but would have them, wherever they went, to discharge the office of
ambassadors among all nations and languages. In this respect there is a
difference between them and <i>Pastors, </i>who are, in a manner, tied to their
particular churches. For the <i>Pastor </i>has not a commission to preach the
gospel over the whole world, but to take care of the Church that has been
committed to his charge. In his Epistle to the Ephesians he places
<i>Evangelists </i>after the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Apostles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but here he passes them over; for from the highest order, he passes
immediately to <i>Prophets.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By this term he means, (in my opinion,) not those who
were endowed with the gift of prophesying, but those who were endowed with a
peculiar gift, not merely for interpreting Scripture, but also for applying it
wisely for present use.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f667</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> My reason for thinking so is this, that
he prefers prophecy to all other gifts, on the ground of its yielding more
edification &#8212; a commendation that would not be applicable to the
predicting of future events. Farther, when he describes the office of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prophet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or at least treats of what he ought principally to do, he says that he must
devote himself to consolation, exhortation, and doctrine. Now these are things
that are distinct from
prophesyings.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f668</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us, then, by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in this passage understand, <i>first </i>of all, eminent interpreters of
Scripture, and farther, persons who are endowed with no common wisdom and
dexterity in taking a right view of the present necessity of the Church, that
they may speak suitably to it, and in this way be, in a manner, ambassadors to
communicate the divine will.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Between them and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Teachers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>this difference may be pointed out, that the office of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Teacher</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>consists in taking care that sound doctrines be maintained and propagated,
in order that the purity of religion may be kept up in the Church. At the same
time, even this term is taken in different senses, and here perhaps it is used
rather in the sense of Pastor, unless you prefer, it may be, to take it in a
general way for all that are endowed with the gift of teaching, as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:1, where also <i>Luke </i>conjoins them with Prophets. My reason for not
agreeing with those who make the whole of the office of <i>Prophet </i>consist
in the interpretation of Scripture, is this &#8212; that Paul restricts the
number of those who ought to speak, to <i>two or three;
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461429&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:29,) which would not accord with a bare interpretation of
Scripture. In fine, my opinion is this &#8212; that the Prophets here spoken of
are those who make known the will of <i>God, </i>by applying with dexterity and
skill prophecies, threatenings, promises, and the whole doctrine of Scripture,
to the present use of the Church. If any one is of a different opinion, I have
no objection to his being so, and will not raise any quarrel on that account.
For it is difficult to form a judgment as to gifts and offices of which the
Church has been so long deprived, excepting only that there are some traces, or
shadows of them still to be seen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>powers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> gift of
healings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I have spoken when commenting
on the 12th Chapter of the Romans. Only it must be observed that here he makes
mention, not so much of the gifts themselves, as of the administration of them.
As the Apostle is here enumerating offices, I do not approve of what Chrysostom
says, that
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajntilh&gt;yeiv</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, <i>helps </i>or <i>aids, </i>consist in supporting the weak. What
is it then? Undoubtedly, it is either an office, as well as gift, that was
exercised in ancient times, but of which we have at this day no knowledge
whatever; or it is connected with the office of Deacon, or in other words, the
care of the poor; and this latter idea pleases me
better.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:7, he makes mention of two kinds of deacons. Of these I have treated when
commenting upon that passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Governments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

propriety of deportment, as Paul shows elsewhere, when he makes mention of two

knowledge of languages, and the gift of interpretation. They were, however, two
distinct gifts; because in some cases an individual spoke in different
languages, and yet did not understand the language of the Church with which he
had to do. This defect was supplied by
interpreters.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are all
Apostles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>It may indeed have happened,
that one individual was endowed with many gifts, and sustained two of the
offices which he has enumerated; nor was there in this any inconsistency.
Paul&#8217;s object, however, is to show in the <i>first </i>place, that no one
has such a fullness in everything as to have a sufficiency within himself, and
not require the aid of others; and <i>secondly, </i>that offices as well as
gifts are distributed in such a manner that no one member constitutes the whole
body, but each contributing his portion to the common advantage, they then
altogether constitute an entire and perfect body. For Paul means here to take
away every occasion of proud boasting, base envyings, haughtiness, and contempt
of the brethren, malignity, ambition, and everything of that
nature.</font><br></div>

makes little difference as to the meaning; for Paul exhorts the Corinthians to
esteem and desire those gifts especially, which are most conducive to
edification.: For this fault prevailed among them &#8212; that they aimed at
show, rather than usefulness. Hence <i>prophecy </i>was neglected, while
<i>languages </i>sounded forth among them, with great show, indeed, but with
little profit. He does not, however, address individuals, as though he wished
that every one should aspire at prophecy, or the office of teacher; but simply
recommends to them a desire to promote edification, that they may apply
themselves the more diligently to those things that are most conducive to
edification.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

<div><font face="Palatino">The division of the Chapter being so absurd, I could
not refrain from changing it, especially as I could not conveniently interpret
it otherwise. For what purpose did it serve to connect with what goes before a
detached sentence, which agrees so well with what comes after &#8212; nay more,
is thereby rendered complete? It is likely, that it happened through a mistake
on the part of the transcribers. However it may be as to this, after having
commanded that regard should be had chiefly to edification, he now declares that
he will show them something of greater importance &#8212; that everything be
regulated according to the rule of <i>love. </i>This, then, is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the most excellent
way</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>when <i>love </i>is the regulating
principle of all our actions. And, in the outset, he proceeds upon this &#8212;
that all excellencies</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f673</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are of no value without <i>love; </i>for
nothing is so excellent or estimable as not to be vitiated in the sight of God,
if <i>love</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f674</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is wanting. Nor does he teach
anything here but what he does elsewhere, when he <i>declares, </i>that it is
the <i>end of the law, </i>and the <i>bond of perfection,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 1:5,) and also when he makes the holiness of the godly consist entirely
in this, (Colossians 3:l4,) &#8212; for what else does God require from us in
the second Table of the Law? It is not then to be wondered, if all our deeds are
estimated by this test &#8212; their appearing to proceed from love. It is also
not to be wondered, if gifts, otherwise ex<i>cellent, </i>come to have their
true value only when they are made subservient to <i>love.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If should speak with the
tongues of men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He begins with
eloquence, which is, it is true, an admirable gift, considered in itself, but,
when apart from <i>love, </i>does not recommend a man in the estimation of God.
When he speaks of the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tongue of
angels,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he uses a hyperbolical
expression to denote what is singular, or distinguished. At the same time, I
explain it rather as referring to the diversity of languages, which the
Corinthians held in much esteem, measuring everything by ambition &#8212; not by
fruit.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f675</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;Make yourself master,&#8221;<i>

You have, in that case, no reason to think, that you are of higher estimation in
the sight of God than a mere cymbal, if you have not
<i>love.&#8221;</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if I should have the gift

term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophecy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>by way of explanation, but as the term <i>knowledge </i>is immediately
added, of which he had previously made mention by itself,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:8,) it will deserve your consideration, whether the <i>knowledge
of mysteries </i>may not be used here to mean <i>wisdom. </i>As for myself,
while I would not venture to affirm that it is so, I am much inclined to that
opinion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>of which he speaks, is special, as is evident from the clause that is
immediately added &#8212; so </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
I remove mountains</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence the Sophists
accomplish nothing, when they pervert this passage for the purpose of detracting
from the excellence of faith. As, therefore, the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is
<i>(</i></font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">polu&gt;shmon</font><font face="Palatino"><i>)
used in a variety of senses, </i>it is the part of the prudent reader to observe
in what signification it is taken. Paul, however, as I have already stated, is
his own interpreter, by restricting
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>here, to miracles. It is what Chrysostom calls the <i>&#8220;faith </i>of
miracles,&#8221; and what we term a &#8220;special faith,&#8221; because it does
not apprehend a whole Christ, but simply his power in working miracles; and
hence it may sometimes exist in a man without the Spirit of sanctification, as
it did in Judas.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

true, is worthy of the highest praise, if considered in itself; but as
liberality in many cases proceeds from ambition &#8212; not from true
generosity, or even the man that is liberal is destitute of the other
departments of love, (for even liberality, that is inwardly felt, is only one
department of <i>love,) </i>it may happen that a work, otherwise so commendable,
has, indeed, a fair show in the sight of men, and is applauded by them, and yet
is regarded as nothing in the sight of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if I should give up my
body.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He speaks, undoubtedly, of
martyrdom, which is an act that is the most lovely and excellent of all; for
what is more admirable than that invincible fortitude of mind, which makes a man
not hesitate to pour out his life for the testimony of the gospel? Yet even
this, too, God regards as nothing, if the mind is destitute of <i>love. </i>The
kind of punishment that he makes mention of was not then so common among
Christians; for we read that tyrants, at that time, set themselves to destroy
the Church, rather by swords than by
flames,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f679</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> except that Nero, in his rage, had
recourse, also, to burning. The Spirit appears, however, to have predicted here,
by Paul&#8217;s mouth, the persecutions that were coming. But this is a
digression. The main truth in the passage is this &#8212; that as <i>love </i>is
the only rule of our actions, and the only means of regulating the right use of
the gifts of God, nothing, in the absence of it, is approved of by God, however
magnificent it may be in the estimation of men. For where it is wanting, the
beauty of all virtues is mere tinsel &#8212; is empty sound &#8212; is not worth
a straw &#8212; nay more, is offensive and disgusting. As for the inference
which Papists draw from this &#8212; that <i>love </i>is therefore of more avail
for our justification than faith, we shall refute it afterwards. At present, we

different significations; but, as it is sometimes taken to <i>mean &#8212; being
fierce, or insolent, through presumption, </i>this meaning seemed to be more
suitable to the passage before
us.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f682</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Paul, therefore, ascribes to <i>love
</i>moderation, and declares that it is a bridle to restrain men, that they may
not break forth into ferocity, but may live together in a peaceable and orderly
manner. He adds, farther, that it has nothing of the nature of
pride.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

Doth not behave itself unseemly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Erasmus
renders it <i>&#8220;Is not disdainful;&#8221; </i>but as he quotes no author in
support of this interpretation, I have preferred to retain its proper and usual
signification. I explain it, however, in this way &#8212; that <i>love </i>does
not exult in a foolish ostentation, or does not bluster, but observes moderation
and propriety. And in this manner, he again reproves the Corinthians indirectly,
because they shamefully set at naught all propriety by an unseemly
haughtiness.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f685</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seeketh not its

far we are from having <i>love </i>implanted in us by nature; for we are
naturally prone to have love and care for ourselves, and aim at our own
advantage. Nay, to speak more correct]y, we rush headlong into
it.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f686</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For so perverse an inclination the
remedy</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f687</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is <i>love, </i>which leads us to leave
off caring for ourselves, and feel concerned for our neighbors, so as to love
them and be concerned for their welfare. Farther, <i>to

things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f688</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is to be devoted to self, and to
be wholly taken up with concern for one&#8217;s own advantage. This definition
solves the question, whether it is lawful for a Christian to be concerned for
his own advantage? for Paul does not here reprove every kind of care or concern
for ourselves, but the excess of it, which proceeds from an immoderate and blind
attachment to ourselves. Now the excess lies in this &#8212; if we think of
ourselves so as to neglect others, or if the desire of our own advantage calls
us off from that concern, which God commands us to have as to our
neighbors.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f689</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He adds, that <i>love </i>is also a
bridle to repress quarrels, and this follows from the first two statements. For
where there is gentleness and forbearance, persons in that case do not, on a
sudden, become angry, and are not easily stirred up to disputes and
contests.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Beareth all

intimates, that love is neither impatient nor spiteful. For to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and <i>endure all things </i>is the part of forbearance to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>believe</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and <i>hope all things </i>is the part of candor and kindness. As we are
naturally too much devoted to self, this vice renders us morose and peevish. The
effect is, that every one wishes that others should carry him upon their
shoulders, but refuses for his part to assist others. The remedy for this
disease is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which makes us subject to our brethren, and teaches us to apply our
shoulders to <i>their burdens.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:2.) Farther, as we are naturally <i>spiteful, </i>we are, consequently,
suspicious too, and take almost everything amiss. <i>Love, </i>on the other
hand, calls us back to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kindness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

referring to the things that <i>ought to be endured, </i>and in such a manner as
is befitting. For we are not to bear with vices, so as to give our sanction to
them by flattery, or, by winking at them, encourage them through our supineness.
Farther, this <i>endurance </i>does not exclude <i>corrections </i>and just

divests himself of prudence and judgment, that he may be the more easily taken
advantage of &#8212; not that he unlearns the way of distinguishing black from
white. What then? He requires here, as I have already said, <i>simplicity
</i>and <i>kindness </i>in judging of things; and he declares that
these</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f691</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are the invariable accompaniments of
<i>love. </i>The consequence will be, that a Christian man will reckon it better
to be imposed upon by his own kindness and easy temper, than to wrong his

survives.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Papists pervert this passage, for the purpose of
establishing the doctrine which they have contrived, without any authority from
Scripture &#8212; that the souls of the deceased pray to God on our behalf. For
they reason in this manner: &#8220;Prayer is a perpetual <i>office </i>of love
&#8212; love endures in the souls of departed saints &#8212; therefore they pray
for <i>us.&#8221; </i>For my part, although I should not wish to contend too
keenly on this point, yet, in order that they may not think that they have
gained much by having this conceded to them, I reply to their objection in a few
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>first </i>place, though love <i>endures for
ever, </i>it does not <i>necessarily </i>follow that it is (as the expression
is) in constant exercise. For what is there to hinder our maintaining that the
saints, being now in the enjoyment of calm repose, do not exercise
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in present offices?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f692</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What absurdity, I pray you, would there
be in this? In the <i>second </i>place, were I to maintain, that it is <i>not
</i>a perpetual office of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
to </i>intercede for the brethren, how would they prove the contrary? That a
person may intercede for another, it is necessary that he be acquainted with his
necessity. If we may conjecture as to the state of the dead, it is a more
probable supposition, that departed saints are ignorant of what is doing here,
than that they are aware of our necessities. Papists, it is true, imagine, that
they see the whole world in the reflection of light which they enjoy in the
vision of God; but it is a profane and altogether heathenish contrivance, which
has more of the savor of Egyptian
theology,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f693</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> than it has of accordance with Christian
philosophy. What, then, if I should maintain that the saints, being ignorant of
our condition, are not concerned in reference to us? With what argument will
Papists press me, so as to constrain me to hold their opinion? What if I should
affirm, that they are so occupied and swallowed up, as it were, in the vision of
God, that they think of nothing besides? How will they prove that this is not
agreeable to reason? &#8216;What if I should reply, that the perpetuity of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>here mentioned by the Apostle, will be after the last day, and has nothing
to do with the time that is intermediate? What if I should say that the office
of mutual intercession has been enjoined only upon the living, and those that
are sojourning in this world, and consequently does not at all extend to the
departed?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I have already said more than enough; for the
very point for which they contend I leave undetermined, that I may not raise any
contention upon a matter that does not call for it. It was, however, of
importance to notice, in passing, how little support is given them from this
passage, in which they think they have so strong a bulwark. Let us reckon it
enough, that it has no support from any declaration of scripture, and that,
consequently, it is maintained by them rashly and
inconsiderately.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whether knowledge, it will be
destroyed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have already seen the
meaning of these words; but from this arises a question of no small importances
whether those who in this world excel either in learning, or in other gifts,
will be on a level with idiots in the kingdom of God? In the <i>first </i>place,
I should wish to admonish</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f695</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> pious readers, not to harass themselves
more than is meet in the investigation of these things. Let them rather seek the
way by which the kingdom of God is arrived at, than curiously inquire, what is
to be our condition there; for the Lord himself has, by his silence, called us
back from such curiosity. I now return to the question. So far as I can
conjecture, and am able even to gather in part from this passage &#8212;
inasmuch as learning, knowledge of languages, and similar gifts are subservient
to the necessity of this life, I do not think that there will be any of them
then remaining. The learned, however, will sustain no loss from the want of
them, inasmuch as they will receive the fruit of them, which is greatly to be
preferred.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

Paul&#8217;s meaning, however, is &#8212; that it is owing to our imperfection
that we at present have knowledge and prophecy. Hence the phrase

our whole life, and that everything that we have is merely begun. Let us
observe, however, what Paul designs to prove &#8212; that the gifts in question
are but temporary. Now he proves this from the circumstance, that the advantage
of them is only for a time &#8212; so long as we aim at the mark by making

perfection come? It begins, indeed, at death, for then we put off, along with
the body, many infirmities; but it will not be completely manifested until the
day of judgment, as we shall hear presently. Hence we infer, that the whole of
this discussion is ignorantly applied to the time that is

are afterwards done away on arriving at maturity. For example, education is
necessary for childhood; it does not comport with mature
age.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

require, in some sense, education. We are far from having attained, as yet, the

In his Epistle to the Ephesians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians

<div><font face="Palatino">The ministry of the word, I say, is like a

sacraments, for they enjoy a vision of God of another
kind;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f701</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and God does not give them a view of his
face merely in a mirror, but openly manifests himself as present with them. We,
who have not as yet reached that great height, behold the image of God as it is
presented before us in the word, in the sacraments, and, in fine, in the whole
of the service of the Church. This vision Paul here speaks of as partaking of
obscurity &#8212; not as though it were doubtful or delusive, but because it is
not so distinct as that which will be at last afforded on the final day. He
teaches the same thing in other words, in the <i>second </i>Epistle &#8212;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:7) &#8212; that,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">so long as we dwell in
the body we are absent from the
Lord;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">for we walk by faith, not by
sight.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our faith, therefore, at present beholds God as
absent. How so? Because it sees not his face, but rests satisfied with the image
in the <i>mirror; </i>but when we shall have left the world, and gone to him, it
will behold him as near and before its eyes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we must understand it in this manner &#8212;
that the knowledge of God, which we now have from his word, is indeed certain
and true, and has nothing in it that is confused, or perplexed, or dark, but is
spoken of as comparatively <i>obscure, </i>because it comes far short of that
clear manifestation to which we look forward; for then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we shall see face to
face</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f702</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Thus this passage is not at all
at variance with other passages, which speak of the clearness, at one time, of
the law, at another time, of the entire Scripture, but more especially of the
gospel. For we have in the word (in so far as is expedient for us)a naked and
open revelation of God, and it has nothing intricate in it, to hold us in
suspense, as wicked persons imagine;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

small a proportion does this bear to <i>that </i>vision, which we have in our
eye! Hence it is only in a comparative sense, that it is termed
<i>obscure.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The adverb <i>then </i>denotes the last day, rather
than the time that is immediately subsequent to death. At the same time,
although full vision will be deferred until the day of Christ, a nearer view of
God will begin to be enjoyed immediately after death, when our souls, set free
from the body, will have no more need of the outward ministry, or other inferior
helps. Paul, however, as I noticed a little ago, does not enter into any close
discussion as to the state of the dead, because the knowledge of that is not
particularly serviceable to piety.</font><br></div>

particular effects <i>of faith, </i>and compare them,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>will be found to be in many respects superior. Nay, even <i>love </i>itself,
according to the testimony of the same Apostle,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;520103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 1:3,) is an effect of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Now the effect is, undoubtedly, inferior to its cause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, there is bestowed upon
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>a signal commendation, which does not apply to <i>love, </i>when John
declares that it is <i>our victory, which overcometh the world.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 5:4.) In fine, it is by faith that we are born against that we become the
sons of God &#8212; that we obtain eternal life, and that <i>Christ dwells in
</i>us.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:17.) Innumerable other things I pass over; but these few are sufficient to
prove what I have in view &#8212; that faith is, in many of its effects,
superior to love. Hence it is evident, that it is declared here to be superior
&#8212; not in every respect, but inasmuch as it will be perpetual, and holds at
present the first place in the preservation of the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, however, surprising how much pleasure Papists
take hi thundering forth these words. <i>&#8220;If faith </i>justifies,&#8221;
say they, <i>&#8220;then </i>much more does <i>love, </i>which is declared to be
<i>greater.&#8221; </i>A solution of this objection is already furnished from
what I have stated, but let us grant that <i>love </i>is in every respect
superior; what sort of reasoning is that &#8212; that because it is greater,
therefore it is of more avail for justifying men! Then a king will plow the
ground better than a husbandman, and he will make a shoe better than a
shoemaker, because he is more noble than either! Then a man will run faster than
a horse, and will carry a heavier burden than an elephant, because he is
superior in dignity! Then angels will give light to the earth better than the
sun and moon, because they are more excellent! If the power of justifying
depended on the dignity or merit of faith they might perhaps be listened to; but
we do not teach that faith justifies, on the ground of its having more
worthiness, or occupying a higher station of honor, but because it receives the
righteousness which is freely offered in the gospel. Greatness or dignity has
nothing to do with this. Hence this passage gives Papists no more help, than if
the Apostle had given the preference to

gifts, and, inferring from what goes before, that where they do not assign to

the pursuit of them, and wishes them to have a place in the Church. And
assuredly, as they had been conferred for the advantage of the Church,

therefore, an admirable medium, by disapproving of nothing that was useful,
while at the same time he exhorts them not to prefer, by an absurd zeal, things
of less consequence to what was of primary importance. Now he assigns the first
place to

it is probable the Corinthians exercised themselves the more, because it had
more of show connected with it, for when persons hear a man speaking in a
foreign tongue, their admiration is commonly <i>excited. </i>He accordingly
shows, from principles already assumed, how perverse a thing this is, inasmuch
as it does not at all contribute to the edifying of the Church. He says in the

speaketh <i>mysteries </i>and hidden things, and things, therefore, that are of
no profit.&#8221; Chrysostom understands <i>mysteries </i>here in a good sense,
as meaning &#8212; special revelations from God. I understand the term, however,
in a bad sense, as meaning &#8212; dark sayings, that are obscure and involved,
as if he had said, <i>&#8220;He </i>speaks what no one

he, &#8220;is profitable to all, while a foreign language is a treasure hid in
the earth. What great folly, then, it is to spend all one&#8217;s time in what
is useless, and, on the other hand, to neglect what appears to be most
useful!&#8221; To <i>speak to edification, </i>is to speak what contains
doctrine fitted to edify. For I understand this term to mean doctrine, by which
we are trained to piety, to faith, to the worship and fear of God, and the
duties of holiness and righteousness. As, however, we have for the most part
need of goads, while others are pressed down by afflictions, or labor under
weakness, he adds to doctrine,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>exhortation and
consolation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It appears from this
passage, and from what goes before, that <i>prophecy </i>does not mean the gift
of foretelling future events: but as I have said this once before, I do not
repeat it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that speaketh in another

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speaketh to
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But whatever is done in the
Church, ought to be for the common benefit. Away, then, with that <i>misdirected
</i>ambition, which gives occasion for the advantage of the people generally
being hindered! Besides, Paul speaks by way of concession: for when ambition
makes use of such empty
vauntings,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f710</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> there is inwardly no desire of doing
good; but Paul does, in effect, order away from the common society of believers
those men of mere show, who look only to themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I would that ye all spake
with tongues</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Again he declares that he
does not give such a <i>preference </i>to prophecy, as not. to leave some place
for foreign tongues. This must be carefully observed. For God has conferred
nothing upon his Church in vain, and languages were of some
benefit.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f711</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence, although the Corinthians, by a
misdirected eagerness for show, had rendered that gift partly useless and
worthless, and partly even injurious, yet Paul, nevertheless, commends the use
of tongues. So far is he from wishing them abolished or thrown away. At the
present day, while a knowledge of languages is more than simply necessary, and
while God has at this time, in his wonderful kindness, brought them forward from
darkness into light, there are at present great theologians, who declaim against
them with furious zeal. As it is certain, that the Holy Spirit has here honored
the use of tongues with never-dying praise, we may very readily gather, what is
the kind of spirit that actuates those
reformers,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f712</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who level as many reproaches as they can
against the pursuit of them. At the same time the cases are very different. For
Paul takes in languages of any sort &#8212; such as served merely for the
publication of the gospel among all nations. They, on the other hand, condemn
those languages, from which, as fountains, the pure truth of scripture is to be
drawn. An exception is added &#8212; that we must not be so taken up with the
use of languages, as to treat with neglect <i>prophecy, </i>which ought to have
the first place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unless he
interpret.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For if interpretation is
added, there will then be prophecy. You must not, however, understand Paul to
give liberty here to any one to <i>take </i>up the time of the Church to no
profit by muttering words in a foreign tongue. For how ridiculous it were, to
repeat the same thing in a variety of languages without any necessity! But it
often happens, that the use of a foreign tongue is seasonable. In short, let us
simply have an eye to this as our end &#8212; that edification may redound to
the Church.</font><br></div>

themselves abundant fruit from his doctrine. He asks them, then, of what
advantage it would be to them, if he were to make use of foreign languages among
them. He shows them by this instance, how much better it were to apply their
minds to prophesyings. Besides, it was less invidious to reprove this vice in
his own person, than in that of another.</font><br></div>

the height of absurdity, that a man should be a <i>barbarian </i>to the hearers,
by chattering in an unknown tongue, and at the same time he elegantly treats
with derision the foolish ambition of the Corinthians, who were eager to obtain
praise and fame by this means. &#8220;This reward,&#8221; says he, &#8220;you

taken in a bad sense. Hence the Greeks, who looked upon themselves as the only
persons who were good speakers, and had a polished language, gave to all others
the name of

does not hereby give permission to any one to cherish an ambition to excel, even
to the benefit of the Church, but by correcting the fault, he shows how far
short they come of what they are in pursuit of, and at the same time lets them
know who they are that should be most highly esteemed. He would have a man to be
held in higher estimation, in proportion as he devotes himself with eagerness to
promote edification. In the meantime, it is our part to have this one object in

discoursed, so they also prayed in foreign tongues. At the same time, both
abuses took their rise from the same source, as indeed they were comprehended

<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning of the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>however, is not so easily explained. The idea of Ambrose, who refers it to
the Spirit that we receive in baptism, has not only no foundation, but has not
even the appearance of it. Augustine takes it in a more refined way, as denoting
that apprehension, which conceives ideas and signs of things, so that it is a
faculty of the soul that is inferior to the understanding. There is more
plausibility in the opinion of those who interpret it as meaning the breathing
of the throat &#8212; that is, the breath. This interpretation, however, does
not accord with the meaning which the term invariably bears in Paul&#8217;s
discussion in this place: nay more, it appears to have been repeated the oftener
by way of concession. For they gloried in that honorary distinction, which Paul,
it is true, allows them, while, on the other hand, he shows how preposterous it
is to abuse</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f728</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> a thing that is good and <i>excellent.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but to what purpose, if it is useless?&#8221; From this consideration, I am
led to agree with Chrysostom, as to the meaning of this term, who explains it,
as in the previous instance,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:12,) to mean a spiritual gift. Thus <i>my spirit </i>will <i>mean
&#8212; the gift conferred upon
me.</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f729</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a new question arises; for it is not
<i>credible </i>(at least we nowhere read of it) that any spoke under the
influence of the Spirit in a language that was to themselves unknown. For the
gift of tongues was conferred &#8212; not for the mere purpose of uttering a
sound, but, on the contrary, with the view of making a communication. For how
ridiculous a thing it would be, that the tongue of a Roman should be framed by
the Spirit of God to pronounce Greek words, which were altogether unknown to the
speaker, as parrots, magpies, and crows, are taught to mimic human voices! If,
on the other hand, the man who was endowed with the gift of tongues, did not
speak without sense and understanding, Paul would have had no occasion to say,
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the spirit prays, but the
understanding is unfruitful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>understanding</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>must have been conjoined with the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spiri</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>t.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I answer, that Paul here, for the sake of
illustration, makes a supposition, that had no reality, in this way: &#8220;If
the gift of tongues be disjoined from the understanding, so that lie who speaks
is a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>barbarian</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to himself, as well as to others, what good would he do by babbling in this
manner?&#8221; For it does not, appear that the mind is here said to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unfruitful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
(</i></font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">a]karpon</font><font face="Palatino"><i>)
</i>on the ground of no advantage accruing to the Church, inasmuch as Paul is
here speaking of the private prayers of an individual. Let us therefore keep it
in view, that things that are connected with each other are here disjoined for
the sake of illustration &#8212; not on the ground that it either can, or
usually does, so happen. The meaning is now obvious. &#8220;If, therefore, I
frame prayers in a language that is not understood by me, and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>supplies me with words, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>indeed itself, which regulates my tongue, will in that case <i>pray, </i>but
my mind will either be wandering somewhere else, or at least will have no part
in the prayer.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us take notice, that Paul reckons it a great
fault if the mind is not occupied in prayer. And no wonder; for what else do we
in prayer, but pour out our thoughts and desires before God? Farther, as prayer
is the spiritual worship of God, what is more at variance with the nature of it,
than that it should proceed merely from the lips, and not from the inmost soul?
And these things must have been perfectly familiar to every mind, had not the
devil besotted the world to such a degree, as to make men believe that they pray
aright, when they merely make their lips move. So obstinate, too, are Papists in
their madness, that they do not merely justify the making of prayers without
understanding, but even prefer that the unlearned should mutter in unknown
mumblings.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

among believers, as appears, also, from Pliny, who, writing at least forty
years, or thereabouts, after the death of Paul, mentions, that the Christians

add an expression of their desires in the close, so as to take part in them? For

detract from another&#8217;s excellencies, in which they cannot themselves have
distinction, Paul, that he might not seem to depreciate, through malignity or
envy, the gift of tongues, anticipates that suspicion, by showing that he is, in
this respect, superior to them all. &#8220;See,&#8221;<i> </i>says he,
&#8220;how little occasion you have to suspect the design of my discourse, as if
I depreciated what I myself lacked; for if we were to contend as to tongues,
there is not one of you that could bear comparison with me. While, however, I
might display myself to advantage in this department., I am more concerned for
edification.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s doctrine derives no small weight from the
circumstance, that he has not an eye to himself. Lest, however, he should appear
excessively arrogant, in preferring himself before all others, he ascribes it
all to God. Thus he tempers his boasting with modesty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b><i>

</i>Now as Paul, who might otherwise have exulted loftily in his power of
speaking with tongues, voluntarily abstains from it, and, without any show, aims
at <i>edification </i>exclusively, he reproves, by this means, the empty
ambition of those, that are eagerly desirous to show themselves off with empty
<i>tinkling.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

weight in drawing them off from vanity of this kind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Brethren, be not children in

farther; for he shows that the Corinthians are so infatuated, that they, of
their own accord. draw down upon themselves, and eagerly desire, as though it
were a singular benefit, what the Lord threatens that he will send, when he
designs to inflict upon his people the severest punishment. What dreadful
madness is this &#8212; to pursue eagerly with their whole desire, what, in the
sight of God, is regarded as a curse! That we may, however, understand more
accurately Paul&#8217;s meaning, we must, observe, that this statement is
grounded on the testimony of Isaiah, which he immediately afterwards subjoins.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:11, 12.) And as interpreters have been misled, from not observing the
connection to be of this nature, to prevent all mistake, we shall first explain
the passage in Isaiah, and then we shall come to Paul&#8217;s
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In that chapter the Prophet, inveighs with severity
against the ten tribes, which had abandoned themselves to every kind of
wickedness. The only consolation is, that God had still a people uncorrupted in
the tribe of Judah; but straightway he deplores the corruption of that tribe
also; and he does so the more sharply, because there was no hope of amendment.
For thus he speaks in the name of God &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom shall I teach knowledge?
those that are weaned from their mother? those that are drawn from the
breasts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this he means, that they are
no more capable of instruction than little children but lately
weaned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is added &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Precept upon precept, instruction
upon instruction, charge upon charge, direction upon direction, here a little,
and there a little</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In these words he
expresses, in the style of a
mimic,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f742</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the slowness and carelessness by which
they were kept back. &#8220;In<i> </i>teaching them, I lose my labor, for they
make no progress, because they are beyond measure uncultivated, and what they
had been taught by means of long-continued labor, they in a single moment
forget.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is added still farther &#8212; He
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that speaketh to that people is
like one that maketh use of stammering lips, and a foreign
language</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is the passage that Paul
quotes. Now the meaning is,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f743</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that the people have been visited with
such blindness and madness, that they no more understand God when speaking to
them, that they would some barbarian or foreigner, stammering in an unknown
tongue &#8212; which is a dreadful curse. He has not, however, quoted the
Prophet&#8217;s words with exactness, because he reckoned it enough to make a
pointed reference to the passage, that the Corinthians, on being admonished,
might attentively consider it. As to his saying that it was <i>written in the
law,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f744</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>this is not at variance with
common usage; for the Prophets had not a ministry distinct from the law, but
were the interpreters of the law, and their doctrine is, as it were, a sort of
appendage to it; hence the law included the whole body of Scripture, up to the
advent of Christ. Now Paul from this infers as follows &#8212; &#8220;Brethren,
it is necessary to guard against that childishness, which is so severely
reproved by the Prophet &#8212; that the word of God sounds in your ears without
any fruit. Now, when you reject prophecy, which is placed within your reach, and
prefer to stand amazed at empty sound, is not this voluntarily to incur the
curse of God?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f745</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, lest the Corinthians should say in reply,
that to be spiritually <i>children, </i>is elsewhere commended,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401804&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
18:4,) Paul anticipates this objection, and exhorts them, indeed, to be
<i>children in malice, </i>but to beware of being
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children in
understanding</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence we infer how
shameless a part those act, who make Christian simplicity consist in ignorance.
Paul would have all believers to be, as far as possible, in full maturity as to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>understanding</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>The Pope, inasmuch as it is easier to govern asses than men, gives orders,
under pretext of simplicity, that. all under him shall remain
uninstructed.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore tongues are for a
sign</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This passage may be explained in
two ways, by considering the word <i>therefore </i>as referring merely to the
preceding sentence, or as having a bearing generally on the whole of the
foregoing discussion. If it is a particular inference, the meaning will <i>be
&#8212; &#8220;</i>You see, brethren, that what you so eagerly desire is not a
blessing bestowed by God upon believers, but a punishment, by which he inflicts
vengeance upon unbelievers.&#8221; In this way, Paul would not be viewed as
taking in the use of tongues under all circumstances, but simply as touching
upon what had in <i>one </i>instance occurred. Should any one, however, prefer
to extend it to the whole discussion, I have no objection, though I do not
dislike the former interpretation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Taking it in a general way, the meaning will be
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tongues</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in so far as they are given
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for a
sign</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; that is, for a miracle &#8212; are
appointed not properly for <i>believers, </i>but for <i>unbelievers.&#8221;
</i>The advantages derived from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tongues</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>were various. They provided against necessity &#8212; that diversity of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tongues</i></font><font face="Palatino">
might not prevent the Apostles from disseminating the gospel over the whole
world: there was, consequently, no nation with which they could not hold
fellowship. They served also to move or terrify <i>unbelievers </i>by the sight
of a miracle &#8212; for the design of this miracle, equally with others, was to
prepare those who were as yet at a distance from Christ for rendering obedience
to him. Believers, who had already devoted themselves to his doctrine, did not
stand so much in need of such preparation. Hence, the Corinthians brought
forward that gift improperly and out of its right place, allowing prophecy in
the meantime to be neglected, which was peculiarly and specially set apart for
<i>believers, </i>and ought, therefore, to be familiar to them, for in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tongues</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>they looked to nothing farther than the miracle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If therefore the whole Church
come together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As they did not see their
fault, in consequence of having their minds pre-occupied with a foolish and
depraved desire, he tells them that they will be exposed to the scorn of the
wicked or the unlearned, if any, on coming into their assembly, should hear them
uttering a sound, but not speaking. For what unlearned person will not reckon
those to be out of their right mind, who, in place of speech, utter empty sound,
and are taken up with that vanity, while they were gathered together for the
purpose of hearing the doctrine of God? This statement has much that is cutting:
&#8220;You<i> </i>applaud yourselves in your own sleeve; but the wicked and the
unlearned laugh at your fooleries. You do not, therefore, see what to the
unlearned and unbelieving is <i>perfectly </i>manifest.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here Chrysostom starts a question&#8217; &#8220;If
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tongues</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>were given to unbelievers </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for
a sign</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>why does the Apostle say now,
that they will be derided by them?&#8221; He answers, that they are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for a
sign</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to fill them with astonishment
&#8212; not to instruct them, or to reform them. At the same time he adds, that
it is owing to their wickedness, that they look upon the sign as madness. This
explanation does not satisfy me; for however an unbeliever or unlearned person
may be affected by a miracle, and may regard with reverence the gift of God, he
does not cease on that account to deride and condemn an unseasonable abuse of
the gift,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f748</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and think thus with himself:
&#8220;What<i> </i>do these men mean, by wearying out themselves and others to
no purpose? Of what avail is their speaking, if nothing is to be learned from
it?&#8221; Paul&#8217;s meaning, therefore, is &#8212; that the Corinthians
would be justly <i>convicted </i>of madness by the unbelieving and unlearned,
however much they might please
themselves.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f749</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if all
prophesy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As he had previously showed
them, how much more advantageous prophecy is to <i>those that are of the
household of faith
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:10) than the gift of tongues, so he now shows that it would be useful also to
<i>those that are without.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 5:13.) This is a most powerful consideration for showing the
Corinthians their error. For what a base part it is to depreciate a gift that is
most useful both within and without, and to be wholly taken up with another gift
which is useless to those that are <i>within </i>the house; and, in addition to
this, gives occasion of offense to those that are <i>without. </i>He sets before
them this advantage of prophecy, that it summons the <i>consciences </i>of the
wicked to the tribunal of God, and strikes them with a lively apprehension of
divine judgment in such a manner, that he who before in utter regardlessness
despised sound doctrine, is constrained to give glory to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>We </i>shall find it, however, much easier to
understand this passage, if we compare it with another that occurs in the
Epistle to the Hebrews
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
4:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The Word of God is quick and powerful,
and sharper than any two-edged sword; piercing to the dividing asunder of soul
and spirit, and of the joints and marrow &#8212; a discerner of the thoughts of
the heart.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f750</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For in both passages, it is the same kind of efficacy
of the Word of God that is spoken of: only in that other passage it is spoken of
more fully and distinctly. So far as the passage before us is concerned, it is
not difficult to understand now, what is meant by being <i>convinced </i>and
<i>judged. </i>The consciences of men are in a torpid
state,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f751</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and are not touched with any feeling of
dissatisfaction on account of their sins, so long as they are enveloped in the
darkness of ignorance. In short, unbelief is like a lethargy that takes away
feeling. But the Word of God penetrates even to the farthest recesses of the
mind, and by introducing, as it were, a light, dispels darkness, and drives away
that deadly torpor. Thus, then, unbelievers are <i>convinced, </i>inasmuch as
they are seriously affected and alarmed, on coming to know that they have to do
with God; and, in like manner, they are <i>judged </i>in this respect, that
whereas they were previously involved in darkness, and did not perceive their
own wretchedness and baseness, they are now brought into the light of day, and
are constrained to bear witness against themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says, that they are judged and convinced
<i>by all, </i>you must understand him as meaning
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all that
prophesy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for he had said a little
before, <i>If ye all prophesy,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:24.) He has expressly made use of a general term, with the view
of removing the dislike that they felt for
prophecy.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f752</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The unbeliever, I say, is <i>convinced
&#8212; not </i>as if the Prophet pronounced a judgment upon him either silently
in the mind, or openly with the mouth, but because the conscience of the hearer
apprehends from the doctrine his own judgment. He is <i>judged, </i>inasmuch as
he descends into himself, and, after thorough examination, comes to know
himself, while previously he was unmindful of himself. To the same purpose, too,
is that saying of Christ:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The Spirit, when he is
come, will convince the world of
sin,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
16:8;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and this is what he immediately adds &#8212; that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the secrets of his heart are made
manifest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For he does not mean, in my
opinion, that it becomes manifest to others what sort of person he is, but
rather that his own conscience is aroused, so that he perceives his sins, which
previously lay hid from his view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here again Chrysostom asks, how it comes to pass that
prophecy is so effectual for arousing <i>unbelievers, </i>while Paul had said a
little before that it was not given to them. He answers, that it was not given
to them as a useless sign, but for the purpose of instructing them. For my part,
however, I think that it will be simpler, and therefore more suitable, to say
that it was not given to unbelievers, who perish, whose hearts</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Satan has blinded, that
they may not see the light which shines forth from it.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 4:3, 4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It will also suit better to connect this statement
with the prophecy</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f753</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of Isaiah
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:11,12,) because the Prophet speaks of unbelievers, among whom prophecy is of
no profit or advantage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Falling down on his face, he
will worship</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For it is only the
knowledge of God that can bring down the pride of the flesh. To that, prophecy
brings us. Hence,<i> </i>it is its proper effect and nature to bring down men
from their loftiness, that they may, with prostrate homage, render worship to
God. To many, however, prophecy also is of no benefit &#8212; nay more, they are
made worse by what they hear. Nor was it even Paul&#8217;s intention to ascribe
this effect to prophecy, as if it were always the result of it. He simply
designed to show how much advantage is derived from it, and what is its office.
It is therefore a singular commendation, that it extorts from unbelievers this

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What is it
then?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now shows the way in which they
may remedy those evils. In the first place, each gift must have its place, but
in order and in measure. Farther, the Church must not be taken up to no purpose
with unprofitable exercises, but must, in whatever is done, have an eye to
edification. He speaks, however, in the first place of edification in this way:
&#8220;Let every one, according as he has been endowed with some particular
gift, make it his aim to lay it out for the advantage of all.&#8221;<i> </i>For
it is in this way that we must understand the word rendered <i>every one &#8212;
that </i>no one may take it as implying universality, as though all to a man
were endowed with some such gift.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any one speak in another
tongue</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now describes the order and
limits the measure. <i>&#8220;If </i>you have a mind to speak with other
tongues,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> let only two speak, or,
at most, not more than three, and let there be at the same time an interpreter
sitting by</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Without an interpreter,
<i>tongues </i>are of no advantage: let them, therefore be dispensed
with.&#8221; It is to be observed, however, that he does not <i>command, </i>but
merely
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>permits</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for the Church can, without any inconvenience, dispense with <i>tongues,
</i>except in so far as they are helps to prophecy, as the Hebrew and Greek
languages are at this day. Paul, however, makes this concession, that he may not
seem to deprive the assembly of believers of any gift of the
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, it might seem as if even this were
not agreeable to reason, inasmuch as he said before,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:22,) that <i>tongues, </i>in so far as they are for a <i>sign,
</i>are suited to <i>unbelievers. </i>I answer, that, while a miracle may be
performed more particularly with a view to unbelievers, it, nevertheless, does
not follow, that it may not be of some advantage to believers also. If you
understand, that an unknown tongue is a sign to unbelievers in the sense that
Isaiah&#8217;s words</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f756</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> bear, the method of procedure, which
Paul here prescribes, is different. For he allows of other tongues in such a way
that, interpretation being joined with them, nothing is left obscure. He
observes, therefore, a most admirable medium in correcting the fault of the
Corinthians. On the one hand, he does not at all set aside any gift of God
whatever,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f757</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in order that all his benefits may be
seen among believers. On the other hand he makes a limitation &#8212; that
ambition do not usurp the place that is due to the glory of God, and that no
gift of inferior importance stand in the way of those that are of chief moment;
and he adds the <i>sauce</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f758</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212;</i> that<i> </i>there be no
mere ostentation, devoid of advantage.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let him speak to himself and to

says he, &#8220;his<i> </i>gift in his own conscience, and let him give thanks
to God.&#8221; For in this way I explain the expression to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speak to himself and to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as meaning &#8212; to recognize in
his own mind with thanksgiving the favor conferred upon
him,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f759</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and to enjoy it as his own, when there
is not an opportunity for bringing it forward in a public manner. For he draws a
contrast between this <i>secret </i>way of speaking, and speaking <i>publicly
</i>in the Church &#8212; which he
forbids.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prophets, two or

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophecy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>too, he prescribes limits, because &#8220;multitude,&#8221;<i> </i>as they
commonly say, &#8220;breeds<i> </i>confusion.&#8221; This is true, for we know
it by every day&#8217;s experience. He does not, however, restrict the number so
definitely, as when he was treating of tongues, for there is less danger, in the
event of their applying themselves for a longer time to prophesyings, nay more,
continued application would be the most desirable thing of all; but Paul
considered what the weakness of men could bear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There still remains, however, a question &#8212; why
it is that he assigns the like number to prophesyings and to tongues, except
that, as to the latter, he adds particularly &#8212; at <i>the most, </i>for if
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tongues</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>are less useful, there ought assuredly to be a more sparing use of them? I
answer, that even in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tongues</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as he takes the term, prophecy is included; for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tongues</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>were made use of either for
discourses,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f761</font></sup><font face="Palatino">or for prayers. In the former department,
the interpreter was in the place of the prophet: thus it was the principal and
more frequent exercise of it. Only he limits the measure of it, lest it should
fall into contempt through a feeling of disgust, and lest those who were less
skillful should prevent those that were better qualified from having time and
opportunity of speaking; for he would, undoubtedly, have those to whom he
assigns the duty of speaking, to be of the more select class, and appointed by
their common suffrages.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f762</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> None, however, are more inclined to push
themselves forward, than those who have but a slight smattering of learning, so
that the proverb holds good, &#8220;Ignorance is
pert.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f763</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Paul had it in view to remedy this evil,
by assigning the office of speaking to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>two</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
three</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let the others
judge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Lest he should give any occasion
to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the others
to</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>complain &#8212; as though he were
desirous that the gift of God</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f764</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> should be suppressed among them and
buried, he shows in what way they may lawfully make use of it for the benefit of
the Church, even by <i>keeping silence &#8212; </i>if<i> </i>they set themselves
to</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
judge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of what is said by others. For it
is of no small advantage, that there should be some that are skillful in
judging, who will not allow sound doctrine to be perverted by the impostures of
Satan, or to be otherwise corrupted by silly trifles. Paul, accordingly, teaches
that the other prophets will be useful to the Church, even by <i>keeping
silence.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may seem, however, to be absurd that men should
have liberty given them to judge of the doctrine of God, which ought to be
placed beyond all controversy. I answer, that the doctrine of God is not
subjected to the scrutiny of men, but there is simply permission given them to
judge by the Spirit of God, whether it is his word that is set before them, or
whether human inventions are, without any authority, set off under this pretext,
as we shall have occasion to notice again ere long.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if anything be revealed to

&#8212; that whenever there will be occasion, the way will also be open to them.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f765</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence they have no longer any occasion to complain, that the Spirit is bound, or
that his mouth is shut. For all have opportunity and liberty allowed them of
speaking, when there is occasion for it, provided only no one unseasonably
intrudes &#8212; having it in view to please himself, rather than to serve some
useful purpose. Now he requires this modesty on the part of all &#8212; that
every one in his place shall give way to another that has something better to
bring forward.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f766</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">For this
only is the true liberty of the Spirit &#8212; not that every one be allowed to
blab out rashly whatever he pleases, but that all, from the highest to the
lowest, voluntarily allow themselves to be under control, and that the one
Spirit be listened to, by whatever mouth he speaks. As to the certainty of the
revelation, we shall see ere long.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You can all, one by one.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">In the <i>first </i>place, when he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he does not include believers universally, but only those that were endowed
with this gift. Farther, he does not mean that all ought to have equally their
turn, but that, according as it might be for the advantage of the <i>people,
</i>each one should come forward to speak either more frequently or more
seldom.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f767</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;No one will remain always
unemployed; but an opportunity of speaking will present itself, sometimes to one
and at other times to another.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that all may
learn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is applicable, it is true,
to the whole of the people, but it is particularly suited to the Prophets, and
Paul more <i>especially </i>refers to them. For no one will ever be a good
teacher, who does not show himself to be teachable, as no one will ever be found
who has, in himself alone, such an overflowing in respect of perfection of
doctrine, as not to derive benefit from listening to others. <i>Let </i>all,
therefore, undertake the office of teaching on this principle, that they do not
refuse or grudge, to be scholars to each other in their turn, whenever there
shall be afforded to others the means of edifying the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, in the <i>second </i>place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that all may receive
consolation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence we may infer, that
the ministers of Christ, so far from envying, should rather rejoice with all
their heart, that they are not the only persons that excel, but have
fellow-partakers of the same gift &#8212; a disposition which Moses discovered,
as is related in sacred history.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;041128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
11:28.) For when his servant, inflamed with a foolish jealousy, was greatly
displeased, because the gift of prophecy was conferred upon others also, he
reproves him: &#8220;Nay,&#8221; says he, <i>&#8220;would </i>that all the
people of God were sharers with me in this superior gift!&#8221; And,
undoubtedly, it is a special consolation for pious ministers, to see the Spirit
of God, whose instruments they are, working in others also, and they derive also
from this no small confirmation. It is a consolation, too, that it contributes
to the spread of the word of God, the more it has of ministers and
witnesses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">parakalei~sqai</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which Paul here employs, is of doubtful
signification,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f768</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it might also be rendered <i>may receive
exhortation.</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f769</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Nor would this be unsuitable, for
it is sometimes of advantage to listen to others, that we may be more powerfully

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the spirits of the
Prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This, too, is one of the
reasons, why it is necessary for them to take turns &#8212; because it will
sometimes happen that, in the doctrine of one Prophet, the others may find
something to reprove. <i>&#8220;It </i>is not reasonable,&#8221; says he,
<i>&#8220;that </i>any one should be beyond the sphere of scrutiny. In this way
it will sometimes come to a person&#8217;s turn to speak, who was among the
audience and was sitting silent.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage has been misunderstood by some, as if
Paul had said, that the Lord&#8217;s Prophets were not like persons taken with a
sudden frenzy, who, when a divine impulse
<i>(</i></font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejnqousiasmo&lt;v</font><font face="Palatino"><i>)
</i>had once seized them,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f770</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> were no longer masters of
themselves.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f771</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is indeed true that God&#8217;s
Prophets are not disordered in mind; but this has nothing to do with this
passage of Paul&#8217;s writings. For it means, as I have already stated, that
no one is exempted from the scrutiny of others, but that all must be listened
to, with this understanding, that their doctrine is, nevertheless, to be
subjected to examination. It is not, however, without difficulty, for the
Apostle declares that their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirits are
subject</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Though it is of gifts that he
speaks, how can prophecy, which is given by the Holy Spirit, be judged of by
men, so that the Spirit himself is not judged by them? In this manner, even the
word of God, which is revealed by the Spirit; will be subjected to examination.
The unseemliness of this needs not be pointed out, for it is of itself
abundantly evident. I maintain, however, that neither the Spirit of God nor his
word is restrained by a scrutiny of this kind. The Holy Spirit, I say, retains
his majesty unimpaired, so as to</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">judge all things, while
he is judged by no
one.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 2:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sacred word of God, too, retains the respect due
to it, so that it is received without any disputation, as soon as it is
presented.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;What is if, then,&#8221; you will say,
&#8220;that<i> </i>is subjected to examination?&#8221;&#8217; I answer &#8212;
If any one were furnished with a full revelation, that man would undoubtedly,
along with his gift, be above all scrutiny. There is, I say, no subjection,
where there is a plenitude of revelation; but as God has distributed his spirit
to every one in a certain measure, in such a way that, even amidst the greatest
abundance, there is always something wanting, it is not to be wondered, if no
one is elevated to such a height, as to look down from aloft upon all others,
and have no one to pass judgment upon him. We may now see how it is, that,
without any dishonor to the Holy Spirit, his gifts admit of being examined. Nay
more, where, after full examination, nothing is found that is worthy of reproof,
there will still be something, that stands in need of polishing. The sum of all,
therefore, is this &#8212; that the gift is subjected to examination in such a
way, that whatever is set forth, the Prophets consider as to it &#8212; whether
it has proceeded from the Spirit of God; for if it shall appear that the Spirit
is the author of it, there is no room left for hesitation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, however still farther asked &#8212;
&#8220;What rule is to be made use of in examining?&#8221; This question is
answered in part by the mouth of Paul, who, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:6, requires that prophecy be regulated according to the <i>proportion of
faith. </i>As to the passing of judgment, however, there is no doubt, that it
ought to be regulated by the word and Spirit of God &#8212; that nothing may be
approved of, but what is discovered to be from God &#8212; that nothing may be
found fault with but in accordance with his word &#8212; in fine, that God alone
may preside in this judgment, and that men may be merely his
heralds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From this passage of Paul&#8217;s writings, we may
conjecture how very illustrious that Church was, in respect of an extraordinary
abundance and variety of spiritual gifts. There were colleges of Prophets, so
that pains had to be taken, that they might have their respective turns. There
was so great a diversity of gifts, that there was a superabundance. We now see
our leanness, nay, our poverty; but in this we have a just punishment, sent to
requite our ingratitude. For neither are the riches of God exhausted, nor is his
benignity lessened; but we are neither deserving of his bounty, nor capable of
receiving his liberality. Still we have an ample sufficiency of light and
doctrine, provided there were no deficiency in respect of the cultivation of
piety, and the fruits that spring from it.</font><br></div>

its ground; but if the wicked resist, we must set our face against them, and
have no fear, lest the blame of the disturbances should be laid to our charge.

<div><font face="Palatino">It appears that the Church of the Corinthians was
infected with this fault too, that the talkativeness of women was allowed a
place in the sacred assembly, or rather that the fullest liberty was given to
it. Hence he forbids them to speak in public, either for the purpose of teaching
or of prophesying. This, however, we must understand as referring to ordinary
service, or where there is a Church in a regularly constituted state; for a
necessity may occur of such a nature as to require that a woman should speak in
public; but Paul has merely in view what is becoming in a duly regulated
assembly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let them be in subjection, as
also saith the law.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>What connection has
the object that he has in view with the subjection under which the law places
women? &#8220;For what is there,&#8221; some one will say, &#8220;to<i>
</i>hinder their being in subjection, and yet at the same time teaching?&#8221;
I answer, that the office of
teaching</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f776</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is a superiority in the Church, and is,
consequently, inconsistent with <i>subjection. </i>For how unseemly a thing it
were, that one who is under subjection to one of the members, should
preside</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f777</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> over the entire body! It is therefore an
argument from things inconsistent &#8212; If the woman is under subjection, she
is, consequently, prohibited from authority to teach in
public.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f778</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
unquestionably,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f779</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> wherever even natural propriety has been
maintained, women have in all ages been excluded from the public management of
affairs. It is the dictate of common sense, that female government is improper
and unseemly. Nay more, while originally they had permission given to them at
Rome to plead before a court,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f780</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the effrontery of Caia
Afrania</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f781</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> led to their being interdicted, even
from this. Paul&#8217;s reasoning, however, is simple &#8212; that authority to
teach is not suitable to the station that a woman occupies, because, if she
teaches, she presides over all the men, while it becomes her to be <i>under
subjection.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>35.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they wish to learn any

means, to shut out women from opportunities of learning, he desires them, if
they are in doubt as to anything, to inquire in private, that they may not stir
up any disputation in public. When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>husbands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he does not prohibit them from consulting the Prophets themselves, if
necessary. For all husbands are not competent to give an answer in such a case;
but, as he is reasoning here as to external polity, he reckons it sufficient to
point out what is unseemly, that the Corinthians may guard against. it. In the
meantime, it is the part of the prudent reader to consider, that the things of
which he here treats are intermediate and indifferent, in which there is nothing
unlawful, but what is at variance with propriety and
edification.</font><br></div>

</i>This is a somewhat sharper reproof, but nothing more than was needful for
beating down the haughtiness of the Corinthians. They were, beyond measure,
self-complacent. They could not endure that either themselves, or what belonged
to them, should be found fault with in anything. He asks, accordingly, whether
they are the only Christians in the world; nay, farther, whether they are the
first, or are to be the last?
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Did the word of
God,&#8221;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he,
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come out from

</i>it originate with you<i>?&#8221; &#8220;Has </i>it ended with you?&#8221;
that is, <i>&#8220;Will </i>it spread no farther<i>?&#8221; </i>The design of
the admonition is this &#8212; that they may not, without having any regard to
others, please themselves in their own contrivances or customs. And this is a
doctrine of general application; for no Church should be taken up with itself
exclusively, to the neglect of others; but on the contrary, they ought all, in
their turn, to hold out the right hand to each other, in the way of cherishing
mutual fellowship, and accommodating themselves to each other, in so far as a
regard to harmony requires.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f782</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here it is asked, whether every Church, according
as it has had the precedence of another in the order of
time,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f783</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> has it also in its power to bind it to
observe its institutions.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f784</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For Paul seems to intimate this in what
he says. For example, Jerusalem was the mother of all the Churches, inasmuch as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word of the Lord had come out
from it</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Was she then at liberty to
assume to herself a superior right, so as to bind all others to follow her? I
answer, that Paul here does not employ an argument of universal application, but
one that was specially applicable to the Corinthians, as is frequently the case.
He had, therefore, an eye to individuals, rather than to the thing itself. Hence
it does not necessarily follow, that Churches that are of later origin must be
bound to observe, in every point, the institutions of the earlier ones, inasmuch
as even Paul himself did not bind himself by this rule, so as to obtrude upon
other Churches the customs that were in use at Jerusalem. Let there be nothing
of ambition &#8212; let there be nothing of obstinacy &#8212; let there be
nothing of pride and contempt for other Churches &#8212; let there be, on the
other hand, a desire to edify &#8212; let there be moderation and prudence; and
in that case, amidst a diversity of observances, there will be nothing that is
worthy of reproof.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that. the
haughtiness of the Corinthians is here reproved, who, concerned for themselves
exclusively,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f785</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> showed no respect to the Churches of
earlier origin, from which they had received the gospel, and did not endeavor to
accommodate themselves to other Churches, to which the gospel had flowed out
from them. Would to God that there were no Corinth in our times, in respect of
this fault, as well as of others! But we see how savage men, who have <i>never
tasted </i>the gospel,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
6:5,) trouble the Churches of the saints by a tyrannical enforcement of their
own laws.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>37.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any one thinks
himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Mark here the judgment, which
he had previously assigned to the Prophets &#8212; that they should receive what
they recognised as being from God. He does not, however, desire them to inquire
as to his doctrine, as though it were a doubtful matter, but to receive it as
the sure word of God, inasmuch as they will recognize it as the word of God, if
they judge rightly. Farther, it is in virtue of apostolical authority, that he
takes it upon himself to prescribe to them the sentence which they ought to
pronounce.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f787</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is still greater confidence in what he
immediately adds &#8212; He </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This,
it is true, was allowable for Paul, who was fully assured as to the revelation
that he had received from God, and he ought also to have been well known to the
Corinthians, so that they should have looked upon him in no other light, than as
an Apostle of the Lord. It is not, however, for every one to advance such a
claim for himself, or if he does, he will, by his boasting, throw himself open
to merited derision, for <i>then </i>only is there ground for such confidence,
when what is affirmed with the mouth shows itself in reality. It was with truth
that Paul affirmed, that his precepts were those of the Lord. Many will be
prepared to pretend the same thing on false grounds. His great object is this
&#8212; that it may be clearly perceived, that he who does not allow himself to
be under control, speaks as from the Holy Spirit, not from his own brain. That
man, therefore, who is no other than a pure organ of the Holy Spirit, will have
the courage to declare fearlessly with Paul, that those who shall reject his
doctrine, are not <i>Prophets </i>or <i>spiritual </i>persons; and this he will
do in virtue of a right that belongs to him, in accordance with what we had in
the beginning of the Epistle &#8212; he <i>that is spiritual, judgeth all
things.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked here, how it is that Paul
declares those things to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commandments of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as to which no statement is to be
found in the Scriptures? Besides this, there is also another difficulty that
presents itself &#8212; that if they are the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commandments of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>they are necessary to be observed,
and they bind the conscience, and yet they are rites connected with polity, as
to the observance of which no such necessity exists. Paul, however, merely says,
that he enjoins nothing, but what is in accordance with the will of God. Now God
endowed him with wisdom, that he might recommend this order in external things
at Corinth, and in other places &#8212; not that it might be an inviolable law,
like those that relate to the spiritual worship of God, but that it might be a
useful directory to all the sons of God, and not by any means to be
despised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>38.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if any man be

thus: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that knows not this,
will be
unknown</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f788</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but this is a mistake. For Paul
had it in view to cut off every handle from contentious persons, who make no end
of disputing, and that, under the pretense of inquiring &#8212; as if the matter
were not yet clear; or at least he intimates in general terms, that he regarded
as of no account any one that would call in question what he said. &#8220;If<i>
</i>any one is ignorant, I do not stop to take notice of his doubts, for the
certainty of my doctrine is not at all impaired thereby. Let him go then,
whoever he may be. As for you, do not the less on that account give credit to
Christ, as speaking by me.&#8221; In fine, he intimates, that sceptics,
contentious persons, and subtle
disputants;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f789</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> do not by the questions they raise
diminish, in any degree, the authority of sound doctrine, and of that truth as
to which believers ought to feel assured, and at the same time he admonishes us,
not to allow their doubts to be any hindrance in our way. That elevation of
mind, however, which despises all human judgments, ought to be founded on
ascertained truth. Hence, as it would be the part of perverse rashness, either
to maintain pertinaciously, in opposition to the views of all others, an opinion
that has once been taken up, or audaciously to cling to it, while others are in
doubt, so, on the other hand, when we have felt assured that it is God that
speaks, let us fearlessly break through all human impediments and all
difficulties.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

connection with the principal question &#8212; that <i>prophecy </i>is to be
preferred to other gifts, because it is the most useful gift of all, while at
the same time other gifts ought not to be despised. We must observe, however,
his manner of speaking. For he intimates, that <i>prophecy </i>is worthy of
being eagerly and ardently aspired at by all. In the meantime, he exhorts them
not to envy others the rarer
gift,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f791</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which is not so much to be desired; nay
more, to allow them the praise that is due to them, divesting themselves of all

conclusion, which does not merely include, in short compass, the entire case,
but also the different parts. Nay farther, it is a rule by which we must
regulate</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f792</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> everything, that has to do with external
polity. As he had discoursed, in various instances, as to rites, he wished to
sum up everything here in a brief summary &#8212; that decorum should be
observed &#8212; that confusion should be avoided. This statement shows, that he
did not wish to bind consciences by the foregoing precepts, as if they were in
themselves necessary, but only in so far as they were subservient to propriety
and peace. Hence we gather (as I have said) a doctrine that is always in force,
as to the purpose to which the polity of the Church ought to be directed. The
Lord has left external rites in our choice with this view &#8212; that we may
not think that his worship consists wholly in these things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the meantime, he has not allowed us a rambling and
unbridled liberty, but has inclosed it (so to speak) with
railings,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f793</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or at least has laid a restriction upon
the liberty granted by him in such a manner, that it is after all only from his
word that we can judge as to what is right. This passage, therefore, when duly
considered, will show the difference between the tyrannical edicts of the Pope,
which oppress men&#8217;s consciences with a dreadful bondage, and the godly
regulations of the Church, by which discipline and order are maintained. Nay
farther, we may readily infer from this, that the latter are not to be looked
upon as human traditions, inasmuch as they are founded upon this general
injunction, and have a manifest approval, as it were, from the mouth of Christ
himself.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">FOOTNOTES</font><br></div>

displeasure, that &#8220;although Paul seems to have relaxed the stern severity
of the archinquisitor in regard to his Protestant nephew, [Galeacius
Caracciolus,] by permitting him to be dealt with in the way of remonstrance and
bribery, when another would have been arrested and put to death, still the
compulsory retirement of the latter, after literally leaving &#8216;brethren and
sisters, and father and mother, and wife and children, and lands for
Christ&#8217;s sake and the gospel&#8217; to Geneva, where he spent the evening
of his days as a ruling-elder in the Italian Reformed Church, presented a
striking contrast to the brilliant fortunes of his cousins the Caraffas, during
their enjoyment of the Papal favor. But when the Pope found these ungrateful,
and when that favor was lost, the Genevan exile [Caracciolus] must have felt
peculiarly thankful for the deliverance he had had from such tempations and
reverses, and one can hardly suppose but that the Pope himself must have been
affected by the contrast at all points between his many Roman Catholic and one

ft13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The part which CALVIN acted as to this
matter will be found to be in exact accordance with the views expressed by him,
when commenting on 1 Corinthians 7:15 &#8212; a passage on which opposite
opinions have been entertained by eminent interpreters. It may be noticed in
connexion with this case, that the United Brethren, when laboring in the West
India Islands, near the close of the last century, felt greatly at a loss as to
the course proper to be pursued in the case of converted negroes, whose husbands
or wives had (as very frequently happened) been purchased by proprietors from
other islands, and were, in consequence of this, parted from them for ever.
&#8220;For some time&#8221; they &#8220;prohibited the converts from contracting
another marriage, apprehending this to be inconsistent with the principles of
Christianity.&#8221; Afterwards, however, in particular cases, they judged it
better &#8220;not to hinder,&#8221; though they &#8220;did not advise, a regular
marriage with another person.&#8221; &#8212; Brown&#8217;s History of Misssions,

In the interesting volume already referred to &#8212; &#8220;Lettres de Calvin a
Jaque de Bourgogne&#8221; &#8212; there is preserved the original letter of
CALVIN to James of Burgundy, (received on the 6th February 1546,) requesting
permission to dedicate to him the Commentary on the First Epistle to the
Corinthians. The following translation of such parts of said letter as bear upon
this point, will be interesting to the reader: &#8212; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Since my letter was written, I have taken
another thought as to the Dedicatory Epistle to my Commentary; for as there is
much trouble and difficulty in binding one&#8217;s self to fill up a certain
number of pages, and no more, I send it quite complete. At the same time it is
with the understanding, that it is not to be printed, except by your order.
Accordingly I enclose it in this, in order that Vendelin may not have it
otherwise than through your hands. If it does not appear to you expedient that I
should address it to you, I shall, on receiving notice to that effect, prepare a
new one.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Be not surprised, however, if I speak of you
briefly; for I was afraid of coming upon some thorny points by going into more
detail. But, according as matters shall turn out, we shall be able, God willing,
in the second impression, to present fully in detail everything that will be
necessary.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In a subsequent letter to James of Burgundy,
(received on the 2nd April 1546,) CALVIN expresses in the following terms his
high satisfaction on receiving permission to dedicate the Commentary to him:
&#8212; &#8220;I give praise to our Lord, because the present of my Commentary
is agreeable to you.&#8221; (Lettres de Calvin, etc.) &#8212;

Among other passages in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, which CALVIN may
be supposed to have had more particularly in his eye, there are the following,
&#8212; 1:24; 2:4; and 4:20. In commenting on the last of these passages, he
complains, as above, of the very general lack in his times of

The reader will observe that CALVIN here repeats, in precisely the same words, a
statement which had been made by him in his previous dedication to James of
Burgundy, and unquestionably the conduct of Caracciolus still more strikingly
exemplified the spirit of self-denial which CALVIN here recommends. &#8212;

The verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">katartizw</font><font face="Palatino">
properly signifies, to <i>repair</i>,<i> </i>or <i>refit</i>,<i> </i>or
<i>restore </i>to its original condition what has been disarranged or broken;
and in this sense it is applied to the repairing of nets, ships, walls, etc.
(See
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400421&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
4:21;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;410119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
1:19.) We might with perfect propriety understand the Apostle as alluding here
to the <i>repairing </i>of a ship that has been broken or damaged, and as
intimating that a Church, when shattered by divisions, is (so to speak) not
sea-worthy, and must be carefully <i>repaired</i>,<i> </i>before she can be fit
for purposes of commerce, by conveying to the nations of the earth the
&#8220;true riches.&#8221; The allusion, however, most probably is, as CALVIN
thinks, to the members of the human body, which are so admirably <i>adjusted
</i>to each other. It deserves to be noticed, that Paul makes use of a
derivative from the same verb

meaning is, that whereas the members of the Church were all (as it were)

and they should endeavor to make perfect what was amiss amongst them either in

occurring nowhere else in the New Testament, or in any of the writings of

or
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pi&gt;qavoiv</font><font face="Palatino">,

that Calvin employs the phrase </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to

Locke, in accordance with CALVIN&#8217;S view, understands Paul as if he had
said: &#8220;Why do you make divisions, by glorying, as you do, in your distinct
teachers? The glory that God has ordained us (Christian teachers and professors)
to, is to be expounders, preachers, and believers of those revealed truths and
purposes of God, which, though contained in the sacred Scriptures of the Old

the Sacraments in two different ways. When he has to do with hypocrites, who
glory in mere symbols, he in that case proclaims aloud the emptiness and
worthlessness of the outward symbol, and denounces in strong terms their absurd
confidence. Why so? It is because he has in view, not the ordinance of God, but
the corruption of it by wicked men. When, on the other hand, he addresses
believers, who make a proper use of the symbols, he in that case views them in
connection with the reality which they represent. Why so? It is because he does
not make a show of any false splendor as belonging to the Sacraments, but
presents before our view in reality what the outward ceremony represents. Hence
it comes that, agreeably to the divine appointment, the reality is associated
with the symbols.&#8221; The same subject is touched upon in the

then sacrificed certain men unto their gods, which men they termed

&#8220;The Greek word <i>pedagogue</i>,&#8221;<i> </i>says <i>Calmet</i>,<i>
</i>&#8220;now<i> </i>carries with it an idea approaching to contempt. With no
other word to qualify it, it excites the idea of a pedant, who assumes an air of
authority over others, which does not belong to him. But among the ancients a
pedagogue was a person to whom they committed the care of their children, to
lead them, to observe them, and to instruct them in their first rudiments. Thus
the office of a pedagogue nearly answered to that of a governor or tutor, who
constantly attends his pupil, teaches him, and forms his manners. Paul
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:13) says: &#8220;For though you have ten thousand instructors

&#8212; representing himself as their father in the faith, since he had
<i>begotten them in the gospel</i>.<i> </i>The <i>pedagogue</i>,<i> </i>indeed,
may have some power and interest in his pupil, but he can never have the natural
tenderness of a <i>father </i>for him.&#8221; &#8212;

The view here given by CALVIN of the spirit by which Paul was actuated hi this
part of his conduct, is most successfully brought out, at greater length, by the
Reverend Andrew Fuller, when comparing
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461033&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:33, with
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
1:10. &#8212; &#8220;Though both these kinds of action are expressed by one term
&#8212; to <i>please</i> &#8212; <i>yet </i>they are exceedingly diverse; no
less so than a conduct which has the glory of God and the good of mankind for
its object, and one that originates and terminates in self. The former of these
passages should be read in connection with what precedes and follows it,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461031&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:31-33.) Hence it appears plain, that the <i>things </i>in which
the Apostle <i>pleased all</i>,<i> men</i>,<i> </i>require to be restricted to
such things as tend to their &#8216;profit, that they may be
sav<i>ed</i>.&#8217; Whereas the things in which, according to the latter
passage, he could <i>not </i>please men, and yet be the servant of Christ, were

&#8220;It is well known that trumpets were exclusively employed in almost all
ancient armies, for the purpose of directing the movements of the soldiers, and
of informing them what they were to do &#8212; as when to attack, advance, or
retreat. This was the custom in even the most early Jewish armies, as the Law
directed two silver trumpets to be made for the purpose.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;041001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers

various intimations which were in this manner conveyed; and if the trumpeter did
not give the proper intonation, the soldiers could not tell how to act, or were
in danger, from misconception, of acting wrongly.&#8221; <i>Illustrated

&#8220;The Greeks, after the custom of the Egyptians, mentioned by; Herodotus,
(lib. 2,)called all those <i>barbarians </i>who did not speak their language.
process of time, however, the Romans haaving subdued the Greeks, delivered
themselves by the force of arms from that opprobrious appellation; and joined
the Greeks in calling all barbarians who did not speak either the Greek or the
Latin language. Afterwards, <i>barbarian </i>signified any one who spoke a
language which another did not understand. Thus the Scythian philosopher,
Anacharsis, said, that among the Athenians the Scythians were
<i>barbarians</i>;<i> </i>and among the Scythians the Athenians were

&#8220;What is it,&#8221; says <i>Witsius</i>,<i> </i>(in his &#8220;Sacred
Dissertations,&#8221;) to pray with the <i>tongue</i>?<i> </i>with the
<i>spirit</i>?<i> </i>with the <i>mind</i>?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:14, 15.) The <i>tongue </i>means here a language unknown to
others, and employed by one who is endowed with a supernatural gift of the Holy
Spirit. To <i>pray with the tongue</i>,<i> </i>is to pray in a language unknown
to others; as, for instance, to pray in the Hebrew language in presence of
Greeks. In that sense he had said,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:2,) &#8216;He that speaketh with the tongue, speaketh not unto
men, but unto God; for no man understandeth him;&#8217; that is, he who speaks
in a foreign tongue, the knowledge of which he has acquired by an extraordinary
gift of the Spirit, has God only for a witness. He cannot reckon as his
witnesses, or as persons aware of what he is doing, those who are ignorant of
the language, and to whose edification he has contributed little or nothing. The
<i>spirit </i>means here that extraordinary gift, by which a man is led to act
in a certain way, accompanied by almost ecstatic emotions, so that sometimes he
is neither aware what he says, nor do others understand what he means. To
<i>pray with the Spirit</i>,<i> </i>is to pray in such a manner as to show that
you feel the presence of an extraordinary gift of the Spirit, which moves and
hurries you along, in a powerful manner, to those actions which excite
astonishment.

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;200501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
5:1.) To <i>pray with the mind</i>,<i> </i>is to pray in such a manner that the
prayers which you deliberately <i>conceive</i>,<i> </i>may be conceived and
understood by others. Paul, accordingly, proposes himself as an example of the
proper manner of conducting prayers. <i>If I pray in a tongue </i>unknown to the
assembly in whose presence I pray, but which I have learned by Divine
inspiration, <i>my spirit prayeth</i>,<i> </i>I am acting under the influence of
that gift, which impels and arouses me to unusual and remarkable proceedings;
but <i>my understanding is unfruitful</i>,<i> </i>I do not enable another to
understand with advantage the conceptions of my mind. <i>What then</i>?<i> I
will pray with the Spirit</i>;<i> </i>when the vehement emotion of the Spirit
comes upon me, I will not struggle against it, <i>but I will pray with the
understanding also</i>;<i> </i>I will show that I am not mad, but possessed of a
sound understanding; and I will endeavor that others, as well as myself, be
edified by my prayer.&#8221; Biblical Cabinet, volume 24. &#8212;

<i>Henderson </i>on <i>Isaiah</i>,<i> </i>when commenting on the passage here
quoted by the Apostle,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232809&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:9-11,) observes, that it &#8220;contains the taunting language of the drunken
priests and judges of the Jews, who repel with scorn the idea that they should
require the plain and reiterated lessons which Jehovah taught by his messengers.
Such elementary instruction was fit&#8221; (in their view) &#8220;only for
babes: it was an insult to their understanding to suppose that they stood in
need of it.  The language of verse 10&#8221; (<i>precept pon</i>,<i>
precept</i>,<i> </i>etc.) &#8220;more resembles that of inebriated persons, than
any used by persons in a state of sobriety. The words are obviously selected to
suit the character of those supposed to employ them;  and, by their monosyllabic
and repetitious forms, admirably express the initiatory process of tuition which
they indignantly despise.  13-24The language they employed in caviling at the
Prophetic warnings was all but  barbarous: it consisted of barely intelligible
sounds: they should, by way of condign punishment, hear the foreign, and to them
apparently mocking accents of the Chaldeans, whom God would employ as the
interpreters of his severe but righteous will. The passage is employed by Paul
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:20, 21) quite in the spirit of the connection in which it here
stands. He tacitly compares the Corinthian faction, which boasted of the faculty
of speaking in unknown tongues, to the puerile characters adverted to,

3. n. 2,)in the following terms: &#8212; &#8220;Mulicbris verecundiae oblita,
suas per se causas agebat, et importunis clamoribus judicibus obstrepebat; non

becomes a femme, she pleaded her own cause in person, and annoyed the judges
with a senseless clamouring &#8212; not from any want of advocates to take her
case in hand, but from excessive impudence. In consequence of this, women that
were of bold front, and were forgetful of the modesty that becomes a matron,
were, by way of reproach, called <i>Afranias</i>.&#8221; &#8212;

&#8220;This precept is sometimes applied to support the use of rites and
ceremonies in the worship of God, not commanded in Scripture. But any one who
considers the place which it holds in this discourse, will be sensible that it
hath no relation to rites and ceremonies, but to the <i>decent </i>and
