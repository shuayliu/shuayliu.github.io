<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now I make known to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now enters on another subject
&#8212; the resurrection &#8212; the belief of which among the Corinthians had
been shaken by some wicked persons. It .is uncertain, however, whether they
doubted merely as to the ultimate resurrection of the body, or as to the
immortality of the soul also. It is abundantly well known, that there were a
variety of errors as to this point. Some philosophers contended that souls are
immortal. As to the resurrection of the body, it never entered into the mind of
any one of them. The Sadducees, however, had grosser views; for they thought of
nothing but the present life; nay more, they thought that the soul of man was a
breath of wind without substance. It is not, therefore, altogether certain (as I
have already said) whether the Corinthians had at this time gone to such a
height of madness, as to cast off all expectation of a future life, or whether
they merely denied the resurrection of the body; for the arguments which Paul
makes use of seem to imply, that they were altogether bewitched with the mad
dream of the Sadducees.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For example, when he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Of what advantage is it
to be baptized for the
dead?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461529&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 15:29.)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Were it not better to eat
and to drink?
</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461532&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 15:32.)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Why are we in peril every
hour?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461530&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 15:30,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and the like, it might very readily be replied, in
accordance with the views of the philosophers, &#8220;Because after death the
soul survives the body.&#8221; Hence some apply the whole of Paul&#8217;s
reasoning contained in this chapter to the immortality of the soul. For my part,
while I leave undetermined what the error of the Corinthians was, yet I cannot
bring myself to view Paul&#8217;s words as referring to anything else than the
resurrection of the body. Let it, therefore be regarded as a settled point, that
it is of this exclusively that he treats in this chapter. And what if the
impiety of Hymeneus and Philetus had extended thus
far,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f795</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who said that <i>the resurrection was
already past,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;550218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:18,) and that there would be nothing more of it? Similar to these,
there are at the present day some madmen, or rather
devils,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f796</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">who call
themselves Libertines.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f797</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">To me,
however, the following conjecture appears more probable &#8212; that they were
carried away by some delusion,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f798</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">which took
away from them the hope of a future resurrection, just as those in the present
day, by imagining an allegorical
resurrection,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f799</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">take away
from us the true resurrection that is pro-raised to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However this may be, it is truly a dreadful case, and
next to a prodigy, that those who had been instructed by so distinguished a
master, should have been capable of falling so
quickly</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f800</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">into errors
of so gross a nature. But what is there that is surprising in this, when in the
Israelitish Church the Sadducees had the audacity to declare openly that man
differs nothing from a brute, in so far as concerns the essence of the soul, and
has no enjoyment but what is common to him with the beasts? Let us observe,
however, that blindness of this kind is a just judgment from God, so that those
who do not rest satisfied with the truth of God, are tossed hither and thither
by the delusions of Satan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is asked, however, why it is that he has left off
or deferred to the close of the Epistle, what should properly have had the
precedence of everything else? Some reply, that this was done for the purpose of
impressing it more deeply upon the memory. I am rather of opinion that Paul did
not wish to introduce a subject of such importance, until he had asserted his
authority, which had been considerably lessened among the Corinthians, and until
he had, by repressing their pride, prepared them for listening to him with
docility.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I make known to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make
known</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>here does not mean to teach what
was previously unknown to them, but to recall to their recollection what they
had heard previously. &#8220;Call to your recollection, along with me, that
gospel which you had learned, before you were led aside from the right
course.&#8221; He calls the doctrine of the resurrection the <i>gospel, </i>that
they may not imagine that any one is at liberty to form any opinion that he
chooses on this point, as on other questions, which bring with them no injury to
salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which I preached to
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he amplifies what he had said:
<i>&#8220;If </i>you acknowledge me as an apostle, I have assuredly taught you
so.&#8221; There is another amplification in the words &#8212;<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which also ye have
received</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for if they now allow
themselves to be persuaded of the contrary, they will be chargeable with
fickleness. A <i>third </i>amplification is to this effect, that they had
hitherto continued in that belief with a firm and steady resolution, which is
somewhat more than that they had once believed. But the most important thing of
all is, that he declares that their salva.-tion is involved in this, for it
follows from this, that, if the resurrection is taken away, they have no
religion left them, no assurance of faith, and in short, have no faith
remaining. Others understand in another sense the word <i>stand, </i>as meaning
that they are <i>upheld!; </i>but the interpretation that I have given is a more
correct one.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f801</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If you keep in memory &#8212;

vain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f802</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font></sup><font face="Palatino">These two expressions are very cutting.
In the <i>first, </i>he reproves their carelessness or fickleness, because such
a sudden fall was an evidence that they had never understood what had been
delivered to them, or that their knowledge of it had been loose and floating,
inasmuch as it had so quickly vanished. By the <i>second, </i>he warns them that
they had needlessly and uselessly professed allegiance to Christ, if they did
not hold fast this main
doctrine.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f803</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I delivered to you first
of all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now confirms what he had
previously stated, by explaining that the resurrection had been preached by him,
and that too as a fundamental doctrine of the gospel. <i>First of all, </i>says
he, as it is wont to be with a foundation in the erecting of a house. At the
same time he adds to the authority of his preaching, when he subjoins, that he
<i>delivered </i>nothing but </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what
he had received</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for he does not simply
mean that he related what he had from the report of others, but that it was what
had been enjoined upon him by the
Lord.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f804</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For the
word</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f805</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">must be
explained in accordance with the connection of the passage. Now it is the duty
of an apostle to bring forward nothing but what he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has received from the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so as from hand to
hand</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f806</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">(as they
say) to administer to the Church the pure word of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That Christ died,
etc</i></font><font face="Palatino">. See now more clearly whence he received
it, for he quotes <i>the Scriptures </i>in proof. In the first place, he makes
mention of the death of Christ, nay also of his burial, that we may infer, that,
as he was like us in these things, he is so also in his resurrection. He has,
therefore, died with us that we may rise with him. In his burial, too, the
reality of the death in which he has taken part with us, is made more clearly
apparent. Now there are many passages of Scripture in which Christ&#8217;s death
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>resurrection</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>are predicted, but nowhere more
plainly</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f807</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">than in
Isaiah 53, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270926&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
9:26, and in Psalm 22.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For our
sins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>That is, that by taking our curse
upon him he might redeem us from it. For what else was Christ&#8217;s death, but
a sacrifice for expiating our sins &#8212; what but a satisfactory penalty, by
which we might be reconciled to God &#8212; what but the condemnation of one,
for the purpose of obtaining forgiveness for us? He speaks also in the same
manner in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450425&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:25, but in that passage, on the other hand, he ascribes it also to the
resurrection as its effect &#8212; that it confers righteousness upon us; for as
sin was done away through the death of Christ, so righteousness is procured
through his resurrection. This distinction must be carefully <i>observed,
</i>that we may know what we must look for from the death of Christ, and what
from his resurrection. When, however, the Scripture in other places makes
mention only of his death, let us understand that in those cases his
<i>resurrection </i>is included in his death, but when they are mentioned
separately, the commencement of our salvation is (as we see) in the one, and the
consummation of it in the other.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he was seen by
Cephas</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now brings forward <i>eye<b>

(</i></font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aujto&gt;ptav</font><font face="Palatino"><i>)

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
1:2,) who saw the accomplishment of what the Scriptures had foretold would take
place. He does not, however, adduce them all, for he makes no mention of women.
When, therefore, he says that he appeared first to Peter, you are to understand
by this that he is put before all the <i>men, </i>so that there is nothing
inconsistent with this in the statement of Mark
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:9) that <i>he appeared to Mary.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But how is it that he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he appeared to the
twelve</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>when, after the death of Judas,
there were only eleven remaining? Chrysostom is of opinion that this took place
after Matthias had been chosen in his room. Others have chosen rather to correct
the expression, looking upon it as a
mistake</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f808</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But as we know, that there were
<i>twelve </i>in number that were set apart by Christ&#8217;s appointment,
though one of them had been expunged from the roll, there is no, absurdity in
supposing that the name was retained. On this principle, there was a body of men
at Rome that were called
Centumviri,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f809</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">while they

hundred</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>took place. Only it is possible
that this large multitude assembled at Jerusalem, when he manifested himself to
them. For Luke
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422433&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
24:33) makes mention in a general way of the disciples who had assembled with
the eleven; but how many there were he does not say. Chrysostom refers it to the
ascension, and explains the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpa&gt;nw</font><font face="Palatino">
to mean, <i>from on high.</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f811</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font></sup><font face="Palatino">Unquestionably, as to what he says in
reference to his having appeared to James apart, this may have been subsequently
to the ascension.</font><br></div>

the Apostles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I understand not merely the

f812</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">In
proportion as our Lord was desirous that there should be many witnesses of his

should be so much the more <i>surely believed among us.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
1:1.) Farther, inasmuch as the Apostle proves the resurrection of Christ from
the fact that be appeared to many, he intimates by this, that it was not
figurative but true and natural, for the eyes of the body cannot be witnesses of
a spiritual resurrection.</font><br></div>

greatest weight and influence among the Corinthians, he introduces, by the way,
a commendation of himself personally, but at the same time qualified in such a
manner that, while he claims much for himself, he is at the same time
exceedingly modest. Lest any one, therefore, should meet him with the objection:
&#8220;Who<i> </i>art thou that we should give credit to thee?&#8221; he, of his
own accord, confesses his unworthiness, and, in the first place, indeed he
compares himself to one that is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>born
prematurely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and that, in my opinion,
with reference to his sudden conversion. For as infants do not come forth from
the womb, until they have been there formed and matured during a regular course
of time, so the Lord observed a regular period of time in creating, nourishing,
and forming his Apostles. Paul, on the other hand, had been cast forth from the
womb when he had scarcely received the vital
spark.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

my part, while I have no doubt that, he was at all times voluntarily, and even
cheerfully, disposed to abase himself, that he might magnify the grace of God,
yet I suspect that in this instance he wished to obviate calumnies. For that
there were some at Corinth: that made it their aim to detract from his dignity
by malicious slander, may be inferred not only from many foregoing passages, but
also from his adding a little afterwards a comparison, which he would assuredly
never have touched upon, if he had not been constrained to it by the wickedness

of all, and next to nothing, provided this contempt does not impede him in any
degree in his ministry, and does not at all detract from his doctrine. He is
contented that, as to himself, he shall be reckoned unworthy of any honor,

opposition to the grace of God, that whatever good we do may not be ascribed
wholly to Him, wrest these words to suit their own interpretation &#8212; as if
Paul boasted, that he had by his own industry taken care that God&#8217;s grace
toward him had not been misdirected. Hence they infer, that God, indeed, offers
his grace, but that the right use of it is in man&#8217;s own power, and that it
is in his own power to prevent its being ineffectual. I maintain, however, that
these words of Paul give no support to their error, for he does not here claim
anything as his own, as if he had himself, independently of God, done anything
praiseworthy. What then? That he might not seem to glory to no purpose in mere
words, while devoid of reality, he says, that he affirms nothing that is not
openly apparent. Farther, even admitting that these words intimate, that Paul
did not abuse the grace of God, and did not render it ineffectual by his
negligence, I maintain, nevertheless, that there is no reason on that account,
why we should divide between him and God the praise, that ought to be ascribed
wholly to God, inasmuch as he confers upon us not merely the power of doing
well, but also the inclination and the accomplishment.</font><br></div>

detracting from Paul, endeavored to set off themselves and their goods to
advantage, as, in their opinion at least, it is not likely that he wished to
enter upon a contest with the Apostles. When he compares himself, however, with
the Apostles, he does so merely for the sake of those wicked persons, who were
accustomed to bring them forward for the purpose of detracting from his
reputation, as we see in the Epistle to the Galatians
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
1:11.) Hence the probability is, that it is of the Apostles that he speaks, when
he represents his own labors as superior to theirs, and it is quite true, that
he was superior to others, not merely in respect of his enduring many hardships,
encountering many dangers, abstaining from things lawful, and perseveringly
despising all <i>perils;

grace of God &#8212;<i> wholly, </i>I say, not in part, for whatever he might
have seemed to do, was <i>wholly, </i>he declares, the work of grace. A
remarkable passage certainly, both for laying low the pride of man, and for
magnifying the operation of Divine grace in us. For Paul, as though he had
improperly made himself the author of anything good, corrects what he had said,
and declares the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grace of

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;550217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:17, 18.) For as the resurrection is the completion of our salvation,
and as to all blessings is, as it were, the farthest
goal,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f835</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">the man who
says that our resurrection is already past, leaves us nothing better to hope for
after death. However this may be, this passage gives at all events no
countenance to the frenzy of those who imagine that the soul sleeps as well as
the body, until the day of the
<i>resurrection.</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f836</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i></font></sup><font face="Palatino">They
bring forward, it is true, this objection &#8212; that if the soul continued to
live when separated from the body, Paul would not have said that, if the
resurrection were taken away, we would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have hope only in this
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>inasmuch as there would still be
some felicity remaining for the soul. To this, however, I reply, that
Paul&#8217; did not dream of Elysian
fields,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f837</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">and foolish
fables of that sort, but takes it for granted, that the entire hope of
Christians looks forward to the final day of judgment &#8212; that pious souls
do even at this day rest in the same expectation, and that, consequently, we are
bereft of everything, if a confidence of this nature deceives
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why does he say that we
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would be the most miserable of
all men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as if the lot of the Christian
were worse than that of the wicked? For <i>all things, </i>says Solomon,
<i>happen alike to the good and to the bad.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;210902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ecclesiastes
9:2.) I answer, that all men, it is true, whether good or bad, are liable to
distresses in common, and they feel in common the same inconveniences, and the
same miseries; but there are two reasons why Christians have in all ages fared
worse, in addition to which, there was one that was peculiar to the times of
Paul. The <i>first </i>is, that while the Lord frequently chastises the wicked,
too, with his lashes, and begins to inflict his judgments upon them, he at the
same time peculiarly afflicts his own in various ways; &#8212; in the <i>first
</i>place, because he <i>chastises those whom he loves,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:6;) and <i>secondly, </i>in order that he may train them to patience, that he
may try their obedience, and that he may gradually prepare them by the cross for
a true renovation. However it may be as to this, that statement always holds
good in the case of believers <i>It is time, that judgment should begin at the
house of God.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;242529&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

<div><font face="Palatino">Meanwhile, the condition of the wicked is for the
most part the more desirable, because the Lord feeds them up, as hogs for the
day of slaughter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>second </i>reason is, that believers, even
though they should abound in riches and in blessings of every kind, they
nevertheless do not go to excess, and do not gormandize at their ease; in fine,
they do not enjoy the world, as unbelievers do, but go forward with anxiety,
constantly <i>groaning,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

an eager longing for the future life. Unbelievers, on the other hand, are wholly
intent on intoxicating themselves with present
delights.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f839</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>third </i>reason, which was peculiar, as I
have said,<sup> </sup>to the age of the Apostle, is &#8212; that at that time
the name of <i>Christians </i>was so odious and abominable, that no one could
then take upon himself the name of Christ without exposing his life to imminent
peril. It is, therefore, not without good reason that he says that Christians
would be <i>the most miserable of </i>all men, if their confidence were confined
to this world.</font><br></div>

to take it in a more simple way &#8212; that in him the first fruit of the
resurrection was gathered. I rather prefer, however, to understand the statement
in this sense &#8212; that the rest of the dead will follow him, as the entire
harvest does the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>first-fruits</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Since by man came
death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The point to be proved is, that
Christ is the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.first-fruits</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and that it was not merely as an individual that he was raised up from the
dead. He proves it from contraries, because death is not from nature, but from
man&#8217;s sin. As, therefore, Adam did not die for himself alone, but for us
all, it follows, that Christ in like manner, who is the
antitype,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f842</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">did not
rise for himself alone; for he came, that he might restore everything that had
been ruined in Adam.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must observe, however, the force of the argument;
for he does not contend by similitude, or by example, but has recourse to
opposite causes for the purpose of proving&#8217; opposite effects. The cause of
death is Adam, and we die in him: hence Christ, Whose office it is to restore to
us what we lost in Adam, is the cause of life to us; and his resurrection is the
ground-work and pledge of ours. And as the former was the beginning of death, so
the latter is of life. In the fifth chapter of the Romans (Romans 5) he follows
out the same comparison; but there is this difference, that in that passage he
reasons respecting a spiritual life and death, while he treats here of the
resurrection of the body, which is the fruit of spiritual life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every one in his own

some one might say, &#8220;draws<i> </i>ours along with it, why does not this
appear? Instead of this, while Christ has risen from the grave, we lie rotting
there.&#8221;<i> </i>Paul&#8217;s answer is, that God has appointed another
order of things. Let us therefore reckon it enough, that we now have in Christ
the

that his coming</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

time of our resurrection. For <i>our life </i>must still be <i>hid with him,
</i>because he has not yet <i>appeared.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians

be before Christ&#8217;s coming. But as this world is like a stormy sea, in
which we are continually tossed, and our condition is so uncertain, or rather is
so full of troubles, and there are in all things such sudden changes, this might
be apt to trouble weak minds. Hence he now leads them forward to that day,
saying that all things will be set in order. <i>Then, </i>therefore, shall come
<i>the </i>end &#8212; that is, the goal of our course &#8212; a quiet harbour
&#8212; a condition that will no longer be exposed to changes; and he at the
same time admonishes us, that that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>end</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>must be waited for, because it is not befitting that we should be crowned in
the middle of the course. In what respect Christ will
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deliver up the kingdom to the
Father,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>will be explained in a little.
When he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God and the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>this may be taken in two senses
&#8212; either that God the Father is called the God and Father of Christ, or
that. the name of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is added by way of explanation. The conjunction <i>et<b> </b>(and) </i>will
in the <i>latter </i>case mean <i>namely. </i>As to the <i>former
</i>signification, there is nothing either absurd, or unusual, in the saying,
that Christ is inferior to God, in respect of his human nature.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When he shall have abolished all
rule.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some understand this as referring
to the powers that are opposed to Christ himself; for they have an eye to what
immediately follows, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>until he
shall have put all his enemies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc.
This clause, however, corresponds with what goes before, when he said, that
Christ would not sooner </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deliver
up the kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence there is no reason
why we should restrict in such a manner the statement before us. I explain it,
accordingly, in a general way, and understand by it &#8212; all powers that are
lawful and <i>ordained by God.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:1.) In the <i>.first </i>place, what we find in the Prophets
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;231310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
13:10;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;263207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
32:7) as to the darkening of the sun and moon, that God alone may shine forth,
while it has begun to be fulfilled under the reign of Christ, will,
nevertheless, not be fully accomplished until the last day; but then <i>every
height shall be brought low,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
3:5,) that the glory of God may alone shine forth. Farther, we know that all
earthly principalities and honors are connected exclusively with the keeping up
of the present life, and, consequently, are a part of the world. Hence it
follows that they are temporary.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence as the world will have an end, so also will
government, and magistracy, and laws, and distinctions of ranks, and different
orders of dignities, and everything of that nature. There will be no more any
distinction between servant and master, between king and peasant, between
magistrate and private citizen. Nay more, there will be then an end put to
angelic principalities in heaven, and to ministries and superiorities in the
Church, that God may exercise his power and dominion by himself alone, and not
by the hands of men or angels. The angels, it is true, will continue to exist,
and they will also retain their distinction. The righteous, too, will shine
forth, every one according to the measure of his grace; but the angels will have
to resign the dominion, which they now exercise in the name and by the
commandment of God. Bishops, teachers, and Prophets will cease to hold these
distinctions, and will resign the office which they now discharge. <i>Rule</i>,
and <i>authority, </i>and <i>power </i>have much the same meaning in this
passage; but these three terms are conjoined to bring out the meaning more
fully.</font><br></div>

things will be put into a right and tranquil state, because Christ has not yet
&#8216;subdued all his enemies. Blow that <i>must </i>be brought about,
<i>because </i>the Father has placed him at his right hand with this
understanding, that he is not to resign the authority that he has received,
until they have been subdued under his power. And this is said for the
consolation of the pious, that they may not be impatient on account of the long
delay of the resurrection. This statement occurs in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
110:1.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul, however, may seem to refine upon the word
<i>until </i>beyond what the simple and natural meaning of the word requires;
for the Spirit does not in that passage give intimation of what shall be
afterwards, but simply of what must be previously. I answer, that Paul does not
conclude that Christ will </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deliver
up the kingdom to the Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>on the
ground of its having been so predicted in the Psalm, but he has made use of this
quotation from the Psalm, for the purpose of proving that the day of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>delivering up the
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>had not yet arrived, because
Christ has still to do with his enemies. Paul, however, explains in passing what
is meant by Christ&#8217;s sitting at the right hand of the Father, when in
place of that figurative expression he makes use of the simple
word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

</i>Hence Christ must still be the administrator of his Father&#8217;s kingdom.
Let believers, therefore, be of good courage, and not give up hope, until
everything that must precede the resurrection be accomplished. It is asked,
however, in what sense he affirms that death shall be the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>last enemy <sup>f847</sup> that
will be destroyed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>when it has been
already destroyed by Christ&#8217;s death, or at least, by his resurrection,
which is the victory over death, and the attainment of life? I answer, that it
was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destroyed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in such a way as to be no longer deadly to believers, but not in such a way
as to occasion them no uneasiness. The Spirit of God, it is true, dwelling in us
is life; but we still carry about with us a mortal body.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600124&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:24.) The substance of death in us will one day be drained off, but it
has not been so as yet. We are <i>born again of incorruptible seed,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:23,) but we ha. re not yet arrived at perfection. Or to sum up the
matter briefly in a similitude, the sword of death which could penetrate into

danger;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

generally received opinion. Paul shows from that Psalm, that God the Father has
conferred upon Christ the power of all things, because it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast put all things under
his feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The words are in themselves
plain, were it not that there are two difficulties that present <i>themselves
&#8212; first, </i>that the Prophet speaks here not of Christ alone, but of the
whole human race; and <i>secondly, </i>that by <i>all things </i>he means only
those things that have to do with the convenience of the life of the body, as we
find in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
2:19. The solution of the former difficulty is easy; for as Christ is the
<i>first-born of every creature,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:15,) and the <i>heir of all things,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:2,) God, the Father, has not conferred upon the human race the use of all
creatures in such a way as to hinder that in the mean time the chief power, and,
so to speak, the rightful dominion, remain in Christ&#8217;s hands. Farther, we
know, that Adam lost the right that had been conferred upon him, so that we can
no longer call anything our own. For the <i>earth was cursed, </i>(Genesis in.
17,) and everything that it contains; and it is through Christ alone that we
recover what has been taken from
us.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f849</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">It is with
propriety, therefore, that this commendation belongs to Christ personally
&#8212; that the Father has <i>put all things under his feet, </i>inasmuch as we
rightfully possess nothing except in him. For how shall we become heirs of God,
if we are not his sons, and by whom are we made his sons but by
Christ</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The solution of the <i>second </i>difficulty is as
follows &#8212; that the Prophet, it is true, especially mentions <i>fowls of
heaven, fishes of the sea, </i>and <i>beasts of the field, </i>because this kind
of dominion is visible, and is more apparent to the eye;but at the same time the
general statement reaches much farther &#8212; to the heavens and the earth, and
everything that they contain. Now the subjection must have a corrrespondence
with the character of him who rules &#8212; that is, it has a suitable-ness to
his condition, so as to correspond with it. Now Christ does not need animals for
food, or other creatures for any necessity. He rules, therefore, that all things
may be subservient to his glory, inasmuch as he adopts us as participants in his
dominion. The fruit of this openly appears in visible creatures; but believers
feel in their consciences an inward fruit, which, as I have said, extends
farther.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All things put under him, except
him who put all things under him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He
insists upon two things<i> &#8212; first, </i>that all things must be brought
under subjection to Christ before he restores to the Father the dominion of the
world, and <i>secondly, </i>that the Father has given all things into the hands
of his Son in such a way as to retain the principal right in his own hands. From
the <i>former </i>of these it follows, that the hour of <i>the </i>last judgment
is not yet come &#8212; from the <i>second, </i>that Christ is now the medium
between us and the Father in such a way as to bring us at length to him. Hence
he immediately infers as follows:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After he shall have subjected all
things to him, then shall the Son subject himself to the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>&#8220;Let us wait patiently
until Christ shall vanquish all his enemies, and shall bring us, along with
himself, under the dominion of God, that the kingdom of God may in every respect
be accomplished in <i>us.</i>&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This statement, however, is at first view at variance
with what we read in various passages of Scripture respecting the eternity of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom. For how will these things correspond &#8212; Of <i>his
kingdom there will be no end,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
7:14, 27;

1:33;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;610111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 1:11,) and <i>He himself shall be subjected? </i>The solution of this
question will open up Paul&#8217;s meaning more clearly. In the <i>first
</i>place, it must be observed, that all power was delivered over to Christ,
inasmuch as he was manifested in the flesh. It is true that such distinguished
majesty would not correspond with a mere man, but, notwithstanding,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Father has exalted
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in the same nature in which he was
abased, and has</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">given, him a name, before
which every knee must bow, etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;502609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Philippians
2:9, 10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, it must be Observed, that he has been
appointed Lord and highest King, so as to be as it were the Father&#8217;s
Vicegerent in the government of the world &#8212; not that he is employed and
the Father unemployed (for how could that be, inasmuch as he is the wisdom and
counsel of the Father, is of one essence with him, and is therefore himself
God?) But the reason why the Scripture testifies, that Christ now holds dominion
over the heaven and the earth in the room of the Father is &#8212; that we may
not think that there is any other governor, lord, protector, or judge of the
dead and living, but may fix our contemplation on him alone
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f850</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We acknowledge, it is true, God as the ruler, but it is in the face of the man
Christ. But Christ will then restore the kingdom which he has received, that we
may cleave wholly to
God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f851</font></sup><font face="Palatino">.
Nor&#8217; will he in this way resign the kingdom, but will transfer it in a
manner from his humanity to his glorious divinity, because a way of approach
will then be opened up, from which our infirmity now keeps us back. Thus then
Christ will be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>subjected to the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because the vail being then
removed, we shall openly behold God reigning in his
majesty,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f852</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">and
Christ&#8217;s humanity will then no longer be interposed to keep us back from a
closer view of God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f853</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That God may be all in
all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Will it be so in the Devil and
wicked men also? By no means &#8212; unless perhaps we choose to take the verb
to be as meaning, to <i>be known, and openly beheld. </i>In that case the
meaning will be: <i>&#8220;For </i>the present, as the Devil resists God, as
wicked men confound and disturb the order which he has established, and as
endless occasions of offense present themselves to our view, it does not
distinctly appear that <i>God is all in all; </i>but when Christ will have
executed the judgment which has been committed to him by the Father, and will
have cast down Satan and all the wicked, the glory<sub> </sub>of God will be
conspicuous in their destruction. The same thing may be said also respecting
powers that are sacred and lawful in their kind, for they in a manner hinder
God&#8217;s being seen aright by us in himself. Then,<i> </i>on the other hand,
God, holding the government of the heaven and the earth by himself, and without
any medium, will in that respect be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and will consequently at last be so, not only in all persons, but also in
all creatures.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a pious
interpretation,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f854</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">and, as it
corresponds sufficiently well with the Apostle&#8217;s design, I willingly
embrace it. There would, however, be nothing out of place in understanding it as
referring exclusively to believers, in whom God has now begun his kingdom, and
will then perfect it, and in such a way that they shall cleave to him wholly.
Both meanings sufficiently refute of themselves the wicked frenzies of some who
bring forward this passage in proof of them. Some imagine, that God will be
<i>all in all </i>in this respect, that all things will vanish and dissolve into
nothing. Paul&#8217;s words, however, mean nothing but this, that all things
will be brought back to God, as their alone beginning and end, that they may be
closely bound to him. Others infer from this that the Devil and all the wicked
will be saved &#8212; as if God would not altogether be better known in the
Devil&#8217;s destruction, than if he were to associate the Devil with himself,
and make him one with himself. We see then, how impudently madmen of this sort
wrest this statement of Paul for maintaining their blasphemies.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Else what shall they
do</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He resumes his enumeration of the
absurdities, which follow from the error under which the Corinthians labored. He
had set himself in the outset to do this, but he introduced instruction and
consolation, by means of which he interrupted in some degree the thread of his
discourse. To this he now returns. In the first place he brings forward this
objection &#8212; that the baptism which those received who are already regarded
as dead, will be of no avail if there is no resurrection. Before expounding this
passage, it is of importance to set aside the common exposition, which rests
upon the authority of the ancients, and is received with almost universal
consent. Chrysostom, therefore, and Ambrose, who are followed by others, are of
opinion <sup>
</sup></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f855</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">that the Corinthians were accustomed, when
any one had been deprived of :baptism by sudden death, to substitute some living
person in the place of the deceased &#8212; to be baptized at his grave. They at
the same time do not deny that this custom was corrupt, and full of
superstition, but they say that Paul, for the purpose of confuting the
Corinthians, was contented with this single
fact,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f856</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that while they denied that there was a
resurrection, they in the mean time declared in this way that they believed in
it. For my part, however, I cannot by any means be persuaded to believe
this,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f857</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">for it is
not to be credited, that those who denied that there was a resurrection had,
along with others, made use of a custom of this sort. Paul then would have had
immediately this reply made to him: &#8220;Why do you trouble us with that old
wives&#8217; superstition, which you do not yourself approve of?&#8221; Farther,
if they had made use of it, they might very readily have replied: &#8220;If this
has been hitherto practiced by us through mistake, rather let the mistake be
corrected, than that it should have weight attached to it for proving a point of
such importance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Granting, however, that the argument was conclusive,
can we suppose that, if such a corruption as this had prevailed among the
Corinthians, the Apostle, after reproving almost all their faults, would have
been silent as to this one? He has censured above some practices that are not of
so great moment. He has not scrupled to give directions as to women&#8217;s
having&#8217; the head covered, and other things of that nature. Their corrupt
administration of the Supper he has not merely reproved, but has inveighed
against it with the greatest keenness. Would he in the meantime have uttered not
a single word in reference to such a base profanation of baptism, which was a
much more grievous fault? He has inveighed with great vehemence against those
who, by frequenting the banquets of the Gentiles, silently counte-nanced their
superstitions. Would he have suffered this horrible superstition of the Gentiles
to be openly carried on in the Church itself under the name of sacred baptism?
But granting that he might have been silent, what shall we say when he expressly
makes mention of it? Is it, I pray you, a likely thing that the Apostle would
bring forward in the shape of an argument a
sacrilege</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f858</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">by which
baptism was polluted, and converted into a mere magical abuse, and yet not say
even one word in condemnation of the fault? When he is treating of matters that
are not of the highest importance, he introduces nevertheless this parenthesis,
that he <i>speaks as a man.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:5;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450619&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:19;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:15.) Would not this have been a more befitting and suitable place for such a
parenthesis? Now from his making mention of such a thing without any word of
reproof, who would not understand it to be a thing that was allowed? For my
part, I assuredly understand him to speak here of the right, use of baptism, and
not of an abuse of it of that nature.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now inquire as to the meaning. At one time I
was of opinion, that Paul here pointed out the universal design of baptism, for
the advantage of baptism is not confined to this life; but on considering the
w6rds afterwards with greater care, I perceived that Paul here points out
something peculiar. For he does not speak of all when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What shall they do, who are
baptized</i></font><font face="Palatino">? etc. Besides, I am not fond of
interpretations, that are more ingenious than solid. What then? I say, that
those are <i>baptized for dead, </i>who are looked upon as already dead, and who
have altogether despaired of life; and in this way the particle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpe&gt;r</font><font face="Palatino">
will have the force of the Latin <i>pro, </i>as when we say, <i>habere pro
derelicto; &#8212; to reckon as
abandoned</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f859</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This signification is not a
forced one. Or if you would prefer another signification, to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>baptized for the
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>will mean &#8212; to be baptized so
as to profit the dead &#8212; not the
living,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f860</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">Now it is
well known, that from the very commencement of the Church, those who had, while
yet catechumens,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f861</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">fallen into
disease,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f862</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">if their
life was manifestly in danger, were accustomed to ask baptism, that they might
not leave this world before they had made a profession of Christianity; and
this, in order that they might carry with them the seal of their
salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It appears from the writings of the Fathers, that as
to this matter, also, there crept in afterwards a superstition, for they inveigh
against those who delayed baptism till the time of their death, that, being once
for all purged from all their sins, they might in this state meet the judgment
of God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f863</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> A gross error truly, which proceeded
partly from great ignorance, and partly from hypocrisy! Paul, however, here
simply mentions a custom that was sacred, and in accordance with the Divine
institution &#8212; that if a catechumen, who had already in his heart embraced
the Christian faith,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f864</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">saw that
death was impending over him, he asked baptism, partly for his own consolation,
and partly with a view to the edification of his brethren. For it is no small
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consolation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
to </i>carry the token of his salvation sealed in his body. There is also an
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>edification</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>not to be lost sight of &#8212; that of making a confession of his faith.
They were, then, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>baptized for the
dead,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>inasmuch as it could not be of any
service to them in this world, and the very occasion of their asking baptism was
that they despaired of life. We now see that it is not without good reason that
Paul asks, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what they would
do</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>if there remained no hope after
death?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f865</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This passage shows us, too, that those
impostors who had disturbed the faith of the Corinthians, had contrived a
figurative resurrection, making the farthest goal of believers to be in this
world, His repeating it a second time,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why are they also baptized for
the dead? </i></font><font face="Palatino">gives it greater emphasis: &#8220;Not
only are those baptized who think that they are to live longer, but those too
who have death before their eyes; and that, in order that they may in death reap
the fruit of their baptism.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.

also?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8220;If </i>our resurrection and
ultimate felicity are in this world, why do we of our own accord abandon it, and
voluntarily encounter death?&#8221; The argument might also be unfolded in this
manner: &#8220;To<i> </i>no purpose would we
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stand in peril every
hour,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>if we did not look for a better
life, after death has been passed through.&#8221; He speaks, however, of
voluntary dangers, to which believers expose their lives for the purpose of
confessing Christ. &#8220;This magnanimity of soul, I say, in despising death,
would be ascribed to rashness rather than firmness, if the saints perished at
death, for it is a diabolical madness to purchase by death an immortal
fame.<sup>&#8221;</sup></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

much misery, if there were no reward in reserve for me in heaven? Nay more, if
my glory and bliss lie in this world, why do I not rather <i>enjoy </i>them,

Fabius,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

different &#8212; to be thrown to wild beasts, and to fight with wild beasts.
For those that were thrown to wild beasts were straightway torn in pieces; but
those that fought with wild beasts went forth armed into the arena, that if they
were endued with strength, courage, and agility, they might effect their escape
by dispatching the wild beasts. :Nay more, there was a game in which those who
fought with wild beasts were trained, like the
gladiators</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

prefer, however, that, for the handling of this subject, recourse should <i>be

proverb was in common use among the Greeks, chose rather to make use of it, that
it might make its way into their minds more readily, than to express the same

variance with human reason than this article of faith. For who but God alone
could persuade us that bodies, which are now liable to corruption, will, after
having rotted away, or after they have been consumed by fire, or torn in pieces
by wild beasts, will not merely be restored entire, but in a greatly better
condition. Do not all our apprehensions of things straightway reject this as a
thing fabulous, nay, most
absurd?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

this appearance of absurdity, makes use of an
<i>anhypophora,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f892</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, he brings forward by way
of objection, in the person of another, what appears at first view to be at
variance with the doctrine of a resurrection. For this question is not that of
one who inquires doubtingly as to the mode, but of one who argues from
impossibility &#8212; that is, what is said as to the resurrection is a thing
incredible. Hence in his reply he repels such an objection with severity. Let us
observe, then, that the persons who are here introduced as speaking, are those
who endeavor to disparage, in a way of scoffing, a belief in the resurrection,
on the ground of its being a thing that is impossible.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>36.

sowest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Apostle might have replied,
that the mode, which is to us incomprehensible, is nevertheless easy with God.
Hence, we must not here form our judgment according to our own understanding,
but must assign to the stupendous and secret power of God the honor of
believing, that it will accomplish what we cannot comprehend. He goes to work,
however, in another way. For he shows, that the resurrection is so far from
being against nature, that we have every day a clear illustration of it in the
course of nature itself &#8212; in the growth of the fruits of the earth. For
from what but from rottenness spring the fruits that we gather out of the earth?
For when the seed has been sown, unless the grains
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>die</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>there will be no increase. Corruption, then, being the commencement and
cause of production, we have in this a sort of picture of the resurrection.
Hence it follows, that we are beyond measure spiteful and ungrateful in
estimating the power of God, if we take from him what is already manifest before
our eyes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>37.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou sowest not that body
that will spring up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This comparison
consists of two <i>parts &#8212; first, </i>that it is not to be wondered that
bodies rise from rottenness, inasmuch as the same thing takes place as to seed;
and <i>secondly, </i>that it is not at variance with reason, that our bodies
should be restored in another condition, since, from bare grain, God brings
forth so many ears of corn, clothed with admirable contrivance, and stored with
grains of superior quality. As, however, he might seem to intimate, by speaking
in this way, that many bodies will therefore risc out of one, he modifies his
discourse in another way, by saying that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forms the body as it pleases
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>meaning that in that also there is
a difference in respect of quality.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to every seed its own
body</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this clause he restricts what
he had said respecting another body; for he says that, while the body is
different, it is in such a way as to retain, nevertheless, its particular
kind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>39.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All flesh is
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, etc</i>. Here we have another
comparison leading to the same conclusion, though there are some that explain it
otherwise. For when he says, that under the name of<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is comprehended the body of a man as well as of a beast, and yet the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in those two cases is different, he means by this that the substance indeed
is the same, but there is a difference as to quality. The sum is this &#8212;
that whatever diversity we see in any particular kind is a sort of prelude of
the resurrection, because God clearly shows, that it is no difficult thing with

only is there a difference between heavenly bodies and earthly, but even the
heavenly bodies have not all the same glory; for the sun surpasses the moon, and

f895</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for it is supposed that Paul meant to
say, that, after the resurrection, the saints will have different degrees of
honor and glory. This, indeed, is perfectly true, and is proved by other
declarations of Scripture; but it has nothing to do with Paul&#8217;s object.
For he is not arguing as to what difference of condition there will be among the
saints after the resurrection, but in what respect our bodies at present differ
from those that we will one day
receive.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">He removes, then, every idea of absurdity, by
instituting this comparison: The substance of the sun and moon is the same, but
there is a great difference between them in point of dignity and excellence. Is
it to be wondered, then, if our body puts on a more excellent
quality?</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f897</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>&#8220;</i>I do not teach that
anything will take place at the resurrection but what is already presented
before the eyes of all.&#8221; That such is the meaning of the words is clear
from the context. For whence and for what purpose would Paul make such a
transition, were he now comparing them with one another in respect of the
difference of their condition, while up to this point he has been comparing the
present condition of all with their future condition, and immediately proceeds
with that comparison?</font><br></div>

remaining, Paul explains himself, by unfolding the difference between their
present condition, and that which will be after the resurrection. What
connection, then, would there be in his discourse, if he had intended in the
first instance</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f898
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">to distinguish between the different degrees
of future glory among the saints? There can, therefore, be no doubt, that he has
been, up to this point, following out one subject. He now returns to the first
similitude that he had made use of, but applies it more closely to his design.
Or, if you prefer it, keeping up that similitude, he figuratively compares the
time of the present life to the seed-time, and the resurrection to the harvest;
and he says, that our body is now, indeed, subject to mortality and ignominy,
but will then be glorious and incorruptible. He says the same thing in other

things of a similar nature. Hence the weakness of <i>animation </i>is clearly
manifested. The energy of the Spirit, on the other hand, for <i>quickening,
</i>will be much more complete, and, consequently, exempted from necessities of
that nature. This is the simple and genuine meaning of the Apostle; that no one
may, by philosophizing farther, indulge in airy speculations, as those do, who
suppose that the substance of the body will be spiritual, while there is no
mention made here of substance, and no change will be made upon

2:7) &#8212; meaning, that his body was quickened by the soul, so that he became
a living man. It is asked, what is the meaning of the word <i>soul </i>here? It
is well known, that the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&ccedil;pn</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>(nephesh,) which </i>Moses makes use of, is taken in a variety of senses; but
in this passage it is taken to mean either vital motion, or the <i>very<sub>

that the same thing is affirmed as to beasts &#8212; that they were made <i>a
living soul,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
1:20, 24;) but as the soul of every animal must be judged of according to its
kind, there is nothing to hinder that a <i>soul, </i>that is to say, vital
motion, may be common to all; and yet at the same time the <i>soul </i>of man
may have something peculiar and distinguishing, namely, immortal <i>essence,
</i>as the light of intelligence and reason.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The last

phrase,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> It is
written</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>must be understood as referring
exclusively to the first clause; but after bringing forward this testimony of
Scripture, the Apostle now begins in his own person to draw a contrast between
Christ and Adam. <i>&#8220;Moses </i>relates that Adam was furnished with a
<i>living soul </i>Christ, on the other hand, is endowed with a <i>life-giving
Spirit. </i>Now it is a much greater thing to be <i>life, </i>or the <i>source
of life, </i>than simply to
<i>live.&#8221;</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f906</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i></font></sup><font face="Palatino">It
must be observed, however, that Christ did also, like us, become a <i>living
soul; </i>but, besides the <i>soul, </i>the Spirit of the Lord was also
poured-out upon him, that by his power he might rise again from the dead, and
raise up others, This, therefore, must be observed, in order that no one may
imagine, (as Apollinaris</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f907</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">did of
old,) that the Spirit was. in Christ in place of a soul. And independently of
this, the interpretation of this passage may be taken from the eighth chapter of
the Romans, where the Apostle declares, that <i>the body, indeed, is dead, on
account of sin, </i>and we <i>carry<sub> </sub></i>in us the elements of death;
but that <i>the Spirit of Christ, who raised him up from the dead, dwelleth also
in us, </i>and that he is life, to raise up us also one day from the dead.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:10, 11.) From this you see, that we have <i>living souls, </i>inasmuch as we
are men, but that we have the <i>life-giving Spirit </i>of Christ poured out
upon us by the grace of regeneration. In short, Paul&#8217;s meaning is, that
the condition that we obtain through Christ is greatly superior to the lot of
the <i>first man, </i>because a <i>living soul </i>was conferred upon Adam in
his own name, and in that of his posterity, but Christ has procured for us the
Spirit, who is <i>life.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now as to his calling Christ
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the last
Adam</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the reason is this, that as the
human race was created in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>first
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so it is renewed in Christ. I shall
express it again, and more distinctly: All men were created in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>first
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because, whatever God designed to
give to all, he conferred upon that one man, so that the condition of mankind
was settled in his person. He by his
fall</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f908</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">ruined
himself and those that were his, because he drew them all, along with himself,
into the same ruin: Christ came to restore our nature from ruin, and raise it up
to a better condition than ever.
They</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f909</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">are then,
as it were, two sources, or two roots of the human race. Hence it is not without
good reason, that the one is called the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>first
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and the other the <i>last.
</i>This, however, gives no support to those madmen, who make Christ to be one
of ourselves, as though there were and always had been only two men, and that
this multitude which we behold, were a mere phantom ! A similar comparison
occurs in

derive our origin from Adam, and resemble him. Let us, therefore, not wonder, if
we begin with the <i>living soul, </i>for as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>being

as Christ, the <i>heavenly man, </i>came after Adam. Now the Manichees perverted
this passage, with the view of proving that Christ brought a body from heaven
into the womb of the Virgin. They mistakingly imagined, however, that Paul
speaks here of the substance of the body, while he is discoursing rather as to
its condition, or quality. Hence, although the <i>first man </i>had an immortal
soul, and that too, not taken from the earth, yet he, nevertheless, savoured of
the earth, from which his body had sprung, and on which he had been appointed to
live. Christ, on the other hand, brought us from heaven a <i>life-giving Spirit,
</i>that he might regenerate us into a better life, and elevated above the
earth.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

comparison</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f912</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> requires this much, that Christ have his
body </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as the body of Adam was formed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the

man&#8217;s soul should be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
the earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but that Christ&#8217;s soul
had come forth from heaven. I answer, that Paul had not contrasted the two
departments of the subject with such refinement and minuteness, (for this was
not necessary;) but when treating of the nature of Christ and <i>Adam, </i>he
made a passing allusion to the creation of Adam, that he had been formed <i>from
the earth,, </i>and at the same time, for the purpose of commending
Christ&#8217;s excellence, he states, that he is the Son of God, who came down
to us from heaven, and brings with him, therefore, a heavenly nature and
influence. This is the simple meaning, while the refinement of the Manichees is
a mere calumny.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must, however, reply to another objection still.
For Christ, so long as he lived in the world, lived a life similar to ours, and
therefore earthly: hence it is not a proper contrast. The solution of this
question will serve farther to refute the
contrivance</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f913</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">of the
Manichees. For we know, that the body of Christ was liable to death, and that it
was exempted from corruption, not by its essential property, (as they
speak,)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f914</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">but solely
by the providence of God. Hence Christ was not merely <i>earthy </i>as to the
essence of his body, but was also for a time in an earthly condition; for before
Christ&#8217;s power could show itself in conferring the heavenly life, it was
necessary that he should die in the <i>weakness of the flesh,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;471304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 13:4.) Now this heavenly life appeared first in the resurrection,
that he might quicken us also.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>49.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As we have
borne</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some have thought, that there is
here an exhortation to a pious and holy life, into which Paul was led by way of
digression; and on that account they have changed the verb from the future tense
into the horta-tive mood. Nay more, in some Greek manuscripts the reading is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">fore&gt;swmen</font><font face="Palatino">

context.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f916</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us observe, in the first place, that
this is not an exhortation, but pure doctrine, and that he is not treating here
of newness of life, but pursues, without any interruption, the thread of his
discourse respecting the resurrection of the flesh. The meaning accordingly will
be this: &#8220;As<i> </i>the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>animal
nature</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which has the <i>precedency
</i>in us, is the image of Adam, so we shall be conformed to Christ in the

we <i>now </i>begin to bear the image of Christ, and are every day more and more
transformed into it;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f917</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but that image consists in spiritual
regeneration. But <i>then </i>it will be fully restored both in body and in
soul, and what is now begun will be perfected, and <i>accordingly </i>we will
obtain in reality what we as yet only hope for.&#8221; If, however, any one
prefers a different reading, this statement will serve to spur forward the
Corinthians; and if there had been a lively meditation of sincere piety and a
new life, it might have been the means of kindling up in them at the same time
the hope of heavenly glory.</font><br></div>

dead: <i>secondly, </i>he shows of what nature it will be. Now, however, he
enters more thoroughly into a description of the manner of it. This he calls a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mystery</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because it had not been as yet so clearly unfolded in any statement of
revelation; but he does this to make them more attentive. For that wicked
doctrine had derived strength from the circumstance, that they disputed as to
this matter carelessly and at their
ease;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

were a matter in which they felt no difficulty. Hence by the term

them, but ought to be reckoned among God&#8217;s heavenly

conjecture, had arisen from this &#8212; that some readers, who were not the

conjecture a reading which was more approved by
them.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

interpret to mean &#8212; the glory that the sons of God alone will obtain. The

<div><font face="Palatino">Paul&#8217;s intention is to explain what he had said

believers; for although the resurrection of the wicked will also involve
<i>change, </i>yet as there is no mention made of them here, we must consider
everything that is said, as referring exclusively to the elect. We now see, how
well this statement corresponds with the preceding one, for as he had said, that

difficult to unravel it in this way &#8212; that as a <i>change </i>cannot take
place without doing away with the previous system, that <i>change </i>is
reckoned, with good reason, a kind of <i>death; </i>but, as it is not a
separation of the soul from the body, it is not looked upon as an ordinary
death. It will then be <i>death, </i>inasmuch as it will be the destruction of
corruptible nature: it will not be a <i>sleep, </i>inasmuch as the soul will not
quit the body; but there will be a sudden transition from corruptible nature

take place in the Church before Christ&#8217;s coming.

the Corinthians, as it were, into immediate contact with the event, associate
himself and them with those who would at that time be alive.</font><br></div>

previously be delivered from corruption. Our nature then, as being now
corruptible and mortal, is not admissible into the kingdom of God, but when it
shall have put off corruption, and shall have been beautified with
in-corruption, it will then make its way into it. This passage, too, distinctly
proves, that we shall rise again in that same flesh that we now carry about with
us, as the Apostle assigns a new quality to it which will serve as a garment. If
he had said, <i>This corruptible must be renewed, </i>the error of those
fanatics, who imagine that mankind will be furnished with new bodies, would not
have been so plainly or forcibly overthrown. Now, however, when he declares that
<i>this corruptible shall be invested with glory, </i>there is no room left for
cavil.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>54.

also, is necessary. To <i>come to pass, </i>is used here in the sense of being

daily, too, receiving further accomplishment; but it will not have its complete
fulfillment until the last day.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It does not, however, appear quite manifest, from
what passage he has taken this quotation, for many statements occur in the
Prophets to this effect. Only the probability is, that the first clause is taken
either from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
25:8, where it is said that <i>death will be for ever destroyed </i>by the
Lord,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f929</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">or, (as
almost all are rather inclined to think,) from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;281314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
13:14, where the Prophet, bewailing the obstinate wickedness of Israel,
complains that he was like an untimely child, that struggles against the efforts
of his mother in travail, that he may not <i>come </i>forth from the womb, and
from this he concludes, that it was owing entirely to himself, that he was not
delivered from death. <i>I will ransom them, </i>says he, from <i>the power of
the grave: I will rescue them from death. </i>It matters not, whether you read
these words in the future of the indicative, or in the
subjunctive</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f930
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">for in either way the meaning amounts to this
&#8212; that God was prepared to confer upon them salvation, if they would have
allowed the favor to be conferred upon them, and that, therefore, if they
perished, it was their own fault.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> I will be thy destruction,
O death! thy ruin, O grave</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>!</i> In these
words God intimates, that he accomplishes the salvation of his
people</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f931</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">only when
death and the grave are reduced to nothing. For no one will deny, that in that
passage there is a description of completed salvation. As, therefore, we do not
see such a destruction of death, it follows, that we do not yet enjoy that
complete salvation, which God promises to his people, and that, consequently, it
is delayed until </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that day.
Then</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>accordingly,
<i>will</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> death be swallowed
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, it will be reduced to
nothing,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

complete victory over it.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f933</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the second clause, in which he triumphs over
death and the grave, it is not certain whether he speaks of himself, or whether
he meant there also to quote the words of the Prophet. For where we render it,
&#8220;I will be thy destruction, O death ! &#8212; thy ruin, O grave
<i>!&#8221; </i>the Greeks have translated it, &#8220;Where,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O death, is thy
suit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f934</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>where, O grave, thy
sting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?&#8221; </i>Now although this mistake
of the Greeks is excusable from the near resemblance of the
words,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f935</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">yet if any
one will attentively examine the context, he will see that they have gone quite
away from the Prophet&#8217;s intention. The true meaning, then, will be this
&#8212; that the Lord will put an end to death, and destroy the grave. It is
possible, however, that, as the Greek translation was in common use, Paul
alluded to it, and in that there is nothing inconsistent, though he has not
quoted literally, for instead of <i>victory </i>he has used the term <i>action,
</i>or <i>law-suit.</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f936</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I am certainly of opinion, that
the Apostle did not deliberately intend to call in the Prophet as a witness,
with the view of making a wrong.use of his authority, but simply accommodated,
in passing, to his own use a sentiment that had come into common use, as being,
independently of this, of a pious
nature.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f937A</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The main thing is this &#8212; that
Paul, by an exclamation of a spirited nature, designed to rouse up the minds of
the Corinthians, and lead them on, as it were, to a near view of the
resurrection. Now, although we do not as yet behold the victory with our eyes,
and the day of triumph has not yet arrived, (nay more, the dangers of war must
every day be encountered,) yet the assurance of faith, as we shall have occasion
to observe ere long, is not at all thereby diminished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>56.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The sting of death is
sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In other words, &#8220;Death has no
dart with which to wound us except
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>since
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>proceeds from the anger of God. Now it is only with our sins that God is
angry. Take away sin, therefore, and death will no more be able to harm
us.&#8221; This agrees with what he said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450623&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:23, that <i>the wages of sin is death. </i>Here, however, he makes use of
another metaphor, for he compared sin to a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>with which alone death is armed for inflicting upon us a deadly wound. Let
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>be taken away, and death is disarmed, so as to be no longer hurtful. Now
with what view Paul says this, will be explained by him ere
long.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The strength of sin is the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is the law of God that imparts
to that sting its deadly power, because it does not merely discover our guilt,
but even increases it. A clearer exposition of this statement may be found in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:9, where Paul teaches us that we
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>are
alive</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so long as we are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>without the
law,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because in our own opinion it is
well with us, and we do not feel our own misery, until the law summons us to the
judgment of God, and wounds our conscience with an apprehension of eternal
death. Farther, he teaches us that sin has been in a manner lulled asleep, but
is kindled up by the law, so as to rage furiously. Meanwhile, however, he
vindicates the law from calumnies, on the ground that it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>holy, and good, and
just</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and is not of itself the parent of
sin or the cause of death. Hence he concludes, that whatever there is of evil is
to be reckoned to our own account, inasmuch as it manifestly
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>proceeds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>from the depravity of our nature. Hence the law is but the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>occasion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of injury. The true
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cause</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of ruin is in ourselves. Hence he speaks of the law here as the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strength or
power</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of sin, because it executes upon
us the judgment of God. In the mean time he does not deny, that sin inflicts
death even upon those that know not the law; but he speaks in this manner,
because it exercises its tyranny upon them with less violence. For the <i>law
came that sin might abound,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:20,) or that it <i>might become beyond measure sinful.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>57.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But thanks be to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>From this it appears, why it it was
that he made mention both of sin and of the law, when treating of death. Death
has no
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>with which to wound except
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and the law imparts to this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>a deadly power. But Christ has conquered sin, and by conquering it has
procured victory for us, and has <i>redeemed us from the curse of the law.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:13.) Hence it follows, that we are no longer lying under the power of death.
Hence, although we have not as yet a full discovery of those benefits, yet we
may already with confidence glory in them, because it is necessary that what has
been accomplished in the Head should be accomplished, also, in the members. We
may, therefore, triumph over death as subdued, because Christ&#8217;s victory is
ours.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, therefore, he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>victory has been given to
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>you are to understand by this in the
<i>first </i>place, that it is inasmuch as Christ has in his own person
abolished sin, has satisfied the law, has endured the curse, has appeased :the
anger of God, and has procured life; and farther, because he has already begun
to make us partakers of all those benefits. For though we still carry about with
us the remains of sin, it, nevertheless, does not reign in us: though it still
<i>stings </i>us, it does not do so fatally, because its edge is blunted, so
that it does not penetrate into the vitals of the soul. Though the law still
threatens, yet there is presented to us on the other hand, the liberty that was
procured for us by Christ, which is an antidote to its terrors. Though the
remains of sin still dwell in us, yet the Spirit who raised up Christ from the
dead is <i>life, because of righteousness.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:10.) Now follows the conclusion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>58.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore, my
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Having satisfied himself that
he had sufficiently proved the doctrine of the resurrection, he now closes his
discussion with an exhortation; and this has much more force, than if he had
made use of a simple conclusion with an affirmation.

he says that <i>their labor is not in vain, </i>for this reason, that there is a
reward laid up for them with God. This is that exclusive hope which, in the
first instance, encourages believers, and afterwards sustains them, so that they
do not stop short in the race. Hence he exhorts them to remain <i>steadfast,
</i>because they rest on a firm foundation, as they know that a better life is
prepared for them in heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds &#8212;<i>

1:10. For amidst so many occasions of offense as constantly present themselves
to us, who is there that would not despond, or turn aside from the way, were it
not that, by thinking of a better life he is by this means kept in the fear of
God? Now, on the other hand, he intimates, that if the hope of a resurrection is
taken away, then, the foundation (as it were) being rooted up, the whole

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But concerning the
collection</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Luke relates
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
11:28) that the prediction of Agabus, foretelling that there would be a famine
under Claudius Caesar, gave occasion for alms being collected by the saints,
with the view of affording help to the brethren in Jerusalem. For though the
Prophet had foretold, that this calamity would be generally prevalent almost
throughout the world, yet as they were more heavily oppressed with penury at
Jerusalem, and as all the Gentile Churches were bound, if they would not be held
guilty of very great ingratitude, to afford aid to that place from which they
had received the gospel, every one, consequently, forgetful of self, resolved to
afford relief to Jerusalem. That the pressure of want was felt heavily at
Jerusalem, appears from the Epistle to the Galatians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
2:10,) where Paul relates, that he had been charged by the Apostles to stir up
the Gentiles to afford help.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f938</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">Now the
Apostles would never have given such a charge, had they not been constrained by
necessity. Farther, this passage is an evidence of the truth of what Paul states
there also &#8212; that he had been careful to exhort the Gentiles to afford
help in such a case of necessity. Now, however, he prescribes the method of
relief; and that the Corinthians may accede to it the more readily, he mentions
that he had already prescribed it to the Churches of Galatia; for they would
necessarily be the more influenced by example, as we are wont to feel a natural
backwardness to anything that is not ordinarily practiced. Now follows the
method &#8212; by which he designed to cut off all hinderances and
impediments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On one of the
Sabbaths.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The end is this &#8212; that
they may have their alms ready in time. He therefore exhorts them not to wait
till he came, as anything that is done suddenly, and in a bustle, is not done
well, but to contribute on the Sabbath what might seem good, and according as
every one&#8217;s ability might enable &#8212; that is, on the day on which they
held their sacred assemblies. The clause rendered on
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one of the
Sabbaths</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
(</i></font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kata&lt; mi&gt;an
sabba&gt;twn</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,) </i>Chrysostom explains to
<i>mean &#8212; the first Sabbath. </i>In this I do not agree with him; for Paul
means rather that they should contribute, one on one Sabbath and another on
another; or even each of them every Sabbath, if they chose. For he has an eye,
first of all, to convenience, and farther, that the sacred assembly, in which
the communion of saints is celebrated, might be an additional spur to them. Nor
am I more inclined to admit the view taken by Chrysostom &#8212; that the term
<i>Sabbath </i>is employed here to mean the <i>Lord&#8217;s day,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;660110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Revelation
1:10,) for the probability is, that the Apostles, at the beginning, retained the
day that was already in use, but that afterwards, constrained by the
superstition of the <i>Jews, </i>they set aside that day, and substituted
another. Now the <i>Lord&#8217;s day </i>was made choice of, chiefly because our
Lord&#8217;s <i>resurrection </i>put an end to the shadows of the law. Hence the
day itself puts us in mind of our Christian liberty. We may, however, very
readily infer from this passage, that believers have always had a certain day of
rest from labor &#8212; not as if the worship of God consisted in idleness, but
because it is of importance for the common harmony, that a certain day should be
appointed for holding sacred assemblies, as they cannot be held every day. For
as to Paul&#8217;s forbidding elsewhere
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:10) that any distinction should be made between one day and another, <i>that

Corinthians, that whatever they might contribute for the saints would be their
best and safest <i>treasure. </i>For if a heathen poet could say &#8212;

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;201917&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.

we know for certain, that what we give is well laid out, he points out to the
Corinthians a method, by which they may be assured of a good and faithful
administration &#8212; by selecting approved persons, to whom they may intrust
the matter. Nay more, he offers his own services, if desired, which is an
evidence that he has the matter at heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When I shall pass through
Macedonia</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The common opinion is, that
this espisle was sent from Philippi. Persons coming thence to Corinth by land,
required to pass through Macedonia; for that colony is situated in the farthest
extremity, towards the Emathian mountains. Paul, it is true, might, instead of
going by land, have gone thither by sea, but he was desirous to visit the
Macedonian Churches, that he might confirm them in passing. So much for the
common opinion. To me, however, it appears more probable, that the epistle was
written at Ephesus; for he says a little afterwards, that <i>he will remain
there until Pentecost,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 16:8)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

the name of the Philippians, but of the <i>Asiatics.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461619&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 16:19.)</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f946</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">Besides, in
the second epistle he explicitly states, that, after he had sent away this
epistle, he passed over into Macedonia.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:13.) Now after passing through Macedonia, he would be at a
distance from Ephesus, and in the neighborhood of Achaia. Hence I have no doubt
that he was at Ephesus at that time: <i>thence </i>he could sail by a straight
course to Achaia. For visiting Macedonia, a long circuit was needed, and a more
disagreeable route. Accordingly he lets them know that he will not come to them
by a direct course, as he required to <i>go
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through
Macedonia</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the Corinthians, however, he promises something
farther &#8212; that he would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make a longer stay with
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this he shows his affection
towards them. For what reason had he for delay, except that he was concerned as
to their welfare? On the other hand, he lets them know how fully assured he is
of their affection towards him in return, by taking it, as it were, for granted
that he would be conducted forward by them in the way of kindness; for he says
this from <i>confidence </i>in their
friendship.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

saints ought to follow up all their plans and deliberations; for it is an
instance of great rashness to undertake and determine many things for the
future, while we have not even a moment in our power. The main thing indeed is,
that, in the inward affection of the mind, we submit to God and his providence,
whatever we resolve upon;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will

argued above, that this epistle was sent from Ephesus, rather than from
Philippi. For the probability is, that the Apostle speaks of the place in which
he was at the time, and not of a place, in going to which he would require to
make a long circuit; and farther, in passing through
Macedonia,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f952</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">it would
have been necessary to leave Corinth when already in the neighborhood of it, and
cross the sea in order to reach Ephesus. He accordingly tells them beforehand
that he will </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remain at Ephesus
until Pentecost</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>adding the reason
&#8212; in order that they may wait for him the more patiently. Erasmus has
preferred to render <i>it &#8212; until the fiftieth day, </i>influenced by
frivolous conjectures rather than by any solid argument. He objects, that there
was as yet no day of Pentecost appointed among Christians, as it is now
celebrated; and this I grant. He says, that it ought not to be understood as
referring to the Jewish solemnity, because in various instances he annuls and
condemns the superstitious observance of days.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:10;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451405&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:16, 17.) I do not concede to him, however, that Paul celebrated that day at
Ephesus from being influenced by a superstitious regard to the day, but because
there would be a larger assembly at that time, and tie hoped that, in that way,
an opportunity would be presented to him of propagating the gospel. Thus, when
he was hastening forward to Jerusalem, he assigned as the reason of his haste,
<i>that he might arrive there at Pentecost,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;442016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
20:16;) but while others presented themselves there for the purpose of
sacrificing according to the ritual of the law, he himself had another object in
view &#8212; that his ministry might be the more useful in proportion to the
largeness of the attendance. It were, however, an excessively poor meaning to
understand Paul here as simply specifying fifty days. Besides, when he expressly
says </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">th&lt;n
penthkosth&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino"> <i>(the Pentecost,) </i>he cannot
but be understood as speaking of a particular day. As to this festival, see

is afforded him there of furthering the gospel; and 2dly, Because, in
consequence of the great number of <i>adversaries </i>that were there, his
presence was particularly required. &#8220;I shall do much good by prolonging my
stay here for a little while, and were I absent, Satan would do much
injury.&#8221; In the first clause, he makes use of a metaphor that is quite in
common use, when he employs the term

them, but because he would have enemies of
Christ</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f955</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">to oppose
him. He wishes, therefore, that they should carefully take heed that no injury
be done to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds the reason &#8212; for he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>worketh the work of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence we infer, that the Church of
Christ ought to be concerned for the preservation of the lives of ministers. And
assuredly, it is reasonable, that, in proportion as an individual is endowed
with superior gifts for the edification of believers, and applies himself to it
the more strenuously, his life ought to be so. much dearer to
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The clause &#8212;<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as I also

despise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>him &#8212; perhaps because he
was as yet of a youthful age, which usually draws forth less respect. He wishes
them, therefore, to take care, that there be no hinderance in the way of this
faithful minister of Christ being held in due esteem &#8212; unless, perhaps, it
be that Paul reckoned this very thing to be an evidence of contempt, if they
were not concerned, as it became them to be, in reference to his life. This
injunction, however, appears to include something farther, that they should not
undervalue Timothy, from ignorance of his worth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>third </i>place, he charges them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>conduct him forward in

states the reason of this, in order that the Corinthians may not suspect that he
had been hindered by him. For the better he was known by them, they were so much
the more favourably disposed towards him, and they would be the more ready to

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Watch
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino">. A short exhortation, but of great weight.
He exhorts them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>watch</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in order that Satan may not oppress them, finding them off their guard. For
as the warfare is incessant, the <i>watching </i>requires to be incessant too.
Now watchfulness of spirit is this &#8212; when, free and disentangled from
earthly cares, we meditate on the things of God. For as the body is weighed down
by <i>surfeiting and drunkenness,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422134&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
21:34,) so as to be fit for nothing, so the cares and lusts of the world,
idleness or carelessness, are like a spiritual surfeiting that overpowers the
mind.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f958</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>second </i>thing is that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>persevere in the
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or that they hold fast the faith,
so as to <i>stand firm; </i>because that is the foundation on which we rest. It
is certain, however, that he points out the means of perseverance &#8212; by
resting upon God with a firm faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>third </i>exhortation, which is much of the
same nature, he stirs them up to manly fortitude. And, as we are naturally weak,
he exhorts them <i>fourthly to </i>strengthen themselves, or gather strength.
For where we render it <i>be strong, </i>Paul makes use of only one word, which
is equivalent to <i>strengthen yourselves.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let all your things be done
in love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Again he repeats what is the
rule in all those transactions, in which we have dealings with one another. He
wishes, then, that <i>love </i>shall be the directress; because the Corinthians
erred chiefly in this respect &#8212; that every one looked to himself without
caring for others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye know the house of
Stephanas</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We know, from daily
experience, of what advantage it is, that those should have the highest
authority, whom God has adorned with the most distinguished gifts. Accordingly,
if we wish to secure the welfare of the Church, let us always take care that
honor be conferred upon the good: let their counsels have the greatest weight;
let others give way to them, and allow themselves to be governed by their
prudence. This Paul does in this instance, when admonishing the Corinthians to
show respect to the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>house of
Stephanas</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some manuscripts add,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
Fortunatus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f959 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">For God manifests himself to us when he
shows us the gifts of his Spirit. Hence, if we would not appear to be despisers
of God, let us voluntarily </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>submit
ourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to those, on whom God has
conferred superior gifts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, that they may be the more inclined to put honor
upon <i>that house, </i>(for as to the other, it appears to me to be, in this
place at least, a spurious addition,) he reminds them that they were the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>first-fruits of
Achaia</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, that the household of
Stephanas were the first that had embraced the gospel. Not indeed as though the
first in order of time were in every case superior to the others, but where
there is perseverance along with this, it is with good reason, that honor is
conferred upon those, who have in a manner paved the way for the gospel by
promptitude of faith. It must be observed, however, that he dignifies with this
honorable title those, who had consecrated to believers their services and
resources. For the same reason, he bestows commenda &#8212; tion a little
afterwards upon Fortunatus and Achaicus, that, in proportion to a man&#8217;s
superiority of excellence,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f960</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">he might be
held so much the more in esteem, that he might be able to do the more good.
Farther, in order that the Corinthians may be the more disposed to love them, he
says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>what </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had been
wanting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>on the part of their entire
Church </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had been
compensated</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> for </i>by their vicarious
services.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With the Church that is in
their house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>A magnificent eulogium,
inasmuch as the name of the Church is applied to a single family! At the same
time it is befitting, that all the families of the pious should be regulated in
such a manner as to be so many little Churches. As to the term <i>Congregation,
</i>which Erasmus has used in preference, it is foreign to Paul&#8217;s design;
for it was not his intention to designate a crowd of persons by a mere common
term, but to speak in honorable terms of the management of a Christian
household. His saluting them in the name of Aquila and Priscilla, confirms what
I have noticed above &#8212; that the Epistle was written at Ephesus, not at
Philippi. For Luke informs us, that they remained at Ephesus, when Paul went
elsewhere.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Salute one another with a
holy kiss.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The practice of kissing was
very common among the Jews, as is manifest from the Scriptures. In <i>Greece,
</i>though it was not so common and customary, it was by no means unknown; but
the probability is, that Paul speaks here of a solemn kiss, with which they
saluted each other in the sacred assembly. For I could easily believe, that from
the times of the Apostles a kiss was used in connection with the administration
of the Supper;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f961</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in place of which, among nations that
were somewhat averse to the practice of kissing, there crept in the custom of
kissing the patine.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f962</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">However
this may be, as it was a token of mutual love. I have no doubt, that Paul meant
to exhort them to the cultivation of good-will among themselves &#8212; not
merely in their minds</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f963</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and in needful services, but also by
that token, provided only it was <i>holy, </i>that is, neither unchaste nor
deceitful,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f964</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; though, at the same time,
<i>holy </i>may be taken to mean <i>sacred.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any man love not the Lord
Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The close of the Epistle consists
of <i>three </i>parts. He entreats the grace of Christ in behalf of the
Corinthians: he makes a declaration of his love towards them, and, with the
severest threatening, he inveighs against those that falsely took upon
themselves the Lord&#8217;s name, while not loving him from the heart. For he is
not speaking of strangers, who avowedly hated the Christian name, but of
pretenders and hypocrites, who troubled the Churches for the sake of their own
belly, or from empty boasting.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f965</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">On such
persons he denounces an anathema, and he also pronounces a curse upon them. It
is not certain, however, whether he desires their destruction in the presence of
God, or whether he wishes to render them odious &#8212; nay, even execrable, in
the view of believers. Thus in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
1:8, when pronouncing one who corrupts the Gospel to.be
<i>accursed,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"> f966
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">he does not mean that he was rejected or
condemned by God, but he declares that he is to be abhorred by us. I expound it
in a simple way as follows: &#8220;Let them perish and be cut off, as being the
pests of the Church.&#8221; And truly, there is nothing that is more pernicious,
than that class of persons, who prostitute a profession of piety to their own
depraved affections. Now he points out the origin of this evil, when he says,
that they do not love Christ, for a sincere and earnest love to Christ will not
suffer us to give occasion of offense to
brethren.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f967</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he immediately <i>adds &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Maranatha</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is somewhat more difficult. Almost all of the ancients are agreed, that they
are Syriac terms.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f968</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>Jerome, </i>however, explains it:
<i>The Lord cometh; </i>while others render it, <i>At the coming of the Lord,
</i>or, <i>Until the Lord comes. </i>Every one, however, I think, must see how
silly and puerile is the idea, that the Apostle spoke to Greeks in the Syriac
tongue, when meaning to say <i>&#8212; The Lord has come. </i>Those who
translate it, <i>at the coming of the Lord, </i>do so on mere conjecture; and
besides, there is not much plausibility in that interpretation. How much more
likely it is, that this was a customary form of expression among the Hebrews,
when they wished to excommunicate any one. For the Apostles never speak in
foreign tongues, except when they repeat anything in the person of another, as
for example, <i>Eli, Eli, lammah sabathani,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402746&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
27:46,) <i>Talitha cumi,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;410541&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
5:41,) and <i>Ephphata,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;410734&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
7:34,) or when they make use of a word that has come into common use, as <i>Amen
&#8212; Hosanna. </i>Let us see, then, whether <i>Maranatha </i>suits with
excommunication. Now Bullinger,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f969</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">on the
authority of Theodore Bibliander, has affirmed, that, in the Chaldee dialect,
<i>Maharamata </i>has the same meaning as the Hebrew term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rj</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>cherem, (accursed,)</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f970</font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i></font></sup><font face="Palatino">and
I was myself at one time assured of the same thing by Wolfgang
Capito,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f971</font><font face="Palatino"> </font></sup><font face="Palatino">a man of
blessed memory<sub>. </sub>It is nothing unusual, however, for the Apostles to
write such terms differently from the way in which they are pronounced in the
language from which they are derived; as may be seen even from the instances
brought forward above. Paul, then, after pronouncing an anathema on those who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do not love
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
f972 </font></sup><font face="Palatino">deeply affected with the seriousness of
the matter, as if he reckoned that he had not said enough, added a term that was
in common use among the Jews, and which they made use of in pronouncing a
sentence of anathema &#8212; just as if, speaking in Latin, I should say,
&#8220;I<i> </i>excommunicate thee,&#8221; but if I add &#8212; &#8220;and
pronounce thee an anathema,&#8221; this would be an expression of more intense
feeling.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">

<div><font face="Palatino">THE EPISTLES OF PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS contain more
of admonition and reproof than most of his other Epistles. While THE CHURCH OF
CORINTH was more than ordinarily distinguished in respect of spiritual gifts, it
had fallen into corruptions and abuses, from which the other Churches appear to
have been, to a great extent, free. There is, accordingly &#8212; as might be
expected &#8212; in these Epistles, more frequent reference to local evils, than
in most of the other Epistles of the New Testament. They are not, however, on
that account the less adapted for general utility. While the reproofs which they
contain were occasioned by the corrupt state of a particular Church, they will
be found to involve general principles of the highest importance to the Church
of Christ under all circumstances. The Epistles to the Corinthians
&#8220;have,&#8221; says Dr. Guyse, in his Preface to the <i>Second </i>Epistle,
&#8220;some<i> </i>advantages that are not to be met with in any other part of
the word of God, as they may be deemed the seat of divine directions, relating
to the spiritual privileges, rights, and powers, worship and discipline of the
Churches of Christ; to the purity of doctrines, manners, and celebrations of
Gospel ordinances; and to the unity, peace, and order, mutual watch and care,<i>
</i>and religious respect<i> </i>to faithful pastors, that ought to be preserved
among them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, in the perusal of the four Gospels, the attentive
reader can scarcely fail to observe, that many of the instructive sayings of our
blessed Lord, which are placed on record by the Evangelists, arose naturally out
of occurrences<i> </i>of an accidental nature, &#8212; though taking place under
the watchful superintendence of him</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">without whom not even a
sparrow falleth on the
ground,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401029&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
10:29,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8212; so we find a large portion of the invaluable
directions furnished in the Epistles of the New Testament for the regulation of
the Church in every subsequent age, presented <i>incidentally</i> &#8212; as if
suggested to the mind of the sacred writer by corruptions of doctrine and
practice, into which some particular Church in the primitive age had been left
to fall. While the unhappily corrupt state of the Church of Corinth, as
indicated in the two Epistles addressed to it, tended to mar, in no
inconsiderable degree, the prosperity of the cause of Christ in that city, and
was an occasion of poignant grief to the mind of Paul, who felt the more
solicitous for their welfare from his sustaining to them the relationship
&#8212; not simply of an <i>instructor, </i>but of <i>a father,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:15,) the flagrant abuses which had crept in among them were, in
the providence of God, overruled for good to the Church of Christ generally, by
giving occasion for a fuller development than might otherwise have been
necessary, of some of the most important principles of practical
Christianity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Epistles to the Church of Corinth are a portion
of Paul&#8217;s writings, which, as is justly observed by DR. ALEXANDER, in his
Preface to BILLROTH on the Corinthians, &#8220;occupies a very important place
in the sacred canon. Besides containing some <i>loca classica </i>upon several
of the most essential positions in doctrinal theology, such, for instance, as
the deity of Christ, the personality and agency of the Holy Spirit, the
resurrection of the body, etc., the two Epistles to the Corinthians may be
regarded as constituting the great code<i> </i>of practical ethics for the
Christian Church. In this respect they stand to the science of practical
theology in a relation analogous to that occupied by the Epistles to the Romans,
the Galatians, and the Hebrews, to the science of systematic divinity; they
contain the fullest development of those principles on which that science must
rest, and the practices which its rules are to authorize or inculcate.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f1</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What increases not a little the utility of
Paul&#8217;s Epistles to the Corinthian Church is the circumstance that the
<i>latter </i>Epistle was written by him a considerable time (about a year, it
is generally supposed) subsequently to the <i>former, </i>when opportunity had
been given for the Apostle&#8217;s receiving accounts as to the effect produced
upon the minds of the Corinthians by the faithful, though at the same time
affectionate counsels and admonitions, which he had addressed to them in his
<i>first </i>Epistle. The Apostle had been intensely anxious as to the effect,
which his former Epistle might produce on the minds of the Corinthians. While
his authority as an Apostle, and that too in a Church which he had himself
planted, was at stake, he was, we may believe, chiefly concerned for the purity
of doctrine and discipline, as in danger of being seriously impaired by the
corrupt state of the Church of Corinth. With feelings of deep solicitude he left
Ephesus, where it is generally believed he wrote his <i>first </i>Epistle to the
Corinthian Church, and proceeded to Troas, a sea-port town on the coast of the
AEgean Sea, hoping to meet with Titus there on his return from Corinth.
Disappointed in this expectation, he went forward to Macedonia, where he at
length met with Titus, and received most gratifying accounts as to the favorable
reception, which his former Epistle had met with from the Corinthians, and the
salutary effect which it had produced in remedying, to a great extent., the
evils that he had found occasion to censure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must have afforded to the mind of the Apostle no
ordinary satisfaction to learn, that his admonitions and reproofs had awakened
in the minds of the Corinthians the most poignant grief in reflecting on the
unworthy part which they had acted &#8212; that they had manifested unabated
esteem and affection toward him as their spiritual father &#8212; that they had,
in accordance with his instructions, excluded from their society a gross
offender, whose unnatural crime they had too long connived at; and farther, that
the exercise of discipline in that painful case had been most salutary in its
effects upon the offender himself, so that the Apostle, from what he had learned
as to the evidences of repentance, was now prepared to instruct the Corinthian
Christians to receive him back, without hesitation or delay, into their
fellowship. He had, also, the satisfaction of learning, that his exhortations,
in the close of his former Epistle, to liberality in contributing for the relief
of the &#8220;poor<i> </i>saints at Jerusalem,&#8221; had been promptly and
cheerfully responded to. While Paul&#8217;s <i>second </i>Epistle to the
Corinthians furnishes in these and other respects, express proofs of the
beneficial effects of his <i>former </i>Epistle, his entire silence in the
<i>latter </i>Epistle in reference to various evils unsparingly censured by him
in the <i>former, </i>gives reason to believe that, in connection with these
also, a more hopeful state of matters had begun to appear. Among these we may
notice their party contendings, their vexatious lawsuits, their corrupt
administration of the Sacred Supper, their disorderly exercise of spiritual
gifts, and, in fine, their erroneous views on the important subject of the
resurrection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus &#8220;the<i> </i>success&#8221; of the first
Epistle to the Corinthians, as is justly observed by BARNES, in the Introduction
to his Notes on that Epistle, &#8220;was<i> </i>all that Paul could desire. It
had the effect to repress their growing strifes, to restrain their disorders, to
produce true repentance, and to remove the person who had been guilty of incest
in the Church. The whole Church was deeply affected with his reproofs, and
engaged in hearty zeal in the work of reform.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:9-11.) The authority of the Apostle was recognised, and his
Epistle read with fear and trembling.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:15.) The act of discipline which he had required on the incestuous
person was inflicted by the whole Church.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:6.) The collection which he had desired,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 16:1-4,) and in regard to which he had boasted of their liberality
to others, and expressed the utmost confidence that it would be liberal,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470902&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 9:2, 3,) was taken up agreeably to his wishes, and their disposition
on the subject was such as to furnish the highest satisfaction to his mind.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:13, 14.) Of the success of his letter, however, and of their
disposition to take up the collection, Paul was not apprised until he had gone
into Macedonia, where Titus came to him, and gave him information of the happy
state of things in the Church at Corinth.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470704&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:4-7, 13.) Never was a letter more effectual than this was, and
never was authority in discipline exercised in a more happy and successful
way.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, Paul&#8217;s <i>second </i>Epistle
to the Corinthian Church is of a mixed character, being designed in part to
rectify evils still existing among them, and to vindicate the Apostle from
injurious aspersions, thrown out against him by the false teachers. In various
parts of the Epistle, but more particularly toward the close, he establishes his
claims to apostolical authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A succinct view of the general tenor and design of
this Epistle is given by POOLE, in his Annotations, in the following terms:<i>
&#8212; &#8221; </i>The occasion of his&#8221; (Paul&#8217;s) &#8220;writing<i>
</i>this second Epistle seemeth to be partly the false teachers aspersing
him:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>1.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
As an <i>inconstant man, </i>because he had promised to come in person to
Corinth, and was not yet come; the reason of which he showeth, 1 Corinthians 1,
was not levity, but the troubles he met with in Asia, and his desire to hear
that they had first reformed the abuses he had taxed them for.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
As an <i>imperious man, </i>because of the incestuous person against whom he had
wrote; which charge he avoids, by showing the necessity of his writing in that
manner, and giving new orders for the restoring him, upon the repentance he had
showed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
As a <i>proud </i>and <i>vain-glorious man.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino">
As a <i>contemptible person &#8212; base in his person, </i>as he expresseth it.
The further occasions of his writing were &#8212; to commend them for their kind
reception of, and compliance with, the precepts and admonitions of his former
Epistle, and their kind reception of Titus &#8212; as also to exhort them to a
liberal contribution to the necessities of the saints in Judea, to which they
had showed their forwardness a year before; and his hearing that there was yet a
party amongst them bad enough, that went on vilifying him and his authority, as
well as in other sinful courses; against whom he vindicateth himself, magnifying
his office, assuring them that he was about to come to Corinth, when they should
find him present, such as being absent he had by his letters declared<i>
</i>himself, if they were not reformed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;The substance, therefore, of this Epistle, is
partly <i>apologetical, </i>or <i>excusatory, </i>where he excuseth himself for
his not coming to Corinth so soon as he thought, and for his so severe writing
as to the incestuous person &#8212; partly <i>hortatory, </i>where he persuadeth
them <i>more generally </i>to<i> </i>walk worthy of the gospel; <i>more
specially
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460809&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 8:9) to a liberal contribution to the saints &#8212; partly
<i>minatory </i>or <i>threatening, </i>where he threateneth severity against
those whom, when he came amongst them, he should find contumacious and
impenitent offenders. He concludes the Epistle (as usually) with a salutation of
them, pious exhortations to them, and a prayer for them.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">CALVIN, it will be observed, dedicates his Commentary
on the <i>second </i>Epistle to the Corinthians to MELCHIOR WOLMAR, a man of
great celebrity, under whom CALVIN acquired a knowledge of the Greek language.
&#8220;The<i> </i>academy of Bourges,&#8221; says BEZA, in his Life of Calvin,
&#8220;had... acquired great celebrity through ANDREW ALCIAT, (undoubtedly the
first lawyer of his age,) who had been invited to it from Italy. CALVIN thought
right to study under him also. He accordingly went thither, and on grounds both
religious and literary, formed a friendship with MELCHIOR WOLMAR, a German from
Rothweil, and professor of Greek. I have the greater pleasure in mentioning his
name, because he was my own teacher, and the only one I had from boyhood up to
youth. His learning, piety, and other virtues, together with his admirable
abilities as a teacher of youth, cannot be sufficiently praised. On his
suggestion, and with his assistance, CALVIN learned Greek. The recollection of
the benefit which he thus received from WOLMAR he afterwards publicly testified,
by dedicating to him his Commentary on the First&#8221; (<i>Second</i>)<i>
</i>&#8220;Epistle to the Corinthians.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f2</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The circumstances connected with his attendance on
the instructions of that distinguished teacher are interesting, as giving
occasion to mark the leadings of providence in preparing CALVIN for the
important work, which was afterwards assigned him in the Church of Christ. His
father had originally intended him for the ministry, and procured for him a
benefice in the cathedral church of Noyon, and afterwards the rectory of
Pont-Eveque, the birthplace of his father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Not long afterwards, however, his father resolved to
send him to study civil law, as a more likely means of worldly preferment, while
in the mean time CALVIN, having been made acquainted with the doctrines of the
reformed faith by one of his own relations, PETER ROBERT OLIVET, had begun to
feel dissatisfied with the Romish Church, and had left off attendance on the
public services of the Church. With the view of devoting himself to the study of
law, he removed to Orleans, and placed himself under the tuition of PETER DE
L&#8217;ETOILE, a French lawyer of great celebrity, and made in a short time
surprising progress, so that very frequently, in the absence of the professors,
he supplied their place, and was regarded as a teacher rather than a pupil. He
afterwards went to Bourges, with the view of prosecuting the study of law under
the celebrated ANDREW ALCIAT. While there he formed, as is stated in the
foregoing extract from BEZA&#8217;S Life of Calvin, an intimate friendship with
MELCHIOR WOLMAR, his instructor in the Greek tongue. Having received intimation
of the sudden death of his father, he broke off abruptly the studies in which he
was engaged, and having returned to Noyon, his native town, he soon afterwards
devoted himself to other and higher pursuits. The study of civil law, to which
he had devoted himself for a time, in compliance with his father&#8217;s wishes,
though ultimately abandoned, was not without its use, in connection with those
sacred pursuits to which his subsequent life was devoted. It may be interesting
to the reader to observe unequivocal evidences of this, as furnished in the
following encomiums pronounced upon CALVIN by two eminent writers of sound and
unbiassed judgment: &#8212; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;A founder,&#8221; says Hooker,
&#8220;it&#8221;<i> </i>(the Presbyterian polity) &#8220;had, whom, for mine own
part, I think incomparably the wisest man that ever the French Church did enjoy,
since the hour it enjoyed him. <i>His bringing up was in the study of the civil
law. </i>Divine knowledge he gathered, not by hearing and reading, so much as by
teaching others. For, though thousands were debtors to him as touching knowledge
in that kind, yet he to none but only to God, the Author of that most blessed
fountain, the Book of Life, and of the admirable dexterity of wit, together with
the helps of other learning, which were his guide.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;CALVIN,&#8221;<i> </i>says M. D&#8217;ALEMBERT, &#8220;who with justice
enjoyed a high reputation, was a scholar of the first order. He wrote in Latin
as well as is possible in a dead language, and in French with a purity that was
extraordinary for his time. This purity, which is to the present day admired by
our critics, renders his writings greatly superior to almost all of the same
age; as the works of MM. de Port Royal are still distinguished on the same
account, from the barbarous rhapsodies of their opponents and contemporaries.
CALVIN <i>being a skilful lawyer, </i>and as enlightened a divine as a heretic
can be, <i>drew up, in concert with the magistrates, a code of laws,&#8221;
</i>etc. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f4</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">While CALVIN&#8217;S large acquirements in the study
of civil law were thus eminently serviceable in other and higher departments of
labor, the other branch of study cultivated by him while at Bourges &#8212; the
knowledge of the Greek tongue &#8212; was more directly fitted to prepare him,
though he little thought of it at the time, for the sacred pursuits in which
Providence called him to engage, with devotedness and success, in after years.
Under the tuition of WOLMAR, he appears to have applied himself to the study of
the Greek language with the greatest diligence and ardour. &#8220;He<i> </i>did
not indeed,&#8221; says THOLUCK, &#8220;learn<i> </i>Greek before his residence
in Bourges, but he could not have been then, at most, more than twenty-two years
old; and it is not therefore strange, that, with his resolute spirit, he made
himself complete master of it.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>His instructor in this department, MELCHIOR WOLMAR, was a man of
distinguished talent, and of high moral worth. BEZA, who, as we have seen,
expresses in his Life of CALVIN, in the strongest terms, his esteem for WOLMAR,
his sole instructor, has furnished in his <i>Icones, </i>(French edition,)
entitled, &#8220;Les vrais Pourtraits des Hommes illustres,&#8221; (&agrave;
G&eacute;n&egrave;ve 1581, pp. 148-51,) the following interesting sketch of the
leading particulars of the life of this distinguished man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;MELIOR WOLMAR of Rotweil, Professor of Civil
Law, and of the Greek Language, in the University of T&uuml;bingen, (originally
called MELCHIOR, but latterly JOACHIM CAMERARIUS, a very learned personage, and
also Professor of Literature in T&uuml;bingen, admiring the probity of Wolmar,
softened the name and changed it thus,) was born at Rotweil, which is an allied
town of the Cantons, was brought up at Berne, and studied at Paris, where he
immediately became well known for his admirable expertness in the Greek and
Latin languages, as also in the town of Orleans, and more particularly at
Bourges, where, being in the pay of MARGARET OF VALOIS, QUEEN OF NAVARRE, and
Duchess of Berry, he read in Greek and in Latin, was admitted as teacher by the
advice of ANDREW ALCIAT, the prince of lawyers in our times. Farther, his house
was frequented by men that were learned and fearers of God, among whom must be
numbered JOHN CALVIN, who had no hesitation in placing himself under Wolmar, to
learn from him the Greek language, he having opened a school expressly for
certain young men of good family and of great hope, in which he succeeded so
admirably, that there could not have been found a man better qualified for the
successful training of youth, and there was no one who had educated in a proper
manner so large a number as he had done.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;France would have reaped more fruits of
Melior&#8217;s industry, had not the persecutions<i> </i>that arose against the
Church of God, and respect for ULRICH, DUKE OF WITTEMBERG, by whom he was
invited, drawn him away to T&uuml;bingen in the year 1535, when, having read in
law, and having interpreted Greek authors during upwards of twenty years with
great honor, he was at length permitted to resign. Having retired, with his
wife, named Margaret, to Isne, a town belonging to that lady, he was attacked
with paralysis, and at the end of some months, he and his wife (overcome as she
was with grief) died on the same day &#8212; it being the will of God, that
those whom a sacred friendship had held bound during the space of twenty-seven
years complete, should be inclosed in the same tomb.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;He was an accomplished personage in all the
gifts that are requisite for making a man accomplished. Above all he was
amazingly charitable to the poor, and at the same time so remote from ambition,
that, while he had the Greek and Latin languages at his command, he put to the
press nothing but an elegant preface, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f6</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
introductory to the Grammar of Demetrius Chalcondyles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Having had in my childhood, as my preceptor,
so distinguished a personage, (revered by me, while he lived, as my own father),
I have bewailed his death, and that of his wife, in three Latin Epigrams, now
rendered into French. He died at Isne in the year 1561, at the age of 64
years.</font><br></div>

quoted in CALVIN on Genesis, (vol. 1.) a list of CALVIN&#8217;S Commentaries is

the Romans is supposed to have been published in 1540, the <i>first
</i>dedication to the Commentary on the <i>First </i>Epistle to the Corinthians,
and the dedication to the Commentary on the <i>Second </i>Epistle, both of them
bear date 1546. It is stated by BEZA in his Life of Calvin, that during the
contentions which prevailed in the Church in 1548, and some preceding years,
CALVIN was &#8220;not only not idle, but, as if he had been living in
retirement, wrote most learned commentaries on six of Paul&#8217;s
Epistles.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f9</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The six Epistles referred to appear to have been the two Epistles to the
Corinthians, and the Epistles to the Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and
Colossians, CALVIN&#8217;S Commentary on the last four of these having been
published, as appears from the dedication prefixed to it, in
1548.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What is chiefly of importance to be observed, in
connection with the respective dates of the Epistles above referred to, is the
circumstance noticed by BEZA &#8212; that CALVIN wrote his &#8220;most learned
Commentaries&#8221; on those Epistles &#8220;<i>as if he had been living in
retirement,</i>&#8221;<i> </i>while in reality amidst scenes, which would have
incapacitated any ordinary mind for such pursuits. In the careful study of these
interesting portions of the Volume of Inspiration, CALVIN&#8217;S devout mind
found refreshment amidst scenes of turmoil; and we cannot doubt, that while
preparing, under circumstances like these, his Commentaries on the Epistles to
the Corinthians, and most of Paul&#8217;s other Epistles, he had ample
experience of what he himself so beautifully expresses, when commenting on
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B950&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

will we meet with any sorrow so heavy for which it will not furnish us with a
remedy. And if we are bereft of consolation and succour in our adversities, the
blame must rest with ourselves; because, despising or overlooking the word of
God, we purposely deceive ourselves with vain consolation.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">SHOULD you be disposed to charge me, not merely with
neglect, but even with incivility, for not having written to you for so long a
time, I confess I have scarcely any apology to offer. For if I were to allege
that the distance between us is so great, and that, during fully five years, I
have met with no one that was going in your direction, this indeed were true,
but it would be, I readily acknowledge, but a lame excuse. It appeared to me,
accordingly, that I could not do better than offer to you some compensation,
that might make up for the errors of the past, and might at once set me clear
from all blame. Here, then, you have a commentary on the Second Epistle of Paul
to the Corinthians, prepared by me with as much care as was in my power. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f11</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For I have no doubt that you will, in your kindness, accept of this as a
sufficient compensation. At the same time there are other and weightier
considerations, that have induced me to dedicate this to you.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First of all, I remember with what fidelity 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f12</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
you cherished and strengthened the friendship, which had begun, (now long
since,) in some small degree, to subsist between us &#8212; how generously you
were prepared to lay out yourself and your services on my account, when you
thought that you had an opportunity presented to you of testifying your

for my advancement, had not the calling in which I was at that time engaged
prevented me from availing myself of it. Nothing, however, has had greater
weight with me than the recollection of the first time I was sent by my father
to learn civil law. Under your direction and tuition, I conjoined with the study
of law Greek literature, of which you were at that time a most celebrated
professor. And certainly it was not owing to you that I did not make greater
proficiency; for, with your wonted kindness of disposition, you would have had
no hesitation in lending me a helping hand for the completion of my course, had
I not been called away by my father&#8217;s death, when I had little more than
started. I am, however, under no small obligations to you in this respect, that
I was initiated by you in the rudiments, at least, which were afterwards of
great advantage to me. Hence I could not satisfy myself without leaving to
posterity some memorial of my gratitude, and at the same time rendering to you
some fruit, such as it is, of your labor.

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">SECOND EPISTLE
TO THE CORINTHIANS.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So far as we can judge from the connection of this
Epistle, it appears that the <i>first </i>Epistle was not without some good
effect among the Corinthians, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f15</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but at the same time was not productive of so much benefit as it ought to have
been; and farther, that some wicked persons, despising Paul&#8217;s authority,
persisted in their obstinacy. For the fact of his being so much occupied, at one
time in declaring his fidelity, and at another in maintaining the dignity of his
office, is itself a token that they had not as yet been thoroughly confirmed. He
himself, too, complains in express terms, that there were some that made sport
of his former Epistle, instead of deriving benefit from it. Understanding, then,
the condition of the Church among them to be such, and being detained by other
matters, so as to be prevented from coming to them so soon as he had at that
time contemplated, he wrote this Epistle from Macedonia. We are now in
possession of the purpose which he had in view in writing this Epistle &#8212;
that he might perfect what he had already begun, in order that he might, when he
came, find every thing in proper order.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He begins, as he is wont, with thanksgiving,
rendering thanks to God, that he had been marvellously rescued from the most
imminent dangers, and at the same time he calls them to notice, that all his
afflictions and distresses tended to their benefit and welfare, that he may the
better secure their favor by this farther pledge of union, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f16</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
while the, wicked perversely took occasion from this to lessen his influence.
Farther, when wishing to apologize for delaying to come to them, he declares
that he had not changed his purpose from lightness or unsteadiness, and that he
had not, for the purpose of deceiving, professed anything that he had not really
had in view; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f17</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for there was the same consistency to be seen by them in all his sayings, that
they had had experience of in his doctrine. Here, too, he briefly notices, how
stable and sure was the truth of his preaching, as being founded on Christ, by
whom all the promises of God are fixed and ratified &#8212; which is a high
recommendation of the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After this he declares, that the reason why he had
not come was this, that he could not appear among them cheerful and agreeable.
In this statement, he reproves those, who, from his change of purpose, took
occasion to calumniate him. He accordingly throws the blame upon the
Corinthians, as being not yet well prepared for receiving him. He shows, at the
same time, with what fatherly forbearance he was actuated, inasmuch as he kept
himself back from visiting their city for this reason &#8212; that he might not
be under the necessity of exercising severity upon them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, lest any one should object, that he had in
the mean time not at all refrained from handling the Corinthians severely in his
writings, he apologizes for the vehemence that he made use of in his first
Epistle, by saying that it was owing to others &#8212; they having shut him up
to the necessity of this against his will. That this keenness had proceeded from
a friendly disposition he satisfactorily shows, by ordering that the incestuous
person himself, on whose account he had been much exasperated, should be
received back into favor, having since that time given some evidence of
repentance. Farther, he brings forward this additional evidence of his affection
towards them, that he <i>had no rest in his mind
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:13) until he had learned through means of Titus the state of their
affairs, for an anxiety of this kind originates in affection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having had occasion, however, to make mention here of
his journey to Macedonia, he begins to speak of the glory of his ministry. As,
however, those darling Apostles, who endeavored to detract from him, had
obtained an easy victory over him by trumpeting their own praises, that he may
have nothing in common with them, and that he may at the same time beat down
their foolish boasting, he declares that he derives commendation from the work
itself, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f18</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and does not borrow it from men. In the same passage, he extols in magnificent
terms the efficacy of his preaching, and sets off to advantage the dignity of
his Apostleship by comparing the gospel with the law, declaring, however, first
of all, that he claimed nothing as his own, but acknowledged everything,
whatever it might be, to have come forth from God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After this he relates again, with what fidelity and
integrity he had discharged the office intrusted to him, and in this he reproves
those who malignantly reproached him. Nay more, rising still higher in holy
confidence, he declares, that all are blinded by the devil, who do not perceive
the lustre of his gospel. Perceiving, however, that the meanness of his person
(as being contemptible) 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f19</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
detracted much from the respect due to his Apostleship, embracing this favorable
opportunity, he does not merely remove this occasion of offense, but turns it
into an opposite direction, by saying, that the excellence of God&#8217;s grace
shines forth so much the more brightly, from the circumstance that so valuable
a</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">treasure was presented in
earthen
vessels.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 4:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus he turns to his own commendation those things
which the malevolent were wont to cast up to him by way of reproach, because on
his being weighed down with so many distresses, he always, nevertheless, after
the manner of the palm tree, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f20</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
rises superior to them. He treats of this subject up to the middle of the
<i>fourth </i>chapter, (2 Corinthians 4). As, however, the true glory of
Christians lies beyond this world, he teaches that we must, by contempt of this
present life and mortification of the <i>outward man, </i>set ourselves with the
whole bent of our mind to meditation on a blessed immortality.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, near the beginning of the <i>fifth
</i>chapter, (2 Corinthians 5), he glories in this &#8212; that being actuated
by such a disposition, he has nothing else as the object of his desire, than to
have his services approved unto the Lord, and he entertains a hope, that he will
have the Corinthians as witnesses of his sincerity. As, however, there was a
danger of his being suspected of vanity, or arrogance, he again repeats, that he
is constrained to this by the unreasonableness of wicked persons, and that it
was not for his own sake, as though he were eager to retain their good opinion,
but for the benefit of the Corinthians, to whom it was of advantage to have this
opinion and persuasion; and he declares that he is concerned for nothing but
their welfare. With the view of confirming this, he subjoins a universal
statement, showing what ought to be the object aimed at by the servants of
Christ &#8212; that, losing sight of themselves, they should live to the honor
of their Lord; and at length he concludes, that everything except newness of
life ought to be reckoned of no importance, so that he alone, who has denied
himself, is to be held in esteem. From this he passes on to unfold the sum of
the Gospel message, that by the magnitude and excellence of it he may stir up
both ministers and people to a pious solicitude. This he does in the beginning
of the <i>sixth </i>chapter, (2 Corinthians 6).</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here again, after having noticed how faithfully he
discharged his office, he gently reproves the Corinthians, as being hinderances
to themselves in the way of their reaping advantage. To this expostulation he
immediately subjoins an exhortation, to <i>flee from idolatry &#8212; </i>from
which it appears, that the Corinthians had not yet been brought so far as he
wished. Hence it is not without good reason that he complains, that they had
themselves to blame, inasmuch as they had not had their ears open to doctrine so
plain. But lest he should, by pressing too severely their tender minds,
dishearten or alienate them, he again assures them of his kind disposition
towards them, and resuming his apology for severity, which he had left off in a
manner abruptly, he brings it to a conclusion, though in a different way. For
assuming greater confidence, he acknowledges that he is not dissatisfied with
himself for having grieved them, inasmuch as he had done it for their good; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f21</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
while at the same time, by congratulating them on the happy issue, he shows them
how cordially he desires their best interests. These things he treats of to the
end of the <i>seventh </i>chapter, (2 Corinthians 7).</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From the beginning of the <i>eighth </i>chapter, (2
Corinthians 8), to the end of the <i>ninth</i>, (2 Corinthians 9), he stirs them
up to cheerfulness in giving alms, of which he had made mention in the last
chapter of the first Epistle. He commends them, it is true, for having begun
well, but lest the ardour of their zeal should cool in process of time, as often
happens, he encourages them by a variety of arguments to go on perseveringly in
the course on which they had entered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>tenth </i>chapter, (2 Corinthians 10), he
begins to defend himself, and his office as an Apostle, from the calumnies with
which the wicked assailed him. And in the first place, he shows that he is
admirably equipped with the armor that is requisite for maintaining
Christ&#8217;s warfare. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f22</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Farther, he declares, that the authority which he had exercised in the former
Epistle was grounded on the assurance of a good conscience, and he shows them
that he had no less power in his actions, when present, than authority in his
words when absent. Lastly, by instituting a comparison between himself and them,
he shows how vain their boasting is. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f23</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>eleventh </i>chapter, (2 Corinthians 11),
he calls upon the Corinthians to renounce those depraved inclinations, by which
they had been corrupted, showing them that nothing is more dangerous than to
allow themselves to be drawn aside from the simplicity of the Gospel. The fact
of his having begun to be somewhat disesteemed among them, while others had been
more favorably received by them, had arisen, as he shows, not from any fault on
his part, but from their being haughty or nice to please; inasmuch as those
others had brought them nothing better or more excellent, while he was
contemptible in their view because he did not set himself off to advantage by
elegance of speech, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f24</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or because he had, by voluntary subjection, by way of humouring their weakness,
given up his just claim. This irony 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f25</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
contains in it an indirect reproach for their ingratitude, for where was the
reasonableness of esteeming him the less, because he had accommodated himself to
them? He declares, however, that the reason why he had refrained from taking the
wages to which he was entitled, was not that he had less affection to the
Corinthians, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f26</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but in order that no advantage might be gained over him in any respect by the
false apostles, who, he saw, laid snares for him by this
stratagem.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having reproved the unreasonable and malignant
judgment of the Corinthians, he magnifies himself in a strain of pious glorying,
letting them know in what magnificent terms he could boast, were he so inclined,
premising however, that it is for their sakes that he acts the fool 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f27</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in heralding his own praises. At length, checking himself, as it were, in the
middle of the course, he says that his chief ground of glorying is that
abasement which was despised by the proud, for he had been admonished by the
Lord, not to glory in anything but in his infirmities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Towards the close of the <i>twelfth </i>chapter, (2
Corinthians 12), he again expostulates with them for shutting him up to the
necessity of thus playing the fool, while they give themselves up to ambitious
men, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f28</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
by whom they are estranged from Christ. Farther, he inveighs keenly against
those who wantonly raged against him, adding to their previous crimes this
impudence of opposition. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f29</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>thirteenth </i>chapter, (2 Corinthians 13),
by forewarning such persons, that he will treat them with peculiar severity, he
exhorts all in general to recognise his apostleship, as it will be for their
advantage to do so; while it is a dangerous thing for them to despise one, whom
they had found by experience to be a trusty and faithful ambassador from the
Lord.</font><br></div>

Both of these Paul claims for himself. The false apostles, it is true, do the
same; but then, by usurping a title that does not belong to them, they gain
nothing among the sons of God, who can with the utmost ease convict them of
impertinence. Hence the mere name is not enough, if there be not the reality
along with it, so that he who gives himself out as an Apostle must also show
himself to be such by his work.</font><br></div>

He had endured his tribulations with fortitude and alacrity: this fortitude he

he had a little before cleared his afflictions from reproach and unfavorable
reports, so now he instructs the Corinthians, that his having come off
victorious through heavenly consolation was for their sake and with a view to
their advantage, that they may stir themselves up to fellowship in suffering,
instead of haughtily despising his conflicts. As, however, the Apostle lived not
for himself but for the Church, so he reckoned, that whatever favors God
conferred upon him, were not given for his own sake merely, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f37</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but in order that he might have more in his power for helping others. And,
unquestionably, when the Lord confers upon us any favor, he in a manner invites
us by his example to be generous to our neighbours. The riches of the Spirit,
therefore, are not to be kept by us to ourselves, but every one must communicate
to others what he has received. This, it is true, must be considered as being
applicable chiefly to ministers of the Word. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f38</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is, however, common to all, according to the measure of each. Thus Paul here
acknowledges, that he had been sustained by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consolation of God, that he might
be able himself to comfort
others</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>

may be explained in two ways &#8212; actively and passively. If you take it
<i>actively, </i>the meaning will be this: &#8220;The more I am tried with
various afflictions, so much the more resources have I for comforting
others.&#8221; I am, however, more inclined to take it in a <i>passive
</i>sense, as meaning that God multiplied his consolations according to the
measure of his tribulations. David also acknowledges that it had been thus with
him:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">According to the

<div><font face="Palatino">In Paul&#8217;s words, however, there is a fuller
statement of doctrine; for the afflictions of the pious he calls the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sufferings of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as he says
elsewhere,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The miseries and vexations, it is true, of the
present life are common to good and bad alike, but when they befall the wicked,
they are tokens of the curse of God, because they arise from sin, and nothing
appears in them except the anger of God and participation with Adam, which
cannot but depress the mind. But in the mean time believers are conformed to

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whether we are
afflicted.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From the circumstance that
before the clause <i>our hope of you is steadfast, </i>there is introduced the
connecting particle <i>and, </i>Erasmus has conceived the idea, that some word
must be understood to correspond with those words &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for your consolation and
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; in this way, <i>whether we
are afflicted, </i>IT IS<i> for your consolation. </i>I think it, however, more
probable, that the connecting particle <i>and </i>is used here as meaning:
<i>Thus also, </i>or <i>in both cases. </i>He had already stated, that he
received consolation in order that he might communicate it to others. Now he
goes a step farther, and says, that he has a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>steadfast
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>would be partakers of the
consolation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Besides, some of the most
ancient Greek manuscripts introduce immediately after the first clause this
statement<i> &#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and our
hope of you is steadfast</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>This reading removes all ambiguity. For when it is introduced in the middle,
we must necessarily refer it to the latter clause, equally as to the former. At
the same time, if any one wishes to have a complete sentence in each clause, by
supplying some verb, there will be no great harm in this, and there will be no
great difference as to the meaning. For if you read it as one continued
statement, you must, at the same time, explain the different parts in this
manner &#8212; that the Apostle is afflicted, and is refreshed with consolation
for the advantage of the Corinthians; and that he entertains, therefore, the
hope, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f44</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they will be at length partakers of the same consolation, with what is in
reserve for himself. For my own part, I have adopted the way that I have judged
the more suitable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, however, to be observed, that the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>afflicted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>here refers not merely to outward misery, but also to that of the mind, so
as to correspond with the opposite term <i>comforted.
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">parakalei~sqai</font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>)<i>
</i>Thus the meaning is, that the person&#8217;s mind is pressed down with
anxiety from a feeling of misery. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f45</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
What we render
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consolation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is in the Greek
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">para&gt;klhsiv</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;,
&#8212; a term which signifies also <i>exhortation. </i>If, however, you
understand that kind of consolation, by which a person&#8217;s mind is lightened
of grief, and is raised above it, you will be in possession of Paul&#8217;s
meaning. For example, Paul himself would well-nigh have fallen down dead under
the pressure of so many afflictions, had not God encouraged him, by raising him
up by means of his consolation. Thus, too, the Corinthians derive strength and
fortitude of mind from his sufferings, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f46</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
while they take comfort from his example. Let us now sum up the whole matter
briefly. As he saw that his afflictions were made by some an occasion of holding
him in contempt, with the view of calling back the Corinthians from an error of
this nature, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f47</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he shows in the first place that he ought to be in high esteem among them, in
consideration of advantage redounding to themselves; and then afterwards he
associates them with himself, that they may reckon his afflictions to be in a
manner their own. &#8220;Whether I suffer afflictions, or experience
consolation, it is all for your benefit, and I cherish an assured hope, that you
will continue to enjoy this advantage.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f48</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For such were Paul&#8217;s afflictions, and his
consolations also, that they would have contributed to the edification of the
Corinthians, had not the Corinthians of their own accord deprived themselves of
the advantage redounding from it. He, accordingly, declares his confidence in
the Corinthians to be such, that he entertains the assured hope that it will not
be vain, that he has been afflicted, and has received consolation for their
advantage. The false apostles made every effort to turn to Paul&#8217;s reproach
everything that befell him. Had they obtained their wish, the afflictions which
he endured for their salvation, had been vain and fruitless; they would have
derived no advantage from the consolations with which the Lord refreshed him. To
contrivances of this nature he opposes his present confidence. His afflictions
tended to promote the comfort of believers, as furnishing them with occasion of
confirmation, on their perceiving that he suffered willingly, and endured with
fortitude so many hardships for the sake of the gospel. For however we may
acknowledge that afflictions ought to be endured by us for the sake of the
gospel, we, nevertheless, tremble through a consciousness of our weakness, and
think ourselves not prepared for it. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f49</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In that case, we should call to mind the examples of the saints, which should
make us more courageous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the other hand, his personal consolation flowed
out to the whole Church, inasmuch as they concluded, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f50</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that God who had sustained and refreshed him hi his emergency, would, in like
manner, not be wanting to them. Thus their welfare was promoted in both ways,
and this is what he introduces as it were by way of parenthesis, when he says
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which is made effectual
in the endurance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> etc. For he wished to
add this clause, by way of explanation, that they might not think that they had
nothing to do with the afflictions which he alone endured. Erasmus takes the
participle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">goume&gt;nhv</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;
in an active sense, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f51</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but a passive signification is more suitable, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f52</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as Paul designed simply to explain in what respect everything that befell him
was for their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He says, accordingly, that he suffers, indeed, alone, but that his
sufferings are of use for promoting their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; not as though they were expiations or sacrifices for sins, but as
edifying them by confirming them. Hence he conjoins consolation and salvation,
with the view of pointing out the way in which their salvation was to be
accomplished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Knowing, that
as</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>However there might be some of the
Corinthians that were drawn away for the time by the calumnies of the false
Apostles, so as to entertain less honorable views of Paul, on seeing him
shamefully handled before the world, he, nevertheless, associates them with
himself both in fellowship of afflictions, and in hope of consolation. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f53</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus he corrects their perverse and malignant view, without subjecting them to
an open rebuke.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I would not have you
ignorant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He makes mention of the
greatness and difficulty of his conflicts, that the glory of victory may thereby
the more abundantly appear. Since the time of his sending them the former
epistle, he had been exposed to great dangers, and had endured violent assaults.
The probability, however, is that he refers here to the history, which Luke
relates in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441923&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
19:23, though in that passage he does not so distinctly intimate the extent of
the danger. As, however, he states that <i>the whole city was in a tumult,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441929&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
19:29,) it is easy from this to infer the rest. For we know what is the usual
effect of a popular tumult, when it has been once kindled. By this persecution
Paul declares he had been oppressed <i>beyond measure, </i>nay more,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>above
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, so as not to be able
to endure the burden. For it is a metaphor taken from persons who give way under
the pressure of a heavy load, or from ships that sink from being overladen
&#8212; not that he had actually fainted, but that he felt that his strength
would have failed him, if the Lord had not imparted fresh strength. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f54</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So that we were in anxiety even as
to life itself</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; that<i> </i>is,
&#8220;So that I thought life was gone, or at least I had very little hope of it
remaining, as those are wont to feel who are shut up so as to see no way of
escape.&#8221; Was then so valiant a soldier of Christ, so brave a wrestler,
left without strength, so as to look for nothing but death? 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f55</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For he mentions it as the reason of what he had stated &#8212; that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>despaired of
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have already observed, that Paul
does not measure his strength in connection with help from God, but according to
his own personal feeling of his ability. Now there can be no doubt, that all
human strength must give way before the fear of death. Farther, it is necessary
that even saints themselves should be in danger of an entire failure of
strength, that, being put in mind of their own weakness, they may learn,
agreeably to what follows, to place their entire dependence on God alone. At the
same time I have preferred to explain the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejxaporei~sqai</font><font face="Palatino">,
which is made use of by Paul, as denoting a <i>trembling anxiety, </i>rather
than render it, as Erasmus has done by the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>despair</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>because he simply means, that he was hemmed in by the greatest difficulties,
so that no means of preserving life seemed to remain. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f56</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nay more, we had the sentence of
death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is as though we should say
&#8212; &#8221;I had already laid my account with dying, or had regarded it as a
thing fixed.&#8221; He borrows, however, a similitude from those who are under
sentence of death, and look for nothing but the hour when they are to die. At
the same time he says, that this sentence had been pronounced by him upon
himself, by which he intimates, that it was in his own view that he had been
sentenced to death &#8212; that he might not seem to have had it from any
revelation from God. In this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sentence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f57</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>therefore, there is something more implied than in the feeling of <i>anxiety
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejxaporei~sqai)</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>that he had made mention of, because in the former case there was despair of
life, but in this case there is certain death. We must, however, take notice,
chiefly, of what he adds as to the design &#8212; that he had been reduced to
this extremity, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he might not
trust in himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For I do not agree
with what Chrysostom says &#8212; that the Apostle did not stand in need of such
a remedy, but set himself forth to others as a pattern merely in appearance. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f58</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For he was a man that was <i>subject, </i>in other respects, <i>to like passions
</i>as other men &#8212;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;590517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
5:17) &#8212; not merely to cold and heat, but also to misdirected confidence,
rashness, and the like. I do not say that he was addicted to these vices, but
this I say, that he was capable of being tempted to them, and that this was the
remedy that God seasonably interposed, that they might not make their way into
his mind. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f59</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are, accordingly, two things to be observed
here. In the <i>first </i>place &#8212; that the fleshly confidence with which
we are puffed up, is so obstinate, that it cannot be overthrown in any other way
than by our falling into utter despair. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f60</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For as the flesh is proud, it does not willingly give way, and never ceases to
be insolent until it has been constrained; nor are we brought to true
submission, until we have been brought down by the <i>mighty hand of God.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:6.) <i>Secondly, </i>it is to be observed, that the saints themselves
have some remains of this disease adhering to them, and that for this reason
they are often reduced to an extremity, that, stript of all self-confidence,
they may learn humility: nay more, that this malady is so deeply rooted in the
minds of men, that even the most advanced are not thoroughly purged from it,
until God sets death before their eyes. And hence we may infer, how displeasing
to God confidence in ourselves must be, when for the purpose of correcting it,
it is necessary that we should be condemned to death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But in God that raiseth the
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As we must first die, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f61</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in order that, renouncing confidence in ourselves, and conscious of our own
weakness, we may claim no honor to ourselves, so even that were not sufficient,
if we did not proceed a step farther. Let us begin, therefore, with despairing
of ourselves, but with the view of placing our hope in God. Let us be brought
low in ourselves, but in order that we may be raised up by his power. Paul,
accordingly, having brought to nothing the pride of the flesh, immediately
substitutes in its place a confidence that rests upon
God.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Not in
ourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says
he,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> but in

<div><font face="Palatino">The epithet that follows, Paul has adapted to the
connection of the subject, as he does in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:17, where he speaks of Abraham. For to</font><br></div>

calleth those things that are not, as though they were, and to hope in God who
raiseth the dead,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">are equivalent to his setting before him as an object
of contemplation, the power of God in creating his elect out of nothing, and
raising up the dead. Hence Paul says, that death had been set before his eyes,
that he might, in consequence of this, recognize the more distinctly the power
of God, by which he had been raised up from the dead. The first thing in order,
it is true, is this &#8212; that, by means of the strength with which God
furnishes us, we should acknowledge him as the Author of life; but as in
consequence of our dulness the light of life often dazzles our eyes, it is
necessary that we should be brought to God by having death presented to our
view.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath delivered us from so
great a death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he applies to
himself personally, what he had stated in a general way, and by way of
proclaiming the grace of God, he declares that he had not been disappointed in
his expectation, inasmuch as he had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>delivered from
death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and that too, in no common form.
As to his manner of expression, the hyperbole, which he makes use of, is not
unusual in the Scriptures, for it frequently occurs, both in the Prophets and in
the Psalms, and it is made use of even in common conversation. What Paul
acknowledges as to himself personally, let every one now take home as applicable
to himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In whom we have an assured
hope.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He promises himself as to the
future, also, that beneficence of God, which he had often experienced in the
past. Nor is it without good reason; for the Lord, by accomplishing in part what
he has promised, bids us hope well as to what remains. Nay more, in proportion
to the number of favors that we receive from him, does he by so many pledges, or
earnests, as it were, confirm his promises. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f63</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now, although Paul had no doubt that God would of his own accord be present with
him, yet he exhorts the Corinthians to commend to God in their prayers his
safety. For when he assumes it as certain, that he will be aided by them, this
declaration has the force of an exhortation, and he means that they would not
merely do it as a matter of duty, but also with advantage. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f64</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Your prayers, also,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;will help me.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f65</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For God wills not that the duty of mutual intercession, which he enjoins upon
us, should be without advantage. This ought to be a stimulus to us, on the one
hand, to solicit the intercession of our brethren, when we are weighed down by
any necessity, and, on the other, to render similar assistance in return, since
we are informed, that it is not only a duty that is well pleasing to God, but
also profitable to ourselves. Nor is it owing to distrust that the Apostle
implores the friendly aid of his brethren, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f66</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for, while he felt assured, that his safety would be the object of God&#8217;s
care, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f67</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
though he were destitute of all human help, yet he knew that it was well
pleasing to God, that he should be aided by the prayers of the saints. He had
respect, also, to the promises that were given, that assistance of this kind
would not be in vain. Hence, in order that he might not overlook any assistance
that was appointed to him by God, he desired that the brethren should pray for
his preservation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum is this &#8212; that we follow the word of
God, that is, that we obey his commandments and cleave to his promises. This is
not the part of those who have recourse to the assistance of the dead; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f68</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for not contented with the sources of help appointed by God, they call in to
their aid a new one, that has no countenance from any declaration of Scripture.
For whatever we find mentioned there as to mutual intercession, has no reference
to the dead, but is expressly restricted to the living. Hence Papists act
childishly in perverting those passages, so as to give some colour to their
superstition.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the gift bestowed upon us
through means of many persons.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As there
is some difficulty in Paul&#8217;s words, interpreters differ as to the meaning.
I shall not spend time in setting aside the interpretations of others, nor
indeed is there any need for this, provided only we are satisfied as to the true
and proper meaning. He had said, that the prayers of the Corinthians would be an
assistance to him. He now adds a second advantage that would accrue from it
&#8212; a higher manifestation of God&#8217;s glory. &#8220;For whatever God
will confer upon me,&#8221; says he, &#8220;being as it were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>obtained through means of many

celebrated with praises:<i>&#8221; </i>or in this way &#8212; &#8221;Many will
give thanks to God in my behalf, because, in affording help to me, he has
favorably regarded the prayers, not merely of one but of many.&#8221; In the
first place, while it is our duty to allow no favor from God to pass without
rendering praise, it becomes us, nevertheless, more especially when our prayers
have been favorably regarded by him, to acknowledge his mercy with thanksgiving,
as he commands us to do in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;195015&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
50:15. Nor ought this to be merely where our own personal interest is concerned,
but also where the welfare of the Church in general, or that of any one of our
brethren is involved. Hence when we mutually pray one for another, and obtain
our desire, the glory of God is so much the more set forth, inasmuch as we all
acknowledge, with thanksgiving, God&#8217;s benefits &#8212; both those that are
conferred publicly upon the whole Church, and also those that are bestowed
privately upon individuals.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this interpretation there is nothing forced; for
as to the circumstance that in the Greek the article being introduced between
the two clauses </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by many
persons</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gift conferred upon

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f70</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>that </i>has no force, as it is frequently found introduced between clauses
that are connected with each other. Here, however, it is with propriety
introduced in place of an adversative particle; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f71</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for although it had come forth from many persons, it was nevertheless peculiar
to Paul. To take the phrase
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dia&lt; pollw~n
</font><font face="Palatino">(<i>by means of many</i>) in the neuter gender, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f72</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as some do, is at variance with the connection of the passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may, however, be asked, why he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From many
persons</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>rather than
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From many
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and what is the meaning of the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>person</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>here? I answer, it is as though he had said &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With respect to
many</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For the favor was conferred upon
Paul in such a way, that it might be given to many. Hence, as God had respect to
many, he says on that account, that many persons were the cause of it. Some
Greek manuscripts have </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpe&lt;r
uJmw~n </font><font face="Palatino">&#8212; <i>on your account; </i>and although
this appears to be at variance with Paul&#8217;s design, and the connection of
the words, it may, nevertheless, be explained with propriety in this manner:
&#8220;When God shall have heard you in behalf of my welfare, and that too for
your own welfare, thanks will be given by many on your
account.&#8221;</font><br></div>

oppose himself to God, as though he had anything that was his own, or that was

integrity to which he lays claim, nor does he make confidence in <i>that </i>the

These three exceptions lay a foundation for every godly person glorying on good

of all, acknowledge ourselves to be indebted to God for everything good that we
possess, claiming no merit to ourselves. Secondly, let us hold fast this

elsewhere, but that he had remained longer at Corinth, in order that he might
(not to mention other purposes) afford a fuller and clearer proof of his

this point, there is nothing to prevent readers from understanding it, were it
not that they have had their eyes shut, from being misled by the different
meanings of the word. The sum is this &#8212; that Paul declares, that he brings
forward no other things than what were known and perceived by the Corinthians
&#8212; nay more, things as to which they would bear him witness. The first term
employed is <i>recognoscere, </i>(to <i>recognize,) </i>which is applicable,
when persons are convinced from experience that matters are so. The second is

the manner in which it is allowable for saints to glory in God&#8217;s benefits
&#8212; when they repose themselves in God alone, and have no other object of
aim. Thus it was a ground of pious glorying on the part of Paul, that he had, by
his ministry, brought the Corinthians under obedience to Christ; and of the
Corinthians, on the other hand, that they had been trained up so faithfully and
so virtuously by such an Apostle &#8212; a privilege that had not been allotted
to all. This way of glorying in men does not stand in the way of our glorying in
God alone. Now he instructs the Corinthians, that it is of the greatest
importance for themselves that they should acknowledge him to be a faithful, and
not a merely pretended, servant of Christ; because, in the event of their
withdrawing from him, they would deprive themselves of the highest glory. In
these words he reproves their fickleness, inasmuch as they voluntarily deprived
themselves of the highest glory, by listening too readily to the spiteful and
envious.</font><br></div>

speaking is not evanescent, as those things are that glitter in the eyes of men,

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In this
confidence.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After having given them
reason to expect that he would come, he had subsequently changed his intention.
This was made an occasion of calumny against him, as appears from the excuse
that he brings forward. When he says that it was from relying
on</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> this
confidence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that he formed the purpose of
coming to them, he indirectly throws the blame upon the Corinthians, inasmuch as
they had, by their ingratitude, hindered, to some extent, his coming to them, by
depriving him of <i>that confidence.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye might have a second
benefit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The first<i> </i>benefit had
been this &#8212; that he had devoted himself for the entire period of <i>a year
and six months
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
18:11) to the work of gaining them to the Lord; the <i>second </i>was their
being confirmed, by means of his coming to them, in the faith which they had
once received, and being stirred up by his sacred admonitions to make farther
progress. Of this latter benefit the Corinthians had deprived themselves,
inasmuch as they had not allowed the apostle to come to them. They were paying,
therefore, the penalty of their own fault, and they had no ground for imputing
any blame to Paul. If any one, however, prefers, with Chrysostom, to take
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ca&gt;rin</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(benefit) </i>as used instead of
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kara&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
(joy,) </i>I do not much object to it. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f90</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The former interpretation, however, is more simple.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Did I use
fickleness?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There are two things, more
especially, that prevent the purposes of men from being carried into effect, or
their promises from being faithfully performed. The one is that they make
changes upon them almost every hour, and the other is that they are too rash in
forming their plans. It is a sign of changeableness to purpose or promise what
you almost immediately afterwards regret. With that fault Paul declares he had
not been chargeable. &#8220;I have not,&#8221; says he, &#8220;through
<i>fickleness </i>drawn back from the promise that I made.&#8221; He declares
also that he had been on his guard against rashness and misdirected confidence;
for such is the way in which I explain the expression &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>purpose according to the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For it is, as I have stated, the
common practice of men, as though they were not dependent on God&#8217;s
providence, and were not subject to his will, to determine rashly and
presumptuously what they will do. Now God, with the view of punishing this
presumption, defeats their plans, so as to prevent them from having a prosperous
issue, and in many instances holds up themselves to ridicule.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The expression, it is true,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>might be extended farther, so as
to include all wicked schemes, and such as are not directed to a right end, as
for example such as are dictated by ambition, avarice, or any other depraved
affection. Paul, however, in my opinion, did not intend here to refer to any
thing of that nature, but merely to reprove that rashness which is but too
customary on the part of man, and in daily use in the forming of plans. To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>purpose</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>therefore, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is not owning God as our ruler,
but, instead of this, being impelled by a rash presumption, which is afterwards
justly derided by God, and punished. The apostle, with the view of clearing
himself from these faults, proposes a question, as if in the person of his
opponents. Hence it is probable, as I have already said, that some unfavorable
report had been put in circulation by wicked persons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That with me there should be yea,
yea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some connect this statement with
what goes before, and explain it thus: &#8220;As if it were in my power to
perform whatever I purpose, as men determine that they will do whatever comes
into their mind, and <i>order their ways, </i>as Solomon speaks,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;201601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
16:1,) while they cannot so much as govern their tongue.&#8221; And,
undoubtedly, the words seem to imply this much &#8212; that what has been once
affirmed must remain fixed, and what has been once denied must never be done. So
James in his Epistle
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;590512&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
5:12) says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Let your yea be yea, and
your nay nay, lest ye fall into dissimulation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, the context would in this way suit
exceedingly well as to what goes before. For to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>purpose according to the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is this &#8212; when we wish that,
without any exception, our determinations shall be like oracles. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f91</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This interpretation, However, does not accord with what immediately <i>follows
&#8212; God is faithful, </i>etc., where Paul makes use of the same form of
expression, when he has it in view to intimate, that he had not been unfaithful
in his preaching. Now it were absurd, if almost in the same verse he reckoned it
as a fault that his yea should be yea, and his nay nay, and yet at the same time
laid claim to it as his highest praise. I am aware of what could be said in
reply, if any one were disposed to sport himself with subtleties, but I have no
relish for anything that is not solid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have, therefore, no doubt, that in these words Paul
designed to reprove fickleness, although they may seem to be susceptible of
another meaning, for the purpose of clearing himself from that calumny &#8212;
that he was accustomed to promise in words what he failed to perform in deeds. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f92</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus the reiterating of the affirmation and negation will not have the same
meaning as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400537&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:37 and in James, but will bear this meaning &#8212; &#8220;that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>should with me be in this instance
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and on the other hand, when it pleases me,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nay,
nay</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>At the same time it
is possible that it may have crept in through the ignorance of transcribers, as
the old translation does not redouble the words, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f93</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
However this may be, we ought not to be very solicitous as to the words,
provided we are in possession of the apostle&#8217;s intention, which, as I have
said, clearly appears from what follows. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f94</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God is
faithful.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he means doctrine, as is manifest from the
reason that he adds, when he says, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Son of God, who is preached by
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is not variable, etc. As to his
being always consistent with himself in point of doctrine, and not differing
from himself, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f95</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he intends that by this they shall form a judgment as to his integrity, and in
this way he removes every unfavorable suspicion of fickleness or unfaithfulness.
It does not, however, necessarily follow, that the man who is faithful in
doctrine, is also observant of truth in all his <i>words. </i>But as Paul did
not reckon it of much importance in what estimation he was held, provided only
the majesty of his doctrine remained safe and sound, he, on that account, calls
the attention of the Corinthians chiefly to that matter. He intimates, it is
true, that he observed in his whole life the same course of fidelity, as the
Corinthians had seen in his ministry. He seems, however, as if intentionally, in
repelling the calumny, to transfer it from his person to his doctrine, because
he was unwilling that his apostleship should be indirectly defamed, while he was
not greatly concerned as to himself in other respects.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But observe, with what zeal he applies himself to
this. For he calls God to witness, how simple and pure his preaching was &#8212;
not ambiguous, not variable, not temporizing. In his oath, too, he connects the
truth of God with the truth of his doctrine. &#8220;The truth of my preaching is
as sure and stable as God is faithful and true.&#8221; Nor is this to be
wondered at, for the word of God, which Isaiah says <i>endureth for ever,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;234008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
40:8,) is no other than what prophets and apostles published to the world, as
Peter explains it.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:25.) Hence, too, his confidence 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f96</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in denouncing a curse upon angels, if they dared to bring another gospel, one
that was at variance with his.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
1:8.) Who would dare to make the angels of heaven subject to his doctrine, if he
had not God as his authority and defense? With such an assurance of a good
conscience does it become ministers 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f97</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to be endowed, who mount the pulpit to speak the word in Christ&#8217;s name
&#8212; so as to feel assured that their doctrine can no more be overthrown than
God himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Son of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here we have the proof &#8212;
because his preaching 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f98</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
contained nothing but Christ alone, who is the eternal and immutable truth of
God. The clause </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>preached by
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is emphatic. For, as it may be, and
often does happen, that Christ is disfigured by the inventions 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f99</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of men, and is adulterated, as it were, by their disguises, he declares that it
had not been so as to himself or his associates, but that he had sincerely and
with an integrity that was befitting, held forth Christ pure and undisguised.
Why it is that he makes no mention of Apollos, while he mentions by name
Timotheus and Silvanus, does not exactly appear; unless the reason be, as is
probable, that the more that individuals were assailed by the calumnies of the
wicked, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f100</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he was so much the more careful to defend them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In these words, however, he intimates that his whole
doctrine was summed up in a simple acquaintance with Christ alone, as in reality
the whole of the gospel is included in it. Hence those go beyond due limits, who
teach anything else than Christ alone, with whatever show of wisdom they may
otherwise be puffed up. For as he is the <i>end of the law,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:4,) so he is the head &#8212; the sum &#8212; in fine, the consummation
&#8212; of all spiritual doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>second </i>place, he intimates that his
doctrine respecting Christ had not been variable, or ambiguous, so as to present
him from time to time in a new shape after the manner of Proteus; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f101</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as some persons make it their sport to make changes upon him, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f102</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
just as if they were tossing a ball to and fro with their hand, simply for the
purpose of displaying their dexterity. Others, with a view to procure the favor
of men, present him under various forms, while there is still another class,
that inculcate one day what on the next they retract through fear. Such was not
Paul&#8217;s Christ, nor can that of any true apostle 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f103</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
be such. Those, accordingly, have no ground to boast that they are ministers of
Christ, who paint him in various colors with a view to their own advantage. For
he alone is the true Christ, in whom there appears that uniform and unvarying
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yea</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which Paul declares to be characteristic of him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
For all the promises of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> &#8212;
Here again he shows how firm and unvarying the preaching of Christ ought to be,
inasmuch as he is the groundwork 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f104</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the promises of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For it were worse than absurd to
entertain the idea that he, in whom
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all the promises of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>are established, is like one that
wavers. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f105</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now though the statement is general, as we shall see ere long, it is,
notwithstanding, accommodated to the circumstances of the case in hand, with the
view of confirming the certainty of Paul&#8217;s doctrine. For it is not simply
of the gospel in general that he treats, but he honors more especially his own
gospel with this distinction. &#8220;If the promises of God are sure and
well-founded, my preaching also must of necessity be sure, inasmuch as it
contains nothing but Christ, in whom they are all established.&#8221; As,
however, in these words he means simply that he preached a gospel that was
genuine, and not adulterated by any foreign additions, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f106</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
let us keep in view this general doctrine, that all the promises of God rest
upon Christ alone as their support &#8212; a sentiment that is worthy of being
kept in remembrance, and is one of the main articles of our faith. It depends,
however, on another principle &#8212; that it is only in Christ that God the
Father is propitious to us. Now the promises are testimonies of his fatherly
kindness towards us. Hence it follows, that it is in him alone that they are
fulfilled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The promises, I say, are testimonies of Divine grace:
for although God shows kindness even to the unworthy,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420635&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
6:35,) yet when promises are given in addition to his acts of kindness, there is
a special reason &#8212; that in them he declares himself to be a Father.
<i>Secondly, </i>we are not qualified for enjoying the promises of God, unless
we have received the remission of our sins, which we obtain through Christ.
<i>Thirdly, </i>the promise, by which God adopts us to himself as his sons,
holds the first place among them all. Now the cause and root of adoption is
Christ; because God is not a Father to any that are not members and brethren of
his only-begotten Son. Everything, however, flows out from this source &#8212;
that, while we are without Christ, we are hated by God rather than favorably
regarded, while at the same time God promises us everything that he does
promise, because he loves us. Hence it is not to be wondered if Paul here
teaches, that all the promises of God are ratified and confirmed in
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is asked, however, whether they were feeble or
powerless, previously to Christ&#8217;s advent; for Paul seems to speak here of
Christ as <i>manifested in the flesh.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:16.) I answer, that all the promises that were given to believers from
the beginning of the world were founded upon Christ. Hence Moses and the
Prophets, in every instance in which they treat of reconciliation with God, of
the hope of salvation, or of any other favor, make mention of him, and discourse
at the same time respecting his coming and his kingdom. I say again, that the
promises under the Old Testament were fulfilled to the pious, in so far as was
advantageous for their welfare; and yet it is not less true, that they were in a
manner suspended until the advent of Christ, through whom they obtained their
true accomplishment. And in truth, believers themselves rested upon the promises
in such a way, as at the same time to refer the true accomplishment of them to
the appearing of the Mediator, and suspended their hope until that time. In
fine, if any one considers what is the fruit of Christ&#8217;s death and
resurrection, he will easily gather from this, in what respect the promises of
God have been sealed and ratified in him, which would otherwise have had no sure
accomplishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore, also, through him let
there be Amen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here also the Greek
manuscripts do not agree, for some of them have it in one continued statement
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>&#8212; As many promises of God
as there are, are in him Yea, and in him Amen to the glory of God
through</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> us.</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f107</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>The different reading, however, which I have followed, is easier, and
contains a fuller meaning. For as he had said, that, in Christ, God has
confirmed the truth of all his promises, so now he teaches us, that it is our
duty to acquiesce in this ratification. This we do, when, resting upon Christ by
a sure faith, we subscribe and <i>set our seal that God is true, </i>as we read
in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430333&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:33, and that with a view to his glory, as this is the end to which everything
should be referred.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:13, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The other reading, I confess, is the more common one,
but as it is somewhat meagre, I have not hesitated to prefer the one that
contains the fuller meaning, and, besides, is much better suited to the context.
For Paul reminds the Corinthians of their duty &#8212; to utter their <i>Amen
</i>in return, after having been instructed in the simple truth of God. If,
however, any one is reluctant to depart from the other reading, there must, in
any case, be an exhortation deduced from it 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f108</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to a mutual agreement in doctrine and faith.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">God, indeed, is always true and steadfast. in his
promises, and has always his <i>Amen, </i>as often as he speaks. But as for us,
such is our vanity, that we do not utter our Amen in return, except when he
gives a sure testimony in our hearts by his word. This he does by his Spirit.
That is what Paul means here. He had previously taught, that this is a befitting
harmony &#8212; when, on the one hand, <i>the calling of God is without
repentance,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:29,) and we, in our turn, with an unwavering faith, accept of the blessing of
adoption that is held out to us. That God remains steadfast to his promise is
not surprising; but to keep pace with God in the steadfastness of our faith in
return &#8212; <i>that </i>truly is not in man&#8217;s power. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f109</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He teaches us, also, that God cures our weakness or defect, (as they term it,)
when, by correcting our belief, he confirms us by his Spirit. Thus it comes,
that we glorify him by a firm steadfastness of faith. He associates himself,
however, with the Corinthians, expressly for the purpose of conciliating their
affections the better, with a view to the cultivation of unity. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f110</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath anointed
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He employs different terms to
express one and the same thing. For along with <i>confirmation, </i>he employs
the terms <i>anointing </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sealing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or, by this twofold metaphor, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f111</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he explains more distinctly what he had previously stated without a figure. For
God, by pouring down upon us the heavenly grace of the Spirit, does, in this
manner, <i>seal </i>upon our hearts the certainty of his own word. He then
introduces a <i>fourth </i>idea &#8212; that the Spirit has been given to us as
an </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>earnest</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">&#8212; a similitude which he frequently makes use
of, and is also exceedingly appropriate. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f112</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For as the Spirit, in bearing witness of our adoption, is our security, and, by
confirming the faith of the promises, is the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seal</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sfragi&lt;v)</font><font face="Palatino">,
so it is on good grounds that he is called an
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>earnest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f113</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>because it is owing to him, that the covenant of God is ratified on both
sides, which would, but for this, have hung in suspense. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f114</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here we must notice, in the <i>first</i> place, the
relation 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f115</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which Paul requires between the gospel of God and our faith; for as every thing
that God says is more than merely certain, so he wishes that this should be
established in our minds by a firm and sure assent. <i>Secondly, </i>we must
observe that, as an assurance of this nature is a thing that is above the
capacity of the human mind, it is the part of the Holy Spirit to confirm within
us what God promises in his word. Hence it is that he has those titles of
distinction &#8212; the <i>Anointing, </i>the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Earnest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the <i>Comforter, </i>and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seal</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>In the <i>third </i>place we must observe, that all that have not the Holy
Spirit as a witness, so as to return their <i>Amen </i>to God, when calling them
to an assured hope of salvation, do on false grounds assume the name of
Christians.</font><br></div>

reason for his change of purpose; for hitherto he has merely repelled calumny.
When, however, he says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
spared them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he indirectly throws back
the blame upon them, and thus shows them that it would be unfair if he were put
to grief through their fault, but that it would be much more unfair if they
should permit this; but most of all unfair if they should give their assent to
so base a calumny, as in that case they would be substituting in their place an
innocent person, as if he had been guilty of their sin. Now he <i>spared
</i>them in this respect, that if he had come he would have been constrained to
reprove them more severely, while he wished rather that they should of their own
accord repent previously to his arrival, that there might be no occasion for a
harsher remedy, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f118</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which is a signal evidence of more than paternal lenity. For how much
forbearance there was in shunning this necessity, when he had just ground of
provocation!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He makes use, also, of an oath, that he may not seem
to have contrived something to serve a particular purpose. For the matter in
itself was of no small importance, and it was of great consequence that he
should be entirely free from all suspicion of falsehood and pretence. Now there
are two things that make an oath lawful and pious &#8212; the occasion and the
disposition. The <i>occasion </i>I refer to is, where an oath is not employed
rashly, that is, in mere trifles, or even in matters of small importance, but
only where there is a call for it. The <i>disposition </i>I refer to is, where
there is not so much regard had to private advantage, as concern felt for the
glory of God, and the advantage of the brethren: For this end must always be
kept in view, that our oaths may promote the honor of God, and promote also the
advantage of our neighbours in a matter that is befitting.

and obscure, where man&#8217;s knowledge fails, we have recourse to God, that
he, who alone is truth, may bear testimony to the truth. But the man that
appeals to God as his witness, calls upon him at the same time to be an avenger
of perjury, in the event of his declaring what is false. This is what is meant
by the phrase </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>upon my
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>&#8220;I do not object to his
inflicting punishment upon me, if I am guilty of falsehood.&#8221; Although,

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f120</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as to be formidable in your very look? Such were not the gravity of a Christian
pastor, but the cruelty of a savage tyrant.&#8221; He answers this objection
first <i>indirectly, </i>by declaring that matters are not so; and afterwards
<i>directly, </i>by showing that the very circumstance, that he had been
constrained to treat them more harshly, was owing to his fatherly affection.
When he says that he does not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>exercise dominion over their
faith,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he intimates, that such a power
is unjust and intolerable &#8212; nay more, is tyranny in the Church. For faith
ought to be altogether exempt, and to the utmost extent free, from the yoke of
men. We must, however, observe, who it is that speaks, for if ever there was a
single individual of mortals, that had authority to claim for himself such a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dominion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>Paul assuredly was worthy of such a privilege. Yet he acknowledges, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f121</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that it does not belong to him. Hence we infer, that faith owns no subjection
except to the word of God, and that it is not at all in subjection to human
control. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f122</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Erasmus has observed in his Annotations, that by supplying the Greek particle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e[neka</font><font face="Palatino">,
it may be understood in this way &#8212; <i>Not that we exercise dominion over
you &#8212; with respect to your faith &#8212; a </i>rendering which amounts
almost to the same thing. For he intimates, that there is no spiritual dominion,
except that of God only. This always remains a settled point &#8212; pastors
have no peculiar
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dominion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>over men&#8217;s consciences, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f123</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

calls </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>them helpers of their

of a peace that was free, and full of joy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For by faith ye
stand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As to the reason why he adds
this, others either pass it over altogether in silence, or they do not explain
it with sufficient distinctness. For my part, I am of opinion that he here again
argues from contraries. For if the nature and effect of faith be such that we
lean, in order that we may
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stand</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f125</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

chargeable.</font><br></div>

explains, in what manner he had <i>spared </i>them. &#8220;I had
determined,&#8221; says he, &#8220;not to come to you any more in sorrow,&#8221;
or in other words, to occasion you sorrow by my coming. For he had come once by
an Epistle, by means of which he had severely pained them. Hence, so long as
they had not repented, he was unwilling to come to them, lest he should be
constrained to grieve them again, when present with them, for he chose rather to
give them longer time for repentance.

says, that he has such a fellow-feeling with the Corinthians,

that he cannot feel joyful, unless he sees them happy. Nay more, he declares
that they were the source and the authors of his joy &#8212; which they could
not be, if they were themselves sorrowful. If this disposition prevail in
pastors, it will be the best restraint, to keep them back from alarming with
terrors those minds, which they ought rather to have encouraged by means of a
cheerful affability. For from this arises an excessively morose harshness

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:1,) so now also he lets them know, that he came the first time in
sadness by an Epistle, that they might not have occasion to feel this severity
when he was present with them. Hence they have no ground to complain of that
former sadness, in which he was desirous to consult their welfare. He goes even
a step farther, by stating that, when writing, he did not wish to occasion them
grief, or to give any expression of displeasure, but, on the contrary, to give
proof of his attachment and affection towards them. In this way, if there was
any degree of keenness in the Epistle, he does not merely soften it, but even
shows amiableness and suavity. When, however, he confesses afterwards, what he
here denies, he appears to contradict himself. I answer, that there is no
inconsistency, for he does not come afterwards to confess, that it was his
ultimate object to <i>grieve </i>the Corinthians, but that this was the means,
by which he endeavored to conduct them to true joy. Previously, however, to his
stating this, he speaks here simply as to his design. He passes over in silence,
or delays mentioning for a little the means, which were not so
agreeable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having

towards the Corinthians, that they may thus in their turn be persuaded of his

common, there must in that case be perfect love.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For out of much
affliction</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he brings forward
another reason with the view of softening the harshness which he had employed.
For those who smilingly take delight in seeing others weep, inasmuch as they
discover thereby their cruelty, cannot and ought not to be borne with. Paul,
however, declares that; his feeling was very different. &#8220;Intensity of
grief,&#8221; says he, &#8220;has extorted from me every thing that I have
written.&#8221; Who would not excuse, and take in good part what springs from
such a temper of mind, more especially as it was not on his own account or
through his own fault, that he suffered grief, and farther, he does not give
vent to his grief, with the view of lightning himself by burdening them, but
rather, for the purpose of shewing his affection for them? On these accounts, it
did not become the Corinthians to be offended at this somewhat severe
reproof.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tears</i></font><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; which, in a man that is brave and magnanimous are a token of intense
grief. Hence we see, from what emotions of mind pious and holy admonitions and
reproofs must of necessity proceed. For there are many noisy reprovers, who, by
declaiming, or rather, fulminating against vices, display a surprising ardour of
zeal, while in the mean time they are at ease in their mind, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f131</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so that it might seem as if they exercised their throat and sides 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f132</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
by way of sport. It is, however, the part of a pious pastor, to weep within
himself, before he calls upon others to weep: 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f133</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to feel tortured in silent musings, before he shows any token of displeasure;
and to keep within his own breast more grief, than he causes to others. We must,
also, take notice of Paul&#8217;s tears, which, by their abundance, shew
tenderness of heart, but it is of a more heroical character than was the
iron-hearted hardness of the Stoics. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f134</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For the more tender the affections of love are, they are so much the more
praiseworthy.</font><br></div>

comparative sense; and, in that case, it would be a tacit complaint &#8212; that
the Corinthians do not make an equal return in respect of affection, inasmuch as
they love but coldly one by whom they are ardently loved. I take it, however, in
a more simple way, as meaning that Paul commends his affection towards them, in
order that this assurance may soften down every thing of harshness that might be
in his words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if any
one.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here is a <i>third </i>reason with
the view of alleviating the offense &#8212; that he had grief in common with
them, and that the occasion of it came from another quarter. &#8220;We
have,&#8221; says he, &#8220;been alike grieved, and another is to blame for
it.&#8221; At the same time he speaks of that person, too, somewhat mildly, when
he says, <i>if any one</i> &#8212; not affirming the thing, but rather leaving
it in suspense. This passage, however, is understood by some, as if Paul meant
to say: &#8220;He<i> </i>that has given me occasion of grief, has given offense
to you also; for you ought to have felt grieved along with me, and yet I have
been left almost to grieve alone. For I do not wish to say so absolutely &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that I may not put the blame upon
you all.&#8221;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this way the second
clause would contain a correction of the first. Chrysostom&#8217;s exposition,
however, is much more suitable; for he reads it as one continued sentence
&#8212; &#8221;<i>He hath not grieved me alone, but almost all of you. </i>And
as to my saying <i>in part, </i>I do so in order that I may not <i>bear too hard
upon him.&#8221;</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f135</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I differ from Chrysostom merely in the clause <i>in part, </i>for I understand
it as meaning <i>in some measure. </i>I am aware, that Ambrose understands it as
meaning &#8212; part of the saints, inasmuch as the Church of the Corinthians
was divided; but that is more ingenious than solid.</font><br></div>

</i>He now extends kindness even to the man who had sinned more grievously than
the others, and on whose account his anger had been kindled against them all,
inasmuch as they had connived at his crime. In his showing indulgence even to
one who was deserving of severer punishment, the Corinthians have a striking
instance to convince them, how much he disliked excessive harshness. It is true,
that he does not act this part merely for the sake of the Corinthians, but
because he was naturally of a forgiving temper; but still, in this instance of
mildness, the Corinthians could not but perceive his remarkable kindness of
disposition. In addition to this, he does not merely show himself to be
indulgent, but exhorts others to receive him into favor, in the exercise of the
same mildness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us, however, consider these things a little more
minutely. He refers to the man who had defiled himself by an incestuous marriage
with his mother-in-law. As the iniquity was not to be tolerated, Paul had given
orders, that the man should be excommunicated. He had, also, severely reproved
the Corinthians, because they had so long given encouragement to that enormity 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f136</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
by their dissimulation and patient endurance. It appears from this passage, that
he had been brought to repentance, after having been admonished by the Church.
Hence Paul gives orders, that he be forgiven, and that he be also supported by
consolation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage ought to be carefully observed, as it
shows us, with what equity and clemency the discipline of the Church ought to be
regulated, in order that there may not be undue severity. There is need of
strictness, in order that the wicked may not be rendered more daring by
impunity, which is justly pronounced an allurement to vice. But on the other
hand, as there is a danger of the person, who is chastised, becoming dispirited,
moderation must be used as to this &#8212; so that the Church shall be prepared
to extend forgiveness, so soon as she is fully satisfied as to his penitence. In
this department, I find a lack of wisdom on the part of the ancient bishops; and
indeed they ought not to be excused, but on the contrary, we ought rather to
mark their error, that we may learn to avoid it. Paul is satisfied with the
repentance of the offender, that a reconciliation may take place with the
Church. They, on the other hand, by making no account of his repentance, have
issued out canons as to repentance during three years, during seven years, and
in some cases during life. By these they exclude poor unhappy men from the
fellowship of the Church. And, in this way, the offender is either alienated the
more from the Church, or 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f137</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is induced to practice hypocrisy. But even if the enactment were more plausible
in itself, this consideration would, in my view, be enough to condemn it &#8212;
that it is at variance with the rule of the Holy Spirit, which the Apostle here
prescribes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest such an one should be
swallowed up by overmuch sorrow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The end
of excommunication, so far as concerns the power of the offender, is this: that,
overpowered with a sense of his sin, he may be humbled in the sight of God and
the Church, and may solicit pardon with sincere dislike and confession of guilt.
The man who has been brought to this, is now more in need of consolation, than
of severe reproof. Hence, if you continue to deal with him harshly, it will be
&#8212; not discipline, but cruel domineering. Hence we must carefully guard
against pressing them beyond this limit. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f138</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For nothing is more dangerous, than to give Satan a handle, to tempt an offender
to despair. Now we furnish Satan with arms in every instance, in which we leave
without consolation those, who are in good earnest affected with a view of their
sin.</font><br></div>

this purpose.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He anticipates an
objection, that they might bring forward. &#8220;What then did you mean, when
you were so very indignant, because we had not inflicted punishment upon him?
From being so stern a judge, to become all at once a defender &#8212; is not
this indicative of a man, that wavers between conflicting dispositions?&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f139</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This idea might detract greatly from Paul&#8217;s authority; but he answers,
that he has obtained what he asked, and that he was therefore satisfied, so that
he must now give way to compassion. For, their carelessness having been
corrected, there was nothing to hinder their lifting up the man by their
clemency, when now prostrate and downcast.

&#8220;Do not hesitate to forgive: I promise that I shall confirm whatever you
may have done, and I already subscribe your sentence of forgiveness.&#8221;
<i>Secondly</i>, he says that he does this <i>for their sake;</i> and that too,
sincerely and cordially. He had already shown how desirous he was, that the
man&#8217;s welfare should be consulted: he now declares, that he grants this
willingly to the Corinthians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Instead of the expression <i>in the sight of
Christ</i>, some prefer <i>person</i>, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f142</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

and did in a manner represent his person. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f144</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I am, however, more inclined to understand him as declaring, that he forgives
sincerely and without any pretence. For he is accustomed to employ this phrase
to express pure and undisguised rectitude. If, however, any one prefers the
former interpretation, it is to be observed that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>person of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is interposed, because there is nothing
that ought to incline us more to the exercise of mercy. </font><br></div>

fraud of Satan, when depriving us of all consolation, he swallows us up, as it
were, in a gulf of despair; and such is the explanation that is given of it by
Chrysostom. I prefer, however, to view it as referring to Paul and the
Corinthians. For there was a twofold danger, that beset them from the stratagems
of Satan &#8212; in the event of their being excessively harsh and rigorous, or,
on the other hand, in case of dissension arising among them. For it very
frequently happens, that, under colour of zeal for discipline, a Pharisaical
rigour creeps in, which hurries on the miserable offender to ruin, instead of
curing him. It is rather, however, in my opinion, of the <i>second </i>danger
that he speaks; for if Paul had not to some extent favored the wishes of the
Corinthians, Satan would have prevailed by kindling strife among
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we are not ignorant of his
devices</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>That is, &#8220;We know, from
being warned of it by the Lord, that one stratagem to which he carefully has
recourse is, that when he cannot ruin us by open means, he surprises us when off
our guard by making a secret attack. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f146</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As, then, we are aware that he makes an attack upon us by indirect artifices,
and that he assails us by secret machinations, we must look well before us, and
carefully take heed that he may not, from some quarter, do us injury. He employs
the word <i>devices </i>in the sense in which the Hebrews make use of the term
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hmz</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>zimmah</i>,) but in a bad sense, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f147</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as meaning artful schemes and machinations, which ought not to be unknown to
believers, and will not be so, provided they give themselves up to the guidance
of God&#8217;s Spirit. In short, as God warns us, that Satan employs every means
to impose upon us, and, in addition to this, shows us by what methods he may
practice imposture upon us, it is our part to be on the alert, that he may have
not a single chink to creep through.</font><br></div>

Troas</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By now mentioning what he had
been doing in the mean time, in what places he had been, and what route he had
pursued in his journeyings, he more and more confirms what he had said
previously as to his coming to the Corinthians. He says that he had come to
Troas from Ephesus for the sake of the gospel, for he would not have proceeded
in that direction, when going into Achaia, had he not been desirous to pass
through Macedonia. As, however, he did not find Titus there, whom he had sent to
Corinth, and by whom he ought to have been informed respecting the state of that
Church, though he might have done much good there, and though he had an
opportunity presented to him, yet, he says, setting everything aside, he came to
Macedonia, desirous to see Titus. Here is an evidence of a singular degree of
attachment to the Corinthians, that he was so anxious respecting them, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had no
rest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>anywhere, even when a large
prospect of usefulness presented itself, until he had learned the state of their
affairs. Hence it appears why it was that he delayed his coming. He did not wish
to come to them until he had learned the state of their affairs. Hence it
appears, why it was that he delayed his coming. He did not wish to come to them,
until he had first had a conversation with Titus. He afterwards learned from the
report brought him by Titus, that matters were at that time not yet ripe for his
coming to them. Hence it is evident, that Paul loved the Corinthians so much,
that he accommodated all his journeyings and long circuits to their welfare, and
that he had accordingly come to them later than he had promised &#8212; not from
having, in forgetfulness of his promise, rashly changed his plan, or from having
been carried away by some degree of <i>fickleness,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

them.</font><br></div>

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 16:9.) Its meaning is, that an opportunity of promoting the gospel
had presented itself. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f149</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For as an opportunity of entering is furnished when the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>door is
opened,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>so the servants of the Lord make
advances when an opportunity is presented. The <i>door is shut, </i>when no
prospect of usefulness is held out. Now as, on the door being shut, it becomes
us to enter upon a new course, rather than by farther efforts to weary ourselves
to no purpose by useless labor, so where an opportunity presents itself of
edifying, let us consider that by the hand of God a door is opened to us for
introducing Christ there, and let us not withhold compliance with so kind an
indication from God. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f150</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may seem, however, as if Paul had erred in this
&#8212; that disregarding, or at least leaving unimproved, an opportunity that
was placed within his reach, he betook himself to Macedonia. &#8220;Ought he not
rather to have applied himself to the work that he had in hand, than, after
making little more than a commencement, break away all on a sudden in another
direction?&#8221; We have also observed already, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>opening of a
door</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is an evidence of a divine call,
and this is undoubtedly true. I answer, that, as Paul was not by any means
restricted to one Church, but was bound to many at the same time, it was not his
duty, in consequence of the present aspect of one of them, to leave off concern
as to the others. Farther, the more connection he had with the Corinthian
Church, it was his duty to be so much the more inclined to aid it; for we must
consider it to be reasonable, that a Church, which he had founded by his
ministry, should be regarded by him with a singular affection 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f151</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; just as at this day it is our duty, indeed, to promote the welfare of
the whole Church, and to be concerned for the entire body of it; and yet, every
one has, nevertheless, a closer and holier connection with his own Church, to
whose interests he is more particularly devoted. Matters were in an unhappy
state at Corinth, so that Paul was in no ordinary degree anxious as to the
issue. It is not, therefore, to be wondered, if, under the influence of this
motive, he left unimproved an opportunity that in other circumstances was not to
be neglected; as it was not in his power to occupy every post of duty at one and
the same time. It is not, however, at all likely that he left Troas, till he had
first introduced some one in his place to improve the opening that had occurred.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But thanks be to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he again glories in the
success of his ministry, and shows that he had been far from idle in the various
places he had visited; but that he may do this in no invidious way, he sets out
with a thanksgiving, which we shall find him afterwards repeating. Now he does
not, in a spirit of ambition, extol his own actions, that his name may be held
in renown, nor does he, in mere pretense, give thanks to God in the manner of
the Pharisee, while lifted up, in the mean time, with pride and arrogance.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
18:11.) Instead of this, he desires from his heart, that whatever is worthy of
praise, be recognised as the work of God alone, that his power alone may be
extolled. Farther, he recounts his own praises with a view to the advantage of
the Corinthians, that, on hearing that he had served the Lord with so much fruit
in other places, they may not allow his labor to be unproductive among
themselves, and may learn to respect his ministry, which God everywhere rendered
so glorious and fruitful. For what God so illustriously honors, it is criminal
to despise, or lightly esteem. Nothing was more injurious to the Corinthians,
than to have an unfavorable view of Paul&#8217;s Apostleship and doctrine:
nothing, on the other hand, was more advantageous, than to hold both in esteem.
Now he had begun to be held in contempt by many, and hence, it was not his duty
to be silent. In addition to this, he sets this holy boasting in opposition to
the revilings of the wicked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who causeth us to
triumph</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If you render the word
literally, it will be, <i>Qui nos triumphat &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who triumpheth over
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f153</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Paul, however, means something different from what this form of expression
denotes among the Latins. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f154</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For captives are said to be <i>triumphed over, </i>when, by way of disgrace,
they are bound with chains and dragged before the chariot of the conqueror.
Paul&#8217;s meaning, on the other hand, is, that he was also a sharer in the
triumph enjoyed by God, because it had been gained by his instrumentality, just
as the lieutenants accompanied on horseback the chariot of the chief general, as
sharers in the honor. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f155</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As, accordingly, all the ministers of the gospel fight under God&#8217;s
auspices, so they also procure for him the victory and the honor of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>triumph</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f156</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but, at the same time, he honors each of them with a share of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>triumph</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>according to the station assigned him in the army, and proportioned to the
exertions made by him. Thus they enjoy, as it were, a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>triumph</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but it is God&#8217;s rather than theirs. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f157</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>triumphs</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>inasmuch as he has conferred upon him all the glory of empire. Should any
one prefer to render it thus: &#8220;Who triumphs by means of us,&#8221; even in
that way a sufficiently consistent meaning will be made out.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The odor of his
knowledge.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>triumph</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>consisted in this, that God, through his instrumentality, wrought powerfully
and gloriously, perfuming the world with the health-giving <i>odor </i>of his
grace, while, by means of his doctrine, he brought some to the knowledge of
Christ. He carries out, however, the metaphor of <i>odor, </i>by which he
expresses both the delectable sweetness of the gospel, and its power and
efficacy for inspiring life. In the mean time, Paul instructs them, that his
preaching is so far from being saviorless, that it quickens souls by its very
<i>odor. </i>Let us, however, learn from this, that those alone make right
proficiency in the gospel, who, by the sweet fragrance of Christ, are stirred up
to desire him, so as to bid farewell to the allurements of the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He
says</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> in every
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>intimating by these words, that
he went to no place in which he did not gain some fruit, and that, wherever he
went, there was to be seen some reward of his labor. The Corinthians were aware,
in how many places he had previously sowed the seed of Christ&#8217;s gospel. He
now says, that the last corresponded with the first. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f158</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A sweet odor of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The metaphor which he had
applied to the knowledge of Christ, he now transfers to the persons of the
Apostles, but it is for the same reason. For as they are called the <i>light of
the world,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:14,) because they enlighten men by holding forth the torch of the gospel, and
not as if they shone forth upon them with their own lustre; so they have the
name of <i>odor, </i>not as if they emitted any fragrance of themselves, but
because the doctrine which they bring is odoriferous, so that it can imbue the
whole world with its delectable fragrance. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f159</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is certain, however, that this commendation is applicable to all the
ministers of the gospel, because wherever there is a pure and unvarnished
proclamation of the gospel, there will be found <i>there </i>the influence of
that <i>odor, </i>of which Paul here speaks. At the same time, there is no
doubt, that he speaks particularly of himself, and those that were like him,
turning to his own commendation what slanderers imputed to him as a fault. For
his being opposed by many, and exposed to the hatred of many, was the reason why
they despised him. He, accordingly, replies, that faithful and upright ministers
of the gospel have a sweet odor before God, not merely when they quicken souls
by a wholesome savior, but also, when they bring destruction to unbelievers.
Hence the gospel ought not to be less esteemed on that account. &#8220;Both
odors,&#8221; says he, &#8220;are grateful to God &#8212; that by which the
elect are refreshed unto salvation, and that from which the wicked receive a
deadly shock.&#8221; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here we have a remarkable passage, by which we are
taught, that, whatever may be the issue of our preaching, it is,
notwithstanding, well-pleasing to God, if the Gospel is preached, and our
service will be acceptable to him; and also, that it does not detract in any
degree from the dignity of the Gospel, that it does not do good to all; for God
is glorified even in this, that the Gospel becomes an occasion of ruin to the
wicked, nay, it must turn out so. If, however, this is a <i>sweet odor </i>to
God, it ought to be so to us also, or in other words, it does not become us to
be offended, if the preaching of the Gospel is not salutary to all; but on the
contrary, let us reckon, that it is quite enough, if it advance the glory of God
by bringing just condemnation upon the wicked. If, however, the heralds of the
Gospel are in bad odor in the world, because their success does not in all
respects come up to their desires, they have this choice consolation, that they
waft to God the perfume of a sweet fragrance, and what is to the world an
offensive smell, is a <i>sweet odor </i>to God and angels. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f160</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The term <i>odor </i>is very emphatic. &#8220;Such is
the influence of the Gospel in both respects, that it either quickens or kills,
not merely by its taste, but by its very smell. Whatever it may be, it is never
preached in vain, but has invariably an effect, either for life, or for
death.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f161</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But it is asked, how this accords with the nature of the Gospel, which we shall
find him, a little afterwards, calling the <i>ministry </i>of life?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:6.) The answer is easy: The Gospel is preached for salvation: this
is what properly belongs to it; but believers alone are partakers of that
salvation. In the mean time, its being an occasion of condemnation to
unbelievers &#8212; that arises from their own fault. Thus</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Christ came not into the
world to condemn the

<div><font face="Palatino">for what need was there of this, inasmuch as without
him we are all condemned? Yet he sends his apostles to <i>bind, </i>as well as

Gospel,

discharge the office of a good Apostle 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f165</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to Christ is a thing that exceeds all human power, and thus he ascribes the
praise to God. Others think, that he takes notice of the small number of good
ministers. I am of opinion, that there is an implied contrast that is shortly
afterwards expressed. &#8220;Profession, it is true, is common, and many
confidently boast; but to have the reality, is indicative of a rare and
distinguished excellence.

I claim nothing for myself, but what will be discovered to be in me, if trial is
made.&#8221; Accordingly, as those, who hold in common the office of instructor,
claim to themselves indiscriminately the title, Paul, by claiming to himself a
peculiar excellence, separates himself from the herd of those, who had little or
no experience of the influence of the Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we are

openly with the false apostles, and that by way of amplifying, and at the same
time, with the view of excluding them from the praise that he had claimed to
himself. &#8220;It is on good grounds,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that I speak in
honorable terms of my apostleship, for I am not afraid of being convicted of
vanity, if proof is demanded. But many on false grounds arrogate the same thing
to themselves, who will be found to have nothing in common with me. For they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>adulterate the word of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which I dispense with the greatest
faithfulness and sincerity for the edification of the Church.&#8221; I do not
think it likely, however, that those, who are here reproved, preached openly
wicked or false doctrines; but am rather of opinion, that they corrupted the
right use of doctrine, for the sake either of gain or of ambition, so as utterly
to deprive it of energy. This he terms <i>adulterating. </i>Erasmus prefers to
render <i>it &#8212; cauponari &#8212; huckstering</i>. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f167</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kaphleu&gt;ein</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is taken from retailers, or tavern-keepers, who are accustomed to adulterate
their commodities, that they may fetch a higher price. I do not know whether the
word <i>cauponari </i>is used in that sense among the Latins. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f168</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, indeed, certain from the corresponding clause,
that Paul intended to express here &#8212; corruption of doctrine &#8212; not as
though they had revolted from the truth, but because they presented it under
disguise, and not in its genuine purity. For the doctrine of God is corrupted in
two ways. It is corrupted in a <i>direct</i> way, when it is mixed up with
falsehood and lies, so as to be no longer the pure and genuine doctrine of God,
but is falsely commended under that title. It is corrupted <i>indirectly,
</i>when, although retaining its purity, it is turned hither and thither to
please men, and is disfigured by unseemly disguises, by way of hunting after
favor. Thus there will be found some, in whose doctrine there will be no impiety
detected, but as they hunt after the applauses of the world by making a display
of their acuteness and eloquence, or are ambitious of some place, or gape for
<i>filthy lucre,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:8,) or are desirous by some means or other to rise, they,
nevertheless, corrupt the doctrine itself by wrongfully abusing it, or making it
subservient to their depraved inclinations. I am, therefore, inclined to retain
the word <i>adulterate, </i>as it expresses better what ordinarily happens in
the case of all that play with the sacred word of God, as with a ball, and
transform it according to their own convenience. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f169</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For it must necessarily be, that they degenerate from the truth, and preach a
sort of artificial and spurious Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But as of
sincerity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word <i>as </i>here is
superfluous, as in many other places. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f170</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In contrast with the corruption that he had made mention of, he makes use,
<i>first of all</i>, of the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sincerity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which may be taken as referring to the manner of preaching, as well as to
the disposition of the mind. I approve rather of the latter. <i>Secondly, </i>he
places in contrast with it a faithful and conscientious dispensation of it,
inasmuch as he faithfully delivers to the Church from hand to hand, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f171</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as they say, the Gospel which God had committed to him, and had given him in
charge. <i>Thirdly, </i>he subjoins to this a regard to the Divine presence. For
whoever has the three following things, is in no danger of forming the purpose
of corrupting the word of God. The <i>first</i> is &#8212; that we be actuated
by a true zeal for God. The <i>second </i>is &#8212; that we bear in mind that
it is his business that we are transacting, and bring forward nothing but what
has come from him. The <i>third </i>is &#8212; that we consider, that we do
nothing of which he is not the witness and spectator, and thus learn to refer
every thing to his judgment.</font><br></div>

intention.

also was brought forward against him &#8212; that he was excessively fond of
publishing his own exploits, and brought against him, too, by those who were
grieved to find that the fame, which they were eagerly desirous to obtain, was
effectually obstructed in consequence of his superior excellence. They had
already, in my opinion, found fault with the former Epistle, on this ground,
that he indulged immoderately in commendations of himself. To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>here means to boast foolishly and beyond measure, or at least to recount
one&#8217;s own praises in a spirit of ambition. Paul&#8217;s calumniators had a
plausible pretext &#8212; that it is a disgusting 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f174</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and odious thing in itself for one to be the trumpeter of his own praises. Paul,
however, had an excuse on the ground of <i>necessity, </i>inasmuch as he
gloried, only because he was shut up to it. His design also raised him above all
calumny, as he had nothing in view but that the honor of his apostleship might
remain unimpaired for the edification of the Church; for had not Christ&#8217;s
honor been infringed upon, he would readily have allowed to pass unnoticed what
tended to detract from his own reputation. Besides, he saw that it was very much
against the Corinthians, that his authority was lessened among them. In the
first place, therefore, he brings forward their calumny, letting them know that
he is not altogether ignorant as to the kind of talk, that was current among
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have we
need?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The answer is suited (to use a common
expression) to the person rather than to the thing, though we shall find him
afterwards saying as much as was required in reference to the thing itself. At
present, however, he reproves their malignity, inasmuch as they were displeased,
if he at any time reluctantly, nay even when they themselves constrained him,
made mention of the grace that God had bestowed upon him, while they were
themselves begging in all quarters for epistles, that were stuffed entirely with
flattering commendations. He says that he has no need of commendation in words,
while he is abundantly commended by his deeds. On the other hand, he convicts
them of a greedy desire for glory, inasmuch as they endeavored to acquire favor
through the suffrages of men. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f175</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In this manner, he gracefully and appropriately repels their calumny. We must
not, however, infer from this, that it is absolutely and in itself wrong to
receive recommendations, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f176</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
provided you make use of them for a good purpose. For Paul himself recommends
many; and this he would not have done had it been unlawful. Two things, however,
are required here &#8212; <i>first</i>, that it be not a recommendation that is
elicited by flattery, but an altogether unbiassed testimony; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f177</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and <i>secondly</i>, that it be not given for the purpose of procuring
advancement for the individual, but simply that it may be the means of promoting
the advancement of Christ&#8217;s kingdom. For this reason, I have observed,
that Paul has an eye to those who had assailed him with
calumnies.</font><br></div>

that <i>we </i>have, has its seat in men&#8217;s consciences.&#8221; It may also
be viewed as referring in part to the Corinthians, in this sense: &#8220;Those
that obtain recommendations by dint of entreaty, have not in the conscience what
they carry about written upon paper, and those that recommend others often do so
rather by way of favor than from judgment. We, on the other hand, have the

commendation, that Paul had pronounced to the honor of himself and his
Apostleship, lest he should seem to speak of himself more confidently than was
befitting, he transfers the entire glory to God, from whom he acknowledges that
he has received everything that he has. &#8220;By this boasting,&#8221; says he,

When he thus disclaims all merit, it is not as if he abased himself in merely

work is <i>thought</i>. In other words, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f186</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it has neither the <i>first</i> part of the praise, nor the <i>second</i>; and
yet he does not allow us even <i>this</i>. As it is less

those act, who arrogate to themselves a right <i>will</i>, when Paul does not

For they think to get off by acknowledging that man is not qualified to form
good purposes, while in the mean time they ascribe to him a right apprehension
of the mind, which, with some assistance from God, may effect something of
itself. Paul, on the other hand, declares that man is in want, not merely of

of every thing good.

He had acknowledged himself to be altogether useless. Now he declares, that, by
the grace of God, he has been qualified 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f192</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for an office, for which he was previously unqualified. From this we infer its
magnitude and difficulty, as it can be undertaken by no one, that has not been
previously prepared and fashioned for it by God. It is the Apostle&#8217;s
intention, also, to extol the dignity of the gospel. There is, at the same time,
no doubt, that he indirectly exposes the poverty of those, who boasted in lofty
terms of their endowments, while they were not furnished with so much as a
single drop of heavenly grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not of the letter but of the
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now follows out the
comparison between the law and the gospel, which he had previously touched upon.
It is uncertain, however, whether he was led into this discussion, from seeing,
that there were at Corinth certain perverse 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f193</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
devotees of the law, or whether he took occasion from something else to enter
upon it. For my part, as I see no evidence, that the false apostles had there
confounded the law and the gospel, I am rather of opinion, that, as he had to do
with lifeless declaimers, who endeavored to obtain applause through mere
prating, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f194</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and as he saw, that the ears of the Corinthians were captivated with such
glitter, he was desirous to show them what was the chief excellence of the
gospel, and what was the chief praise of its ministers. Now this he makes to
consist in the efficacy of the Spirit. A comparison between the law and the
gospel was fitted in no ordinary degree to show this. This appears to me to be
the reason why he came to enter upon it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, however, no doubt, that by the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>letter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he means the Old Testament, as by the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he means the gospel; for, after having called himself a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>minister of the New
Testament</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he immediately adds, by way
of exposition, that he is a <i>minister of the spirit, </i>and contrasts the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>letter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>with the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>We must now enquire into the reason of this designation. The exposition
contrived by Origen has got into general circulation &#8212; that by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>letter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>we ought to understand the grammatical and genuine meaning of Scripture, or
the <i>literal </i>sense, (as they call it,) and that by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is meant the allegorical meaning, which is commonly reckoned to be the
<i>spiritual </i>meaning. Accordingly, during several centuries, nothing was
more commonly said, or more generally received, than this &#8212; that Paul here
furnishes us with a key for expounding Scripture by allegories, while nothing is
farther from his intention. For by the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>letter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he means outward preaching, of such a kind as does not reach the heart; and,
on the other hand, by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he means living doctrine, of such a nature as <i>worketh effectually
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;520213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 2:13)on the minds of men, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f195</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
through the grace of the Spirit. By the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>letter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>therefore, is meant <i>literal </i>preaching &#8212; that is, <i>dead
</i>and <i>ineffectual, </i>perceived only by the ear. By the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>on the other hand, is meant <i>spiritual </i>doctrine, that is, what is not
merely uttered with the mouth, but effectually makes its way to the souls of men
with a lively feeling. For Paul had an eye to the passage in Jeremiah, that I
quoted a little ago,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;243131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:31,) where the Lord says, that his law had been proclaimed merely with the
mouth, and that it had, therefore, been of short duration, because the people
did not embrace it in their heart, and he promises the Spirit of regeneration
under the reign of Christ, to write his gospel, that is, the new covenant, upon
their hearts. Paul now makes it his boast, that the accomplishment of that
prophecy is to be seen in his preaching, that the Corinthians may perceive, how
worthless is the loquacity of those vain boasters, who make incessant noise 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f196</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
while devoid of the efficacy of the Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is asked, however, whether God, under the Old
Testament, merely sounded forth in the way of an external voice, and did not
also speak inwardly to the hearts of the pious by his Spirit. I answer in the
<i>first </i>place, that Paul here takes into view what belonged peculiarly to
the law; for although God then wrought by his Spirit, yet that did not take its
rise from the ministry of Moses, but from the grace of Christ, as it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:17 &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The law was given by
Moses;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">but grace and truth came by
Jesus Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">True, indeed, the grace of God did not, during all
that time, lie dormant, but it is enough that it was not a benefit that belonged
to the law. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f197</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For Moses had discharged his office, when he had delivered to the people the
doctrine of life, adding threatenings and promises. For this reason he gives to
the law the name of the <i>letter, </i>because it is in itself a dead preaching;
but the gospel he calls <i>spirit, </i>because the ministry of the gospel is
<i>living, </i>nay, <i>lifegiving. </i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I answer <i>secondly, </i>that these things are not
affirmed absolutely in reference either to the law or to the gospel, but in
respect of the contrast between the one and the other; for even the gospel is
not always
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>When, however, we come to compare the two, it is truly and properly
affirmed, that the nature of the law is to teach men <i>literally, </i>in such a
way that it does not reach farther than the ear; and that, on the other hand,
the nature of the gospel is to teach <i>spiritually, </i>because it is the
instrument of Christ&#8217;s grace. This depends on the appointment of God, who
has seen it meet to manifest the efficacy of his Spirit more clearly in the
gospel than in the law, for it is his work exclusively to teach effectually the
minds of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When Paul, however, calls himself a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Minister of the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he does not mean by this, that
the grace of the Holy Spirit and his influence, were tied to his preaching, so
that he could, whenever he pleased, breathe forth the Spirit along with the
utterance of the voice. He simply means, that Christ blessed his ministry, and
thus accomplished what was predicted respecting the gospel. It is one thing for
Christ to connect his influence with a man&#8217;s doctrine. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f198</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and quite another for the man&#8217;s doctrine 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f199</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to have such efficacy of itself. We are, then, <i>Ministers of the Spirit,
</i>not as if we held him inclosed within us, or as it were captive &#8212; not
as if we could at our pleasure confer his grace upon all, or upon whom we
pleased &#8212; but because Christ, through our instrumentality, illuminates the
minds of men, renews their hearts, and, in short, regenerates them wholly. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f200</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is in consequence of there being such a connection and bond of union between
Christ&#8217;s grace and man&#8217;s effort, that in many cases <i>that </i>is
ascribed to the minister which belongs exclusively to the Lord. For in that case
it is not the mere individual that is looked to, but the entire dispensation of
the gospel, which consists, on the one hand, in the secret influence of Christ,
and, on the other, in man&#8217;s outward efforts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the letter
killeth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This passage was mistakingly
perverted, first by Origen, and afterwards by others, to a spurious
signification. From this arose a very pernicious error &#8212; that of imagining
that the perusal of Scripture would be not merely useless, but even injurious, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f201</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
unless it were drawn out into allegories. This error was the source of many
evils. For there was not merely a liberty allowed of adulterating the genuine
meaning of Scripture, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f202</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but the more of audacity any one had in this manner of acting, so much the more
eminent an interpreter of Scripture was he accounted. Thus many of the ancients
recklessly played with the sacred word of God, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f203</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as if it had been a ball to be tossed to and fro. In consequence of this, too,
heretics had it more in their power to trouble the Church; for as it had become
general practice to make any passage whatever 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f204</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
mean anything that one might choose, there was no frenzy so absurd or monstrous,
as not to admit of being brought forward under some pretext of allegory. Even
good men themselves were carried headlong, so as to contrive very many mistaken
opinions, led astray through a fondness for allegory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning of this passage, however, is as follows
&#8212; that, if the word of God is simply uttered with the mouth, it is an
occasion of death, and that it is <i>lifegiving, </i>only when it is received
with the heart. The terms
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>letter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>therefore, do not refer to the exposition of the word, but to its influence
and fruit. Why it is that the doctrine merely strikes upon the ear, without
reaching the heart, we shall see presently.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if the ministry of
death.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now sets forth the dignity of
the gospel by this argument &#8212; that God conferred distinguished honor upon
the law, which, nevertheless, is nothing in comparison with the gospel. The law
was rendered illustrious by many miracles. Paul, however, touches here upon one
of them merely &#8212; that the face of Moses shone with such splendor as
dazzled the eyes of all. That splendour was a token of the glory of the law. He
now draws an argument from the less to the greater &#8212; that it is befitting,
that the glory of the gospel should shine forth with greater lustre, inasmuch as
it is greatly superior to the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>first</i> place, he calls the law the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ministry of
death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. Secondly, </i>he says, that the
doctrine of it was written in letters, and with ink. <i>Thirdly, </i>that it was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>engraven on
stones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. Fourthly, </i>that it was not of
perpetual duration; but, instead of this, its condition was temporary and
fading. And, <i>fifthly, </i>he calls it the ministry of <i>condemnation. </i>To
render the antitheses complete, it would have been necessary for him to employ
as many corresponding clauses in reference to the gospel; but, he has merely
spoken of it as being the <i>ministry of the Spirit, </i>and
of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and as enduring for ever.
If you examine the <i>words, </i>the correspondence is not complete, but so far
as the matter itself is concerned, what is expressed is sufficient. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f205</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For he had said that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit
giveth life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and farther, that
men&#8217;s <i>hearts </i>served instead of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>disposition</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in the place of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ink</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now briefly examine those attributes of the
law and the gospel. Let us, however, bear in mind, that he is not speaking of
the whole of the doctrine that is contained in the law and the Prophets; and
farther, that he is not treating of what happened to the fathers under the Old
Testament, but merely notices what belongs peculiarly to the ministry of Moses.
The law was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>engraven on
stones</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and hence it was a literal
doctrine. This defect of the law required to be corrected by the gospel, because
it could not but be brittle, so long as it was merely engraven on tables of
stone. The gospel, therefore, is a holy and inviolable covenant, because it was
contracted by the Spirit of God, acting as security. From this, too, it follows,
that the law was the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ministry of
condemnation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for when men are instructed as to their duty, and hear it declared, that all
who do not render satisfaction to the justice of God are cursed,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;052726&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
27:26,) they are convicted, as under sentence of sin and death. From the law,
therefore, they derive nothing but a condemnation of this nature, because God
there demands what is due to him, and at the same time confers no power to
perform it. The gospel, on the other hand, by which men are regenerated, and are
reconciled to God, through the free remission of their sins, is the ministry of
righteousness, and, consequently, of life also.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, however, a question arises: As the gospel is
the <i>odor of death unto death </i>to some,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:16,) and as Christ is a <i>rock of offense, </i>and a <i>stone of
stumbling set for the ruin of many</i>, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f206</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420234&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
2:34;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:8,) why does he represent, as belonging exclusively to the law, what is
common to both? Should you reply, that it happens accidentally that the gospel
is the source of death, and, accordingly, it the occasion of it rather than the
cause, inasmuch as it is in its own nature salutary to all, the difficulty will
still remain unsolved; for the same answer might be returned with truth in
reference to the law. For we hear what Moses called the people to bear witness
to &#8212; that he had set before them life and death.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;053015&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
30:15.) We hear what Paul himself says in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:10 &#8212; that the law has turned out to our ruin, not through any fault
attaching to it, but in consequence of our wickedness. Hence, as the entailing
of condemnation upon men is a thing that <i>happens </i>alike to the law and the
gospel, the difficulty still remains.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">My answer is this &#8212; that there is,
notwithstanding of this, a great difference between them; for although the
gospel is an occasion of condemnation to many, it is nevertheless, on good
grounds, reckoned the doctrine of life, because it is the instrument of
regeneration, and offers to us a free reconciliation with God. The law, on the
other hand, as it simply prescribes the rule of a good life, does not renew
men&#8217;s hearts to the obedience of righteousness, and denounces everlasting
death upon transgressors, can do nothing but <i>condemn</i>. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f207</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Or if you prefer it in another way, the office of the law is to show us the
disease, in such a way as to show us, at the same time, no hope of cure: the
office of the gospel is, to bring a remedy to those that were past hope. For as
the law leaves man to himself, it condemns him, of necessity, to death; while
the gospel, bringing him to Christ, opens the gate of life. Thus, in one word,
we find that it is an accidental property of the law, that is perpetual and
inseparable, that it <i>killeth; </i>for as the Apostle says elsewhere,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:10,)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">All that remain under the
law are subject to the curse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It does, not, on the other hand, invariably happen to
the gospel, that it <i>kills, </i>for in it is</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">revealed the
righteousness of God from faith to faith, and therefore it is the power of God
unto salvation to every one that believeth.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
1:17,18.)</font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f208</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It remains, that we consider the last of the
properties that are ascribed. The Apostle says, that the law was but for a time,
and required to be abolished, but that the gospel, on the other hand, remains
for ever. There are various reasons why the ministry of Moses is pronounced
transient, for it was necessary that the shadows should vanish at the coming of
Christ, and that statement &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The law and the Prophets
were until John
&#8212;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
11:13)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8212; applies to more than the mere shadows. For it
intimates, that Christ has put an end to the ministry of Moses, which was
peculiar to him, and is distinguished from the gospel. Finally, the Lord
declares by Jeremiah, that the weakness of the Old Testament arose from this
&#8212; that it was not engraven on men&#8217;s hearts.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;243132&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:32,33.) For my part, I understand that abolition of the law, of which mention
is here made, as referring to the whole of the Old Testament, in so far as it is
opposed to the gospel, so that it corresponds with the statement &#8212; <i>The
law and the Prophets were until John. </i>For the context requires this. For
Paul is not reasoning here as to mere ceremonies, but shows how much more
powerfully the Spirit of God exercises his power in the gospel, than of old
under the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So that they could not
look.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He seems to have had it in view to
reprove, indirectly, the arrogance of those, who despised the gospel as a thing
that was excessively mean, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f209</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so that they could scarcely deign to give it a direct look. &#8220;So
great,&#8221; says he, &#8220;was the splendor of the law, that the Jews could
not endure it. What, then, must we think of the gospel, the dignity of which is
as much superior to that of the law, as Christ is more excellent than
Moses?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What was rendered
glorious.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is not a correction of
what goes before, but rather a confirmation; for he means that the glory of the
law is extinguished when the gospel comes forth. As the moon and stars, though
in themselves they are not merely luminous, but diffuse their light over the
whole earth, do, nevertheless, disappear before the brightness of the sun; so,
however glorious the law was in itself, it has, nevertheless, no glory in
comparison with the excellence of the gospel. Hence it follows, that we cannot
sufficiently prize, or hold in sufficient esteem the glory of Christ, which
shines forth in the gospel, like the splendor of the sun when beaming forth; and
that the gospel is foolishly handled, nay more, is shamefully profaned, where
the power and majesty of the Spirit do not come forth to view, so as to draw up
men&#8217;s minds and hearts heavenward.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having therefore this
hope.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he advances still farther,
for he does not treat merely of the nature of the law, or of that enduring
quality of which we have spoken, but also of its abuse. True, indeed, this also
belonged to its nature, that, being covered with a veil, it was not so manifest
to the eye, and that by its brightness it inspired terror, and accordingly Paul
says elsewhere, what amounts to the same thing &#8212; that the people of Israel
had <i>received </i>from it the <i>spirit of bondage unto fear.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:15.) Here, however, he speaks rather of an abuse that was foreign and
adventitious. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f214</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
There was at that time in all quarters a grievous stumbling-block arising from
the wantonness of the Jews, inasmuch as they obstinately rejected Christ. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f215</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In consequence of this, weak consciences were shaken, being in doubt, whether
they should embrace Christ, inasmuch as he was not acknowledged by the chosen
people. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f216</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This kind of scruple the Apostle removes, by instructing them, that their
blindness had been prefigured even from the beginning, inasmuch as they could
not behold the face of Moses, except through the medium of a <i>veil. </i>As,
therefore, he had stated previously, that the law was rendered glorious by the
lustre of Moses&#8217; countenance, so now he teaches, that the <i>veil </i>was
an emblem of the blindness that was to come upon the people of Israel, for the
person of Moses represents the law. The Jews, therefore, acknowledged by this,
that they had not eyes to behold the law, except when veiled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This <i>veil, </i>he adds, is not taken away, except
by Christ. From this he concludes, that none are susceptible of a right
apprehension, but those who direct their minds to Christ. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f217</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In the <i>first </i>place, he draws this distinction between the law and the
Gospel &#8212; that the brightness of the former rather dazzled men&#8217;s
eyes, than enlightened them, while in the latter, Christ&#8217;s glorious face
is clearly beheld. He now triumphantly exults, on the ground that the majesty of
the Gospel is not terrific, but amiable 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f218</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; is not hid, but is manifested familiarly to all. The term
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">parjrJhsi&gt;a
</font><font face="Palatino"><i>confidence, </i>he employs here, either as
meaning an elevated magnanimity of spirit, with which all ministers of the
Gospel ought to be endowed, or as denoting an open and full manifestation of
Christ; and this second view is the more probable, for he contrasts this
<i>confidence </i>with the obscurity of the law.

to the intention of Moses. For as it was his office, to publish the law to his
people, so, there can be no doubt that he was desirous, that its true meaning
should be apprehended by all, and that he did not intentionally involve his
doctrine in obscurity, but that the fault was on the part of the people. As,
therefore, he could not renew the minds of the hearers, he was contented with
faithfully discharging the duty assigned to him. Nay more, the Lord having
commanded him to put a <i>veil </i>between his face and the eyes of the
beholders, he obeyed. Nothing, therefore, is said here to the dishonor of Moses,
for he was not required to do more than the commission, that was assigned to
him, called for. In addition to this, that bluntness, or that weak and obtuse
vision, of which Paul is now speaking, is confined to unbelievers exclusively,
because the law though wrapt up in figures,

dulness of vision was not for a single hour merely, but prefigured what the

is in itself bright, but it is only when Christ. appears to us in it, that we
enjoy its splendor. The Jews turn away their eyes as much as they can from
Christ. It is not therefore to be wondered, if they see nothing, refusing as
they do to behold the sun. This blindness on the part of the chosen people,
especially as it is so long continued, admonishes us not to be lifted up with
pride, relying on the benefits that God has conferred upon us. This point is
treated of in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where the Spirit of the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now describes the manner, in
which Christ gives life to the law &#8212; by giving us his Spirit. The term
<i>Spirit </i>here has a different signification from what it had in the
preceding verse. <i>There, </i>it denoted the soul, and was ascribed
metaphorically to Christ. <i>Here, </i>on the other hand, it means the Holy
Spirit, that Christ himself confers upon his people. Christ, however, by
regenerating us, gives life to the law, and shows himself to be the fountain of
life, as all vital functions proceed from man&#8217;s soul. Christ, then, is to
all (so to speak) the universal soul, not in respect of essence, but in respect
of grace. Or, if you prefer it, Christ is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because he quickens us by the
life-giving influence of his Spirit.

liberty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I do not understand merely
emancipation from the servitude of sin, and of the flesh, but also that
confidence, which we acquire from His bearing witness as to our adoption. For it

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">We have not again
received the spirit of bondage, to fear, etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
8:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In that passage, the Apostle makes mention of two
things &#8212; <i>bondage, </i>and <i>fear</i>. The opposites of these
are</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
liberty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and <i>confidence. </i>Thus I
acknowledge, that the inference drawn from this passage by Augustine is correct
&#8212; that we are by nature the slaves of sin, and are made free by the grace
of regeneration. For, where there is nothing but the bare letter of the law,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>will be only the dominion of sin, but the
term</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Liberty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as I have said, I take in a
more extensive sense. The grace of the Spirit might, also, be restricted more
particularly to ministers, so as to make this statement correspond with the
commencement of the chapter, for ministers require to have another grace of the
Spirit, and another liberty from what others have. The former signification,
however, pleases me better, though at the same time I have no objection, that
this should be applied to every one according to the measure of his gift. It is
enough, if we observe, that Paul here points out the efficacy of the Spirit,
which we experience for our salvation &#8212; as many of us, as have been
regenerated by his grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But we all, with unveiled
face</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I know not how it had come into the mind
of Erasmus, to apply to ministers exclusively, what is evidently common to all
believers. The word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">katoptrizesqai</font><font face="Palatino">,
it is true, has a double signification among the Greeks, for it sometimes means
to hold out a mirror to be looked into, and at other times to look into a mirror
when presented. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f232</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The old interpreter, however, has correctly judged, that the <i>second</i> of
these is the more suitable to the passage before us. I have accordingly followed
his rendering. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f233</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Nor is it without good reason, that Paul has added a term of universality
&#8212; &#8220;<i>We all</i>,&#8221; says he; for he takes in the whole body of
the Church. It is a conclusion that suits well with the doctrine stated
previously &#8212; that we have in the gospel a clear revelation from God. As to
this, we shall see something farther in the <i>fourth</i>
chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He points out, however, at the same time, both the
strength of the revelation, and our daily progress. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f234</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For he has employed such a similitude to denote <i>three </i>things:
<i>first<b>,</b> </i>That we have no occasion to fear obscurity, when we
approach the gospel, for God <i>there </i>clearly discovers to us His face; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f235</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>secondly, </i>That it is not befitting, that it should be a dead
contemplation, but that we should be transformed by means of it into the image
of God; and, <i>thirdly, </i>that the one and the other are not accomplished in
us in one moment, but we must be constantly making progress both in the
knowledge of God, and in conformity to His image, for this is the meaning of the
expression &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from glory to
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he adds, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as by the Spirit of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he again reminds of what he had
said &#8212; that the whole excellence of the gospel depends on this, that it is
made life-giving to us by the grace of the Holy Spirit. For the particle of
comparison &#8212; <i>as, </i>is not employed to convey the idea of something
not strictly applicable, but to point out the manner. Observe, that the design
of the gospel is this &#8212; that the image of God, which had been effaced by
sin, may be stamped anew upon us, and that the advancement of this restoration
may be continually going forward in us during our whole life, because God makes
his glory shine forth in us by little and little.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is one question that may be proposed here.
&#8220;Paul says, that we behold God&#8217;s face with an unveiled face, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f236</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
while in the former Epistle we find it stated, that we do not, for the present,
know God otherwise than through a mirror, and in an obscure manner.&#8221; In
these statements there is an appearance of contrariety. They are, however, by no
means at variance. The knowledge that we have of God for the present is obscure
and slender, in comparison with the glorious view that we shall have on occasion
of Christ&#8217;s last coming. At the same time, He presents Himself to us at
present, so as to be seen by us, and openly beheld, in so far as is for our
advantage, and in so far as our capacity admits of. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f237</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence Paul makes mention of progress being made, inasmuch as there will <i>then
</i>only be perfection.</font><br></div>

that he had reached such a pinnacle of honor, but had been led forward by the
mercy of God exclusively. Now there was more implied in making the <i>mercy

he, on the other hand, indirectly reproves the false Apostles, who, while they
corrupted by their ambition the genuine excellence<i> </i>of the gospel, were,
nevertheless, desirous of exclusive distinction. Hence the faults, from which he
declares himself to be exempt, he indirectly imputes to them. By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hidden things of
disgrace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or <i>concealments, </i>some
understand the shadows of the Mosaic law. Chrysostom understands the expression
to mean the vain show, by which they endeavored to recommend themselves. I
understand by it &#8212; all the disguises, with which they adulterated the pure
and native beauty of the gospel. For as chaste and virtuous women, satisfied
with the gracefulness of natural beauty, do not resort to artificial adornings,
while harlots never think themselves sufficiently adorned, unless they have
corrupted nature, so Paul glories in having set forth the pure gospel, while
others set forth one that was disguised, and covered over with unseemly
additions. For as they were ashamed of the simplicity of Christ, or at least
could not have distinction 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f243</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from true excellencies of Apostles, they framed a new gospel, not unlike a
profane philosophy, swelled up with empty bombast, while altogether devoid of
the efficacy of the Spirit. Spurious ornaments of this nature, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f244</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
by which the gospel is disfigured, he calls the <i>concealments of disgrace,
</i>because the nakedness of those, who have recourse to concealments and
disguises, must of necessity be dishonorable and disgraceful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to himself, he says that he rejects or disdains
disguises, because Christ&#8217;s face, the more that it is seen opened up to
view in his preaching, shines forth so much the more gloriously. I do not,
however, deny, that he alludes at the same time to the veil of Moses,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;023433&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
34:33,) of which he had made mention, but he ascribes a quite different veil to
the false Apostles. For Moses covered his face, because the excessive brightness
of the glory of the law could not be endured by tender and blear eyes. They, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f245</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
on the other hand, put on a veil by way of ornament. Besides, as they would be
despicable, nay, infamous, if the simplicity of the gospel shone forth, they, on
this account, hide their shame under ever so many cloaks and
masks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not walking in
craftiness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There can be no doubt, that
the false Apostles delighted themselves greatly in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>craftiness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>that Paul reproves, as though it had been a distinguished excellence, as we
see even at this day some, even of those who profess the gospel, who would
rather be esteemed subtile than sincere, and sublime rather than solid, while in
the mean time all their refinement is mere childishness. But what would you do?
It delights them to have a name for acuteness, and they have, under that
pretext, applause among the ignorant. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f246</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We learn, however, in what estimation Paul holds this appearance of excellence.

to the judgment-seat of God, whereas they abused the mistaken judgment of men,
or their corrupt affection, and were not so desirous to be in reality worthy of
praise as they were eager to appear so. Hence we infer, that there is a contrast
here between the <i>consciences </i>of men and their <i>ears. </i>Let the
servants of Christ, therefore, reckon it enough to have approved their integrity
to the

might have been an easy thing to pour calumny upon what he had said as to the
clearness of his preaching, because he had many adversaries. That calumny he
repels with stern authority, for he threatens all who do not acknowledge the

that men have light enough for their use; but when Christ is disjoined from it,
there is nothing left but darkness, or a false appearance of light, that dazzles
men&#8217;s eyes instead of assisting them. It is, however, a token of great
confidence, that he ventures to regard as reprobates all that reject his

Hilary, as he had to do with Arians, who abused this passage, so as to make it a
pretext for denying Christ&#8217;s true divinity, while they at the same time
confessed him to be God, twists the text in this way<i> &#8212; </i>&#8221;God

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f254</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>What influenced Ambrose does not appear. Augustine had the same reason as
Chrysostom, having to contend with the Manicheans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see what the heat of controversy does in carrying

to refute them, than to investigate Paul&#8217;s meaning. But what occasion was
there for this? For the subterfuge of the Arians was childish &#8212; that if
the devil is called the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>god of

ground of his having dominion over them, and being worshipped by them in the

to the Manicheans, this appellation gives no more countenance to the Manicheans,

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f258</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
nay, he is called <i>God blessed for ever.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450905&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:5.) He is said to be that God who was</font><br></div>

world.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John

<div><font face="Palatino">The devil, on the other hand, is called
the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> god of this

Egypt. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f259</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Manicheans, as I have said, for maintaining their delusion, have recourse to
other declarations of Scripture, as well as this, but there is no difficulty in
refuting those also. They contend not so much respecting the <i>term, </i>as
respecting the <i>power. </i>As the <i>power </i>of <i>blinding </i>is ascribed
to Satan, and dominion over unbelievers, they conclude from this that he is,
from his own resources, the author of all evil, so as not to be subject to
God&#8217;s control &#8212; as if Scripture did not in various instances
declare, that devils, no less than the angels of heaven, are servants of God,
each of them severally in his own manner. For, as the latter dispense to us
God&#8217;s benefits for our salvation, so the former execute his wrath. Hence
good angels are called <i>powers </i>and <i>principalities,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:10,) but it is simply because they exercise the power given them by God. For
the same reason Satan is <i>the prince of this world, </i>not as if he conferred
dominion upon himself, or obtained it by his own right, or, in fine, exercised
it at his own pleasure. On the contrary, he has only so much as the Lord allows
him. Hence Scripture does not merely make mention of the good spirit of God, and
good angels, but he also speaks of evil spirits of God. <i>An</i> <i>evil spirit
from God came upon Saul.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;091614&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 16:14.) Again, chastisements through means of <i>evil angels.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;197849&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
78:49.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With respect to the passage before us, the
<i>blinding </i>is a work common to God and to Satan, for it is in many
instances ascribed to God; but the <i>power </i>is not alike, nor is the
<i>manner </i>the same. I shall not speak at present as to the manner.
Scripture, however, teaches that Satan <i>blinds </i>men, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f260</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
not merely with God&#8217;s permission, but even by his command, that he may
execute his vengeance. Thus Ahab was deceived by Satan,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;112221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 22:21,) but could Satan have done this of himself? By no means; but having
offered to God his services for inflicting injury, he was sent to be
a</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">lying spirit in the mouth
of all his
prophets.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;112222&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Kings 22:22.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nay more, the reason why God is said to <i>blind
</i>men is, that after having deprived us of the right exercise of the
understanding, and the light of his Spirit, he delivers us over to the devil, to
be hurried forward by him to a <i>reprobate mind,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28,) gives him the power of deception, and by this means inflicts just
vengeance upon us by the minister of his wrath. Paul&#8217;s meaning, therefore,
is, that all are possessed by the devil, who do not acknowledge his doctrine to
be the sure truth of God. For it is more severe to call them slaves of the
devil, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f261</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
than to ascribe their blindness to the judgment of God. As, however, he had a
little before adjudged such persons to destruction,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:3,) he now adds that they perish, for no other reason than that
they have drawn down ruin upon themselves, as the effect of their own
unbelief.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest the light of the glorious
gospel of Christ should shine upon them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>This serves to confirm what he had said &#8212; that if any one rejected his
gospel, it was his own blindness that prevented him from receiving it.
&#8220;For nothing,&#8221; says he, &#8220;appears. in it but Christ, and that
not obscurely, but so as to shine forth clearly.&#8221; He adds, that Christ is
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>image of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which he intimates that they
were utterly devoid of the knowledge of God, in accordance with that
statement<i> &#8212;</i></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">He that knoweth not me
knoweth not my
Father.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
14:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then is the reason, why he pronounced so severe
a sentence<i> </i>upon those that had doubts as to his Apostleship &#8212;
because they did not behold Christ, who might there be distinctly beheld. It is
doubtful whether he employed the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the gospel of the glory of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as meaning the glorious gospel,
agreeably<i> </i>to the Hebrew idiom; or whether he means by it &#8212; the
gospel, in which Christ&#8217;s glory shone forth. The <i>second </i>of these
meanings I rather prefer, as having in it more completeness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, however, Christ is called the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>image of the invisible
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>this is not meant merely of his
essence, as being the &#8220;co-essential<i> </i>of the Father,&#8221; as they
speak, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f262</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but rather has a reference to us, because he represents the Father to us. The
Father himself is represented as <i>invisible, </i>because he is in himself not
apprehended by the human understanding. He exhibits himself, however, to us by
his Son, and makes himself in a manner visible. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f263</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I state this, because the ancients, having been greatly incensed against the
Arians, insisted more than was befitting on this point &#8212; how it is that
the Son is inwardly the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>image of
the Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by a secret unity of essence,
while they passed over what is mainly for edification &#8212; in what respects
he is the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>image of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to us, when he manifests to us what
had otherwise been hid in him. Hence the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>image</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>has a reference to us, as we shall see again presently 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f264</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The epithet <i>invisible, </i>though omitted in some Greek manuscripts, I have
preferred to retain, as it is not superfluous 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f265</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we preach not
ourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some make this to be an
instance of <i>Zeugma,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f266</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in this manner: We preach not ourselves to be lords, but God&#8217;s only
Son, whom the Father has set over all things, to be the one Lord. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f267</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I do not, indeed, find fault with that interpretation, but as the expression is
more emphatic
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">(emfatikwtera)</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and has a more extensive signification, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f268</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when it is said, that one <i>preaches himself. </i>I am more inclined to retain
this interpretation, especially as it is almost unanimously approved of. For
there are other ways in which men <i>preach themselves, </i>than by arrogating
to themselves dominion, as for example, when they aim at show, rather than at
edification &#8212; when they are desirous in any way to have distinction
&#8212; when, farther, they make gain of the gospel. Ambition, therefore, and
avarice, and similar vices in a minister, taint the purity of his doctrine, so
that Christ has not there the exclusive distinction. Hence, he that would preach
Christ alone, must of necessity forget himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ourselves your
servants.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Lest any one should mutter out
the objection&#8212;&#8221;But in the mean time you say many things respecting
yourself,&#8221; he answers, that he desires nothing farther, than that he
should be their <i>servant. </i>&#8220;Whatever things I declare respecting
myself (so loftily, and boastfully, in your opinion) have this object in view
&#8212; that I may in Christ <i>serve </i>you advantageously.&#8221; It follows,
that the Corinthians are excessively proud and ungrateful, if they reject this
condition. Nay more, it follows, that they had been previously of a corrupt
judgment, inasmuch as they had not perceived his holy
affection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, however, all pastors of the Church are
admonished as to their state and condition, for by whatever title of honor they
may be distinguished, they are nothing more than the<i> servants </i>of
believers, and unquestionably, they cannot serve Christ, without. serving his
Church at the same time. An honorable servitude, it is true, this is, and
superior to any principality, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f269</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but still it is a <i>servitude, </i>so that Christ alone may be elevated to
distinction &#8212; not encumbered by the shadow of a single rival 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f270</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence it is the part of a good pastor, not merely to keep aloof from all desire
of domineering, but to regard it as the highest pitch of honor, at which he
aspires &#8212; that he may <i>serve </i>the people of God. It is the duty of
the people, on the other hand, to esteem the servants of Christ first of all on
the ground of the dignity of their Master, and then farther on account of the
dignity and excellence of their office, that they may not despise those, whom
the Lord has placed in so illustrious a station.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>
</b><i>God who commanded light to shine out of
darkness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I<i> </i>see that this passage
may be explained in four different ways. In the <i>first </i>place thus:
&#8220;God has </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commanded light to
shine forth out of darkness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>that is, by
the ministry of men, who are in their own nature
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>darkness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>He has brought forward the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>light</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of His gospel into the world.&#8221; <i>Secondly, </i>thus: &#8220;God has
made the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>light</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of the gospel to take the place of the law, which was wrapt up in <i>dark
</i>shadows, and thus, He has brought
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>light</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>out of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>darkness</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221;<i>
</i>Those that are fond of subtleties, would be prepared readily to receive
expositions of that sort, but any one, who will examine the matter more closely,
will perceive, that they do not correspond with the Apostle&#8217;s intention.
The <i>third </i>exposition is that of Ambrose: &#8220;When all things were
involved in darkness, God kindled up the light of His gospel. For mankind were
sunk in the darkness of ignorance, when God on a sudden shone forth upon them by
his gospel.&#8221; The <i>fourth </i>is that of Chrysostom, who is of opinion,
that Paul alluded to the creation of the world, in this way: &#8220;God,<i>
</i>who by his word created light, drawing it, as it were, out of the darkness 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f271</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; that same Being has now enlightened us in a spiritual manner, when we
were buried in darkness.&#8221; This transition, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f272</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from light that is visible and corporeal to what is spiritual, has more of
elegance, and there is nothing forced in it. The preceding one, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f273</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
however, is not unsuitable. Let every one follow his own
judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hath shined in our
hearts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He speaks of a twofold
illumination, which must be carefully observed &#8212; the one is that of the
gospel, the other is secret, taking place in our hearts. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f274</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For as God, the Creator of the world, pours forth upon us the brightness of the
sun, and gives us eyes to receive it, so, as the Redeemer, in the person of his
Son, He shines forth, indeed, upon us by His gospel, but, as we are blind, that
would be in vain, if He did not at the same time enlighten our understandings by
His Spirit. His meaning, therefore, is, that God has, by His Spirit, opened the
eyes of our understandings, so as to make them capable of receiving the light of
the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the face of Jesus
Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the same sense in which he
had previously said that Christ is the <i>image of the Father,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:4) he now says, that the glory of God is manifested to us <i>in
his face. </i>Here we have a remarkable passage, from which we learn that God is
not to be <i>sought out
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;180907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
9:7) in His unsearchable height,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(for He dwells in light
that is inaccessible,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;540616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Timothy 6:16,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but is to be known by us, in so far as He manifests
himself in Christ. Hence, whatever men desire to know respecting God, apart from
Christ, is evanescent, for they wander out of the way. True, indeed, God in
Christ appears in the first instance to be mean, but he appears at length to be
glorious in the view of those, who hold on, so as to come from the cross to the
resurrection. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f275</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Again we see, that in the word person 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f276</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>there is a reference made to us, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f277</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because it is more advantageous for us to behold God, as He appears in His
only-begotten Son, than to search out His secret essence.</font><br></div>

The wicked, more particularly, caught hold of this pretext, when they wished to
bring into contempt every thing that was in him. What, however, he saw to be
most of all unfavorable to the honor of his Apostleship among the ignorant, he
turns by an admirable contrivance into a means of advancing it. First of all, he
employs the similitude of a

illustrated, and is the better seen. &#8220;Those,<i> </i>who allege the

dignity of my ministry, are unfair and unreasonable judges, for a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>treasure

which it is deposited, is not a precious one. Nay more, it is usual for great
<i>treasures </i>to be laid up in earthen pots. Farther, they do not consider,
that it is ordered by the special Providence of God, that there should be in
ministers no appearance of excellence, lest any thing of distinction should
throw the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> power of

abasement of ministers, and the outward contempt of their persons give occasion

<div><font face="Palatino">Paul, however, does not speak merely of the universal

He says more than he had done previously, for he shows, that the very thing that
the false apostles used as a pretext for despising the gospel, was so far from
bringing any degree of contempt upon the gospel, that it tended even to render
it glorious. For he employs the expression<i> &#8212; the mortification of Jesus
Christ &#8212; </i>to<i> </i>denote everything that rendered him contemptible in
the eyes of the world, with the view of preparing him for participating in a
blessed resurrection. In the first place, the sufferings of Christ, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f288</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
however ignominious they may be in the eyes of men, have, nevertheless, more of
honor in the sight of God, than all the triumphs of emperors, and all the pomp
of kings. The end, however, must also be kept in view, that we <i>suffer with
him, </i>that we may be <i>glorified together with him.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450817&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:17.) Hence he elegantly reproves the madness of those, who made his peculiar
fellowship with Christ a matter of reproach. At the same time, the Corinthians
are admonished to take heed, lest they should, while haughtily despising
Paul&#8217;s mean and abject appearance, do an injury to Christ himself, by
seeking an occasion of reproach 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f289</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in his sufferings, which it becomes us to hold in the highest

<div><font face="Palatino">The word rendered <i>mortification,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f290</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>

Scripture. For it often means self-denial, when we renounce the lusts of the
flesh, and are renewed unto obedience to God. Here, however, it means the
afflictions by which we are stirred up to meditate on the termination of the
present life. To make the matter more plain, let us call the former the
<i>inward </i>mortification, and the latter the <i>outward. </i>Both make us
conformed to Christ, the one directly, the other indirectly, so to speak. Paul
speaks of the former in

endurance of the afflictions of this present life, share with Adam, but the
elect have participation with the Son of God, so that all those miseries that
are in their own nature accursed, are helpful to their salvation. All the sons
of God, it is true, have this in common, that they

respect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the life of
Jesus.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here is the best antidote to
adversity &#8212; that as Christ&#8217;s death is the gate of life, so we know

shall be partakers of his life, if in this world we submit to die with
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sentence that immediately follows may be
explained in two ways. If you understand the expression
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>delivered unto
death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as meaning to be incessantly
harassed with persecutions and exposed to dangers, this would be more
particularly applicable to Paul, and those like him, who were openly assailed by
the fury of the wicked. And thus the expression, for Jesus&#8217; sake, will be
equivalent to <i>for the testimony of Christ.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;660109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Revelation
1:9.) As, however, the expression <i>to be daily delivered unto death, </i>means
otherwise &#8212; to have death constantly before our eyes, and to live in such
a manner, that our life is rather a shadow of death, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f293</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I have no objection, that this passage, also, should be expounded in such a way
as to be applicable to all believers, and that, too, to every one in his order.
Paul himself, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450836&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:36, explains in this manner
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;194422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
44:22. In this way <i>for Christ&#8217;s sake </i>would mean &#8212; because
this condition is imposed upon all his members. Erasmus, however, has rendered
it, with not. so much propriety, <i>we who live. </i>The rendering that I have
given is more suitable &#8212; <i>while we live. </i>For Paul means that, so
long as we are in the world, we resemble the dead rather than the
living.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hence death
indeed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is said ironically, because
it was unseemly that the Corinthians should live happily, and in accordance with
their desire, and that they should, free from anxiety, take their ease, while in
the mean time Paul was struggling with incessant hardships. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f294</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Such an allotment would certainly have been exceedingly unreasonable. It was
also necessary that the folly of the Corinthians should be reproved, inasmuch as
they contrived to themselves a Christianity without the cross, and, not content
with this, held in contempt the servants of Christ, because they were not so
effeminate.

foregoing irony. He had represented the condition of the Corinthians as widely
different from his own, (not according to his own judgment, but according to

was pleasant and free from all molestation of the cross, and entertained less
honorable views of him, because his condition was less renowned. Now, however,
he associates himself with them in the hope of the same blessedness.
&#8220;Though<i> </i>God spares you, and deals with you more indulgently, while
he treats me with somewhat more severity, this diversity, nevertheless, will be
no hinderance in the way of the like glorious resurrection awaiting both of us.

has been thought, that the Apostle speaks here of the holy fathers, who lived
under the Old Testament, and represents them as partakers with us, in the same
faith. This, indeed, is true, but it does not accord with the subject in hand.
For it is not Abraham, or the rest of the fathers, that he associates with
himself in a fellowship of faith, but rather the Corinthians, whereas they
separated themselves from him by a perverse ambition. &#8220;However<i> </i>my

the connection attentively, will perceive,<i> </i>that this is the true and

is, that he quotes the testimony of David. It ought, however, to be taken in
connection with the confession &#8212; not with the oneness of faith, or if you
prefer it, it agrees with what follows &#8212; not with what goes before, in
this way: &#8220;Because we have an assured hope of a blessed resurrection, we

where David acknowledges, that, when he had been reduced to the last extremity,
he was so overpowered that he almost gave way, but, having soon afterwards
regained confidence, he had overcome<i> </i>that temptation. Accordingly, he
opens the Psalm thus: <i>I believed, therefore will I speak. </i>For faith is
the mother

the Corinthians, not merely in the hope of future blessedness, but also in these
very afflictions, in which they might seem to differ from him most widely, for
he lets them know, that, if he is afflicted, it is for their benefit. Hence it
follows, that there was good reason why they should transfer part of them to
themselves. What Paul states, depends <i>first </i>of all on that secret
fellowship, which the members of Christ have with one another, but
<i>chiefly</i> on that mutual connection and relationship, which required more
especially<i> </i>to be manifested among them. Now this admonition was fraught
with great utility to the Corinthians, and brought with it choice consolation.
For what consolation there is in this &#8212; that while God, sparing our
weakness, deals with us more gently, those that are endowed with more
distinguished excellence, are afflicted for the common advantage of all! They
were also admonished, that, since they could not aid Paul otherwise, they
should, at least, help him by their prayers and sympathy.</font><br></div>

springs from it &#8212; its tendency to advance the glory of God. By a metonymy,

confined to himself personally, so that he alone enjoys it, but it extends
itself farther &#8212; namely, to the Corinthians, to whom it was of great
advantage. When he makes the overflowing of God&#8217;s gift consist in
gratitude, tending to the glory of its Author, he admonishes us, that every
blessing that God confers upon us perishes through our carelessness, if we are
not prompt and active in rendering thanks.</font><br></div>

&#8220;There is no cause,&#8221; says he, <i>&#8220;</i>why<i> </i>we should
lose heart, or sink down under the burden of the cross, the issue of which is
not merely so desirable to myself, but is also salutary to others.&#8221; Thus
he exhorts the Corinthians to fortitude by his own example, should they happen
at any time to be similarly afflicted. Farther, he beats down that insolence, in
which they in no ordinary degree erred, inasmuch as under the influence of
ambition, they held a man in higher estimation, the farther he was from the

requisite for keeping up the condition of the present life, is our
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>outward

we are too much taken up with the present life, so long as everything goes on to
our mind, the Lord, on that account, by taking away from us, by little and
little, the things that we are engrossed with, calls us back to meditate on a
better life. Thus, therefore, it is necessary, that the condition of the present
life should decay,

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f311</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but without anything to compensate for it. In the sons of God, on the other
hand, a decay of this nature is the beginning, and, as it were, the cause of
production. He says that this takes place <i>daily, </i>because God continually
stirs us up to such meditation. Would that this were deeply seated in our minds,
that we might uninterruptedly make progress amidst the decay of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>outward man!</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Momentary
lightness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As our flesh always shrinks
back from its own destruction, whatever reward may be presented to our view, and
as we are influenced much more by present feeling than by the hope of heavenly
blessings, Paul on that account admonishes us, that the afflictions and
vexations of the pious have little or nothing of bitterness, if compared with
the boundless blessings of everlasting glory. He had said, that the decay of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>outward

inasmuch as the renovation of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inward
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>springs out of it. As, however, the
<i>decay </i>is visible, and the <i>renovation </i>is invisible, Paul, with the
view of shaking us off from a carnal attachment to the present life, draws a
comparison between present miseries and future felicity. Now this comparison is
of itself abundantly sufficient for imbuing the minds of the pious with patience
and moderation, that they may not give way, borne down by the burden of the
cross. For whence comes it, that patience is so difficult a matter but from
this, &#8212; that we are confounded on having experience of evils for a brief
period, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f312</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and do not raise our thoughts higher? Paul, therefore, prescribes the best
antidote against your sinking down under the pressure of afflictions, when he
places in opposition to them that future blessedness which is <i>laid up for
thee in heaven.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians

have thought that in both terms the magnitude of the heavenly glory, that awaits
believers is extolled; or, at least, they have connected them with the verb

have made is also not unsuitable, I leave it to my readers to make their
choice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Worketh out an eternal
weight</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Paul does not mean, that this is
the invariable effect of afflictions; for the great majority are most miserably
weighed down here with evils of every kind, and yet that very<i>

to their salvation. As, however, he is speaking of believers, we must restrict
exclusively to them what is here stated; for this is a blessing from God that is

the common miseries of mankind.</font><br></div>

amplification
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">(epexergasia)</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or embellishment of the foregoing statement. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f324</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For Paul has it in view, to correct in us impatience, dread, and dislike of the
cross, contempt for what is mean, and in fine, pride, and effeminacy; and this
can only be accomplished by raising up our minds as high as heaven, through
contempt of the world. Now he has recourse to two arguments. On the one hand, he
shows the miserable condition of mankind in this life, and on the other hand,
the supreme and perfect blessedness, which awaits believers in heaven after
death. For what is it that keeps men so firmly bound in a misplaced attachment
to this life, but their deceiving themselves with a false imagination &#8212;
thinking themselves happy in living here? On the other hand, it is not enough to
be aware of the miseries of this life, if we have not at the same time in view
the felicity and glory of the future life. This is common to good and bad alike
&#8212; that both are desirous to live. This, also, is common to both &#8212;
that, when they consider, how many and how great miseries they are here exposed
to, (with this difference, however, that unbelievers know of no adversities but
those of the body merely, while the pious are more deeply affected 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f325</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
by spiritual distresses,) they often groan, often deplore their condition, and
desire a remedy for their evils. As, however, all naturally view death with
horror, unbelievers never willingly quit this life, except when they throw it
off in disgust or despair. Believers, on the other hand, depart willingly,
because they have a better hope set before them beyond this world. This is the
sum of the argument. Let us now examine the words one by one.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We
know,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says he. This knowledge does not
spring from the human intellect, but takes its rise from the revelation of the
Holy Spirit. Hence it is peculiar to believers. Even the heathens had some idea
of the immortality of the soul, but there was not one of them, that had
assurance of it &#8212; not one of them could boast that he spoke of a thing
that was <i>known </i>to him. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f326</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Believers alone can <i>affirm </i>this, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f327</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to whom it has been testified of by the word and Spirit of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, it is to be observed, that this knowledge is
not merely of a general kind, as though believers were merely in a general way
persuaded, that the children of God will be in a better condition after death,
and had no assurance as to themselves individually, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f328</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for of how very little service this would be for affording a consolation, so
difficult of attainment! On the contrary, every one must have a knowledge
peculiar to himself, for this, and this only, can animate me to meet death with
cheerfulness &#8212; if I am fully persuaded, that I am departing to a better
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The body, such as we now have it, he calls a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>house of
tabernacle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For as <i>tabernacles</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f329</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>are constructed, for a temporary purpose, of slight materials, and without
any firm foundation, and then shortly afterwards are thrown down, or fall of
their own accord, so the mortal body is given to men as a frail hut, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f330</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to be inhabited by them for a few days. The same metaphor is made use of, also,
by Peter in his Second Epistle,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;610113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 1:13, 14,) and by Job,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;180419&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
4:19,) when he calls it a <i>house of clay. </i>He places in contrast with this
a <i>building of perpetual duration. </i>It is not certain, whether he means by
this term a state of blessed immortality, which awaits believers after death, or
the incorruptible and glorious body, such as it will be after the resurrection.
In whichever of these senses it is taken, it will not be unsuitable; though I
prefer to understand it as meaning, that the blessed condition of the soul after
death is the commencement of this <i>building, </i>and the glory of the final
resurrection is the consummation of it. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f331</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This exposition will correspond better with the Apostle&#8217;s context. The
epithets, which he applies to this building, tend to confirm more fully its
perpetuity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>
</b><i>Since clothed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He restricts to
believers, what he had stated respecting the certainty of a future life, as it
is a thing peculiar to them. For the wicked, too, are striped of the body, but
as they bring nothing within the view of God, but a disgraceful nakedness, they
are, consequently, not clothed with a glorious body. Believers, on the other
hand, who appear in the view of God, clothed with Christ, and adorned with His
image, receive the glorious robe of immortality. For I am inclined to take this
view, rather than that of Chrysostom and others, who think that nothing new is
here stated, but that Paul simply repeats here, what he had previously said as
to putting on an eternal habitation. The Apostle, therefore, makes mention here
of a twofold clothing, with which God invests us &#8212; the righteousness of
Christ, and sanctification of the Spirit in this life; and, after death,
immortality and glory. The <i>first </i>is the cause of the <i>second,
</i>because</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">those whom God has
determined to glorify, he first justifies.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450830&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
8:30.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This meaning, too, is elicited from the particle
<i>also, </i>which is without doubt introduced for the purpose of amplifying
&#8212; as if Paul had said, that a new robe will be prepared for believers
after death, since they have been clothed in this life
<i>also.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>
</b><i>We groan, being burdened, because we desire not to be
unclothed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The wicked, too, <i>groan,
</i>because they are not contented with their present condition; but afterwards
an opposite disposition prevails, that is, a clinging to life, so that they view
death with horror, and do not feel the long continuance of this mortal life to
be a burden. The <i>groaning </i>of believers, on the other hand, arises from
this &#8212; that they know, that they are here in a state of exile from their
native land, and that they know, that they are here shut up in the body as in a
prison. Hence they feel this life to be <i>a burden, </i>because in it they
cannot enjoy true and perfect blessedness, because they cannot escape from the
bondage of sin otherwise than by death, and hence they aspire to be
elsewhere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, it is natural for all animals to desire
existence, how can it be, that believers are willing to cease to exist? The
Apostle solves this question, when he says, that believers do not desire death
for the sake of losing any thing, but as having regard to a better life. At the
same time, the words express more than this. For he admits, that we have
naturally an aversion to the quitting of this life, considered in itself, as no
one willingly allows himself to be striped of his garments. Afterwards, however,
he adds, that the natural horror of death is overcome by confidence; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f332</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as an individual will, without any reluctance, throw away a coarse, dirty,
threadbare, and, in one word, tattered garment, with the view of his being
arrayed in an elegant, handsome, new, and durable one.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farther, he explains the metaphor by saying<i>
&#8212;</i></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">that what is mortal may
be destroyed</font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f333</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
by life. For as flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
God,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461550&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 15:50,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">it is necessary, that what is corruptible in our
nature should perish, in order that we may be thoroughly renewed, and restored
to a state of perfection. On this account, our body is called a prison, in which
we are confined.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now he that hath fitted
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is added in order that we may
know, that this disposition is supernatural. For mere natural feeling will not
lead us forward to this, for it does not comprehend that hundredfold recompense
which springs from the <i>dying </i>of a single <i>grain.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431224&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
12:24.) We must, therefore, be <i>fitted </i>for it by God. The manner of it is
at the same time subjoined &#8212; that he confirms us by his Spirit, who is as
it were an
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>earnest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>At the same time the particle <i>also </i>seems to be added for the sake of
amplification. &#8220;It is God who forms in us this desire, and, lest our
courage should give way or waver, the Holy Spirit is given us as an
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>earnest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because by his testimony he confirms, and ratifies the truth of the
promise.&#8221; For these are <i>two </i>offices of the Holy Spirit<i> &#8212;
first<b>,</b> </i>to show to believers what they ought to desire, and
<i>secondly, </i>to influence their hearts efficaciously, and remove all their
doubt, that they may steadfastly persevere in choosing what is good. There
would, however, be nothing unsuitable in extending the word <i>fitted, </i>so as
to denote that renovation of life, with which God adorns his people even in this
life, for in this way he already separates them from others, and shows that they
are, by means of his grace, marked out for a peculiar
condition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore we are always
confident</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>That is, as exercising
dependence on the <i>earnest of the Spirit; </i>for, otherwise, we always
tremble, or, at least, are courageous or alarmed by turns, and do not retain a
uniform and even tenor of mind. Hence, that good courage of which Paul speaks
has no place in us, unless it is maintained by the Spirit of God. The connecting
particle <i>and, </i>which immediately follows, ought to be understood as
meaning
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in this way: We are of good courage, BECAUSE
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we know that we are
absent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>etc. For this knowledge is the
cause of our calmness and confidence; for the reason, why unbelievers are
constantly in a ferment of anxiety, or obstinately murmur against God, is, that
they think they will ere long cease to exist, and they place in this life the
highest and uppermost summit of their felicity. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f334</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We, on the other hand, live in the exercise of contentment,

and go forward to death with alacrity,

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We are absent from the

that God is <i>present </i>with us: Paul here teaches, that we are <i>absent
</i>from him. This is seemingly a contradiction; but this difficulty is easily
solved, when we take into view the different respects, in which he is said to be
<i>present </i>or <i>absent. </i>He is, then, <i>present </i>with all men,
inasmuch as he upholds them by his power. He dwells in them,
because</font><br></div>

as he does not present himself to be seen face to face, because we are as yet in
a state of exile from his kingdom, and have not as yet attained that blessed

respecting the confidence of the pious &#8212; that they are so far from
breaking down under the severity of the cross, and from being disheartened by
afflictions, that they are made thereby more courageous. For the worst of evils
is death, yet believers long to attain it, as being the commencement of perfect
blessedness. Hence <i>and </i>may be regarded as equivalent to <i>because,
</i>ill this way: &#8220;Nothing<i> </i>can befall us, that can shake our
confidence and courage, since death (which others so much dread) is to us
<i>great gain.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians

<div><font face="Palatino">Observe here &#8212; what has been once stated

a desire for it,

and that it is, accordingly, on the other hand, a. token of unbelief, when dread
of death predominates in us above the joy and consolation of hope. Believers,
however, desire death &#8212; not as if they would, by an importunate desire,
anticipate their Lord&#8217;s day, for they willingly retain their footing in
their earthly station, so long as their Lord may see good, for they would rather
live to the glory of Christ than <i>die to themselves,

For the desire, of which Paul speaks, springs from faith. Hence it is not at all
at variance with the will of God. We may, also, gather from these words of Paul,
that souls, when released from the body, live in the presence of God, for if, on
being </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>absent from the

<div><font face="Palatino">Here it is asked by some &#8212; &#8220;How then did
it happen that the holy fathers dreaded death so much, as for example David,
Hezekiah, and the whole of the Israelitish Church, as appears from Psalm 4, from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;233803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
38:3, and from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
115:17?&#8221; I am aware of the answer, that is usually returned &#8212; that
the reason, why death was so much dreaded by them was, that the revelation of
the future life was as yet obscure, and the consolation, consequently, was but
small. Now I acknowledge, that this, in part, accounts for it, but not entirely,
for the holy fathers of the ancient Church did not in every case tremble, on
being forewarned of their death. Nay more, they embraced death with alacrity,
and with joyful hearts. For Abraham departed without regret, <i>full of
days.</i>

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;013529&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

Hezekiah did, each of them, on one occasion deprecate death with tears, the
reason was, that they were punished by the Lord for certain sins, and, in
consequence of this, they felt the anger of the Lord in death. Such was the
cause of their alarm, and this believers might feel even at this day, under the
reign of Christ. The <i>desire, </i>however, of which Paul speaks, is the

by afflictions and death they attain to a blessed life, he now from the same
source draws also another conclusion &#8212; that they must, by all means, make
it their main desire to please God. And indeed it cannot but be, that the hope
of a resurrection, and thoughtfulness as to the judgment, will awaken in us this
desire; as, on the other hand, the true reason why we are so indolent and remiss
in duty is, that we seldom, if ever, think of what ought to be constantly kept
in remembrance,

soul is again confirmed.</font><br></div>

all, yet all without distinction do not raise their views in such a way as to
consider every moment, that they must appear before the judgment-seat of Christ.
But while Paul, from a holy desire of acting aright, constantly sisted himself
before the bar of Christ, he had it in view to reprove indirectly those
ambitious teachers, who reckoned it enough to have the plaudits of their
fellow-men. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f350</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For when he says, that no one can escape, he seems in a manner to summon them to
that heavenly tribunal. Farther, though the word translated <i>to be manifested
</i>might be rendered to <i>appear, </i>yet Paul had, in my opinion, something
farther in view &#8212; that we shall then come forth to the light, while for
the present many are concealed, as it were, in the darkness. For then <i>the
books, </i>which are now shut, <i>will be opened.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270710&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
7:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That every one may give
account.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the passage relates to the
recompensing of deeds, we must notice briefly, that, as evil deeds are punished
by God, so also good deeds are rewarded, but for a different reason; for evil
deeds are requited with the punishment that they deserve, but God in rewarding
good deeds does not look to merit or worthiness. For no work is so full and
complete in all its parts as to be deservedly well-pleasing to him, and farther,
there is no one whose works are in themselves well-pleasing to God, unless he
render satisfaction to the whole law. Now no one is found to be thus perfect.
Hence the only resource is in his accepting us through unmerited goodness, and
justifying us, by not imputing to us our sins. After he has received us into
favor, he receives our works also by a gracious acceptance. It is on this that
the reward hinges. There is, therefore, no inconsistency in saying, that he
rewards good works, provided we understand that mankind, nevertheless, obtain
eternal life gratuitously. On this point I have expressed myself more fully in
the preceding Epistle, and my Institutes will furnish a full discussion of it. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f352</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
When he says <i>in the body, </i>I understand him to mean, not merely outward
actions, but all the deeds that are done in this corporeal
life.</font><br></div>

</b><i>Knowing therefore.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now returns
to speak of himself, or he again applies the general doctrine to himself
personally. &#8220;I<i> </i>am not ignorant,&#8221; says he, &#8220;nor<i>
</i>devoid of the fear of God, which ought to reign in the hearts of all the
pious.&#8221; To </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know the terror
of the Lord,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>then, is to be influenced
by this consideration &#8212; that an account must one day be rendered before
the judgment-seat of Christ; for the man who seriously considers this must of
necessity be touched with fear, and shake off all negligence. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f353</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He declares, therefore, that he discharges his apostleship faithfully and with a
<i>pure conscience,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;550103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 1:3,) as one that <i>walks in the fear of the Lord,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440931&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
9:31,) thinking of the account to be rendered by him. As, however, his enemies
might object: &#8220;You<i> </i>extol yourself, it is true, in magnificent
terms, but who is there that sees what you affirm?&#8221; He says, in reply to
this, that he discharges indeed the work of a teacher in the sight of men, but
that it is known to God with what sincerity of mind he acts. &#8220;As<i> </i>my
mouth speaks to men, so does my heart to God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I
trust</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is a kind of correction of
what he had said, for he now boasts that he has not merely God as the witness of
his integrity, but also the Corinthians themselves, to whom he had given proof
of himself. Two things, therefore, are to be observed here: in the <i>first
</i>place, that it is not enough that an individual conducts himself honorably
and assiduously 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f354</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
among men, if his <i>heart is not right in the sight of God,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440821&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
8:21;) and <i>secondly, </i>that boasting is vain, where evidence of the reality
itself is wanting. For none are more bold in arrogating everything to
themselves, than those that have nothing. Let, therefore, the man who would have
credit given him, bring forward such works as may afford confirmation to his
statements. To be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made manifest
in their consciences</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is more than to be
known by proofs; for conscience reaches farther than carnal
judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we commend not
ourselves.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He confirms what he had said
immediately before, and at the same time anticipates a calumny that might be
brought against him. For it might seem as if he were too careful as to his own
praise, inasmuch as he spoke so frequently respecting himself. Nay, it is
probable that this reproach had been cast upon him by the wicked. For when he
says &#8212; We </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commend not
ourselves again</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he says this as if
speaking in his own person. To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is taken in a bad sense, as meaning to <i>boast, </i>or to
<i>brag.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he adds &#8212; that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gives them occasion of
glorying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he intimates in the <i>first
</i>place, that he pleads <i>their </i>cause rather than his own, inasmuch as he
gives up all with a view to their glory, and he again indirectly reproves their
ingratitude, because they had not perceived it to be their duty to magnify, of
their own accord, his Apostleship, so as not to impose upon him this necessity;
and farther, because they had not perceived, that it was <i>their </i>interest
rather than that of Paul himself, that his Apostleship should be accounted
honorable. We are here taught, that Christ&#8217;s servants ought to be
concerned as to their own reputation, only in so far as is for the advantage of
the Church. Paul affirms with truth, that he is actuated by this disposition. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f355</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Let others see that they do not on false grounds pretend to follow his example. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f356</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We are taught farther, that <i>that </i>alone is a minister&#8217;s true praise,
that is common to him with the whole Church, rather than peculiar to himself
exclusively &#8212; in other words, that redounds to the advantage of
all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye may have something in
opposition to those</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He<i>
</i>intimates, in passing, that it is necessary to repress the vanity of those
that make empty boasts, and that it is the duty of the Church to do so. For as
ambition of this nature is a peculiarly destructive pestilence, it is dangerous
to encourage it by dissimulation. As the Corinthians had not taken care to do
this, Paul instructs them how they should act for the future.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glory in appearance, not in

This is a passage that is deserving not merely of notice, but also of constant
meditation; for unless we shall have our minds thus regulated, the smallest

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the love of
Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The
term</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>may be taken either in a <i>passive
</i>signification, or in an <i>active. </i>I prefer the latter. For if we be not
harder than iron, we cannot refrain from devoting ourselves entirely to Christ,
when we consider what great love he exercised towards us, when he endured death
in our stead. Paul, too, explains himself when he adds, that it is reasonable
that we should <i>live to him, </i>being dead to ourselves. Hence, as he had
previously stated:
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:11,) that he was stirred up to duty by fear, inasmuch as an
account was one day to be rendered by him, so he now brings forward another
motive &#8212; that measureless love of Christ towards us, of which he had
furnished us with an evidence in his death. &#8220;The<i> </i>knowledge,&#8221;
I say, &#8220;of<i> </i>this love, ought
to</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
constrain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>our affections, that they may
go in no other direction than that of loving him in return.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is a metaphor

implied in the word

</i>denoting that it is impossible but that every one that truly considers and
ponders that wonderful love, which Christ has manifested towards us by his
death, becomes, as it were, bound to him, and <i>constrained </i>by the closest
tie, and devotes himself wholly to his service.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If one died for

to</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>or if you would have it at greater length, it is to renounce ourselves, that
we may <i>live to Christ; </i>for Christ. redeemed us with this view &#8212;
that he might have us under his authority, as his peculiar possession. Hence it
follows that we are no longer our own masters. There is a similar passage in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:7-9. At the same time, there are two things that are here brought forward
separately &#8212; that we are dead in Christ, in order that all ambition and
eagerness for distinction may be laid aside, and that it may be felt by us no
hardship to be made as nothing; and farther, that we owe to Christ our life and
death, because he has wholly bound us to himself.

every thing which, apart from regeneration, is reckoned worthy of praise. At the

had made mention. &#8220;Since we ought, all of us, to be dead to the present

have no worldly thoughts respecting him.&#8221; This passage is perverted by
some fanatics, such as Servetus, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f363</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for the purpose of proving, that Christ&#8217;s human nature is now absorbed by
the Divinity. But how very far removed such a frenzy is from the Apostle&#8217;s
intention, it is not difficult to perceive; for he speaks here, not of the
substance of his body, but of external appearance, nor does he affirm that the
flesh is no longer perceived by us in Christ, but says, that Christ is not
<i>judged </i>of from that. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f364</font></sup><br></div>

Nay more, take away this foundation, and our whole faith falls to the ground;

a pattern

of it in the person of Christ? For as righteousness is restored to us on this
ground, that Christ, by fulfilling the law in our nature, has abolished
Adam&#8217;s disobedience, so also life has been restored to us by this means,
that he has opened up for our nature the kingdom of God, from which it had been
banished, and has given it a place in the heavenly dwelling. Hence, if we do not
now recognize Christ&#8217;s flesh, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f367</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
we lose the whole of that confidence and consolation that we ought to have in
him. But we acknowledge Christ as man, and as our brother in his flesh &#8212;
not in a fleshly manner; because we rest solely in the consideration of his
spiritual gifts. Hence he is spiritual to us, not as if he laid aside the body,
and became a spirit, but because he regenerates and governs his own people by
the influence of his Spirit.</font><br></div>

the happiness of the pious is completed. As, however, Christ&#8217;s kingdom is
spiritual, this change must take place chiefly in the Spirit, and hence it is
with propriety that he begins with this. There is, therefore, an elegant and
appropriate allusion, when Paul makes use of a commendation of this kind, for
the purpose of setting forth the value of regeneration. Now by

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath reconciled

points &#8212; the <i>one </i>relating to the reconciliation of men with God;
and the <i>other, </i>to the way in which we may enjoy the benefit of this
reconciliation. Now these things correspond admirably with what goes before, for
as the Apostle had given the preference to a good conscience above every kind of
distinction,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470511&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:11,) he now shows that the whole of the gospel tends to this. He
shows, however, at the same time, the dignity of the Apostolical office, that
the Corinthians may be instructed as to what they ought to seek in him, whereas
they could not distinguish between true and false ministers, for this reason,
that nothing but show delighted them. Accordingly, by making mention of this, he
stirs them up to make greater proficiency in the doctrine of the gospel. For an
absurd admiration of profane persons, who serve their own ambition rather than
Christ, originates in our not knowing, what the office of the preaching of the
gospel includes, or imports.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now return to those <i>two leading points </i>that
are here touched upon. The first is &#8212; that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hath reconciled us to himself by
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is immediately followed by
the declaration &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because
God was in Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and has in his person
accomplished reconciliation. The manner is subjoined &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By not imputing unto men their
trespasses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Again, there is annexed a
<i>second </i>declaration<i> &#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because Christ having been
made a sin-offering for our sins, has procured righteousness for
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The <i>second </i>part of the
statement is &#8212; that the grace of reconciliation is applied to us by the
gospel, that we may become partakers of it. Here we have a remarkable passage,
if there be any such in any part of Paul&#8217;s writings. Hence it is proper,
that we should carefully examine the words one by one.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The ministry of
reconciliation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here we have an
illustrious designation of the gospel, as being an embassy for reconciling men
to God. It is also a singular dignity of ministers &#8212; that they are sent to
us by God with this commission, so as to be messengers, and in a manner
sureties. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f370</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This, however, is not said so much for the purpose of commending ministers, as
with a view to the consolation of the pious, that as often as they hear the
gospel, they may know that God treats with them, and, as it were, stipulates
with them as to a return to his grace. Than this blessing what could be more
desirable? Let us therefore bear in mind, that this is the main design of the
gospel &#8212; that whereas we are <i>by nature children of wrath,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:3,) we may, by the breaking up of the quarrel between God and us, be received
by him into favor. Ministers are furnished with this commission, that they may
bring us intelligence of so great a benefit, nay more, may assure us of
God&#8217;s fatherly love towards us. Any other person, it is true, might also
be a witness to us of the grace of God, but Paul teaches, that this office is
specially intrusted to ministers. When, therefore, a duly ordained minister
proclaims in the gospel, that God has been made propitious to us, he is to be
listened to just as an ambassador of God, and sustaining, as they speak, a
public character, and furnished with rightful authority for assuring us of
this.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>
</b><i>God was in Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some take this
as meaning simply <i>&#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God reconciled the world to
himself in Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but the meaning is
fuller and more <i>comprehensive &#8212; first<b>,</b> </i>that God was in
Christ; and, <i>secondly, </i>that he reconciled the world to himself by his
intercession. It is also of the Father that this is affirmed; for it were an
improper expression, were you to understand it as meaning, that the divine
nature of Christ was in him. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f371</font></sup><font face="Palatino">The
Father, therefore, was in the Son, in accordance with that statement
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">I am in the Father, and
the Father in me.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431038&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
10:38.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore he that hath the Son, hath the Father also.
For Paul has made use of this expression with this view &#8212; that we may
learn to be satisfied with Christ alone, because in him we find also God the
Father, as he truly communicates himself to us by him. Hence the expression is
equivalent to this &#8212; &#8220;Whereas God had withdrawn to a distance from
us, he has drawn near to us in Christ, and thus Christ has become to us the true
Emmanuel, and his coming is God&#8217;s drawing near to
men.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>second </i>part of the statement points out
the office of Christ &#8212; his being <i>our propitiation,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 2:2,) because <i>out of Him, </i>God is displeased with us all, inasmuch as
we have revolted from righteousness. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f372</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For what purpose, then, has God appeared to men in Christ? For the purpose of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reconciliation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
&#8212; </i>that,<i> </i>hostilities being removed, those who were aliens, might
be adopted as sons. Now, although Christ&#8217;s coming as our Redeemer
originated in the fountain of Divine love towards us, yet until men perceive
that God has been propitiated by the Mediator, there must of necessity be a
variance remaining, with respect to them, which shuts them out from access to
God. On this point we shall speak more fully ere long.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not imputing to
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Mark, in what way men return into
favor with God &#8212; when they are regarded as righteous, by obtaining the
remission of their sins. For so long as God imputes to us our sins, He must of
necessity regard us with abhorrence;<i> </i>for he cannot be friendly or
propitious to sinners. But this statement may seem to be at variance with what
is said elsewhere &#8212; that, we were loved by Him before the creation of the
world,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:4,) and still more with what he says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:16,) that the love, which he exercised towards us was the reason, why He
expiated our sins by Christ, for the cause always goes before its effect. I
answer, that we were loved before the creation of the world, but it was only
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In the mean time, however, I
confess, that the love of God was first in point of time, and of order, too, as
to God, but with respect to us, the commencement of his love has its foundation
in the sacrifice of Christ. For when we contemplate God without a Mediator, we
cannot conceive<i> </i>of Him otherwise than as angry with us: a Mediator
interposed between us, makes us feel, that He is pacified towards us. As,
however, this also is necessary to be known by us &#8212; that Christ came forth
to us from the fountain of God&#8217;s free mercy, the Scripture explicitly
teaches both &#8212; that the anger of the Father has been appeased by the
sacrifice of the Son, and that the Son has been offered up for the expiation of
the sins of men on this ground &#8212; because God, exercising compassion
towards them, receives them, on the ground of such a pledge, into favor 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f373</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The whole may be summed up thus: &#8220;Where<i>
</i>sin is, <i>there </i>the anger of God is, and therefore God is not
propitious to us without, or before, his blotting out our sins, by not imputing
them. As our consciences cannot apprehend this benefit, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f374</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
otherwise than through the intervention of Christ&#8217;s sacrifice, it is not
without good reason, that Paul makes <i>that </i>the commencement and cause of
reconciliation, with regard to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hath committed to
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Again he repeats, that a commission
has been given to the ministers of the gospel to communicate to us this grace.
For it might be objected, &#8220;Where<i> </i>is Christ now, the peacemaker
between God and us? At what a distance he resides from us!&#8221; He says,
therefore, that as he has <i>once suffered</i>, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f375</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 3:18,) so he daily presents to us the fruit of his suffering through means
of the Gospel, which he designed, should be in the world, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f376</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as a sure and authentic register of the reconciliation, that has once been
effected. It is the part of ministers, therefore, to apply to us, so to speak,
the fruit of Christ&#8217;s death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lest, however, any one should dream of a magical
application, such as Papists contrive, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f377</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
we must carefully observe what he immediately subjoins &#8212; that it consists
wholly in the preaching of the Gospel. For the Pope, along with his priests,
makes use of this pretext for giving a color of warrant for the whole of that
wicked and execrable system of merchandise, which they carry on, in connection
with the salvation of souls. &#8220;The Lord,&#8221; say they, &#8220;has
furnished us with a commission and authority to forgive sins.&#8221; This I
acknowledge, provided they discharge that embassy, of which Paul here makes
mention. The absolution, however, which they make use of in the Papacy, is
entirely magical; and besides, they inclose pardon of sins in lead and
parchment, or they connect it with fictitious and frivolous superstitions. What
resemblance do all these things bear to the appointment of Christ? Hence the
ministers of the Gospel restore us to the favor of God in a right and orderly
manner, when they bear testimony to us by means of the Gospel as to the favor of
God having been procured for us. Let this <i>testimony </i>be removed, and
nothing remains but mere imposture. Beware, then, of placing even the smallest
drop of your confidence on any thing apart from the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I do not, indeed, deny, that the grace of Christ is
applied to us in the sacraments, and that our reconciliation with God is then
confirmed in our consciences; but, as the testimony of the Gospel is engraven
upon the sacraments, they are not to be judged of separately by themselves, but
must be taken in connection with the Gospel, of which they are appendages. In
fine, the ministers of the Church are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ambassadors</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>for testifying and proclaiming the benefit of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reconciliation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>only on this condition &#8212; that they speak from the Gospel, as from an
authentic register.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As if God did beseech
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is of no small importance for
giving authority to the embassy: nay more, it is absolutely necessary, for who
would rest upon the testimony of men, in reference to his eternal salvation? It
is a matter of too much importance, to allow of our resting contented with the
promise of men, without feeling assured that they are ordained by God, and that
God speaks to us by them. This is the design of those commendations, with which
Christ himself signalizes his Apostles:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We entreat you, in Christ&#8217;s

<div><font face="Palatino">For that one thing, that is of itself sufficient for
completing our felicity, and without which we are most miserable, is conferred
upon us, only through means of the Gospel. If, however, this duty is enjoined
upon all the ministers of the Church, in such a way, that he who does not
discharge this embassy is not to be regarded either as an Apostle, or as a
Pastor, we may very readily judge from this, as to the nature of the
Pope&#8217;s entire hierarchy. They are desirous, indeed, to be looked upon as
Apostles and Pastors; but as they are dumb idols, how will their boasting 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f378</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
correspond with this passage of Paul&#8217;s writings. The word <i>entreat
</i>is expressive of an unparalleled 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f379</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
commendation of the grace of Christ, inasmuch as He stoops so low, that he does
not disdain to <i>entreat </i>us. So much the less excusable is our depravity,
if we do not, on meeting with such kindness, show ourselves teachable and
compliant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be
reconciled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is to be observed, that
Paul is here addressing himself to believers. He declares, that he brings to
them every day this embassy. Christ therefore, did not suffer, merely that he
might once expiate our sins, nor was the gospel appointed merely with a view to
the pardon of those sins which we committed previously to baptism, but that, as
we daily sin, so we might, also, by a daily remission, be received by God into
his favor. For this is a continued embassy, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f380</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which must be assiduously sounded forth in the Church, till the end of the
world; and the gospel cannot be preached, unless remission of sins is
promised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have here an express and suitable declaration for
refuting the impious tenet of Papists, which calls upon us to seek the remission
of sins after Baptism from some other source, than from the expiation that was
effected through the death of Christ. Now this doctrine is commonly held in all
the schools of Popery &#8212; that, after baptism, we merit the remission of
sins by penitence, through means of the aid of the <i>keys,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f381</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401619&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
16:19,) &#8212; as if baptism itself could confer this 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f382</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
upon us without penitence. By the term <i>penitence, </i>however, they mean
<i>satisfactions. </i>But what does Paul say here? He calls us to go, not less
<i>after </i>baptism, than <i>before </i>it, to the one expiation made by
Christ, that we may know that we always obtain it gratuitously. Farther, all
their prating as to the administration of the <i>keys </i>is to no purpose,
inasmuch as they conceive of <i>keys </i>apart from the Gospel, while they are
nothing else than that testimony of a gratuitous reconciliation, which is made
to us in the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Him who knew no
sin.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Do you observe, that, according to
Paul, there is no return to favor with God, except what is founded on the
sacrifice of Christ alone? Let us learn, therefore, to turn our views in that
direction, whenever we desire to be absolved from guilt. He now teaches more
clearly, what we adverted to above &#8212; that God is propitious to us, when he
acknowledges us as righteous. For these two things are equivalent &#8212; that
we are acceptable to God, and that we are regarded by him as
righteous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know no

then, that Christ, while he was entirely exempt from sin, was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made sin for
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is commonly remarked,
that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>here denotes an expiatory sacrifice
for sin, and in the same way the Latin&#8217;s term it, <i>piaculum.</i>

</i>(<i>asham</i>)<i> </i>denotes an <i>expiatory sacrifice, </i>as well as an
<i>offense </i>or <i>crime.</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f384</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>

better understood from a comparison of both parts of the antithesis. <i>Sin

that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we were made the

</i>here, is not taken to denote a quality or habit, but by way of imputation,
on the ground of Christ&#8217;s righteousness being reckoned to have been
received by us. What, on the other hand, is denoted by <i>sin? </i>It is the
guilt, on account of which we are arraigned at the bar of God. As, however, the
curse of the individual was of old cast upon the victim, so Christ&#8217;s
condemnation was our absolution, and <i>with his stripes we are healed.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is taken here to denote &#8212; not
that which is given us by God, but that which is approved of by him, as in

world. Farther, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:23, when he says, that we have <i>come short of the glory of God, </i>he
means, that there is nothing that we can glory in before God, for it is no very
difficult matter to appear righteous before men, but it is a mere delusive
appearance of righteousness, which becomes at last the ground of perdition.
Hence, <i>that </i>is the only true righteousness, which is acceptable to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now return to the contrast between

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.

his own offenses, but for those of others, inasmuch as he was pure and exempt
from every fault, and might endure the punishment that. was due to us &#8212;
not to himself. It is in the same manner, assuredly, that we are now
<i>righteous in him &#8212; </i>not<i> </i>in respect of our rendering
satisfaction to the justice of God by our own works, but because we are judged
of in connection with Christ&#8217;s righteousness, which we have put on by
faith, that it might become ours. On this account I have preferred to retain the

must mutually lend a helping hand to each other, so as to give assistance to
each other. I rather prefer, however, the former exposition. Chrysostom
interprets it as referring to the hearers, with whom ministers are

indolence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Ministers are here taught, that it is not enough

salvation flows to us from the mercy of God exclusively, as from a fountainhead.

works moved God to assign to us his favor, for whence comes the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>day of

appointed. In the mean time, we must keep in view what Paul designs to teach
&#8212; that there is need of prompt expedition, that we may not allow the
opportunity to pass unimproved, inasmuch as it displeases God, that the grace
that he offers to us should be received by us with coolness and
indifference.</font><br></div>

Paul transfers the prophecy to the time when Christ is revealed by the continued
preaching of the gospel, and it is with good reason that he does so, for as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>salvation
</i></font><font face="Palatino">was once sent to the whole world, when Christ
appeared, so now it is sent to us every day, when we are made partakers of the
gospel. Here we have a beautiful passage, and affording no ordinary consolation,
because, while the gospel is preached to us, we know assuredly that the way is
opened up for us into the kingdom of God, and that there is a signal of divine
benevolence raised aloft, to invite us to receive
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>for the opportunity of obtaining it must be judged of by the call. Unless,
however, we embrace the opportunity, we must fear the threatening that Paul
brings forward &#8212; that, in a short time, the door will be shut against all
that have not entered in, while opportunity was afforded. For this retribution
always follows contempt of the word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>
</b><i>Giving no offense</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have
already on several occasions remarked, that Paul sometimes commends the ministry
of the gospel generally, and at other times his own integrity. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f398</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In the present instance, then, he speaks of himself, and sets before us in his
own person a living picture of a good and faithful apostle, that the Corinthians
may be led to see how unfair they were in their judgment, in preferring before
him empty blusterers. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f399</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For as they assigned the praise to mere pretences, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f400</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they held in the highest esteem persons that were effeminate and devoid of zeal,
while, on the other hand, as to the best ministers, they cherished no views but
such as were mean and abject. Nor is there any reason to doubt, that those very
things that Paul makes mention of to his own commendation, had been brought
forward by them in part as a ground of contempt; and they were so much the more
deserving of reproof, inasmuch as they converted into matter of reproach, what
was ground of just praise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul, therefore, treats here of <i>three </i>things:
In the <i>first </i>place, he shows what are the excellences, on the ground of
which preachers of the gospel ought to be esteemed; <i>secondly, </i>he shows
that he is himself endowed with those excellences; <i>thirdly, </i>he admonishes
the Corinthians not to acknowledge as Christ&#8217;s servants those who conduct
themselves otherwise than he prescribes here by his example. His design is, that
he may procure authority for himself and those that were like him, with a view
to the glory of God and the good of the Church, or may restore it where it has
fallen into decay; and <i>secondly, </i>that he may call back the Corinthians
from an unreasonable attachment to the false apostles, which was a hinderance in
the way of their making so much proficiency in the gospel as was necessary.
Ministers give occasion of stumbling, when by their own misconduct they hinder
the progress of the gospel on the part of their hearers. <i>That </i>Paul says
he does not do; for he declares that he carefully takes heed not to stain his
apostleship by any spot of disgrace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this is the artifice of Satan &#8212; to seek
some misconduct on the part of ministers, that may tend to the dishonor of the
gospel. For when he has been successful in bringing the ministry into contempt,
all hope of profit is at an end. Hence the man who would usefully serve Christ,
must strive with his whole might to maintain the credit of his ministry. The
method is &#8212; to take care that he be deserving of honor, for nothing is
more ridiculous than striving to maintain your reputation before others, while
you call forth upon yourself reproach by a wicked and base life. That man,
therefore, will alone be honorable, who will allow himself in nothing that is
unworthy of a minister of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In much
patience.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The whole of the enumeration
that follows is intended to show, that all the tests by which the Lord is
accustomed to try his servants were to be found in Paul, and that there was no
kind of test to which he had not been subjected, in order that the faithfulness
of his ministry might be more fully established. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f401</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Among other things that he enumerates, there are some that are under all
circumstances required for all the servants of Christ. Of this nature are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>labors, sincerity, knowledge,
watchings, gentleness, love, the word of truth, the Spirit, the power of God,
the armor of righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There are
other things that are not necessary in all cases; for in order that any one may
be a servant of Christ, it is not absolutely necessary, that he be put to the
test by means of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stripes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>imprisonments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Hence these things will in some cases be wanting in the experience of the
best. It becomes all, however, to be of such a disposition as to present
themselves to be tried, as Paul was, with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stripes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>imprisonments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>if the Lord shall see meet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Patience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is the regulation of the mind in adversity, which is an excellence that
ought invariably to distinguish a good minister. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f402</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Afflictions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>necessity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>here I understand <i>poverty. </i>Now this is common to many ministers,
there being few of them that are not in poor circumstances; but at the same time
not to all. For why should a moderate amount of riches prevent a man from being
reckoned a servant of Christ, who, in other respects, is pious, is of upright
mind and honorable deportment, and is distinguished by other excellences. As the
man that is poor is not on that account to be straightway accounted a good
minister, so the man that is rich is not on that account to be rejected. Nay
more, Paul in another passage glories not less in his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowing how to
abound</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>than in <i>knowing how to be in
want.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:12.) Hence we must observe the distinction that I have mentioned, between
<i>occasional </i>and <i>invariable </i>grounds of commendation.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b>
</b><i>In tumults</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In proportion to the
calmness and gentleness of Paul&#8217;s disposition was there the greater
excellence displayed in his standing undaunted in the face of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tumults</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>and he takes praise to himself on this account &#8212; that while he
regarded tumults with abhorrence, he nevertheless encountered them with bravery.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f404</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Nor does the praise simply consist in his being unmoved by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tumults,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(this being commonly found among all riotous persons, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f405</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)
but in his being thrown into no alarm by tumults that had been stirred up
through the fault of others. And, unquestionably, two things are required on the
part of ministers of the Gospel &#8212; that they should endeavor to the utmost
of their power to maintain peace, and yet on the other hand go forward,
undaunted, through the midst of commotions, so as not to turn aside from the
right course, though heaven and earth should be mingled.

require to fight, inasmuch as the devil is always on the alert, to molest them.
Now they must be completely armed, because, if he does not succeed in one onset,
he thereupon makes a new attempt, and attacks them at one time from before, at
another from behind &#8212; now on this side, and then on that.

</b><i>By honor and dishonor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is no
slight test for subjecting a man to trial, for to a man of a noble spirit
nothing is more unpleasant, than to incur disgrace. Hence we may observe in all
histories, that there have been few men of heroism that have not fallen back, on
being irritated by insults. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f411</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence it is indicative of a mind well established in virtue, not to be moved
away from one&#8217;s course by any disgrace that may be incurred &#8212; a rare
virtue, but one without which you cannot show. that you are a servant of God. We
must, it is true, have a regard to good character, but it must be only in so far
as the edification of our brethren requires it, and in such a way as not to be
dependent on reports 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f412</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; nay more, so as to maintain in the same even course in <i>honor </i>and

whether we act uprightly from disinterested motives; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f414</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for if one is drawn aside from duty by the ingratitude of men, that man shows
that he had not his eye directed to God alone. As then we see that Paul was
exposed to infamy and insults, and yet did not on that account stop short, but
held forward with undaunted courage, and broke through every impediment so as to
reach the goal, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f415</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
let us not give way, if the same thing should befall us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As

in what estimation he was held by the wicked and those that were <i>without,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460512&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 5:12,) but also what views were entertained of him by those that
were <i>within. </i>Now let every one consider with himself, how unseemly was
the ingratitude of the Corinthians, and how great was his magnanimity in
struggling forward, in spite of such formidable obstacles. By indirect
representations, however, he sharply reproves their perverse judgment, when he
says that he <i>lives </i>and is <i>joyful, </i>while they despised him as one
that was dead and overwhelmed with grief. He reproaches them, also, with
ingratitude, when he says, that he <i>made many rich, </i>while he was contemned
on account of his poverty. For they were of the number of those whom he enriched
by his wealth: nay more, all of them to a man were under obligations to him on
many accounts. Thus he said previously, by way of irony, that he was <i>unknown,
</i>while at the same time the fruit of his labor was everywhere known and
celebrated. But how cruel to despise the poverty of the man who supplies you 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f416</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from his abundance! He means <i>spiritual </i>riches, which ought to be much
more esteemed than <i>earthly.</i></font><br></div>

now reproves them more freely, because they associated with unbelievers, as
partakers with them in outward idolatry. For he has exhorted them to show
themselves docile to him as to a father: he now, in accordance with the rights
that belong to him,

reproves the fault into which they had fallen. Now we mentioned in the former

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f426</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
what this fault was; for, as they imagined that there was nothing that was
unlawful for them in outward things, they defiled themselves with wicked
superstitions without any reserve. For in frequenting the banquets of
unbelievers, they participated along with them in profane and impure rites, and
while they sinned grievously, they nevertheless thought themselves innocent. On
this account Paul inveighs here against outward idolatry, and exhorts Christians
to stand aloof from it, and have no connection with it. He begins, however, with
a general statement, with the view of coming down from that to a particular
instance, for to be <i>yoked with unbelievers </i>means nothing less than
to</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Many are of opinion that he speaks of marriage, but
the context clearly shows that they are mistaken. The word that Paul makes use
of means &#8212; to be connected together in drawing the same yoke. It is a
metaphor taken from oxen or horses, which require to walk at the same pace, and
to act together in the same work, when fastened under one yoke. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f428</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
When, therefore, he prohibits us from having partnership with unbelievers in
drawing the same yoke, he means simply this, that we should have no fellowship
with them in their pollutions. For <i>one </i>sun shines upon us, we eat of the
same bread, we breathe the same air, and we cannot altogether refrain from
intercourse with them; but Paul speaks of the yoke of impiety, that is, of
participation in works, in which Christians cannot lawfully have fellowship. On
this principle marriage will also be prohibited, inasmuch as it is a snare, by
which both men and women are entangled into an agreement with impiety; but what
I mean is simply this, that Paul&#8217;s doctrine is of too general a nature to
be restricted to marriage exclusively, for he is discoursing here as to the
shunning of idolatry, on which account, also, we are prohibited from contracting
marriages with the wicked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For what
fellowship</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He confirms his exhortation
on the ground of its being an absurd, and, as it were, monstrous connecting
together of things in themselves much at variance; for these things can no more
coalesce than fire and water. In short it comes to this, that unless they would
have everything thrown into confusion, they must refrain from the pollutions of
the wicked. Hence, too, we infer, that even those that do not in their hearts
approve of superstitions are, nevertheless, polluted by dissimulation if they do
not openly and ingenuously stand aloof from them.</font><br></div>

devil, the head of all wicked persons. For from what holds good as to the two
heads, he comes down without delay to the members: &#8220;As<i> </i>there is an
irreconcilable variance between Christ and Satan, so we also must keep aloof
from partnership with the wicked.&#8221; When, however, Paul says that a
Christian has no participation with an unbeliever, he does not mean as to food,

things that are peculiar to unbelievers, from which the Lord has separated

has in general terms prohibited believers from associating with the wicked. He
now lets them know what was the chief reason, why he had prohibited them from
such an association &#8212; because they had ceased to reckon the profession of
idolatry to be a sin. He had censured that liberty, and had exposed it at great
length in the former Epistle. It is probable, however, that all had not yet been
gained over, so as to receive the counsel which he had given. Hence it was that
he complained of their being

He does not, however, resume that subject anew, but contents himself with a
short admonition, as we are accustomed to do, when we treat of things that are
well known. At the same time his brevity does not prevent his giving sharp cuts.

is no agreement between the

already in part noticed, contends rather by way of exhortation than of doctrine,
inasmuch as it would have been superfluous to be still treating of it, as if it
were a thing doubtful or obscure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As God saith, I will
walk.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He proves that we are the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>temples of

to the people of Israel that he would dwell in the midst of them. In the first
place, God cannot dwell
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>among</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

privilege &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will dwell in

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dwelling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or presence consist merely in earthly blessings, but must be understood
chiefly of spiritual grace. Hence it does not mean simply that God is near us,
as though he were in the air, flying round about us, but it means rather that he
has his abode in our hearts. If, then, any one objects, that the particle
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

circumstance that God promises that he will dwell <i>among </i>us, we may infer
that he also remains

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f436</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And such was the type of the ark, of which mention is made by Moses in that
passage, from which Paul appears to have borrowed this quotation.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;032612&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
26:12.) If, however, any one thinks that Paul had rather in his eye
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;263727&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
37:27, the argument will be the same. For the Prophet, when describing the
restoration of the Church, mentions as the chief good, the presence of God,
which he had himself in the beginning promised by Moses. Now what was prefigured
by the ark, was manifested to us more fully in Christ, when he became to us
Immanuel 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f437</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
1:23.) On this account, I am of opinion that it is Ezekiel, rather than Moses,
that is here quoted, because Ezekiel alludes at the same time to the type of the
ark, and declares that it will have its fulfillment under the reign of Christ.
Now the Apostle takes it for granted, that God dwells nowhere but in a sacred
place. If we say of a man, &#8220;he<i> </i>dwells here,&#8221; that will not
make the place a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>temple</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;

his presence, he at the same time sanctifies.</font><br></div>

52:11, where the Prophet, when foretelling the deliverance, at length addresses
the priests in these terms. For he makes use of a circumlocution to describe the
priests, when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye that
bear the vessels of the Lord,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>inasmuch
as they had the charge of the <i>vessels, </i>by means of which the sacrifices,
and other parts of divine worship, were performed. There can be no doubt that
his design is to admonish them, that, while eagerly desirous to come forth, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f438</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they should be on their guard against any contamination from the many pollutions
with which the country 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f439</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
was overrun. Now this is no less applicable to us, than to the ancient Levites,
for if so much purity is required on the part of the <i>keepers of the vessels,
</i>how much more in the <i>vessels </i>themselves! 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f440</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

Peter 2:9.) Hence, as we are redeemed by the grace of God, it is befitting that
we keep ourselves undefiled in respect of all uncleanness, that we may not
pollute the sanctuary of God. As, however, while remaining in this world, we are
nevertheless redeemed, and rescued, from the pollutions of the world, so we are
not to quit life with the view of departing from all uncleanness, but must
simply avoid all participation. The sum is this. &#8220;If with a true affection
of the heart, we aim at the benefit of redemption, we must beware of defiling
ourselves by any contamination from its pollutions.&#8221;</font><br></div>

passage merely, but is repeated in various instances. Paul has added it with
this view, that a recognition of the great honor to which God has exalted us,
might be a motive to stir us up to a more ardent desire for holiness. For when
God has restored his Church which he has gathered from profane nations, their
redemption is attended with this fruit, that believers are seen to be his

are reckoned among the sons of God: it belongs to us in our turn to take care,
that we do not show ourselves to be degenerate children to him. For what injury
we do to God, if while we call him father, we defile ourselves with abominations
of idols! Hence, the thought of the high distinction to which he has elevated
us, ought to whet our desire for holiness and purity.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These promises,
therefore.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God, it is true, anticipates
us in his promises by his pure favor; but when he has, of his own accord,
conferred upon us his favor, he immediately afterwards requires from us
gratitude in return. Thus what he said to Abraham, <i>I</i> <i>am thy God,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;011707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:7,) was an offer of his undeserved goodness, yet he at the same time added
what he required from him &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Walk before me, and be thou
perfect</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As, however, this second clause
is not always expressed, Paul instructs us that in all the promises this
condition is implied, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f441</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they must be incitements to us to promote the glory of God. For from what
does he deduce an argument to stimulate us? It is from this, that God confers
upon us such a distinguished honor. Such, then, is the nature of the promises,
that they call us to sanctification, as if God had interposed by an implied
agreement. We know, too,<i> </i>what the Scripture teaches in various passages
in reference to the design of redemption, and the same thing must be viewed as
applying to every token of his favor.</font><br></div>

</i>to mean the <i>soul, </i>is manifest from this, that if the term <i>spirit
</i>meant<i> </i>the grace of regeneration, Paul&#8217;s statement in reference
to the pollution of the spirit would be absurd. He would have us, therefore,
pure from defilements, not merely <i>inward, </i>such as have God alone as their
witness; but also <i>outward, </i>such as fall under the observation of men.
&#8220;Let<i> </i>us not merely have chaste consciences in the sight of God. We
must also consecrate to him our whole body and all its members, that no impurity
may be seen in any part of us.&#8221;

whatever kind, is a defilement of the spirit, what will they understand by
defilement of the flesh, but an outward profession of impiety, whether it be
pretended, or uttered from the heart? They boast of a pure conscience; that,
indeed, is on false grounds, but granting them what they falsely boast of, they
have only the half of what Paul requires from believers. Hence they have no
ground to think, that they have given satisfaction to God by that half; for let
a person show any appearance of idolatry at all, or any indication of it, or
take part in wicked or superstitious rites, even though he were &#8212; -what he
cannot be &#8212; perfectly upright in his own mind, he would, nevertheless, not
be exempt from the guilt of polluting his body.</font><br></div>

it is elegantly made use of here by Paul in the former signification, which is
the more frequent one &#8212; in such a way, however, as to allude to
sanctification, of which he is now treating. For while it denotes perfection, it
seems to have been intentionally transferred to sacred offices, because there
ought to be nothing defective in the service of God, but everything complete.
Hence, in order that you may sanctify yourself to God aright, you must dedicate
both body and soul entirely to him.</font><br></div>

it happen, that many delight themselves so much in outward idolatry, and
haughtily defend so gross a vice, unless it be, that they think that they mock

the foregoing apology was a sort of expostulation, and we can scarcely avoid
reproaching when we expostulate, he softens on this account what he had said.
&#8220;I clear myself,&#8221; says he, <i>&#8220;</i>in<i> </i>such a way as to
be desirous to avoid, what would tend to your dishonor.&#8221; The Corinthians,
it is true, were unkind, and they deserved that, on Paul&#8217;s being acquitted
from blame, <i>they </i>should be substituted in his place as the guilty party;
nay more, that they should be held guilty in two respects &#8212; in respect of
ingratitude, and on the ground of their having calumniated the innocent. Such,
however, is the Apostle&#8217;s moderation, that he refrains from recrimination,
contenting himself with standing simply on the defensive.</font><br></div>

nay more, if any fault has been committed, they either cover it over by taking
no notice of it, or soften it by kindness. For a disposition to reproach is a
sign of hatred. Hence Paul, with the view of showing that he has no inclination
to distress the Corinthians, declares his affection towards them. At the same
time, he undoubtedly in a manner

difference between gall and vinegar, so there is also between that condemnation,
by which we harass a man in a spirit of hatred, with the view of blasting him
with infamy, and, on the other hand, that, by which we endeavor to bring back an
offender into the right way, that, along with safety, he may in addition to this

stated, however, what appeared to me to be the more probable meaning &#8212;
that the report given by Titus had removed the unfavorable impression, which had
previously racked his mind?

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f457</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For he excepts spiritual consolations, by which he was in the mean time
sustained. He was afflicted, therefore, not merely in body, but also in mind, so
that, as a man, he experienced nothing but great bitterness of
afflictions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Without were

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fears</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he means the anxieties, that he endured on account of the internal maladies
of the Church, for it was not so much by personal as by public evils, that he
was disquieted. What he means, then, to say is this &#8212; that there were not
merely avowed enemies that were hostile to him, but that he endured,
nevertheless, much distress in consequence of domestic evils. For he saw how
great was the infirmity of many, nay of almost all, and in the mean time what,
and how diversified, were the machinations, by which Satan attempted to throw
every thing into confusion &#8212; how few were wise, how few were sincere, how
few were steadfast, and how many, on the other hand, were either mere
pretenders, and worthless, or ambitious, or turbulent. Amidst these
difficulties, the servants of God must of necessity feel alarmed, and be racked
with anxieties; and so much the more on this account &#8212; that they are
constrained to bear many things silently, that they may consult the peace of the
Churches. Hence he expressed himself with propriety when he said <i>&#8212;
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Without were fightings;
within were fears.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For faithful pastors
openly set themselves in opposition to those enemies that avowedly attack
Christ&#8217;s kingdom, but they are inwardly tormented, and endure secret
tortures, when they see the Church afflicted with internal evils, for the
exterminating of which they dare not openly sound the trumpet. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f458</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But although he had almost incessant conflicts, it is probable that he was at
that time more severely pressed than usual. The servants of Christ, undoubtedly,
have scarcely at any time exemption from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fears</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and Paul was seldom free from outward
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fightings;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>but as he was at that time more violently oppressed, he makes use of the
plural number &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fightings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and fears, meaning that he required to fight in many ways, and against
various enemies, and that he had at the same time many kinds of
fear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who comforteth the
lowly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is mentioned as a reason;
for he means that consolation had been offered to him, because he was borne down
with evils, and almost overwhelmed, inasmuch as God is wont to <i>comfort the
lowly, </i>that is, those that are cast down. Hence a most profitable doctrine
may be inferred &#8212; that the more we have been afflicted, so much the
greater consolation has been prepared for us by God. Hence, in the epithet here
applied to God, there is a choice promise contained, as though he had said,
that. it is peculiarly the part of God to comfort those that are miserable and
are abased to the dust.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.

in these terms &#8212; &#8221; What is it to us if Titus has cheered you by his
coming? No doubt, as you loved him, you would feel delighted to see him;&#8221;
he declares, that the occasion of his joy was, that Titus had, on returning from
them, communicated the most joyful intelligence. Accordingly he declares, that
it was not so much the presence of one individual, as the prosperous condition
of the Corinthians, that had cheered him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your
desire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Mark, what joyful tidings were
communicated to Paul respecting the Corinthians. Their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>desire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>originated in the circumstance, that they held Paul&#8217;s doctrine in high
estimation. Their <i>tears </i>were a token of respect; because, being affected
with his reproof, they mourned over their sins. Their <i>zeal </i>was an
evidence of good will. From these <i>three </i>things he inferred that they were
penitent. This afforded him full satisfaction, because he had no other intention
or anxiety, than the consulting of their welfare.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So that I rejoiced the
more</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>&#8212; that is, &#8220;So that all
my griefs and distresses gave way to joy.&#8221; Hence we see, not merely with
what fervor of mind he desired the public good of the Church, but also how mild
and gentle a disposition he possessed, as being one that could suddenly bury in
oblivion offenses of so serious a nature. At the same time, this may rather be
taken in another way, so as to be viewed in connection with what follows, and I
am not sure but that this meaning would correspond better with Paul&#8217;s
intention. As, however, it is a matter of no great moment, I pass over it
slightly.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For though I grieved you.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He now begins to apologize to the Corinthians
for having handle them somewhat roughly in the former Epistle. Now we must
observe, in what a variety of ways he deals with them, so that it, might appear
as though he sustained different characters. The reason is that his discourse
was directed to the whole of the Church. There were some there, that entertained
an unfavorable view of him &#8212; there were others that held him, as he
deserved, in the highest esteem &#8212; some were doubtful: others were
confident &#8212; some were docile: others were obstinate. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f459</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In consequence of this diversity, he required to direct his discourse now in one
way, then in another, in order to suit himself to all. Now he lessens, or rather
he takes away altogether any occasion of offense, on account of the severity
that lie had employed, on the ground of its having turned out to the promotion
of their welfare. &#8220;Your welfare,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is so much an
object of desire to me, that I am delighted to see that I have done you
good.&#8221; This softening-down is admissible only when the teacher 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f460</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
has done good so far as was needed, by means of his reproofs; for if he had
found, that the minds of the Corinthians still remained obstinate, and had he
perceived an advantage arising from the discipline that he had attempted, he
would, undoubtedly, have abated nothing from his former severity. It is to be
observed, however, that he rejoices to have been an occasion of grief to those
whom he loved; for he was more desirous to profit, than to please
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what does he mean when he adds &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>though I did
repent?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For if we admit, that Paul had
felt dissatisfied with what he had written, there would follow an
inconsistency<i> </i>of no slight character &#8212; that the former Epistle had
been written under a rash impulse, rather than under the guidance of the Spirit.
I answer, that the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is used here in a loose sense for being <i>grieved. </i>For while he made
the Corinthians sad, he himself also participated in the grief, and in a manner
inflicted grief at the same time upon himself. &#8220;Though I gave you pain
against my inclination, and it grieved me to be under the necessity of being
harsh to you, I am grieved no longer on that account, when I see that it has
been of advantage to you.&#8221; Let us take an instance from the case of a
father; for a father feels grief in connection with his severity,<i> </i>when at
any time he chastises his son, but approves of it, notwithstanding, because he
sees that it is conducive to his son&#8217;s advantage. In like manner Paul
could feel no pleasure in irritating the minds of the Corinthians; but, being
conscious of the motive that influenced his conduct, he preferred duty to
inclination.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I
see.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The transition is abrupt; but that
does not at all impair the distinctness of the sense. In the <i>first </i>place,
he says, that he had fully ascertained by the effect, that the former Epistle,
though for a time unwelcome, had nevertheless at length been of advantage, and
<i>secondly, </i>that he rejoiced on account of that
<i>advantage.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not because you have been
made sorry</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He means, that he feels no pleasure
whatever in their sorrow &#8212; nay more, had he his choice, he would endeavor
to promote equally their welfare and their joy, by the same means; but that as
he could not do otherwise, their welfare was of so much importance in his view,
that he rejoiced that they had been made sorry unto repentance. For there are
instances of physicians, who are, indeed, in other respects good and faithful,
but are at the same time harsh, and do not spare their patients. Paul declares,
that he is not of such a disposition as to employ harsh cures, when not
constrained by necessity. As, however, it had turned out well, that he had made
trial of that kind of cure, he congratulates himself on his success. He makes
use of a similar form of expression in

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f461</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>In the <i>first </i>place, in order to understand what is meant by this
<i>clause according to God, </i>we must observe the contrast, for the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sorrow that is according to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he contrasts with the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sorrow of the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Let us now take, also, the
contrast between two kinds of joy. The <i>joy of the world </i>is, when men
foolishly, and without the fear of the Lord, exult in vanity, that is, in the
world, and, intoxicated with a transient felicity, look no higher than the
earth. The </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>joy that is according
to God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is, when men place all their
happiness in God, and take satisfaction in His grace, and show this by contempt
of the world, using earthly prosperity as if they used it not, and joyful in the
midst of adversity. Accordingly, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sorrow of the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is, when men despond in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consequence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of earthly afflictions, and are overwhelmed with grief; while
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sorrow according to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is that which has an eye to God,
while they reckon it the one misery &#8212; to have lost the favor of God; when,
impressed with fear of His judgment, they mourn over their sins. This sorrow
Paul makes the cause and origin of repentance. This is carefully to be observed,
for unless the sinner be dissatisfied with himself, detest his manner of life,
and be thoroughly grieved from an apprehension of sin, he will never betake
himself to the Lord. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f462</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
On the other hand, it is impossible for a man to experience a sorrow of this
kind, without its giving birth to a new heart. Hence repentance takes its rise
in grief, for the reason that I have mentioned &#8212; because no one can return
to the right way, but the man who hates sin; but where hatred of sin is,
<i>there </i>is self-dissatisfaction and grief.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, however, a beautiful allusion here to the
term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repentance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>when he says &#8212;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> not to
be repented of</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for however unpleasant
the thing is at first taste, it renders itself desirable by its usefulness. The
epithet, it is true, might apply to the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>equally as to that of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repentance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>but it appears to me to suit better with the
term</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
repentance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>&#8220;We are taught by the
result itself, that grief ought not to be painful to us, or distressing. In like
manner, although repentance contains in it some degree of bitterness, if, is
spoken of as</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> not to be repented
of</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>on account of the precious and
pleasant fruit which it produces.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Paul seems to make repentance
the ground of salvation. Were it so, it would follow, that we are justified by
works. I answer, that we must observe what Paul here treats of, for he is not
inquiring as to the ground of salvation, but simply commending repentance from
the fruit which it produces, he says that it is like a way by which we arrive at
salvation. Nor is it without good reason; for Christ <i>calls us </i>by way of
free favor, but it is <i>to repentance.
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400913&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
9:13.) God by way of free favor pardons our sins, but only when we renounce
them. Nay more, God accomplishes in us at one and the same time two things:
being renewed by repentance, we are delivered from the <i>bondage </i>of our
sins; and, being justified by faith, we are delivered also from the <i>curse
</i>of our sins. They are, therefore, inseparable fruits of grace, and, in
consequence of their invariable connection, repentance may with fitness and
propriety be represented as an introduction to salvation, but in this way of
speaking of it, it is represented as an <i>effect </i>rather than as a <i>cause.
</i>These are not. refinements for the purpose of evasion, but a true and simple
solution, for, while Scripture teaches us that we never obtain forgiveness of
sins without repentance, it represents at the same time, in a variety of
passages, the mercy of God alone as the ground of our obtaining
it.</font><br></div>

any dispute as to whether the things that Paul enumerates are effects of
repentance, or belong to it, or are preparatory to it, as all this is
unnecessary for understanding Paul&#8217;s design, for he simply proves the
repentance of the Corinthians from its signs, or accompaniments. At the same
time he makes </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sorrow according to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to be the source of all these
things, inasmuch as they spring from it &#8212; which is assuredly the case; for
when we have begun to feel self-dissatisfaction, we are afterwards stirred up to
seek after the other things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What is meant by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>earnest
desire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we may understand from what is
opposed to it; for so long as there is no apprehension of sin, we lie drowsy and
inactive. Hence drowsiness or carelessness, or unconcern, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f463</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
stands opposed to that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>earnest
desire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that he makes mention of.
Accordingly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>earnest
desire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>means simply an eager and active
assiduity in the correcting of what is amiss, and in the amendment of
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea, what clearing of
yourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Erasmus having rendered it
<i>satisfaction, </i>ignorant persons, misled by the ambiguity of the term, have
applied it to popish <i>satisfactions, </i>whereas Paul employs the term
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpologi&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>(<i>defense.</i>)<i> </i>It is on this account that I have preferred to
retain the word<i> defensionem, </i>which the Old Interpreter had made use of. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f464</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is, however, to be observed, that it is a kind of <i>defense </i>that
consists rather in supplication for pardon, than in extenuation of sin. As a
son, who is desirous to clear himself to his father, does not enter upon a
regular pleading of his cause, but by acknowledging his fault excuses himself,
rather in the spirit of a suppliant, than &#8216;in a tone of confidence,
hypocrites, also, excuse themselves &#8212; nay more, they haughtily defend
themselves, but it is rather in the way of disputing with God, than of returning
to favor with him; and should any one prefer the word <i>excusationem,
</i>(<i>excuse,</i>)<i> </i>I do not object to it; because the meaning will
amount to the same thing, that the Corinthians were prompted to clear
themselves, whereas previously they cared not what Paul thought of
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea, what
indignation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f465</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>This disposition, also, is attendant on sacred sorrow &#8212; that the
sinner is indignant against his vices, and even against himself, as also all
that are actuated by a right zeal 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f466</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
are indignant, as often as they see that God is offended. This disposition,
however, is more intense than sorrow. For the <i>first </i>step is, that evil be
displeasing to us. The <i>second </i>is, that, being inflamed with anger, we
press hard upon ourselves, so that our consciences may be touched to the quick.
It may, however, be taken here to mean
the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
indignation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>with which the Corinthians
had been inflamed against the sins of one or a few, whom they had previously
spared. Thus they repented of their concurrence or connivance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is what. arises from an apprehension of divine judgment, while the offender
thinks &#8212; &#8220;Mark it well, an account must be rendered by thee, and
what wilt thou advance in the presence of so great a judge?&#8221; For, alarmed
by such a consideration, he begins to tremble.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, the wicked themselves are sometimes
touched with an alarm of this nature, he adds <i>desire. </i>This disposition we
know to be more of a voluntary nature than <i>fear, </i>for we are often afraid
against our will, but we never desire but from inclination. Hence, as they had
dreaded punishment on receiving Paul&#8217;s admonition, so they eagerly aimed
at amendment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what are we to understand by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>zeal?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>There can be no doubt that he intended a climax. Hence it means more
than</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
desire</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now we may understand by it,
that they stirred up each other in a spirit of mutual rivalry. It is simpler,
however, to understand it as meaning, that every one, with great fervor of zeal,
aimed to give evidence of his repentance. Thus zeal is intensity of
desire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea, what
revenge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>What we have said as to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>indignation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>must be applied also to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>revenge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for the wickedness which they had countenanced by their connivance and
indulgence, they had afterwards shown themselves rigorous in avenging. They had
for some time tolerated incest; but, on being admonished by Paul, they had not
merely ceased to countenance him, but had been strict reprovers in chastening
him, &#8212; this was the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
revenge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that was meant. As, however, we
ought to punish sins wherever they are, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f467</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and not only so, but should begin more especially with ourselves, there is
something farther meant in what the Apostle says here, for he speaks of the
signs of repentance. There is, among others, this more particularly &#8212;
that, by punishing sins, we anticipate, in a manner, the judgment of God, as he
teaches elsewhere, If we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged by the
Lord.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 11:31.) We are not, however, to infer from this, that mankind, by
taking vengeance upon themselves, compensate to God for the punishment due to
him, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f468</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so that they redeem themselves from his hand. The case stands thus &#8212; that,
as it is the design of God by chastising us, to arouse us from our carelessness,
that, being reminded of his displeasure, we may be on our guard for the future,
when the sinner himself is beforehand in inflicting punishment of his own
accord, the effect is, that he no longer stands in need of such an admonition
from God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is asked, whether the Corinthians had an eye
to Paul, or to God, in this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>revenge,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">as well as in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>zeal,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>desire,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and the rest. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f469</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I answer, that all these things are, under all <i>circumstances, </i>attendant
upon repentance, but there is a difference in the case of an individual sinning
<i>secretly </i>before God, or openly before the world. If a person&#8217;s sin
is secret, it is enough if he has this disposition in the sight of God. on the
other hand, where the sin is open, there is required besides an open
manifestation of repentance. Thus the Corinthians, who had sinned openly and to
the great offense of the good, required to give evidence of their repentance by
these tokens. </font><br></div>

&#8220;Ye have shown yourselves.&#8221; Erasmus renders it, &#8220;Ye have
commended yourselves.&#8221; I have preferred a <i>third </i>rendering, which
appeared to me to suit better &#8212; that the Corinthians showed by clear
evidences, that they were in no degree participants in the crime, with which
they had appeared, from their connivance, to have had some connection. What
those evidences were, we have already seen. At the same time, Paul does not
altogether clear them, but palliates their offense. For the undue forbearance,
which they had exercised<i>, </i>was not altogether free from blame. He acquits
them, however, from the charge of concurrence. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f470</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We must farther observe, that he does not acquit all of them without exception,
but merely the body of the Church. For it may readily be believed, that some
were concerned in it, and countenanced it; but, while all of them together were
involved in disgrace, it afterwards appeared that only a few were in
fault.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12. </b><i>Wherefore if I wrote. </i>He acts as

past things to be buried, he does not any more reproach them, he does not
reprove them for any thing, he does not expostulate as to any thing; in fine, he
forgets every thing, inasmuch as he was satisfied with their simply repenting.
And, certainly, this is the right way &#8212; not to press offenders farther,
when they have been brought to repentance. For if we still</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">call their sins to
remembrance,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;111718&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1

<div><font face="Palatino">it is certain that we are actuated by malevolence,
rather than: by pious affection, or a desire for their welfare. These things,
however, are said by Paul by way of concession, for, unquestionably, he had
followed up the offense that he had taken, and had felt desirous that the author
of this offense should be chastised, but now he puts his foot upon what had been
in some degree offensive. &#8220;I am now desirous, that whatever I have written
may be looked upon as having been written with no other view, than that you
might perceive your affection towards me. As to all other things, let us now
leave them as they are.&#8221; Others explain it in this way, &#8212; that he
had not regard to one individual in particular, but consulted the common
advantage of all. The former interpretation, however, is the more natural
one.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your concern for
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As this reading occurs very
generally in the Greek versions, I have not ventured to go so far as to erase
it, though at the same time in one ancient manuscript the reading is

</i>(<i>of us,</i>) 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f471</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and it appears from Chrysostom s Commentaries, that the Latin rendering 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f472</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
was more commonly received in his times even among the Greeks &#8212;<i> that
our concern for you might become manifest to you, </i>that is, that it might be
manifest to the Corinthians, how much concerned Paul was in regard to them. The
other rendering, however, in which the greater part of the Greek manuscripts
concur, is, notwithstanding, a probable one. For Paul congratulates the
Corinthians on their having learned at length, through means of this test, how
they stood affected towards him. &#8220;You<i> </i>were not yourselves aware of
the attachment that you felt towards me, until you had trial of it in this
matter.&#8221; Others explain it as referring to the particular disposition of
an individual, in this way: &#8220;That<i> </i>it might be manifest among you,
how much respect each of you entertained for me, and that, through the
occurrence of this opportunity, each of you might discover what had previously
been concealed in his heart.&#8221; As this is not of great moment, my readers
are at liberty, so far as I am concerned, to make choice of either; but, as he
adds at the same time, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
sight of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I rather think that he
meant this &#8212; that each of them, having made a thorough search, as if he
had come into the presence of God, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f473</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
had come to know himself better than before.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We received
consolation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Paul was wholly intent upon
persuading the Corinthians, that nothing was more eagerly desired by him than
their advantage. Hence he says, that he had shared with them in their
consolation. Now their consolation had been this &#8212; that, acknowledging
their fault, they did not merely take the reproof in good part, but had received
it joyfully. For the bitterness of a reproof is easily sweetened, so soon as we
begin to taste the profitableness of it to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he adds &#8212; that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rejoiced more abundantly on
account of the consolation of Titus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is
by way of congratulation. Titus had been overjoyed in finding them more obedient
and compliant than could have been expected &#8212; nay more, in his finding a
sudden change for the better. Hence we may infer, that Paul&#8217;s gentleness
was anything but flattery, inasmuch as he rejoiced in their joy, so as to be, at
the same time, chiefly taken up with their repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if I have boasted any
thing to him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He shows indirectly, how
friendly a disposition he had always exercised towards the Corinthians, and with
what sincerity and kindness he had judged of them; for at the very time that
they seemed to be unworthy of commendation, he still promised much that was
honorable on their behalf. Here truly we have a signal evidence of a rightly
constituted and candid mind, &#8212; reproving to their face those that you
love, and yet hoping well, and giving others good hopes respecting them. Such
sincerity ought to have induced them not to take amiss any thing that proceeded
from him. In the mean time, he takes this opportunity of setting before them
again, in passing, his fidelity in all other matters. &#8220;You have hitherto
had opportunity of knowing my candor, so that I have shown myself to be
truthful, and not by any means fickle. I rejoice, therefore, that I have now
also been found truthful, when boasting of you before
others.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His bowels more
abundantly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowels</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>are the seat of the affections, the term is on that account employed to
denote compassion, love, and every pious affection. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f474</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He wished, however, to express emphatically the idea, that while Titus had loved
the Corinthians previously, he had been, at that time, more vehemently stirred
up to love them; and that, from the innermost affections of his heart. Now, by
these words he insinuates Titus into the affections of the Corinthians, as it is
of advantage that the servants of Christ should be loved, that they may have it
in their power to do the more good. He at the same time encourages them to go on
well, that they may render themselves beloved by all the good.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With fear and
trembling.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these two words he
sometimes expresses simply <i>respect,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:5,) and this perhaps would not suit ill with this passage, though I should
have no objection to view the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
trembling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as mentioned particularly to
mean, that, being conscious of having acted amiss, they were afraid to face him.
It is true that even those, that are resolute in their iniquities, tremble at
the sight of the judge, but voluntary trembling, that proceeds from ingenuous
shame, is a sign of repentance. Whichever exposition you may choose, this
passage teaches, what is a right reception for the ministers of Christ.
Assuredly, it is not sumptuous banquets, it is not splendid apparel, it is not
courteous and honorable salutations, it is not the plaudits of the multitude,
that gratify the upright and faithful pastor. He experiences, on the other hand,
an overflowing of delight, when the doctrine of salvation is received with
reverence from his mouth, when he retains the authority that belongs to him for
the edification of the Church, when the people give themselves up to his
direction, to be regulated by his ministry under Christ&#8217;s banners. An
example of this we see here in Titus. He at length, in the close, confirms
again, what he had previously stated &#8212; that he had never been offended to
such a degree, as altogether to distrust the Corinthians.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As, in the event of the Corinthians retaining any
feeling of offense, occasioned by the severity of the preceding Epistle, that
might stand in the way of Paul&#8217;s authority having influence over them, he
has hitherto made it his endeavor to conciliate their affections. Now, after
clearing away all occasion of offense, and regaining favor for his ministry, he
recommends to them the brethren at Jerusalem, that they may furnish help to
their necessities. He could not, with any great advantage, have attempted this
in the commencement of the Epistle. Hence, he has prudently deferred it, until
he has prepared their minds for it. Accordingly, he takes up the whole of this
chapter, and the next, in exhorting the Corinthians to be active and diligent in
collecting alms to be taken to Jerusalem for relieving the Indigence of the
brethren. For they were afflicted with a great famine, so that they could
scarcely support life, without being aided by other churches. The Apostles had
intrusted Paul with this matter,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
2:10,) and he had promised to concern himself in reference to it, and he had
already done so in part, as we have seen in the former Epistle. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f476</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now, however, he presses them still farther.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I make known to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He commends the Macedonians, but it
is with the design of stimulating the Corinthians by their example, although he
does not expressly say so; for the former had no need of commendation, but the
latter had need of a stimulus. And that he may stir up the Corinthians the more
to emulation, he ascribes it to
the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> grace of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that the Macedonians had been so
forward to give help to their brethren. For although it is acknowledged by all,
that it is a commendable virtue to give help. to the needy, they, nevertheless,
do not reckon it. to be a gain, nor do they look upon it as the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grace of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Nay rather, they reckon, that it is
so much of what was theirs taken from them, and lost. Paul, on the other hand,
declares, that we ought to ascribe it to the grace of God, when we afford aid to
our brethren, and that it ought to be desired by us as a privilege of no
ordinary kind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He makes mention, however, of a twofold favor, that
had been conferred upon the Macedonians. The <i>first </i>is, that they had
endured afflictions with composure and cheerfulness. The <i>second </i>is, that
from their slender means, equally as though they had possessed abundance, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f477</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they had taken something &#8212; to be laid out upon their brethren. Each of
these things, Paul affirms with good reason, is a work of the Lord, for all
quickly fail, that are not upheld by the Spirit of God, who is the Author of all
consolation, and distrust clings to us, deeply rooted, which keeps us back from
all offices of love, until it is subdued by the grace of the same
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In much
trial</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; In other words, while they were
tried with adversity, they, nevertheless, did not cease to rejoice in the Lord:
nay, this disposition rose so high, as to swallow up sorrow; for the minds of
the Macedonians, which must. otherwise have been straitened, required to be set
free from their restraints, that they might liberally 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f478</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
furnish aid to the brethren.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he means that spiritual consolation by which believers are sustained under
their afflictions; for the wicked either delude themselves with empty
consolations, by avoiding a perception of the evil, and drawing off the mind to
rambling thoughts, or else they wholly give way to grief, and allow themselves
to be overwhelmed with it. Believers, on the other hand, seek occasions
of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in the affliction itself, as we see
in the 8th chapter of the Romans. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f479</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their deep
poverty.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here we have a metaphor taken
from exhausted vessels, as though he had said, that the Macedonians had been
emptied, so that they had now reached the bottom. He says, that even in such
straits they had abounded in liberality, and had been rich, so as to have enough
&#8212; not merely for their own use, but also for giving assistance to others.
Mark the way, in which we shall always be liberal even in the most straitened
poverty &#8212; if by liberality of mind we make up for what is deficient in our
coffers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Liberality</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is opposed to niggardliness, as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:8, where Paul requires this on the part of deacons. For what makes us more
close-handed than we ought to be is &#8212; when we look too carefully, and too
far forward, in contemplating the dangers that may occur &#8212; when we are
excessively cautious and careful &#8212; -when we calculate too narrowly what we
will require during our whole life, or, in fine, how much we lose when the
smallest portion is taken away. The man, that depends upon the blessing of the
Lord, has his mind set free from these trammels, and has, at the same time, his
hands opened for beneficence. Let us now draw an argument from the less to the
greater. &#8220;Slender means, nay poverty, did not prevent the Macedonians from
doing good to their brethren: What excuse, then, will the Corinthians have, if
they keep back, while opulent and affluent in comparison of
them?&#8221;</font><br></div>

they were </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>willing of
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he means that they were, of
their own accord, so well prepared for the duty, that they needed no
exhortation. It was a great thing &#8212; to strive up to the measure of their
ability; and hence, to exert themselves
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beyond</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>their ability, showed a rare, and truly admirable excellence. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f480</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now he speaks according to the common custom of men, for the common rule of
doing good is that which Solomon prescribes,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;200515&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
5:15) &#8212;</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f481</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Macedonians, on the other hand, making no account
of themselves, and almost losing sight of themselves, concerned themselves
rather as to providing for others. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f482</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In fine, those that are in straitened circumstances are willing beyond their
ability, if they lay out any thing upon others from their slender
means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Beseeching us with much
entreaty. </i></font><font face="Palatino">He enlarges upon their promptitude,
inasmuch as they did not only not wait for any one to admonish them, but even

anticipated the desires of all by their activity. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f483</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We must again repeat the comparison formerly made between the less and the
greater. &#8220;If the Macedonians, without needing to be besought, press
forward of their own accord, nay more, anticipate others by using entreaties,
how shameful a thing is it for the Corinthians to be inactive, more especially
after being admonished! If the Macedonians lead the way before all, how shameful
a thing is it for the Corinthians not, at least, to imitate their example! But
what are we to think, when, not satisfied with <i>beseeching, </i>they added to
their requests </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>earnest
entreaty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and much of it too?&#8221; Now
from this it appears, that they had <i>besought, </i>not. as a mere form, but in
good earnest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the favor and the
fellowship.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The <i>term favor </i>he has
made use of, for the purpose of recommending alms, though at the same time the
word may be explained in different ways. This interpretation, however, appears
to me to be the more simple one; because, as our heavenly Father freely bestows
upon us all things, so we ought to be imitators of his unmerited kindness in
doing good,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400545&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:45); or at least, because, in laying out our resources, we are simply the
dispensers of his <i>favor. </i>The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fellowship of this
ministry</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>consisted in his being a helper
to the Macedonians in this <i>ministry. </i>They contributed of their own, that
it might be <i>administered </i>to the saints. They wished, that Paul would take
the charge of collecting it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.

degree of willingness, such as any Christian should manifest; but they went
beyond his expectation, inasmuch as they not only had their worldly substance in
readiness, but were prepared to devote even <i>themselves.

<div><font face="Palatino">It may be asked, whether their giving themselves to
God, and to Paul, were two different things. It is quite a common thing, that
when God charges or commands through means of any one, he associates the person
whom he employs as his minister, both in authority to enjoin, and in the
obedience that is rendered.</font><br></div>

Nor was it offensive to the Macedonians, that he was desirous to have the
Corinthians as partners in beneficence. In the mean time an apology is made for
Titus, that the Corinthians may not think that he pressed too hard upon them, as
if he had not confidence in their good disposition. For he did that, from having
been entreated, and it was rather in the name of the Macedonians, than in his
own.</font><br></div>

avoid giving offense, inasmuch as he said, that Titus had entreated them, not so
much from his own inclination, as in consideration of the charge given him by
the Macedonians. Now, however, he goes a step farther, by admonishing them, that
they must not even wait for the message of the Macedonians being communicated to
them; and that too, by commending their other virtues. &#8220;You ought not
merely to associate yourselves as partners with the Macedonians, who require
that; but surpass them in this respect, too, as you do in
others.&#8221;</font><br></div>

charges us to help the necessities of our brethren, but he nowhere specifies the
sum; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f486</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

take the rule of love as our guide.</font><br></div>

lawful for him, or unlawful, but says, that he does not <i>command </i>as if he
reckoned that they required to be constrained by <i>command </i>and requirement,

assigns, on the other hand, two reasons why he, notwithstanding, stirs them up
to duty. <i>first<b>,</b> </i>Because the concern felt by him for the saints
compels him to do so; and, <i>secondly, </i>Because he is desirous, that the

meanings &#8212; either that he felt an anxiety as to the individuals, which did
not allow him to be inactive, or that, yielding to the entreaties of others, who
had the matter at heart, he spoke not so much from his own feeling, as at the

would also have been <i>useless, </i>inasmuch as everything that they had
attempted to do would have come<i> </i>short of acceptance in the sight of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who had begun not only to

is not taken simply, (as we commonly say,) but conveys the idea of spontaneous
alacrity, that waits for no monitor. For there are <i>three </i>gradations, so
to speak, as to acting. <i>First<b>,</b> </i>we sometimes act unwillingly, but
it is from shame or fear. <i>Secondly, </i>we act willingly, but at the same
time it is from being either impelled, or induced from influence, apart from our
own minds. <i>Thirdly, </i>we act from the prompting of our own minds, when we
of our own accord set ourselves to do what is becoming. Such <i>cheerfulness

the flesh is always ingenious in finding out subterfuges. Some plead that they
have families, which it were inhuman to neglect; others, on the ground that they
cannot give much, make use of this as a pretext for entire exemption. Could I
give so small a sum? All excuses of this nature Paul removes, when he commands
every one to contribute according to the measure of his ability. He adds, also,
the reason: that God looks to the heart &#8212; not to what is given, for when
he says, that readiness of mind is acceptable<i> </i>to God, according to the
individual&#8217;s ability, his meaning is this &#8212; &#8221; If from slender

that is, God does by no means require of thee, that thou coldest contribute more
than thy resources allow.&#8221; In this way none are excused;<i> </i>for the
rich, on the one hand, owe to God a larger offering, and the poor, on the other
hand, ought not to be ashamed of their slender resources.</font><br></div>

preceding statement &#8212; that a readiness of will is well-pleasing to God
alike in poverty and in wealth, inasmuch as God does not mean that we should be
reduced to straits, in order that others may be at ease through our liberality.
True, indeed, it is certain, that we owe to God, not merely a part, but all that
we are, and all that we have, but in His kindness He spares us thus far, that He
is satisfied with that participation of which the Apostle here speaks, What he
teaches here you must understand to mean an abatement from the rigor of law 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f490</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In the mean time, it is our part to stir ourselves up from time to time to
liberality, because we must not be so much afraid of going to excess in this

niggardliness.</font><br></div>

relieve the necessity of our brethren from our abundance &#8212; not in such a
way that they are at ease, and we are in want, but so that we may, from what

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ijso&gt;thta

In this signification it is made use of, also, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
4:1, where he exhorts &#8220;masters<i> </i>to give to their servants what is
<i>equal.</i>&#8221;<i> </i>He certainly does not mean, that they should be
equal in condition and station, but by this term he expresses that humanity and
clemency, and kind treatment, which masters, in their turn, owe to their
servants. Thus the Lord recommends to us a proportion of this nature, that we
may, in so far as every one&#8217;s resources admit, afford help to the
indigent, that there may not be some in affluence, and others in indigence.
Hence he adds &#8212; at <i>the present time. </i>At that time, indeed,
necessity pressed upon them. Hence we are admonished that, in exercising
beneficence, we must provide for the present necessity, if we would observe the
true rule of equity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their
abundance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is uncertain, what sort of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abundance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he means. Some interpret it as meaning, that this had been the case,
inasmuch as the Gospel had flowed out to them from the Church at Jerusalem, from
which source they had, in their penury, been assisted by their spiritual riches.
This, I think, is foreign to Paul&#8217;s intention. It ought rather, in my
opinion, to be applied to the communion of saints, which means, that whatever
duty is discharged to one member, redounds to the advantage of the entire body.
&#8220;If<i> </i>it is irksome to you to help your brethren with riches that are
of no value, consider how many blessings you are destitute of, and these too,
far more precious, with which you may be enriched by those who are poor as to
worldly substance. This participation, which Christ has established among the
members of his body, should animate you to be more forward, and more active in
doing good.&#8221; The meaning may, also, be this. &#8220;You<i> </i>now relieve
them according to the necessity of the occasion, but they will have an
opportunity given them at another time of requiting you.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f496</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I approve rather of the other sentiment, which is of a more general nature, and
with this accords what he again repeats in reference to equality. For the system
of proportional right in the Church is this &#8212; that while they communicate
to each other mutually according to the measure of gifts and of necessity, this
mutual contribution produces a befitting symmetry, though some have more, and
some less, and gifts are distributed unequally. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f497</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As it is
written.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The passage, that Paul quotes,
refers to the manna, but let us hear what the Lord says by Moses. He would have
this to serve as a never-failing proof, that men do not live by bread alone, but
are Divinely supported, by the secret influence of <i>His </i>will, who
maintains and preserves all things that he has created. Again, in another
passage,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;050803&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
8:3,) Moses admonishes them, that they had been nourished for a time with such
food, that they might learn that men are supported &#8212; not by their own
industry or labor, but by the blessing of God. Hence it appears, that in the
manna, as in a mirror, there is presented to us an emblem of the ordinary food
that we partake of. Let us now come to the passage that Paul quotes. When the
manna had fallen, they were commanded to gather it in heaps, so far as every one
could, though at the same time, as some are more active than others, there was
more gathered by some than was necessary for daily use, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f498</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet no one took for his own private use more than an homer, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f499</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for that was the measure that was prescribed by the Lord. This being the case,
all had as much as was sufficient, and no one was in want. This we have in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021618&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
16:18.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now apply the history to Paul&#8217;s object.
The Lord has not prescribed to us an homer, or any other measure, according to
which the food of each day is to be regulated, but he has enjoined upon us
frugality and temperance, and has forbidden, that any one should go to excess,
taking advantage of his abundance. Let those, then, that have riches, whether
they have been left by inheritance, or procured by industry and efforts,
consider that their abundance was not intended to be laid out in intemperance or
excess, but in relieving the necessities of the brethren. For whatever we have
is <i>manna, </i>from whatever quarter it comes, provided it be really <i>ours,
</i>inasmuch as riches acquired by fraud, and unlawful artifices, are unworthy
to be called so, but are rather <i>quails </i>sent forth by the anger of God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;041131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
11:31.) And as in the case of one hoarding the manna, either from excessive
greed or from distrust, what was laid up immediately putrified, so we need not
doubt that the riches, that are heaped up at the expense of our brethren, are
accursed, and will soon perish, and that too, in connection with the ruin of the
owner; so that we are not to think that it is the way to increase, if,
consulting our own advantage for a long while to come, we defraud our poor
brethren of the beneficence that we owe them. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f500</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I acknowledge, indeed, that there is not enjoined upon us an equality of such a
kind, as to make it unlawful for the rich to live in any degree of greater
elegance than the poor; but an equality is to be observed thus far &#8212; that
no one is to be allowed to starve, and no one is to hoard his abundance at the
expense of defrauding others. The poor man&#8217;s <i>homer</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f501</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>will be coarse food and a spare diet; the rich man&#8217;s <i>homer </i>will
be a more abundant portion, it is true, according to his circumstances, but at
the same time in such a way that they live temperately, and are not wanting to
others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But thanks be to God who hath
put.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That he may leave the Corinthians
without excuse, he now at length adds, that there had been provided for them
active prompters, who would attend to the matter. And, in the first place, he
names Titus, who, he says, had been divinely raised up. This was of great
importance in the case. For his embassy would be so much the more successful, if
the Corinthians recognized him as having come to them, from having been stirred
up to it by God. From this passage, however, as from innumerable others, we
infer that there are no pious affections that do not proceed from the Spirit of
God; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f502</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and farther, that this is an evidence of God&#8217;s concern for his people,
that he raises up ministers and guardians, to make it their endeavor to relieve
their necessities. But if the providence of God shows itself in this manner, in
providing the means of nourishment for the body, how much greater care will he
exercise as to the means of spiritual nourishment, that his people may not be in
want of them! Hence it is His special and peculiar work to raise up pastors.

from being exhorted to it by Paul. He afterwards corrects this by saying, that
Titus had not been so much influenced by the advice of others, as he had felt
stirred up of his own accord, in accordance with his active
disposition.</font><br></div>

respecting the Corinthians, and it became them to be so much the more attentive
to duty, that they might not disappoint the hopes of the Churches. It is
uncertain, however, who this <i>second </i>person was; only that some conjecture
that it was Luke, others that it was Barnabas. Chrysostom prefers to consider it
to have been Barnabas. I agree with him, because it appears that, by the
suffrages of the Churches, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f507</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he was associated with Paul as a companion. As, however, it is almost
universally agreed, that Luke was one of those who were the bearers of this
Epistle, I have no objection that he be reckoned to be the <i>third </i>that is
made mention of.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the second person, whoever he may be, he honors
with a signal commendation, that he had conducted himself as to the gospel in a
praiseworthy manner, that is, he had earned applause by promoting the gospel.
For, although Barnabas gave place to Paul in the department of <i>speaking,
</i>yet in <i>acting </i>they both concurred. He adds farther, that he had
received praise, not from one individual, or even from one Church merely, but
from all the Churches. To this general testimony he subjoins a particular one,
that is suitable to the subject in hand &#8212; that he had been chosen for this
department by the concurrence of the Churches. Now it was likely, that this
honor would not have been conferred upon him, had he not been long before known
to be qualified for it. We must observe, however, the mode of election &#8212;
that which was customary among the Greeks<i> &#8212;</i>

</i>that he had been the adviser of this measure, with the view of providing
against calumnies. Here some one will ask, &#8220;Would<i> </i>any one have been
so impudent, as to venture to defame with even the slightest suspicion the man,
whose fidelity must have been,<i> </i>in all quarters, beyond every
surmise?&#8221; I answer, Who is there that will be exempt from Satan&#8217;s
bite, when even Christ himself was not spared by them? Behold, Christ is exposed
to the reproaches 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f512</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the wicked,<i> </i>and shall his servants be in safety?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401025&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:25.) Nay rather, the more upright a person is, in that proportion does Satan
assail him by every kind of contrivance, if he can by any means shake his
credit, for there would arise from this a much greater occasion of stumbling. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f513</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence the higher the station in which we are placed, we must so much the more
carefully imitate Paul&#8217;s circumspection and modesty. He was not so lifted
up, as not to be under control equally with any individual of the flock. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f514</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He was not so self-complacent, as to think it beneath his station to provide
against calumnies. Hence he prudently shunned dangers, and used great care not
to furnish any wicked person with a handle against him. And, certainly, nothing
is more apt to give rise to unfavorable surmises, than the management of public
money.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Providing things
honest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I am of opinion, that there were
not wanting, even among the Corinthians, some who would have proceeded so far as
to revile, if occasion had been allowed them. Hence he wished them to know the
state of matters, that he might shut the mouths of all everywhere. Accordingly
he declares,<i> </i>that he is not merely concerned to have a good conscience in
the sight of God, but also to have a good character among men. At the same time,
there can be no doubt, that he designed to instruct the Corinthians, as well as
all others, by his example, that, in doing what is right, the opinion of men is
not to be disregarded. The first thing, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f515</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it is true, is that the person take care, that he be a good man. This is
secured, not by mere outward actions, but by an upright conscience. The next
thing is, that the persons, with whom you are conversant, recognize you as
such.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, however, the object in view must be looked to.
Nothing, assuredly, is worse than ambition, which vitiates the best things in
the world, disfigures, I say, the most graceful, and makes sacrifices<i> </i>of
the sweetest smell have an offensive odor before the Lord. Hence this passage is
slippery, so that care must be taken 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f516</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
lest one should pretend to be desirous, in common with Paul, of a good
reputation, and yet be very far from having Paul&#8217;s disposition, for he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>provided things honest in the
sight of men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that no one might be
stumbled by his example, but that, on the contrary, all might be edified. Hence
we must, if we would desire to be like him, take care that we be not on our own
account desirous of a good name. &#8220;He that is regardless of fame,&#8221;
says Augustine, &#8220;is cruel, because it is not less necessary before our
neighbor, than a good conscience is before God.&#8221; This is true, provided
you consult the welfare of your brethren with a view to the glory of God, and in
the mean time are prepared to bear reproaches and ignominy in place of
commendation, if the Lord should see it meet. Let a Christian man, however,
always take care to frame his life with a view to the edification of his
neighbors, and diligently take heed, that the ministers of Satan shall have no
pretext for reviling, to the dishonor of God and the offense of the
good.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This statement may seem at first view to suit ill, or
not sufficiently well, with what goes before; for he seems to speak of a new
matter, that he had not previously touched upon, while in reality he is
following out the same subject. Let the <i>reader, </i>however, observe, that
Paul treats of the very same matter that he had been treating of before &#8212;
that it was from no want of confidence that he exhorted the Corinthians, and
that his admonition is not coupled with any reproof as to the past, but that he
has particular reasons that influence him. The meaning, then, of what he says
now is this: &#8220;I do not teach you that it is a duty to afford relief to the
saints, for what need were there of this? For that. is sufficiently well known
to you, and you have given practical evidence that you are not prepared to be
wanting to them; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f521</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but as I have, from boasting everywhere of your liberality, pledged my credit
along with yours, this consideration will not allow me to refrain from
speaking.&#8221; But for this, such anxious concern might have been somewhat
offensive to the Corinthians, because they would have thought, either that they
were reproached for their indolence, or that they were suspected by Paul. By
bringing forward, however, a most, suitable apology, he secures for himself the
liberty of not merely exhorting them, without giving offense, but even from time
to time urging them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some one, however, may possibly suspect, that Paul
here pretends what he does not really think. This were exceedingly absurd; for
if he reckons them to be sufficiently prepared for doing their duty, why does he
set himself so vigorously to admonish them? and, on the other hand, if he is in
doubt as to their willingness, why does he declare it to be unnecessary to
admonish them? Love carries with it these two things, &#8212; good hope, and
anxious concern. Never would he have borne such a testimony in favor of the
Corinthians, had he not been fully of the mind that he expresses. he had seen a
happy commencement: he had hoped, that the farther progress of the matter would
be corresponding; but as he was well aware of the unsteadiness of the human
mind, he could not provide too carefully against their turning aside from their
pious design.</font><br></div>

For the members of Christ ought mutually to minister to each other. In this way,

boasted, that they had been </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ready
a year before</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>with it, while he is still
urging them to have it in readiness. I answer, that his words are not to be
understood as though Paul had declared, that what they were to give was already
laid aside in the chest, but he simply mentioned what had been resolved upon
among them. This involves no blame in respect of fickleness or mistake. It was,

He now commends alms-giving by a beautiful similitude, comparing it to sowing.
For in sowing, the seed is cast forth by the hand, is scattered upon the ground
on this side and on that, is harrowed, and at length rots; and thus it seems as
good as lost. The case is similar as to alms-giving. What goes from you to some
other quarter seems as if it were, diminishing of what you have, but the season
of harvest will come, when the fruit will be gathered. For as the Lord reckons
every thing that is laid out upon the poor as given to himself, so he afterwards
requites it with large interest.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;201917&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs

corresponding to the sowing: he that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sows

reap a correspondingly bountiful harvest. Let this doctrine be deeply rooted in
our minds, that, whenever carnal reason keeps us back from doing good through
fear of loss, we may immediately defend ourselves with this shield &#8212;
&#8220;But the Lord declares that we are <i>sowing.</i>&#8221; The <i>harvest,
</i>however, should be explained as referring to the spiritual recompense of
eternal life, as well as to earthly blessings, which God confers upon the
beneficent. For God requites, not only in heaven, but. also in this world, the
beneficence of believers. Hence it is as though he had said, &#8220;The<i>
</i>more beneficent you are to your neighbors, you will find the blessing of God
so much the more abundantly poured out upon you.&#8221; He again contrasts here
<i>blessing </i>with <i>sparing, </i>as he had previously done with
<i>niggardliness, </i>Hence it appears, that it is taken to mean &#8212; a large
and bountiful liberality.</font><br></div>

estimated by God, not so much from the sum, as from the disposition. He was
desirous, it is true, to induce them to give largely, in order that the brethren
might be the more abundantly aided; but he had no wish to extort any thing from
them against their will. Hence he exhorts them to give willingly, whatever they
might be prepared to give. He places
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>purpose of

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>necessary,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and yet we do it willingly. We ourselves, accordingly, in that case impose a
necessity of our own accord, and because the flesh is reluctant, we often even
constrain ourselves to perform t duty that is necessary for us. But, when we are
constrained from the influence of others, having in the mean time an inclination
to avoid it, if by any means we could, we do nothing in that case with alacrity
&#8212; nothing with cheerfulness, but every thing with reluctance or constraint
of mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For God loveth a cheerful
giver</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He calls us back to God, as I
said in the outset, for alms are a sacrifice. Now no sacrifice is pleasing to
God, if it is not voluntary. For when he teaches us, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God loveth a cheerful
giver</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he intimates that, on the other
hand, the niggardly and reluctant are loathed by Him. For He does not wish to
lord it over us, in the manner of a tyrant, but, as He acts towards us as a
Father, so he requires from us the cheerful obedience of children.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And God is
able</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Again he provides against the base
thought, which our infidelity constantly suggests to us. &#8220;What! will you
not rather have a regard to your own interest? Do you not consider, that when
this is taken away, there will be so much the less left for yourself?&#8221;
With the view of driving away this, Paul arms us with a choice pro-raise &#8212;
that whatever we give away will turn out to our advantage. I have said already,
that we are by nature excessively niggardly &#8212; because we are prone to
distrust, which tempts every one to retain with eager grasp what belongs to him.
For correcting this fault, we must lay hold of this promise &#8212; that those
that do good to the poor do no less provide for their own interests than if they
were watering their lands. For by alms-givings, like so many canals, they make
the blessing of God flow forth towards themselves, so as to be enriched by it.
What Paul means is this: &#8220;Such<i> </i>liberality will deprive you of
nothing, but God will make it return to you in much greater abundance.&#8221;
For he speaks of the power of God, not as the Poets do, but after the manner of
Scripture, which ascribes to him a power put forth in action, the present
efficacy of which we ourselves feel &#8212; not any inactive power that we
merely imagine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That having all sufficiency in all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He mentions a twofold advantage
arising from that grace, which he had pro-raised to the Corinthians &#8212; that
they should have what is enough for themselves, and would have something over
and above for doing good. By the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sufficiency</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he points out the measure which the Lord knows to be useful for us, for it
is not always profitable for us, to be filled to satiety. The Lord therefore,
ministers to us according to the measure of our advantage, sometimes more,
sometimes less, but in such a way that we are satisfied &#8212; which is much
more, than if one had the whole world to luxuriate upon. In this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sufficiency</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>we must abound, for the purpose of doing good to others, for the reason why
God does us good is &#8212; not that every one may keep to himself what he has
received, but that there may be a mutual participation among us, according as
necessity may require.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.

Prophet mentions this, too, &#8212; that he will not be wanting in doing good,

forth of his liberality will be unceasing. Paul has an eye to this &#8212; that

For the person that sows seed in the proper season, appears when reaping to
gather the fruit of his labor and industry, and sowing appears as though it were
the fountainhead from which food flows forth to us. Paul opposes this idea, by
maintaining that the seed is afforded and the food is furnished by the favor of
God even to the husbandmen that sow, and who are looked upon as supporting
themselves and others by their efforts. There is a similar statement in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;050816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
8:16,18<i>. &#8212;</i></font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f542</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>In this way, there would be a confirmation of the foregoing statement, for
it is no rare thing with Paul to repeat the same promise in different words,
that it may be the better impressed upon men&#8217;s minds. In other manuscripts
these words occur in the infinitive mood, and it is well known that the
infinitive is sometimes used in place of the optative. I rather prefer this
reading, both because it is the more generally received one, and because Paul is
accustomed to follow up his exhortations with prayers, entreating from God what
he had previously comprised in his doctrine; though at the same time the former
reading would not be unsuitable.</font><br></div>

have something to lay up for relieving the necessities of others. For as we are
not born for ourselves merely, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f543</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

with those returns that the greater number lay up in cellars, barns, and

that these are the true riches of believers, when, relying upon the providence
of God for the sufficiency of their support, they are not by distrust kept back
from doing good. Nor is it without good reason, that he dignifies with the title
of affluence the satisfying abundance of a mind that is simple, and contented
with its moderate share; for nothing is more famished and starved than the
distrustful, who are tormented with an anxious desire of
having.</font><br></div>

another result, the alms which they were about to bestow &#8212; that they would
tend to promote the glory of God. He afterwards, too, expresses this more
distinctly, with amplification, in this way: &#8220;Besides<i> </i>the ordinary
advantage of love, they will also produce thanksgiving.&#8221; Now he amplifies
by saying, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thanks will be
given to God by many,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and that, not merely for
the liberality itself, by which they have been helped, but also for the entire
measure of piety among the Corinthians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>administration</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Palatino">term that sometimes denotes a sacrifice, sometimes
any office that is publicly assigned. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f547</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Either of them will suit this passage well. For on the one hand, it is no
unusual thing for alms to be termed sacrifices; and, on the other hand, as on
occasion of offices being distributed among citizens, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f548</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
no one grudges to undertake the duty that has been assigned him, so in the
Church, imparting to others ought to be looked upon as a necessary duty. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f549</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Corinthians, therefore, and others, by assisting the brethren at Jerusalem,
presented a sacrifice to God, or they discharged a service that was proper, and
one which they were bound to fulfill. Paul was the minister of that sacrifice,
but the term <i>ministry, </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>service</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

particular importance.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f550</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>

the test, &#8212; that they were so liberal to brethren that were at a great
distance from them. Paul, however, extends it farther &#8212; to their
concurrent obedience in the gospel. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f551</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For by such proofs we truly manifest, that we are obedient to the doctrine of

In the <i>first </i>place, he has made mention of the comfort that believers
would experience; <i>secondly, </i>the thanksgiving, by means of which God was
to be glorified. Nay more, he has said that this would be a confession, which
would manifest to all their unanimous concurrence in faith, and in pious
obedience. He now adds the reward that the Corinthians would receive from the
saints &#8212; good-will springing from gratitude,

himself

nothing from his authority, inasmuch as he was distinguished by spiritual

be more severe.&#8221; It is the duty of a good pastor to allure his sheep
peacefully and kindly, that they may allow themselves to be governed, rather
than to constrain them by violence. Severity, it is true, is, I acknowledge,
sometimes necessary, but we must always set out with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gentleness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

never be rigorous, unless we are constrained to it.&#8221; In the mean time, as
to their reckoning themselves pusillanimous and timid, when he had to come to

From this we see, <i>when </i>it is time to act with severity - after we have
found, on trial being made, that allurements and mildness have no good effect.
&#8220;I<i> </i>shall do it with reluctance,&#8221; says Paul, &#8220;but<i>

we must, in so far as is in our power, <i>draw </i>men rather than <i>drive
</i>them, so, when mildness has no effect, in dealing with those that are stern
and refractory, rigor must of necessity be resorted to: otherwise it will not be
moderation, nor equableness of temper, but criminal cowardice.

Paul declares that he is not one of this class, inasmuch as he is furnished with
other weapons than those of the flesh and the world. Now, what he affirms
respecting himself is applicable, also, to all true ministers of Christ.

the kind of weapons. He glories in being furnished with <i>spiritual

way of contraries, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f572</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that it is not </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the

gospel to a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>warfare,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he uses a most apt similitude. The life of a Christian, it is true, is a
perpetual warfare, for whoever gives himself to the service of God will have no
truce from Satan at any time, but will be harassed with incessant disquietude.
It becomes, however, ministers of the word and pastors to be standard-bearers,
going before the others; and, certainly, there are none that Satan harasses
more, that are more severely assaulted, or that sustain more numerous or more
dreadful onsets. That man, therefore, is mistaken, who girds himself for the
discharge of this office, and is not at the same time furnished with courage and
bravery for contending; for he is not exercised otherwise than in fighting. For
we must take this into account, that the gospel is like a fire, by which the
fury of Satan is en-kindled. Hence it cannot but be that he will arm himself for
a contest, whenever he sees that it is advanced.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But by what weapons is he to be repelled? It is only
by spiritual weapons that he can be repelled. Whoever, therefore, is unarmed
with the influence of the Holy Spirit, however he may boast that he is a
minister of Christ, will nevertheless, not prove himself to be such. At the same
time, if you would have a full enumeration of spiritual weapons, doctrine must
be conjoined with zeal, and a good conscience with the efficacy of the Spirit,
and with other necessary graces. Let now the Pope go, and assume to himself the
apostolic dignity 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f573</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
What could be more ridiculous, if our judgment is to be formed in accordance
with the rule here laid down by Paul!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mighty through

<i>from God. </i>I am of opinion, that there is here an implied antithesis, so
that this <i>strength </i>is placed in contrast with the <i>weakness </i>which
appears outwardly before the world, and thus, paying no regard to the judgments
of men, he would seek from God approbation of his fortitude. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f574</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
At the same time, the <i>antithesis </i>will hold good in another sense &#8212;
that the power of his arms depends upon God, not upon the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the demolishing of

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fortresses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to denote contrivances, and every high thing that is exalted against God, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f575</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as to which we shall find him speaking afterwards. It is, however, with
propriety and expressiveness that he so designates them; for his design is to
boast, that there is nothing in the world so strongly fortified as to be beyond
his power to overthrow. I am well aware how carnal men glory in their empty
shows, and how disdainfully and recklessly they despise me, as though there were
nothing in me but what is mean and base, while they, in the mean time, were
standing on a lofty eminence. But their confidence is foolish, for that armor of
the Lord, with which I fight, will prevail in opposition to all the bulwarks, in
reliance upon which they believe themselves to be invincible. Now, as the world
is accustomed to fortify itself in a twofold respect for waging war with Christ
&#8212; on the one hand, by cunning, by wicked artifices, by subtilty, and other
secret machinations; and, on the other hand, by cruelty and oppression, he
touches upon both these methods. For by <i>contrivances </i>he means, whatever
pertains to carnal wisdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>high
thing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>denotes any kind of glory and
power in this world. There is no reason, therefore, why a servant of Christ
should dread anything, however formidable, that may stand up in opposition to
his doctrine. Let him, in spite of it, persevere, and he will scatter to the
winds every machination of whatever sort. Nay more, the kingdom of Christ cannot
be set up or established, otherwise than by throwing down everything in the
world that is exalted. For nothing is more opposed to the spiritual wisdom of
God than the wisdom of the flesh; nothing is more at variance with the grace of
God than man&#8217;s natural ability, and so as to other things. Hence the only
foundation of Christ&#8217;s kingdom is the abasement of men. And to this effect
are those expressions in the Prophets:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The moon shall be

down, and the high looks of mortals shall be abased, and the Lord alone shall be

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And bring into

previously spoken more particularly of the conflict of spiritual armor, along
with the hinderances that rise up in opposition to the gospel of Christ, he now,
on the other hand, speaks of the ordinary preparation, by which men must be
brought into subjection to him. For so long as we rest in our own judgment, and
are wise in our own estimation, we are far from having made any approach to the
doctrine of Christ. Hence we must set out with this, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">he who is wise must
become a fool,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1

<div><font face="Palatino">that is, we must give up our own understanding, and
renounce the wisdom of the flesh, and thus we must present our minds to Christ
empty that he may fill them. Now the form of expression must be observed, when
he says, that he <i>brings every thought into captivity, </i>for it is as though
he had said, that the liberty of the human mind must be restrained and bridled,
that it may not be wise, apart from the doctrine of Christ; and farther, that
its audacity cannot be restrained by any other means, than by its being carried
away, as it were, <i>captive. </i>Now it is by the guidance of the Spirit, that
it is brought to allow itself to be placed under control, and remain in a
voluntary captivity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And are in readiness to
avenge.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This he adds, lest insolent men
should presumptuously lift themselves up in opposition to his ministry, as if
they could do so with impunity. Hence he says, that power had been given him
&#8212; not merely for constraining voluntary disciples to subjection to Christ,
but also for inflicting <i>vengeance </i>upon the rebellious, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f576</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and that his threats were not empty bugbears, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f577</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but had the execution quite in readiness &#8212; to use the customary
expression. Now this vengeance is founded on Christ&#8217;s word
&#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">whatsoever ye shall bind
on earth shall be bound also in heaven.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
18:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For although God does not thunder forth immediately

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f578</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">and will be accomplished in its own time. Let
it, however, be always understood, that it is when the minister fights with
spiritual armor. Some understand it as referring to bodily punishments, by means
of which the Apostles inflicted vengeance upon contumacious and impious persons;
as for example, Peter struck Ananias and Sapphira dead, and Paul struck Elymas
the sorcerer blind.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
5:1-10, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:6-11.) But the other meaning suits better, for the Apostles did not make use
of that power invariably or indiscriminately. Paul, however, speaks in general
terms that he has <i>vengeance </i>ready at hand against all the
disobedient.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When your obedience shall be
fulfilled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>How prudently he guards
against alienating any by excessive severity! For as he had threatened to
inflict punishment upon the rebellious, that he may not seem to provoke them, he
declares that another duty had been enjoined upon him with regard to them
&#8212; simply that of making them obedient to Christ. And, unquestionably, this
is the proper intention of the gospel, as he teaches both in the commencement
and in the close of the Epistle to the Romans.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:5, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451626&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
16:26.) Hence all Christian teachers ought carefully to observe this order, that
they should first endeavor with gentleness to bring their hearers to obedience,
so as to invite them kindly before proceeding to inflict punishment upon
rebellion. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f579</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence, too, Christ 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f580</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f582</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that deceives us. The sentence, too, may be read either interrogatively or
affirmatively: nay more, the verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ble&gt;pete
</font><font face="Palatino">may be taken either in the imperative mood, or in
the subjunctive. I am rather of opinion, however, that it is expressive of
chiding, and that the Corinthians are reaproved, because they suffered their
eyes to be dazzled with empty show. &#8220;You greatly esteem others who swell
out with mighty airs of importance, while you look down upon me, because I have
nothing of show and boasting.&#8221; For Christ himself contrasts the
<i>judgment that is according to appearance</i> with <i>righteous judgment</i>.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430724&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
7:24, and
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
8:15.) Hence he reproves the Corinthians, because, contenting themselves with
show, or appearance, they did not seriously consider, what kind of persons ought
to be looked upon as the servants of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any one trusteth in
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; an expression that is full of
great confidence, for he takes it, as it were, for granted, that he is so
certainly a minister of Christ, that this distinction cannot be taken from him.
&#8220;Whoever, says he, &#8220;is desirous to be looked upon as a minister of
Christ, must necessarily count me in along with himself.&#8221; For what reason?
&#8220;<i>Let him</i>,&#8221; says he. &#8220;<i>think for himself</i>, for
whatever things he may have in himself, that make him worthy of such an honor,
the same will he find in me.&#8221; By this he hinted to them, that whoever they
might be that reviled him, ought not to be looked upon as the servants of
Christ. It would not become all to speak thus confidently, for it might
certainly happen &#8212; nay, it happens every day, that they same claim is
haughtily advanced by persons, that are of no reputation, and are nothing else
than a dishonor to Christ. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f583</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Paul, however, affirmed nothing respecting himself but what he had openly given
proof of by clear and sure evidences among the Corinthians. Now should any one,
while destitute of all proof of the reality, recommend himself in a similar
manner, what would he do but expose himself to ridicule? To<i> trust in
one&#8217;s self</i> is equivalent to assuming to one&#8217;s self power and
authority on the pretext that he serves Christ, while he is desirous to be held
in estimation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For though I should boast more
largely of my authority</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was a sign of
modesty, that he put himself into the number of those, whom he greatly excelled.
At the same time, he was not disposed to show such modesty, as not to retain his
authority unimpaired. He accordingly adds, that he has said less than his
authority entitled him to say; for he was not one of the ordinary class of
ministers, but was even distinguished among the Apostles. Hence he says:
&#8220;Though I should boast more,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I should not be
ashamed</i></font><font face="Palatino">, for there will be good ground for
it.&#8221; He anticipates an objection, because he does not fail to speak of his
own glory, while at the same time he refrains from making farther mention of it,
that the Corinthians may understand, that, if he boasts, it is against his will,
as in truth the false Apostles constrained him to it; otherwise he would not
have done so.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the term <i>power</i> he means &#8212; the
authority of his Apostleship, which he had among the Corinthians for, through
all the ministers of the word have the same office in common, there are
nevertheless, degrees of honor. Now God had placed Paul on a higher eminence
than others, inasmuch as he had made use of his endeavors for founding 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f584</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that Church, and had in many ways put honor upon his Apostleship. Lest, however,
malevolent persons should stir up odium against him, on the ground of his making
use of the term <i>power</i>, he adds the purpose for which it was given him
&#8212; the salvation of the Corinthians. Hence it follows, that it ought not to
be irksome to them, or grievous, for who would not bear patiently, nay more, who
would not love what he knows to be of advantage to him? In the mean time, there
is an implied contrast between his power, and that in which the false apostles
gloried &#8212; which was of such a nature that the Corinthians received no
advantage from it, and experienced no edification. There can, however, be no
doubt, that all the ministers of the word are also, furnished with <i>power</i>;
for of what sort were a preaching of the word, that was without <i>power</i>?
Hence it is said to all &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">He that heareth you,
heareth me;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">he that rejecteth you,
rejecteth me.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
10:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As however, many, on false grounds, claim for
themselves what they have not, we must carefully observe, how far Paul extends
his <i>power</i> &#8212; so as to be to the edification of believers. Those,
then, who exercise <i>power</i> in the way of destroying the Church, prove
themselves to be tyrants, and robbers &#8212; not pastors. In the <i>second</i>
place, we must observe, that he declares, that it was given to him by God. He,
therefore, that is desirous to have any thing in his power to do, must have God
as the Author of his power. Others, it is true, will boast of this also, as the
Pope with full mouth thunders forth, that he is Christ&#8217;s vicar. But what
evidence does he give of this? 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f585</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For Christ has not conferred <i>power</i> of this kind upon dumb persons, but
upon the Apostles, and his other ministers, that the doctrine of his Gospel
might not be without defense. Hence the whole <i>power</i> of ministers is
included in the word &#8212; but in such a way, nevertheless, that Christ may
always remain Lord and Master. Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that in lawful
authority these two things are required &#8212; that it be given by God, and
that it be exercised for the welfare of the Church. It is well known, who they
are, on whom God has conferred this <i>power</i>, and in what way he has limited
the power he has given. Those exercise it in a proper manner, who faithfully
obey his commandment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, however, a question may be proposed. &#8220;God
says to Jeremiah, Behold, I set thee over the nations, and
kingdoms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">to plant, and to pluck
up, to build and to
destroy.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
1:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have, also, found it stated a little before,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;471005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 10:5) that the Apostles were set apart on the same footing &#8212;
that they might destroy every thing that exalted itself against Christ. Nay
more, the teachers of the gospel cannot build up in any other way, than by
destroying the old man. Besides, they preach the gospel to the condemnation and
destruction of the wicked.&#8221; I answer that, what Paul says here, has
nothing to do with the wicked, for he addresses the Corinthians, to whom he
wished his Apostleship to be beneficial. With regard to them, I say, he could do
nothing but with a view to edification. We have already observed, also, that
this was expressly stated, that the Corinthians might know, that the authority
of this holy man was not assailed by any one but Satan, the enemy of their
salvation, while the design of that authority was their
edification.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, it is in other respects true in a
general way, that the doctrine of the gospel has in its own nature a tendency to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>edification</i></font><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; not to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>destruction</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
For as to its destroying, that comes from something apart from itself &#8212;
from the fault of mankind, while they stumble at the stone that was appointed
form as a <i>foundation</i>
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:8.) As to the fact, that we are renewed after the image of God by the
destruction of the old man &#8212; that is not at all at variance with
Paul&#8217;s words, for in that case destruction is taken in a good sense, but
here in a bad sense, as meaning the ruin of what is God&#8217;s, or as meaning
the destruction of the soul &#8212; as if he had said, that his <i>power</i> was
not injurious to them, for instead of this the advantage of it for their
salvation was manifested.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I may not seem to
terrify</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Again he touches on the calumny which
he had formerly refuted,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;471002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 10:2,) that he was bold in his writings, while in their presence his
courage failed him. On this pretext they disparaged his writings. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f586</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;What!&#8221; Said they, &#8220;will he terrify us by letters when at a
distance, while, if present with us, he would scarcely venture to mutter a
word!&#8221; Lest, therefore, his letters should have less weight, he answers,
that no objection is advanced against him, that should either destroy or weaken
his credit, and that of his doctrine, for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deeds</i></font><font face="Palatino">
were not to be less valued than
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>words</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
He was not less powerful in actions when present, than he was by words when
absent. Hence it was unfair, that his bodily presence should be looked upon as
contemptible. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deed</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
here, he means, in my opinion, the efficacy and success of his preaching, as
well as the excellences that were worthy of an Apostle, and his whole manner of
life.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speech</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
on the other hand, denotes &#8212; not the very substance of doctrine, but
simply the form of it, and the bark, so to speak: for he would have contended
for doctrine with greater keeness. The contempt, however, proceeded from this
&#8212; that he was deficient in that ornament and splendor of eloquence, which
secures favor.

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we dare
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He says this by way of <i>irony,
</i>for afterwards he does not merely compare himself boldly with them, but,
deriding their vanity, he leaves them far behind him. Now by this <i>irony
</i>he gives a stroke, not merely to those foolish boasters, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f589</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but also to the Corinthians, who encouraged them in their folly by their
misdirected approbation. &#8220;I<i> </i>am satisfied,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;with<i> </i>my moderate way; for I would not dare to put myself on a
footing with your Apostles, who are the heralds of their own excellence. In the
mean time, when he intimates that their glory consists of mere speaking and
boasting, he shows, how silly and worthless they are, while he claims for
himself deeds instead of words, that is, true and solid ground of glorying. He
may seem, however, to err in the very thing for which he reproves others, for he
immediately afterwards commends himself. I answer, that his design must be taken
into view, for those do not aim at their own commendation, who, entirely free
from ambition, have no desire but to serve the Lord usefully. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f590</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As to this passage, however, there is no need of any other explanation than what
may be gathered from the words themselves, for those are said to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commend
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who, while in poverty and
starvation as to true praise, exalt themselves in vain-glorious boasting, and
falsely give out, that they are what they are not. This, also, appears from what
follows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But they measure themselves by
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he points out, as with
his finger their folly. The man that has but one eye sees well enough among the
blind: the man that is dull of hearing hears distinctly enough among the totally
deaf. Such were those that were satisfied with themselves, and showed themselves
off among others, simply because they did not look to any that were superior to
themselves, for if they had compared themselves with Paul, or any one like him,
they would have felt constrained to lay aside immediately that foolish
impression which they entertained, and would have exchanged boasting for
shame.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For an explanation of this passage we need look no
farther than to the monks; for as they are almost all of them the most ignorant
asses, and at the same time are looked upon as learned persons, on account of
their long robe and hood, if any one has merely a slight smattering of elegant
literature, he proudly spreads out his feathers like a peacock &#8212; a
marvelous fame goes abroad respecting him &#8212; among his companions he is
adored 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f591</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Were, however, the mask of the hood laid aside, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f592</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and a thorough examination entered upon, their vanity would at once be
discovered. Why so? The old proverb holds good: &#8220;Ignorance is pert.&#8221;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f593</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But the excessively insolent arrogance of the monks 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f594</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
proceeds chiefly from this &#8212; that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>measure themselves by
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for, as in their cloisters
there is nothing but barbarism, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f595</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it is not to be wondered, if the man that has but one eye is a king among the
blind. Such were Paul&#8217;s rivals, for inwardly they flattered themselves,
not considering what virtues entitled a person to true praise, and how far short
they came of the excellence of Paul, and those like him. And, certainly, this
single consideration might justly have covered them with shame, but it is the
just punishment of the ambitious, that by their silliness they expose themselves
to ridicule, (than which there is nothing that they are more desirous to
avoid,)and in place of glory, which they are immoderately desirous of, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f596</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they incur disgrace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But we will not boast beyond

moderation with the folly of the false Apostles, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f597</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and, at the same time, he shows what is the true measure of glorying &#8212;
when we keep within the limits that have been marked out for us by the Lord.
&#8220;Has the Lord given me such a thing? I shall be satisfied with this
measure. I shall not either desire or claim to myself any thing more.&#8221;

which he had previously entered upon. &#8220;I have,&#8221; says he, &#8220;a
most ample field for glorying, so as not to go beyond my own limits, and you are
one department of that field.&#8221; He modestly reproves, however, their
ingratitude,

in overlooking, in a manner, his apostleship, which ought to have been
especially in estimation among them, on the ground of God&#8217;s commendation
of it. In each clause, too, we must understand as implied, a contrast between
him and the false Apostles, who had no such approbation to
show.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.

when wishing to catch hold of what is not at their hand, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f601</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for of this nature is a greedy thirst for glory, nay more, it is often more
disgusting. For ambitious persons do not merely stretch out their arms and lift
up their feet, but are even carried headlong with the view of obtaining some
pretext for glorying. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f602</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He tacitly intimates that his rivals were of this stamp. He afterwards declares
on what ground he had come to the Corinthians-because he had founded their
church by his ministry. Hence he says,

and this meaning does not suit ill. At the same time, Paul seems to set off to
advantage his coming to the Corinthians, on the ground of his having been
furnished with so precious a gift.</font><br></div>

Apostles, who, while they had put forth their hand in the reaping of another
man&#8217;s harvest, had the audacity at the same time to revile those, who had
prepared a place for them at the expense of sweat and toil. Paul had built up
the Church of the Corinthians &#8212; not without the greatest struggle, and
innumerable difficulties. Those persons afterwards come forward, and find the
road made and the gate open. That they may appear persons of consequence, they
impudently claim for themselves what did not of right belong to them, and
disparage Paul&#8217;s labors.</font><br></div>

will be enlarged, he intimates, that the weakness of faith under which they

Corinthians 1:31,) and in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
9:24. For in those passages it means &#8212; to recognize God as the author of
all blessings, in such a way that every blessing is ascribed to his grace, while
men do not extol themselves, but glorify him alone. Here, however, it means
&#8212; to place our glory at the disposal of God alone,

and reckon every thing else as of no value. For while some are dependent on the
estimation of men, and weigh themselves in the false balance of public opinion,
and others are deceived by their own arrogance, Paul exhorts us to be emulous of
this glow &#8212; that we may please the Lord, by whose judgment we all stand or
fall.</font><br></div>

</i>Now that is so much, but it is not all; for, as almost all are blind through
excessive self-love, we cannot safely place confidence in the estimate that we
form of ourselves. For we must keep in mind what he says elsewhere, (1
Corinthians 4: 4,) that he is not conscious to himself of anything wrong, and
yet is <i>not thereby justified. </i>What then? Let us know, that to God alone
must be reserved the right of passing judgment upon us; for we are not competent
judges in our own cause. This meaning is confirmed by what follows &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for not he that commendeth
himself is approved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>&#8220;For it is
easy to impose upon men by a false impression, and this is matter of every day
occurrence. Let us, therefore, leaving off all other things, aim exclusively at
this &#8212; that we may be approved by God, and may be satisfied to have his
approbation alone, as it justly ought to be regarded by us as of more value than
all the applauses of the whole world. There was one that said, that to have
Plato&#8217;s favorable judgment was to him worth a thousand.

in his power to overturn all the decisions that men have

Immediately afterwards, however, as if gathering confidence, he nevertheless

constrained to it by necessity, and besides, he restrained himself in such a

an unseemly thing to herald one&#8217;s own praises, and a thing that is foreign

<div><font face="Palatino">What I have rendered in the imperative

of a man that is at ease, and not excited by any emotion, for that vehemence of
vehemence of jealousy, with which I am inflamed towards you, does not suffer me
to be at ease.&#8221; As, however, there are two kinds of jealousy &#8212; the
one springs from self love, and of a wicked and perverse nature, while the other
is cherished by us on God&#8217;s account, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f614</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he intimates of what sort his zeal is. For many are zealous &#8212; for
themselves, not for God. <i>That</i> on the other hand, is the only pious and
right zeal, that has an eye to God, that he may not be defrauded of the honors
that of right belong to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I have united you to one
man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That his zeal was of such a nature, he
proves from the design of his preaching, for its tendency was to join them to
Christ in marriage, and retain them in connection with him. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f615</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Here, however, he gives us in his own person a lively picture of a good
minister; for One alone is the Bridegroom of the Church &#8212; the Son of God.
All ministers are the <i>friends of the Bridegroom, </i>as the Baptist declares
respecting himself.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430329&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:29.) Hence all ought to be concerned, that the fidelity of this sacred
marriage remain unimpaired and inviolable. This they cannot do, unless they are
actuated by the dispositions of the Bridegroom, so that every one of them may be
as much concerned for the purity of the Church, as a husband is for the chastity
of his wife. Away then with coldness and indolence in this matter, for one that
is cold 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f616</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
will never be qualified for this office. Let them, however, in the mean time,
take care, not to pursue their own interest rather than that of Christ, that
they may not intrude themselves into his place, lest while they give themselves
out as his <i>paranymphs,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f617</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>

themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To present you as a chaste
virgin.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We are married to Christ, on no
other condition than that we bring virginity as our dowry, and preserve it
entire, so as to be free from all corruption. Hence it is the duty of ministers
of the gospel to purify our souls, that they may be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>chaste virgins to
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>otherwise they accomplish
nothing. Now we may understand it as meaning, that they individually present
themselves as</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> chaste virgins to
Christ,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or that the minister presents
the whole of the people, and brings them forward into Christ&#8217;s presence. I
approve rather of the second interpretation. Hence I have given a different
rendering from Erasmus. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f618</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I
fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He begins to explain, what is the
nature of that <i>virginity </i>of which he has made mention &#8212; our
cleaving to Christ alone, sincerely, with our whole heart. God, indeed,
everywhere requires from us, that we be joined with him in body and in spirit,
and he warns us that he is a <i>jealous God,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;022005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:5,) to avenge with the utmost severity the wrong done to him, in the event of
any one&#8217;s drawing back from him. This connection, however, is accomplished
in Christ, as Paul teaches in Ephesians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490525&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
5:25, 27.) He points out, however, at present the means of it &#8212; when we
remain in the pure simplicity of the gospel, for, as in contracting marriages
among men, there are written contracts 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f619</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
drawn out, so the spiritual connection between us and the Son of God is
confirmed by the gospel, as a kind of written contract. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f620</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Let us maintain the fidelity, love, and obedience, that have been there promised
by us; he will be faithful to us on his part.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now Paul says that he is concerned, that the minds of
the Corinthians may not be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>corrupted from the simplicity

says in Greek </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv

<i>towards Christ,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f621</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>but the Old Interpreter has come nearer, in my opinion, to Paul&#8217;s
intention, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f622</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because by the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>simplicity that is
in Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is meant, that which keeps us
in the unadulterated and pure doctrine of the gospel, and admits of no foreign
admixtures 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f623</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By this he intimates that men&#8217;s minds are <i>adulterated,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f624</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>whenever they turn aside, even in the least degree, to the one side or to
the other, from the pure doctrine of Christ. Nor is it without good reason, for
who would not condemn a matron as guilty of unchastity, so soon as she lends an
ear to a seducer? So in like manner we, when we admit wicked and false teachers,
who are Satan&#8217;s vile agents, show but too clearly, that we do not maintain
conjugal fidelity towards Christ. We must also take notice of the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>simplicity,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>for Paul&#8217;s fear was not, lest the Corinthians should all at once
openly draw back altogether from Christ, but lest, by turning aside, by little
and little, from the simplicity which they had learned, so as to go after
profane and foreign contrivances, they should at length become
adulterated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He brings forward a comparison
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>&oacute; as the serpent beguiled
Eve through his subtilty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For if false
teachers have a show of wisdom, if they have any power of eloquence for
persuading, if they plausibly insinuate themselves into the minds of their
hearers, and instill their poison by fawning artifices, it was in a similar way
that Satan also </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beguiled
Eve</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as he did not openly declare
himself to be an enemy, but crept in privily under a specious
pretext.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For if he that
cometh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now reproves the Corinthians
for the excessive readiness, which they showed to receive the false apostles.
For while they were towards Paul himself excessively morose and irritable, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f625</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so that on any, even the least occasion, they were offended if he gave them even
the slightest reproof, there was, on the other hand, nothing that they did not
bear with, on the part of the false Apostles. They willingly endured their
pride, haughtiness, and unreasonableness. An absurd reverence of this nature he
condemns, because in the mean time they showed no discrimination or judgment.
&#8220;How<i> </i>is it that they take 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f626</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so much liberty with you, and you submit patiently to their control? Had they
brought you another Christ, or another gospel, or another Spirit, different from
what you received through my hands, I would assuredly approve of your regard for
them, for they would be deserving of such honor. But as they have conferred upon
you nothing, that I had not given you previously, what sort of gratitude do you
show in all but adoring those, to whom you are indebted for nothing, while you
despise me, through whom God has bestowed upon you so many and so distinguished
benefits?&#8221; Such is the reverence that is shown even at this day by Papists
towards their pretended Bishops. For while they are oppressed by their
excessively harsh tyranny, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f627</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they submit to it without difficulty; but, at the same time, do not hesitate to
treat Christ himself with contempt.

<div><font face="Palatino">The expressions &#8212;<i> another Christ, </i>and

by removing the only thing that could serve as an excuse for them, for he shows
that he is on a level, even with the chief of the Apostles. The Corinthians,
therefore, were ungrateful

in not esteeming him more highly, after having found him, by experience, to be
such; while, on the other hand, the authority that was justly due to him, they
transferred to persons of no value. For the sake of modesty, however, he says
that he <i>reckons </i>so, while the thing was known and manifest to all. His
meaning, however, is, that God had honored his Apostleship with no less
distinguished marks of favor, than that of John or Peter. Now the man that
despises the gifts of God, which he himself recognizes, cannot clear himself
from the charge of being spiteful and ungrateful. Hence, wherever you see the
gifts of God, you must there reverence God himself: 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f630</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

by</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he means, the very substance
of doctrine. For as man has both a soul and a body, so also in doctrine, there
is the thing itself that is taught, and the ornament of expression with which it
is clothed. Paul, therefore, maintains that he understands, what should be
taught, and what is necessary to be known, though he is not an eloquent orator,
so as to know how to set off his doctrine by a polished and eloquent manner of
expression.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is asked, however, whether elegance of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speech</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f633</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is not also necessary for Apostles; for how will they otherwise be prepared
for teaching?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Knowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>might perhaps suffice for others, but how could a teacher be dumb? I answer,
that, while Paul acknowledges himself to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rude in
speech</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is not as though he were a
mere infant, but as meaning, that he was not distinguished by such splendid
eloquence as others, to whom he yields the palm as to this, retaining for
himself what was the principal thing &#8212; the reality itself., 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f634</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
while he leaves them talkativeness without gravity. If, however, any one should
inquire, why it is that the Lord, who <i>made men&#8217;s tongues,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;020411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
4:11,) did not also endow so eminent an apostle with eloquence, that nothing
might be wanting to him, I answer, that he was furnished with a <i>sufficiency
</i>for supplying the want of eloquence. For we see and feel, what majesty there
is in his writings, what elevation appears in them, what a weight of meaning is
couched under them, what power is discovered in them. In fine, they are
thunderbolts, not mere words. Does not the efficacy of the Spirit appear more
clearly in a naked rusticity of words, (so to speak,) than under the disguise of
elegance and ornament? Of this matter, however, we have treated more largely in
the former Epistle. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f635</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In short, he admits, as far as words are concerned, what his adversaries allege

by way of reproach, while it was an excellence that was deserving of no ordinary
commendation. <i>Humility </i>here means &#8212; voluntary abasement; for in
conducting himself modestly, as if he had nothing in him that was particularly
excellent, so that many looked upon him as one of the common people, he had done
that for the advantage of the Corinthians. For the man was inflamed with so
great a desire, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f640</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and so great an anxiety for their salvation, that he made a regard to himself a
secondary consideration. Hence he says, that he had of his own accord made a
surrender of his own greatness, that they might become great through his
abasement. For his design was, that he might promote their salvation. He now
indirectly charges them with ingratitude, in imputing to him as a fault so pious
a disposition &#8212; not indeed for the purpose of reproaching him, but with
the view of restoring them so much the better to a sound mind. And certainly, he
wounded them more severely by speaking <i>ironically, </i>than if he had spoken
in a simple way, and without a figure. He might have said&#8217; What is this?
Am I despised by you, because I have lowered myself for your advantage?&#8221;
The questioning, however, which he makes use of, was more forcible for putting
them to shame.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I preached
freely</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is a part of his abasement.
For he had given up his own right, as though his condition had been inferior to
that of others; but such was the unreasonableness of some of them, that they
esteemed him the less on that account, as if he had been undeserving of
remuneration. The reason, why he had given his services to the Corinthians
gratuitously, is immediately subjoined &#8212; for he did not act in this manner
everywhere, but, as we have seen in the former Epistle, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f641</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

opinion, made use of an offensive term, that he might the more forcibly express
the unreasonableness of the matter &#8212; in respect of his being despised by
the Corinthians. &#8220;I<i> </i>have,&#8221; says he, &#8220;procured<i>
</i>pay for myself from the <i>spoils </i>of others, that I might serve you.
While I have thus spared you, how unreasonable it is to make me so poor a
return!&#8221;<i> </i>It is, however, a metaphor, that is taken from what is
customary among soldiers; for as conquerors take <i>spoils </i>from the nations
that they have conquered, so every thing that Paul took from the Churches that
he had gained to Christ was, in a manner, the <i>spoils </i>of his victories,
though, at the same time, he never would have taken it from persons against
their will, but what they contributed gratuitously was, in a manner, due by
right of spiritual warfare. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f642</font></sup><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had been in

burden to them, had he not been constrained by necessity. He, nevertheless, in
the mean time, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>labored with his

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>labor of his

does not say, that his living had been furnished to him by the Macedonians, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f643</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but merely that they had supplied what was wanting. We have spoken elsewhere of
the Apostle&#8217;s holy prudence and diligence in providing against dangers.
Here we must take notice of the pious zeal of the Macedonians, who did not
hesitate to contribute of their substance for his pay, that the gospel might be
proclaimed to others, and those, too, that were wealthier than themselves. Ah!
how few

others in Achaia, though it were offered to him. For this manner of expression

anticipates that suspicion also. And by the figure termed <i>anthypophora,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f645</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>

mind? He does not return a direct answer to the question, but the indirect
answer that he returns has much more weight, inasmuch as he calls God to be a
witness of his good disposition towards them. You see here, that in the course
of three verses 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f646</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

design in view, and a legitimate reason is involved. Hence to condemn

intention. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f648</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The false Apostles, with the view of alluring to themselves ignorant persons,
took no pay. Their serving gratuitously was a show of uncommon zeal. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f649</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
If Paul had availed himself of his right, he would have given them occasion to
raise their crest, as if they had been greatly superior to him. Paul,
accordingly, that he might give them no occasion of doing injury, did himself,
also, preach the Gospel, free of charge, and this is what he adds &#8212; that
he is desirous to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cut off
occasion from those that desire occasion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>For the false Apostles were desirous to insinuate themselves by this
artifice, and to detract, in proportion to this, from Paul&#8217;s credit, if
they were superior to him in any respect. He says, that he will not give them
this advantage. &#8220;They will be found,&#8221; says he, &#8220;on a level
with us in that glorying which they would wish to have for themselves
exclusively.&#8221; This, however, is a useful admonition in connection with
cutting off occasion from the wicked, as often as they desire one. For this is
the only way to overcome them &#8212; not in the way of furnishing them with
arms through our imprudence.

away from them what they chiefly desired, yet, not contented with having put
himself on a level with them with respect to that in which they were desirous to
excel, he leaves them nothing for which they deserve any commendation. It was
apparently a laudable thing to despise money, but he says, that they make use of
a pretense for the purpose of deceiving, exactly as if a harlot were to borrow
the apparel of a decent matron. For it was necessary to pull off the mask, which
obscured the glory of God.</font><br></div>

Hence they require to be carefully and thoroughly sifted, lest we should receive
persons as servants of Christ, as soon as any appearance of excellence is
discovered. Nor does Paul in malice and envy put an unfavorable construction
upon what might be looked upon as an excellence, but, constrained by their
dishonesty, he unfolds to view the evil that lay hid, because there was a
dangerous profanation of virtue in pretending to burn with greater zeal than all
the servants of Christ.</font><br></div>

tempts us to evil, he does not profess to be what he really is. For he would
lose his object, if we were made aware of his being a mortal enemy, and opposer
of our salvation. Hence he always makes use of some cloak for the purpose of
insnaring us, and does not immediately <i>show his horns, </i>(as the common
expression is,) but rather makes it his endeavor to appear as
an</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

crimes, he makes use, nevertheless, of some pretext that he may draw us, when we
are off our guard, into his nets. What then, if he attacks us under the
appearance of good, nay, under the very title of God? His life-guards imitate,
as I have said, the same artifice. These are golden preambles &#8212;

abomination. It is a well known saying as to Babylon, that she gives poison to
drink in a golden cup.

<div><font face="Palatino">Should any one now ask, &#8220;Shall we then regard
all with suspicion?&#8221; I answer, that the Apostle did not by any means
intend this; for there are marks of discrimination, which it were the part of
stupidity, not of prudence, to overlook. He was simply desirous to arouse our
attention, that we may not straightway judge of the lion from the skin

For if we are not hasty in forming a judgment, the Lord will order it so that
the ears of the animal will be discovered ere long. Farther, he was desirous in
like manner to admonish us, in forming an estimate of Christ&#8217;s servants,
not to regard masks, but to seek after what is of more importance.

gloried &#8212; that he might clear his apostleship from contempt; for if the

intimates that it was a thing to which he was unaccustomed; for he says, <i>for
a little while. </i>For I take this clause as referring to time, so that the
meaning is, that Paul did not wish to continue it long, but assumed, as it were,
for the moment, the person of another, and immediately thereafter laid it aside,
as we are accustomed to pass over lightly those things that are foreign to our
object, while fools occupy themselves constantly

which this may be understood. He may be understood as reproving the Corinthians
in <i>irony, </i>because they could not endure any thing, as is usually the case
with effeminate persons; or he charges them with indolence, because they had
given themselves up to the false Apostles in a disgraceful bondage; or he
repeats, as it were, in the person of another, what was spitefully affirmed
respecting himself, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f662</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as if he claimed for himself a tyrannical authority over them. The <i>second
</i>meaning is approved by Chrysostom, Ambrose, and Augustine, and hence it is
commonly received; and, indeed, it corresponds best with the context, although
the <i>third </i>is not less in accordance with my views. For we see, how he was
calumniated from time to time by the malevolent, as if he domineered
tyrannically, while he was very far from doing so. As, however, the other
meaning is more generally received, I have no objection, that it should be held
as the true one.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this statement will correspond with the preceding
one in this way: &#8220;You<i> </i>bear with every thing from others, if they
oppress you, if they demand what belongs to you, if they treat you disdainfully.
Why then will you not bear with me, as they are in no respect superior to
me?&#8221;<i> </i>For as to his saying that he is not <i>weak, </i>he means that
he had been endowed by God with such excellent graces, that he ought not to be
looked upon as of the common order. For the word <i>weak </i>has a more
extensive signification, as we shall see again ere long.</font><br></div>

themselves under servile subjection to false apostles, impostors, or mere
worthless pretenders, give them liberty to do any thing whatever, and patiently
submit to and endure, whatever burden they may choose to impose upon them. Thus,
at the present day, you will scarcely find one in thirty, who will put his neck
willingly under Christ&#8217;s yoke, while all have endured with patience a

that time been deprived of jurisdiction, but as this was a kind of moderate
punishment (as they termed it) it is probable that it was allowed them. Now the
law of God was to this effect, that those who did not deserve capital punishment
should be beaten in the presence of a judge,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;052502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
25:2, 3,) provided not more than <i>forty stripes </i>were inflicted, lest the
body should be disfigured or mutilated by cruelty. Now it is probable, that in
process of time it became customary to step at the thirty-ninth lash, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f675</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
lest perhaps they should on any occasion, from undue warmth, exceed the number
prescribed by God. Many such precautions,

prescribed by the Rabbins, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f677</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
are to be found among the Jews, which make some restriction upon the permission
that the Lord had given. Hence, perhaps, in process of time, (as things
generally deteriorate,) they came to think, that all criminals should be beaten
with stripes to that number, though the Lord did not prescribe, how far severity
should go, but. where it was to stop; unless perhaps you prefer to receive what
is stated by others, that they exercised greater cruelty upon Paul. This is not
at all improbable, for if they had been accustomed ordinarily to practice this
severity upon all, he might have said that he was beaten according to custom.

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f687</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

&#8212; when, for the purpose of declaring the truth, we reverently call God as
our witness. Now this persecution was, as it were, Paul&#8217;s first
apprenticeship, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f689</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as appears from Luke,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440923&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
9:23-25); but if, while yet a raw recruit, he was exercised in such beginnings,
what shall we think of him, when a veteran soldier? As, however, flight gives no
evidence of a valiant spirit, it may be asked, why it is that he makes mention
of his flight? I answer, that the gates of the royal city having been closed,
clearly showed with what rage the wicked were inflamed against him; and it was
on no light grounds that they had been led to entertain such a feeling, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f690</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for if Paul had not fought for Christ with a new and unusual activity, the
wicked would never have been thrown into such a commotion. His singular
perseverance, however, shone forth chiefly in this &#8212; that, after escaping
from so severe a: persecution, he did not cease to stir up the whole world
against him, by prosecuting fearlessly the Lord&#8217;s work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be, however, that he proceeds to mock those
ambitious men, who, while they had never had experience of any thing but
applauses, favors, honorable salutations, and agreeable lodgings, wished to be
held in the highest esteem. For, in opposition to this, he relates, that he was
shut in, so that he could with difficulty save his life by a miserable and
ignominious flight.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some, however, ask, whether it was lawful for Paul to
leap over the walls, inasmuch as it was a capital crime to do so? I answer, in
the first place, that it is not certain, whether that punishment was sanctioned
by law in the East; and farther, that even if it was so, Paul, nevertheless, was
guilty&#8217; of no crime, because he did not do this as an enemy, or for sport,
but from necessity. For the law would not punish a man, that would throw himself
down from the walls to save his life from the flames; and what difference is
there between a fire, and a fierce attack from robbers? We must always, in
connection with laws, have an eye to reason and equity. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f691</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

middle of the course, he restrains himself from proceeding farther, and in this
way he most appropriately reproves the impudence of his rivals and declares that
it is with reluctance, that he engages in this sort of contest with them. For
what a shame it was to scrape together from every quarter commendations, or
rather to go a-begging for them, that they might be on a level with so
distinguished a man! As to the latter, he admonishes them by his own example,
that the more numerous and the more excellent the graces by which any one of us
is distinguished, so much the less ought he to think of his own excellence. For
such a thought is exceedingly dangerous, because, like one entering into a
labyrinth, the person is immediately dazzled, so as to be too quick-sighted in
discerning his gifts, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f694</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
while in the mean time he is ignorant of himself. Paul is afraid, lest this
should befall him. The graces conferred by God are, indeed, to be acknowledged,
that we may be aroused, &#8212; <i>first</i>, to gratitude for them, and
<i>secondly, </i>to the right improvement of them; but to take occasion from
them to boast &#8212;<i> that </i>is what cannot be done without great

own mind, but those persons

think that the clause </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in

was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the

means, that God dealt with him in such a way,

us incredible, inasmuch as he sometimes manifests himself to us in such a way,
that the manner of his doing so is, nevertheless, hid from our view.

At the same time, this does not, in any degree, detract from the assurance of
faith, which rests simply on this single point &#8212; that we are aware that
God speaks to us. Nay more, let us learn from this, that we must seek the
knowledge of those things only that are necessary to be known, and leave other
things to God.

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f701</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The Lord manifested himself to Paul in the beginning by a vision, when he
designed to convert him from Judaism to the faith of the gospel, but he was not
then admitted as yet into those secrets, as he needed even to be instructed by
Ananias in the first rudiments. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f702</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440912&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

rendering him teachable. It may be, that, in this instance, lie refers to that
vision, of which he makes mention also, according to Luke&#8217;s narrative.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;442217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
22:17.) There is no occasion, however, for our giving ourselves much trouble as
to these conjectures, as we see that Paul himself kept silence respecting it for
fourteen years, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f703</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and would not have said one word in reference to it, had not the
unreasonableness of malignant persons constrained him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even to the third

between the different heavens in the manner of the philosophers, so as to assign
to each planet its own heaven. On the other hand, the number <i>three </i>is
made use of (</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kat

what is highest and most complete. Nay more, the term <i>heaven, </i>taken by

the spheres, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f704</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and the firmament itself, and even the entire frame-work of the world. Paul,
however, not contenting himself with the simple term, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f705</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
adds, that he had reached even the greatest height, and the innermost

superior to others in knowledge get higher in degree and elevation, but to reach
the <i>third heavens </i>has been granted to very few.</font><br></div>

was to be buried in perpetual silence? I answer, that this took place for the
sake of Paul himself, for one who had such arduous difficulties awaiting him,
enough to break a thousand hearts, required to be strengthened by special means,
that he might not give way, but might persevere undaunted.

grounds; nor would I be justly accused of vanity, for I have ground to go upon,

different sense from what he had done previously, for even those that boast on
good grounds act a silly and disgusting part, if there appears any thing of
boasting or ambition. The folly, however, is more offensive and insufferable, if
any one boasts groundlessly, or, in other words, pretends to be what he is not;
for in that case there is impudence in addition to silliness. The Apostle here
proceeded upon it as a set, tied matter, that his glorying was as humble as it
was well founded. Erasmus has rendered it &#8212; &#8220;I spare you,&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest any one should think of

he is contented to occupy the station, which God has assigned him. &#8220;My<i>

any thing illustrious in me: I have no objection, therefore, to be lightly
esteemed.&#8221; Here we perceive what great modesty there was in this man,
inasmuch as he was not at all concerned on account of his meanness, which he
<i>discovered </i>in his appearance and speech, while he was replenished with
such a superiority of gifts. There would, however, be no. inconsistency in
explaining it in this way, that satisfied with the reality itself, he says
nothing respecting himself, that he may thus reprove indirectly the false
Apostles, who gloried in themselves as to many things, none of which were to be
seen. What I mentioned first, however, is what I rather approve
of.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And lest through the
superiority of revelations. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here we have a
<i>second </i>reason &#8212; that. God, designing to repress in him every
approach to insolence, subdued him with a rod. That rod he calls a <i>goad,
</i>by a metaphor taken from oxen. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is, in the Greek, in the dative 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f715</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence Erasmus has rendered it <i>&#8220;by </i>the flesh.&#8221; I prefer,
however, to understand him as meaning, that the prickings of this <i>goad
</i>were <i>in </i>his flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now it is asked, what this <i>goad </i>was. Those act
a ridiculous part, who think that Paul was tempted to lust. We must therefore
repudiate that fancy 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f716</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Some have supposed, that he was harassed with frequent pains in the head.
Chrysostom is rather inclined to think, that the reference is to Hymeneus and
Alexander, and the like, because, instigated by the devil, they occasioned Paul
very much annoyance. My opinion is, that under this term is comprehended every
kind of temptation, with which Paul was exercised. For <i>flesh </i>here, in my
opinion, denotes &#8212; not the body, but that part of the soul which has not
yet been regenerated. &#8220;There was given to me a <i>goad </i>that my flesh
might be spurred up by it, for I am not yet so spiritual, as not to be exposed
to temptations according to the flesh.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls it farther the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>messenger of
Satan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>on this ground, that as all
temptations are sent by Satan, so, whenever they assail us, they warn us that
Satan is at hand. Hence, at every apprehension of temptation, it becomes us to
arouse ourselves, and arm ourselves with promptitude for repelling Satan&#8217;s
assaults. It was most profitable for Paul to think of this, because this
consideration did not allow him to exult like a man that was off his guard. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f717</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For the man, who is as yet beset with dangers, and dreads the enemy, is not
prepared to celebrate a triumph. &#8220;The Lord, says he, has provided me with
an admirable remedy, against being unduly elated; for, while I am employed in
taking care that Satan may not take advantage of me, I am kept back from
pride.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, God did not cure him by this means
exclusively, but also by humbling him. For he
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> to buffet
me;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by which expression he elegantly
expresses this idea. &#8212; that he has been brought under control. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f718</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For to be <i>buffeted </i>is a severe kind of indignity. Accordingly, if any one
has had his face made black and blue, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f719</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he does not, from a feeling of shame, venture to expose himself openly in the
view of men. In like manner, whatever be the infirmity under which we labor, let
us bear in mind, that we are, as it were,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>buffeted by the
Lord,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>with the view of making us
ashamed, that we may learn humility. Let this be carefully reflected upon by
those, especially, who are otherwise distinguished by illustrious virtues, if
they have any mixture of defects, if they are persecuted by any with hatred, if
they are assailed by any revilings &#8212; that these things are not merely
<i>rods </i>of the Heavenly Master, but <i>buffetings, </i>to fill them with
shame, and beat down all forwardness. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f720</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now let all the pious <i>take </i>notice as to this, that they may see 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f721</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
how dangerous a thing the &#8220;poison of pride&#8221; is, as Augustine speaks
in his third sermon &#8220;On the words of the Apostle,&#8221; inasmuch as it
&#8220;cannot be cured except by poison.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f722</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">And unquestionably, as it was the cause of
man&#8217;s ruin, so it is the last vice with which we have to contend, for
other vices have a connection with evil deeds, but <i>this </i>is to be dreaded
in connection with the best actions; and farther, it naturally clings to us so
obstinately, and is so deeply rooted, that it is extremely difficult to
extirpate it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us carefully consider, who it is that here speaks
&#8212; He had overcome so many dangers, tortures, and other evils &#8212; had
triumphed over all the enemies of Christ &#8212; had driven away the fear of
death &#8212; had, in fine, renounced the world; and yet he had not altogether
subdued pride. Nay more, there awaited him a conflict so doubtful, that he could
not overcome without being <i>buffeted. </i>Instructed by his example, let us
wage war with other vices in such a way, as to lay out our main efforts for the
subduing of this one.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f723</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
from the beginning,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430844&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
8:44,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">was a physician to Paul, and that too, not merely in
the cure of the body, but &#8212; what is of greater importance &#8212; in the
cure of the soul? I answer, that Satan, in accordance with his disposition and
custom, had nothing else in view than to <i>kill and to destroy,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431010&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
10:10,) and that the <i>goad, </i>that Paul makes mention of, was dipt in deadly
poison; but that it was a special kindness from the Lord, to render medicinal
what was in its own nature deadly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this thing I besought the

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f724</font><font face="Palatino">
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">the number <i>three </i>is employed to denote
frequent repetition. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f725</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He means, however, to intimate, that this annoyance had been felt by him
distressing, inasmuch as he had so frequently prayed to be exempted from it. For
if it had been slight, or <i>easy </i>to be endured, he would not have been so
desirous to be freed from it; and yet he says that he had not obtained this:
hence it appears, how much need he had of being humbled. He confirms, therefore,
what he had said previously &#8212; that he had, by means of this bridle, been
held back from being haughty; for if relief from it had been for his advantage,
he would never have met with a refusal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may seem, however, to follow from this, that Paul
had not. by any means prayed in faith, if we would not make void all the
promises of God. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f726</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;We<i> </i>read everywhere in Scripture, that we shall obtain whatever we
ask in faith: Paul prays, and does not obtain.&#8221; I answer, that as there
are different ways of asking, so there are different ways of obtaining. We ask
in simple terms those things as to which we have an express promise &#8212; as,
for example, the perfecting of God&#8217;s kingdom, and the <i>hallowing of his
name,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
6:9,) the remission of our sins, and every<i> </i>thing that is advantageous to
us; but, when we think that the kingdom of God <i>can, </i>nay <i>must </i>be
advanced, in this particular manner, or in that, and that this thing, or that,
is necessary for the <i>hallowing of his name, </i>we are often mistaken in our
opinion. In like manner, we often fall into a serious mistake as to what tends
to promote our own welfare. <i>Hence </i>we ask those former things confidently,
and without any reservation, while it does not belong to us to prescribe the
means. If, however, we specify the means, there is always a condition implied,
though not expressed. Now Paul was not so ignorant as not to know this. Hence,
as to the <i>object </i>of his prayer, there can be no doubt that he was heard,
although he met with a refusal as to the express <i>form. </i>By this we are
admonished not to give way to despondency, as if our prayers had been lost
labor, when God does not gratify or comply with our wishes, but that we must be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>satisfied with his
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, in respect of our not
being forsaken by him. For the reason, why he sometimes mercifully refuses to
his own people, what, in his wrath, he grants to the wicked, is this &#8212;
that he foresees better what is expedient for us, than our understanding is able
to apprehend.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He said to
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not certain, whether he had
this answer by a special revelation, and it is not of great importance. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f727</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For God answers us, when he strengthens us inwardly by his Spirit, and sustains
us by his consolation, so that we do not give up hope and patience. He bids Paul
be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>satisfied with his
grace,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and, in the mean time, not refuse
chastisement. Hence we must bear up under evil of ever so long continuance,
because we are admirably well dealt with, when we have the grace of God to be
our support. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f728</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The term <i>grace, </i>here, does not mean here, as it does elsewhere, the favor
of God, but by <i>metonymy, </i>the aid of the Holy Spirit, which comes to us
from the unmerited favor of God; and it ought to be <i>sufficient </i>for the
pious, inasmuch as it is a sure and invincible support against their ever giving
way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For my
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Our weakness may seem, as if
it were an obstacle in the way of God&#8217;s perfecting his strength in us.
Paul does not merely deny this, but maintains, on the other hand, that it is
only when our weakness becomes apparent, that
God&#8217;s</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
strength</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is duly <i>perfected. </i>To
understand this more distinctly, we must distinguish between God&#8217;s
strength and ours; for the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is emphatic. &#8220;<i>My </i>strength,&#8221;<i> </i>says the Lord,
(meaning that which helps man&#8217;s need &#8212; which raises them up when
they have fallen down, and refreshes them when they are faint,) &#8220;is<i>
</i>perfected in the weakness of men;<i>&#8221; </i>that is, it has occasion to
exert itself, when the weakness of men becomes manifest; and not only so, but it
is more distinctly recognized as it ought to be. For the word <i>perfected
</i>has a reference to the perception and apprehension of mankind, because it is
not <i>perfected </i>unless it openly shines forth, so as to receive its due
praise. For mankind have no taste of it, unless they are first convinced of the
need of it, and they quickly lose sight of its value, if they are not constantly
exercised with a feeling of their own weakness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Most gladly,
therefore</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This latter statement
confirms the exposition that I have given. <i>I will glory, </i>says
he,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> in my infirmities, that the
power of Christ may dwell in me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f729</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Hence, the man that is ashamed of this glorying, shuts the door upon
Christ&#8217;s grace, and, in a manner, puts it away from him. For <i>then
</i>do we make room for Christ&#8217;s grace, when in true humility of mind, we
feel and confess our own weakness. The <i>valleys </i>are watered with rain to
make them fruitful, while in the mean time, the high summits of the lofty
mountains remain dry. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f730</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Let that man, therefore, become a <i>valley, </i>who is desirous to receive the
heavenly rain of God&#8217;s spiritual
grace.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f731</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He
adds</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> most gladly,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to<i> </i>show that he is influenced by such an
eager desire for the grace of Christ, that he refuses nothing for the sake of
obtaining it. For we see very many yielding, indeed, submission to God, as being
afraid of incurring sacrilege in coveting his glory, but, at the same time, not
without reluctance, or at least, less cheerfully than were becoming.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I take pleasure in
infirmities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There can be no doubt, that
he employs the term <i>weakness </i>in different senses; for he formerly applied
this name to the punctures that he experienced in the flesh. He now employs it
to denote those external qualities, which occasion contempt in the view of the
world. Having spoken, however, in a general way,
of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
infirmities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of every kind, he now
returns to that particular description of them, that had given occasion for his
turning aside into this general discourse. Let us take notice, then, that
<i>infirmity </i>is a general term, and that under it is comprehended the
weakness of our nature, as well as all tokens of abasement. Now the point in
question was Paul&#8217;s outward abasement. He proceeded farther, for the
purpose of showing, that the Lord humbled him in every way, that, in his
defects, the glory of God might shine forth the more resplendently, which is, in
a manner, concealed and buried, when a man is in an elevated position. He now
again returns to speak of his excellences, which, at the same time, made him
contemptible in public view, instead of procuring for him esteem and
commendation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For when I am
weak,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is &#8212; &#8220;The more
deficiency there is in me, so much the more liberally does the Lord, from his
strength, supply me with whatever he sees to be needful for me.&#8221;<i>
</i>For the fortitude of philosophers is nothing else than contumacy, or rather
a mad enthusiasm, such as fanatics are accustomed to have. &#8220;If<i> </i>a
man is desirous to be truly
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strong,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>let him not refuse to be at the same time
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>weak</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Let him,&#8221; I say, <i>&#8220;be weak </i>in himself that he may be
<i>strong in the Lord.&#8221;
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:10.) Should any one object, that Paul speaks here, not of a failure of
strength, but of poverty, and other afflictions, I answer, that all these things
are exercises for discovering to us our own weakness; for if God had not
exercised Paul with such trials, he would never have perceived so clearly his
weakness. Hence, he has in view not merely poverty, and hardships of every kind,
but also those effects that arise from them, as, for example, a feeling of our
own weakness, self-distrust, and humility.</font><br></div>

of the false Apostles. He subjoins one exception &#8212; that he

had conferred upon them &#8212; that he had served them gratuitously. To busy
themselves after this, as they did, in pouring contempt upon him, what was this
but to insult his modesty? Nay, what cruelty there was in it! Hence, it is not
without good reason, that he sharply reproves pride so frantic.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Forgive me this
wrong</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>says he. For they were doubly
ungrateful, inasmuch as they not only contemned the man, by whose acts of
kindness they had been brought under obligation, but even turned his kind
disposition into an occasion of reproach. Chrysostom is of opinion, that there
is no <i>irony </i>implied, and that, instead of this, there is an expression of
apology; but, if any one examines the entire context more narrowly, he will
easily perceive, that this gloss is quite foreign to Paul&#8217;s
intention.</font><br></div>

which he had received<i> </i>a very poor requital from the Corinthians. For he
says, that he refrained from taking their worldly substance for two reasons
<i>first<b>,</b> </i>because he sought <i>them, </i>not their wealth; and
<i>secondly, </i>because he was desirous to act the part of a father towards
them. From this it appears, what commendation was due to his modesty, which
occasioned him contempt among the Corinthians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I seek not
yours.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is the part of a genuine and
upright pastor, not to seek to derive gain from his sheep, but to endeavor to
promote their welfare; though, at the same time, it is to be observed, that men
are not to be sought with the view of having 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f748</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
every one his own particular followers. It is a bad thing, to be devoted to
gain, or to undertake the office of a pastor with the view of making a trade of
it; but for a person to <i>draw away disciples after him,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;442030&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
20:30,) for purposes of ambition, is greatly worse. Paul, however, means, that
he is not greedy of hire, but is concerned only for the welfare of souls. There
is, however, still more of elegance in what he says, for it is as though he had
said: &#8220;I<i> </i>am in quest of a larger hire than you think of. I am not
contented with your wealth, but I seek to have you wholly, that I may present a
sacrifice to the Lord of the fruits of my ministry.&#8221; But, what if one is
supported by his labors? Will he in that case seek the worldly substance of the
people. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f749</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Unquestionably, if he is a faithful Pastor, lie will always seek the welfare of
the sheep &#8212; nothing else. His pay will, it is true, be an additional
thing; but he ought to have no other aim, than what we have mentioned. Woe to
those, that have an eye to any thing else!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Parents for their
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Was he then no <i>father

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
4:15, 16.) Was there no one of the other Apostles that was a <i>father,
</i>inasmuch as the Churches ministered to their support? He did not by any
means intend this; for it is no new thing for even parents to be supported by
their children in their old age. Hence, those are not necessarily unworthy of
the honor due to <i>fathers, </i>who live at the expense of the Church; but Paul
simply wished to show from the common law of nature, that what he had done
proceeded from fatherly affection. This argument, therefore, ought not to be
turned in a contrary direction. For he did this as <i>a father; </i>but, though
he had acted otherwise, he would, notwithstanding, have been a <i>father
</i>still.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will most gladly
spend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This, certainly, was an evidence
of a more than fatherly affection &#8212; that he was prepared to lay out in
their behalf not merely his endeavors, and everything in his power to do, but
even life itself. Nay more, while he is regarded by them with coldness, he
continues, nevertheless, to cherish this affection. What heart, though even as
hard as iron, would such ardor of love not soften or break, especially in
connection with such constancy? Paul, however, does not here speak of himself,
merely that we may admire him, but that we may, also, imitate him. Let all
Pastors, therefore, learn from this, what they owe to their
Churches.</font><br></div>

concerned as to their own reputation. With the view, therefore, of repelling
those calumnies, he declares in the <i>first </i>place, that he speaks in the
presence of God, whom evil consciences always dread. In the <i>second </i>place,
he maintains, that he has not so much a <i>view </i>to himself, as to them. He

maintain my authority, and endeavoring to bring you back to obedience, I do
this, lest I should find occasion to punish your obstinacy more severely, if I
come, and find among you nothing of amendment.&#8221;<i> </i>He teaches,
accordingly, by his example, that mild remedies must always be resorted to by
Pastors, for the correction of faults, before they have recourse to extreme
severity; and, at the same time, that we must, by admonitions and reproofs,
prevent the necessity of having recourse to the utmost rigor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest, by any means, there be
contentions.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He enumerates the vices,

would have been the glory and honor of Paul&#8217;s Apostleship. When,
therefore, they were, instead of this, overrun with many vices, they heaped
disgrace upon him to the utmost of their power. He does not, indeed, charge them
all with this crime, but only a few, who had impudently despised all his
admonitions. The meaning, then, is this: &#8220;They<i> </i>think contemptuously
of me, because I appear contemptible. Let them, then, give me no occasion of
abasement: nay more, let them, on the contrary, laying aside their forwardness,
begin to feel shame; and let them, confounded at their iniquities, prostrate
themselves on the ground, instead of looking down upon others with
disdain.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the mean time, he lets us know the disposition of
a true and genuine Past, or, when he says that he will look upon the sins of
others with grief. And, undoubtedly, the right way of acting is this &#8212;
that every Christian shall have his Church inclosed within his heart, and be
affected with its maladies, as if they were his own, &#8212; sympathize with its
sorrows, and bewail its sins. We see, how Jeremiah entreats, that there may be
given him <i>a fountain of tears, </i>(Jeremiah 9: l,) that he may bewail the
calamity of his people. We see, how pious kings and prophets, to whom the
government of the people was committed, were touched with similar feelings. It
is, indeed, a thing that is common to all the pious, to be grieved in every case
in which God is offended, and to bewail the ruin of brethren, and present
themselves before God in their room as in a manner guilty, but it is more
particularly requisite on the part of Pastors.

farther the insolence of those of whom he had been speaking, some of whom living
in profligacy and licentiousness, and others, carrying on contentions and
strifes among them selves, cared nothing for his reproof. For his discourse did
not apply to the entire body of the Church, but to certain diseased and
half-rotten members of it. Hence he now, with greater freedom, uses sharpness,
because he has to do with particular individuals, not with the whole body of the
people, and besides this, it was with persons of such a stamp, that he
perceived, that he would do them no good by kindness, and mild remedies. After
having spent a year and a half among them,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

foretell you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The friendly and agreeable
admonitions, that he had addressed to them so frequently, had been of no
advantage. He, accordingly, betakes himself to a more severe remedy, with which
he had previously threatened them in words when present with them. When we see
him act with so much strictness, we need have no doubt, that they were
surprisingly ungovernable and obstinate; for it appears from his writings, what
mildness, and what unwearied patience he was otherwise prepared to manifest. As,
however, it is the part of a good parent to forgive and bear with many things,
so it is the part of a foolish parent, and one that has no proper regard for the
welfare of his children, to neglect to use severity, when there is occasion for
it, and to mingle strictness with mildness. We are well aware, that nothing is
more hurtful than excessive indulgence 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f762</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Let us, therefore, use mildness, when we can safely do so, and that too,
dignified and properly regulated: let us act with greater severity, when
necessity requires.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is asked, however, why it was, that the Apostle
allowed himself to expose the particular faults of individuals in so open a
manner, as in a manner to point his finger at the very persons? I answer, that
he would never have done so, if the sins had been hid, but as they were manifest
to all, and matter of notoriety, so as to furnish a pernicious example, it was
necessary that he should not spare the authors of a public scandal. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f763</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is asked, <i>secondly, </i>what kind of
chastisement he threatens to inflict upon them, as he could scarcely chastise
them more Severely in words. I have no doubt that he means, that he will inflict
punishment upon them by excommunication. For what is more to be dreaded, than
being cut off from the body of Christ, expelled from the kingdom of God, and
<i>delivered over to Satan for destruction,

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Since ye seek a
proof</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A twofold meaning may be drawn
from these words. The <i>first </i>is, &#8220;Since<i> </i>you wish to try me,
whether I speak of myself, or whether Christ speaks by me;<i>&#8221; </i>and in
this way Chrysostom, and Ambrose, explain it. I am rather inclined, however, to
understand him as declaring, that it does not so much concern himself as Christ,
when his authority is detracted from &#8212; that when his admonitions are
despised, Christ&#8217;s patience is tried. &#8220;It<i> </i>is Christ that
speaks by me; when therefore, you bring my doctrine under your lash, it is not
so much to me as to him that you do injury.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some one, however, will object thus: &#8220;What!
Will a man&#8217;s doctrine, then, be exempted from all investigation, so soon
as he makes it his boast, that he has Christ as his authority? And. what false
prophet will not make this his boast? What distinction, then, will there be
between truth and falsehood, and what will, in that case, become of that
injunction:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Try the spirits, whether
they are of God.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
John 4:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Every objection of this nature Paul anticipates, when
he says that Christ has wrought efficaciously in them by his ministry. For these
two clauses, <i>Christ speaking in me, </i>and, <i>who is mighty in you, not
weak, </i>must be read in connection, in this sense: &#8220;Christ,<i> </i>by
exercising his power towards you in my doctrine, has declared that he spoke by
my mouth, so that you have no excuse on the ground of
ignorance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see, that he does not merely boast in words, but
proves in reality that Christ speaks in him, and he convinces the Corinthians,
before requiring them to give him credit. Whoever, then, will speak in the
Church, whatever be the title that he claims for himself, it will be allowable
to inquire as to his doctrine, until Christ has manifested himself in him, and
thus it will not be of Christ that judgment will be formed, but of the man.
When, however, it is apparent, that it is the word of God that is advanced, what
Paul says holds good &#8212; that it is God himself who is not believed 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f764</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moses spake with the same confidence.

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">What are we &#8212; I and

<div><font face="Palatino">For there is no more room for shuffling, when it has
been made apparent, that it is a minister of God that speaks, and that he
discharges his office faithfully. I return to Paul. As the confirmation of his
ministry had been so decided among the Corinthians, inasmuch as the Lord had
shown himself openly, it is not to be wondered, if he takes it so much amiss,
that he meets with resistance. On good grounds, truly, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f765</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
might he throw back upon them, as he does, the reproach, that they were rebels
against Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.

intention, of Christ&#8217;s abasement, with the view of intimating indirectly, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f766</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that nothing was despised in him, but what they would have been prepared to
despise, also, in Christ himself, inasmuch as he</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">emptied himself, even to
the death of the
cross.</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;502308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Philippians

<div><font face="Palatino">He shows, however, at the same time, how absurd it is
to despise in Christ 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f767</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the abasement of the cross, inasmuch as it is conjoined with the incomparable
glory of his resurrection. &#8220;Shall<i> </i>Christ be esteemed by you the
less, because he showed signs of weakness in his death, as if his heavenly life,
that he leads subsequently to his resurrection, were not a clear token of his
Divine power? For as the term <i>flesh </i>here means Christ&#8217;s human
nature, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f768</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is taken here to denote his Divinity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, however, a question arises &#8212; whether
Christ labored under such infirmity as to be subjected to necessity against his
will; for, what we suffer </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through
weakness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we suffer from constraint, and
not from our own choice. As the Arians of old abused this pretext for
effectually opposing the divinity of Christ, the orthodox Fathers gave this
explanation of it &#8212; that it was effected by appointment, inasmuch as
Christ so desired, and not from his being constrained by any necessity. This
answer is true, provided it be properly understood. There are some, however,
that mistakenly extend the appointment to Christ&#8217;s human will &#8212; as
if this were not the condition of his nature, but a permission contrary to his
nature. For example: &#8220;His dying,&#8221; they say, &#8220;did not happen
because his humanity was, properly speaking, liable to death, but by
appointment, because he chose to die.&#8221; I grant, indeed, that he died,
because he chose to do so; but, whence came this choice, but from this &#8212;
that he had, of his own accord, clothed himself with a mortal nature 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f769</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
If, however, we make Christ&#8217;s human nature so unlike ours, the main
support of our faith is overturned. Let us, therefore, understand it in this way
&#8212; that Christ suffered by appointment, not by constraint, because,
<i>being in the form of God. </i>he could have exempted himself from this
necessity, but, nevertheless, he suffered <i>through weakness, </i>because he
<i>emptied himself
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;501706&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We are weak in
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To be <i>weak in Christ </i>means
here to be a partaker of Christ&#8217;s weakness. Thus he makes his own weakness
glorious, because in it he is conformed to Christ, and he no longer shrinks back
from the disgrace, that he has in common with the Son of God; but, in the mean
time, he says that he will <i>live towards them </i>after Christ&#8217;s
example. &#8220;I also,&#8221;<i> </i>says he, &#8220;will<i> </i>be a partaker
of Christ&#8217;s life, after I shall have been exempted from weakness.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f770</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
To <i>weakness </i>he opposes <i>life, </i>and, accordingly, he understands by
this term a condition that is flourishing, and full of honor. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f771</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The clause <i>towards you </i>may also be taken in connection with the <i>power
of God, </i>but it is of no importance, as the meaning always remains the same
&#8212; that the Corinthians, when they began to judge aright, would have
respectful and honorable views of the power of God, which was in Paul, and would
no longer despise outward infirmity.</font><br></div>

stated previously-that Christ&#8217;s power showed itself openly in his
ministry. For he makes them the judges of this matter, provided they descend, as
it were, into themselves, and acknowledge what they had received from him. In
the first place, as there is but one Christ, it must be of necessity, that the
same Christ must dwell alike in minister and people. Now, dwelling in the
people, how will lie deny himself in the minister. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f772</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Farther, he had shown his power in Paul&#8217;s preaching, in such a manner that
it could be no longer doubtful or obscure to the Corinthians, if they were not
altogether stupid. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f773</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For, whence had they faith? whence had they Christ? whence, in fine, had they
every thing? It, is with good reason, therefore, that they are called to look
into themselves,<i> </i>that they may discover there, what they despise as a
thing unknown. <i>Then </i>only has a minister a true and well grounded
assurance for the approbation of his doctrine, when he can appeal to the
consciences of those whom he has taught, that, if they have any thing of Christ,
and of sincere piety, they may be constrained to acknowledge his fidelity. We<i>
</i>are now in possession of Paul&#8217;s object.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage, however, is deserving of particular
observation on two accounts. For, in the <i>first </i>place, it shows the
relation, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f774</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which subsists between the faith of the people, and the preaching of the
minister &#8212; that the one is the mother, that produces and brings forth, and
the other is the daughter, that ought not to forget her origin 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f775</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In the <i>second </i>place, it serves to prove the assurance of faith, as to
which the Sorbonnic sophists have made us stagger, nay more, have altogether
rooted out from the minds of men. They charge with rashness all that are
persuaded that they are the members of Christ, and have Him remaining in them,
for they bid us be satisfied with a &#8220;moral conjecture,&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f776</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as they call it &#8212; that is, with a mere opinion 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f777</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so that our consciences remain constantly in suspense, and in a state of
perplexity. But what does Paul say here? He declares, that all are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reprobates</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>who doubt whether they profess Christ and are a part of His body. Let us,
therefore, reckon <i>that </i>alone to be right faith, which leads us to repose
in safety in the favor of God, with no wavering opinion, but with a firm and
steadfast assurance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unless by any means you are

their choice, whether they would rather be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reprobates</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>than give due testimony to his ministry; for he leaves them no alternative,
but either to show <i>respect </i>to his Apostleship, or to allow that they are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reprobates</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>For, unquestionably, their faith had been founded upon his doctrine, and
(,hey had no other Christ, than they had received from him, and no other gospel
than what they had embraced, as delivered to them by him, so that it were vain
for them to attempt to separate any part of their salvation from his

urgently, while indulging this confident persuasion &#8212; that he will not be
rejected by the Corinthians. One of two things was necessary &#8212; that they
should either assign to Paul the honor due to an Apostle, or condemn themselves
for unbelief, and acknowledge that they have no Church. He softens, however, the
severity of the statement, by making use of the expression &#8212; I <i>hope;

disappoint the hopes that have been entertained as to our integrity, is

having no regard to himself, should be devoted exclusively to the edification of

it matter to me? For unless I have in view to promote the truth, all the power
that I shall claim will be false and groundless. If, however, I lay out,
whatever I have, for the promotion of the truth, I, in that case, do not consult

condemnation, that. is contrary to its nature. The meaning, therefore, is this:
&#8220;Do not., through your own fault, allow <i>that </i>to turn to your

the source of that grace, and hence it is <i>first </i>in order. I answer, that
the arrangement of terms in the Scriptures is not always so very exact; but, at
the same time, this order, too, corresponds with the common form of doctrine,
which is contained in the Scriptures-that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">when we were enemies to
God,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">we were reconciled by the
death of his Son,

5:10,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">though the Scripture is wont to speak of this in two
ways. For it sometimes declares what I have quoted from Paul &#8212; that there
was enmity between us and God, before we were reconciled through Christ. On the
other hand, we hear what John says &#8212; that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">God so loved the world,
that he gave his only-begotten Son, etc.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
3:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The statements are apparently opposite; but it is
easy to reconcile them; because in the one case we look to God, and in the other
to ourselves. For God, viewed in himself, loved us before the creation of the
world, and redeemed us for no other reason than this &#8212; because he loved
us. As for us, on the other hand, as we see in ourselves nothing but occasion of
wrath, that is, sin, we cannot apprehend any love of God towards us without a
Mediator. Hence it is that, with respect to us, the beginning of love is from
the grace of Christ. According to the former view of the matter, Paul would have
expressed himself improperly, had he put the love of God before the grace of
Christ, or, in other words, the cause before the effect; but according to the
latter, it were a suitable arrangement to begin with the grace of Christ, which
was the procuring cause of God&#8217;s adopting us into the number of his sons,
and honoring us with his love, whom previously he regarded with hatred and
abhorrence on account of sin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fellowship of the Holy

all enemies whatever beneath his power. Now to say that &#8216; the last enemy
that shall be destroyed is death,&#8217; by no means affords a proof of this
position. Though death might be destroyed, and be the last enemy that shall be
destroyed, it would not thence appear but that other enemies might remain not
destroyed. But the proper rendering is, &#8216; Death, the last enemy, should be

&#8220;The mediatorial kingdom of Christ will end when its design is
accomplished; he will cease to exercise an authority which has no longer an
object. When all the elect are converted by the truth, and, being collected into
one body, are presented to the Father &#8216; a glorious Church, not having
spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing;&#8217; when idolatry, superstition, and
heresy are overthrown, and all evil is expelled from the kingdom of God; when
the plans and efforts of wicked spirits are defeated, and they are shut up in
their prison, from which there is no escape; when death has yielded up his
spoils, and laid his scepter at the feet of his Conqueror; when the grand assize
has been held, his impartial sentence has pronounced the doom of the human race,
and their everlasting abodes are allotted to the righteous and the ungodly,
nothing will remain to be done by the power with which our Savior was invested
at his ascension; and his work being finished, his commission will expire. On
this subject we cannot speak with certainty, and are in great danger of error,
because the event is future, and our information is imperfect. Here analogy
fails, and the utmost caution is necessary in borrowing an illustration from
human affairs; but without insinuating that the two cases are exactly similar,
may we not say, that as a regent or vicegerent of a King to whom the royal
authority has been intrusted for a time, resigns it at the close, and the
sovereign himself resumes the reins of government; so our Redeemer, who now
sways the scepter of the universe, will return his delegated power to him from
whom he received it, and a new order of things will commence under which the
dependence of men upon the Godhead will be immediate; and Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, one in essence, counsel, and operation, will reign for ever over the
inhabitants of heaven. This is the probable meaning of the words, <i>Then shall
the Son himself be subject unto him that put all things under him.&#8221;

Milner, in his Church History, (volume 2,) when treating of Gregory Nazianzen,
says, &#8220;In another discourse, he protests against the too common practice
of delaying baptism, which, from the example of Constantine, had grown very.
fashionable, for reasons equally corrupt and superstitious. Men lived in sin as
long as they thought they could safely, and deferred baptism till their near
approach to death, under a groundless hope of washing away all their guilt at

&#8220;Baptism,&#8221; says Dr. Dick, in his Lectures on Theology, (volume 4)
&#8220;imports our interest in the resurrection of Christ and its consequences.
It was called by the ancients &#8216; the earnest of good things to come,&#8217;
and &#8216;the type of the future resurrection.&#8217; May not this be the
meaning of that passage in the fifteenth chapter of the first Epistle to the
Corinthians, concerning which there has been such a diversity of opinion?
&#8216; Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead
rise not? why are they then baptized for the dead?&#8217;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461529&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

declaring their belief that they had not perished, but were alive in a better
world, and their hope that, through Jesus Christ, to whom they dedicated
themselves in baptism, they<sub> </sub>also should be raised again to enjoy the
same glorious recompense. According to this view of the passage, a resurrection
to life is one of the blessings signified and sealed by this institution. It
assures us of a triumph over death and the grave, through the redeeming blood of
Christ, with which we are sprinkled; and of admission into heaven, for which we

&#8220;The connection is not that in which we should have expected such a maxim
to be inserted. It is in the midst of a very affecting and instructive view of
the resurrection of the dead and the life everlasting; but the occasion of it
was this: the Corinthians had received, from the intrusion of false teachers,
principles which militated against that great doctrine. They had been taught to
explain it away, and to resolve it merely into a moral process which takes place
in the present world&#8217;; interpreting what is said of the resurrection of
the dead in a mystical and figurative manner. The apostle insinuates, that it
was by a mixture of the corrupt comnmnications of these men with the Christian
Church, and the intimate contact into which they had permitted themselves to
come with them, that they had been led off from the fundamental doctrine of the
gospel, and rejected a primary<sub> </sub>part of the apostolic testimony.
&#8216;For if there <i>be </i>no resurrection of the dead, then,&#8217; as he
observed, &#8216;is Christ not risen, and if Christ be not risen, then is our
preaching vain, and your faith is also vain; ye are yet in your sins.&#8217; We
see, that notwithstanding the apostle had planted pure Christianity among the
Corinthians, and had confirmed it by the most extraordinary miracles and
supernatural operations, yet such was the contagion of evil example and corrupt
communication, that the members of the Corinthian Church, in a very short time,
departed from the fundamental article of the truth as it is in Jesus Christ; and
hence we may learn the importance, nay, the necessity, of being on our guard in
this respect, and of avoiding such confidence in ourselves as might induce us to
neglect the caution here so forcibly expressed &#8212; &#8217; Be not deceived;
evil communications corrupt good manners.&#8217;&#8221; <i>&#8212; R.

ft893</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;Nearly allied to these are the
examples of peculiar transformations undergone by various insects, and the state
of rest and insensibility which precede those transformations; such as the
chrysalis or aurelia state of butterflies, moths, and silkworms. The myrmeleon
forniicaleo, of whose larva, and its extraordinary history, Reaumur and Roesel
have given accurate descriptions, continues in its insensible or chrysalis state
about four weeks. The libellula, or dragon-fly, continues still longer in its
state of inaction. Naturalists tell us that the worm repairs to the margin of
its pond, in quest of a convenient place of abode, during its insensible state.
It attaches itself to a plant, or piece of dry wood, and the skin, which
gradually becomes parched and brittle, at last splits opposite to the upper part
of the thorax: through this aperture the insect, now become winged, quickly
pushes its way, and being thus extricated front confinement, begins to expand
its wings, to flutter, and, finally, to launch into the air with that
gracefulness and ease which are peculiar to this majestic tribe. Now who that
saw, for the first time, the little pendant coffin in which the insect lay
entombed, and was ignorant of the transformation of which we are now speaking,
would ever predict that, in a few weeks, perhaps in a few days or hours, it
would become one of the most elegant and active of <i>winged </i>insects? And
who that contemplates, with the mind of a philosopher, this current
transformation, and knows that two years before the insect mounts into the air,
even while it is living in water, it has the rudiments of wings, can deny that
the body of a dead man may, at some future period, be again invested with vigor
and activity, and soar to regions for which some latent organization may have
peculiarly fitted <i>it?&#8221; &#8212; Olythus Gregory&#8217;s </i>Letters on

meant, that at all their religious meetings they should do so, is not
<i>improbable. </i>That he meant to make this an everlasting ordinance in all
Christian Churches, though it has sometimes been asserted, has never been
proved, and is by no means likely. That the practice prevailed extensively,
perhaps universally, in the earlier ages, is established on satisfactory
evidence. &#8216;After the prayers,&#8217; says Justin Martyr, who lived in the
earlier part of the second century, giving an account in his Apology of the
religious customs of the Christians &#8212; &#8217; after the prayers, we
embrace each other with a kiss.&#8217; Tertullian speaks of it as an ordinary
part of the religious services of the Lord&#8217;s day; and in the Apostolical
Constitutions, as they are <i>termed, </i>the manner in which it was performed
is particularly described. &#8216; Then let the men apart, and the women apart,

16:16, is: &#8216;From this passage the custom was delivered to the Churches,
that, after prayer, the brethren should salute one another with a kiss.&#8217;
This token of love was generally given at the Holy Supper. It was likely, from
the prevalence of this custom, that the calumny of Christians indulging in
licentiousness at their religious meetings originated; and it is not improbable
that, in order to remove everything like an occasion to calumniators, the
practice which, though in itself innocent, had become not for the use of
edifying, was <i>discontinued.&#8221; &#8212; Brown&#8217;s </i>Exposi-tory
Discourses on 1st Peter, volume in. pages 309, 310. &#8220;It is remarkable
that, by the testimony of Suetonius, an edict was published by one of the Roman
Emperors, for the abolition of this practice among his subjects, &#8212; perhaps
in order to check abuses, for the prevention of which our Apostle enjoins that
it shall be a <i>holy salutation.&#8221; &#8212; Chalmers </i>on the Romans,

</font></sup><font face="Palatino">By the <i>patine </i>or <i>paten, </i>is
meant the <i>plate </i>or <i>salver </i>on which the wafer or bread was placed
in the observance of the mass. The term is made use of by <i>.Dr. Stillingfleet
</i>in his &#8220;Preservative from Popery,&#8221; (title 7:chapter 5,) in
speaking of the practice of the Church of Rome in the adoration of the host:
&#8220;The priest in every mass, as soon as he has consecrated the bread and
wine, with bended knees, he adores the sacrament; that which he has consecrated,
that very thing which is before him, upon the <i>patine, </i>and in the chalice;
and gives the same worship and subjection, both of body and mind, to it as he
could to God or Christ himself.&#8221; In <i>Young&#8217;s </i>Lectures on
Popery, (Loud. 1836,) page 140, the following account is given of the sacrifice
of the mass: &#8220;Upon the altar is the chalice, or cup, which is to contain
the wine, mixed with a little water; and covering the cup is the <i>paten,
</i>or <i>plate, </i>intended to hold the cake or wafer. After an almost endless
variety of movements, and forms, and prayers, and readings, the priest goes to
the altar, and, taking the cup containing wine and water, with the wafer upon
the <i>cover, &#8212; these </i>having been before consecrated and
transubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ, &#8212; he raises his eyes
and says, &#8216;Take, O Holy Trinity, this oblation, which I, unworthy sinner,
offer in honor of thee, of the blessed Virgin Mary, and of all the saints, for
the salvation of the living, and for the rest and quiet of all the faithful that
are dead.&#8217; Then, setting down the chalice, he says, &#8216; Let this
sacrifice be acceptable to Almighty <i>God.&#8217;&#8220; </i>The name <i>paten
</i>is preserved in the English Liturgy to this day. In the prayer of
consecration, in the communion service &#8212; in connection with the words,

upright, lofty, verdant, and embowering. It grows by the brook or well of living

victory; <i>the more it is oppressed the more it flourishes, the higher it

the experimental works of God&#8217;s Spirit upon their own souls, they are not

&#8220;A <i>seal</i> was used for different purposes: to mark a person&#8217;s
property, to secure his treasures, or to authenticate a deed. In the

God; in the <i>second</i>, he guards them as his precious jewels; in the
<i>third</i>, he confirms or ratifies their title to salvation . . . An
<i>earnest</i> is a part given as a security for the future possession of the
whole. The Holy Ghost is the <i>earnest</i> of the heavenly inheritance, because
he begins that holiness in the soul which will be perfected in heaven, and
imparts those joys which are foretastes of its blessedness.&#8221;<i> &#8212;

The views here expressed by CALVIN are severely animadverted upon in the
following terms by the Romanists, in the Annotations appended to the Rheims
version of the New Testament: &#8220;CALVIN and his seditious sectaries with
other like which <i>despise dominion</i>, as St. Jude describeth such, would by
this place deliver themselves from all yoke of spiritual Magistrates and Rulers:
namely, that they be subject to no man touching their faith, or for the
examination and trial of their doctrine, but to God and his word only. And no
marvel that the malefactors and rebels of the Church would come to no tribunal
but God&#8217;s, that so they may remain unpunished at least during this life.
For though the Scriptures plainely condemne their heresies, yet they could
writhe themselves out by false glosses, constructions, corruptions, and denials
of the bookes to be canonical, if there were no lawes or judicial sentences of
men to rule and represse them.&#8221; To these statements Dr. Fulke in his
elaborate work in refutation of the errors of Popery, (Lond. 1601,) p. 559,
appropriately replies as follows: &#8220;This is nothing els but a lewd and
senselesse slander of CALVIN and vs, that we despise lordship, because we will
not be subject to the tyranny of Antichrist, that would be Lord of our faith,
and arrogateth vnto himselfe auctoritie to make new articles of fayth, which
have no ground or warrant in the word of God. But CALVIN did willingly
acknowledge all auctoritie of the ministers of the Church, which the Scripture
doth allow unto them, and both practiced, and submitted himselfe to the
discipline of the Church, and the lawful gouernours thereof, although he would
not yield unto the tyrannicall yoke of the Pope, who is neither soueraigne of
the Church, nor any true member of the same. Yea, CALVIN and we submit
ourselves, not only to the auctoritie of the Church, but also of the Ciuile
Magistrates to be punished, if we shall be found to teach or doe any thing
contrary to the doctrine of faith, receyued and approved by the Church, whereas
the Popish clergy, in causes of religion, will not be subject to the temporal
gouernors, judgement, and correction.&#8221;<i> &#8212; Ed.</i></font><br></div>

&#8220;A <i>triumph</i> among the Romans, to which the Apostle here alludes, was
a public and solemn honor conferred by them on a victorious general, by allowing
him a magnificent procession through the city. This was not granted by the
senate unless the general had gained <i>a very signal and decisive victory</i>;
conquered a <i>province</i>, etc... The people at Corinth were sufficiently
acquainted with the nature of a <i>triumph</i>: about two hundred years before

&#8220;Elsner and many other commentators think, with sufficient reason, that
there is here an allusion to the perfumes that were usually censed during the
triumphal processions of Roman conquerors. Plutarch, on an occasion of this
kind, describes the streets and temples as being
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">qumiamatwn
plhrei</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221; <i>&#8212; </i>&#8216;full of
incense,&#8217; which might not improperly be called an odour of death to the
vanquished, and of life to the conquerors. It is possible that in the following
verses the Apostle further alludes to the different effects of strong perfumes,
to cheer some, and to throw others into various disorders, according to the
different dispositions they may be in to receive them. There is, perhaps, not
equal foundation for another conjecture which has been offered, that the
expression, causeth us to triumph in Christ, contains an allusion to the custom
of victorious generals, who, in their triumphal processions, were wont to carry
some of their relations with them in their chariot.&#8221;<i> &#8212;

the word

more properly signifies) of Christ in them that are saved and in them that
perish. To the one we are the odour of death unto death; to the other, the odour
of life unto life.&#8217; And this lay with a mighty weight upon his spirit. O
that ever we should be the savor of death unto death to any! Who is sufficient
for these things! But whether of life or death, we are a sweet odour to God in
Christ, as to both; when he sees the sincerity of our hearts, and how fain we
would fetch souls out of the state of death into this life. So grateful and
pleasant to him is the work effected of saving souls, that the attempt and
desire of it is not ungrateful. &#8220;<i> &#8212; Howe&#8217;s Works</i>,

&#8220;<i>We are the savor of death unto death</i>. It is probable that the
language here used is borrowed from similar expressions which were common among
the Jews. Thus in Debarim Rabba, section. 1. fol. 248, it is said, &#8216;As the
bee brings some honey to the owner, but stings others; so it is with the words
of the law.&#8217; &#8216;They (the words of the law) are a <i>savor</i> <i>of
life</i> to Israel, but <i>savor of death</i> to the people of this
world.&#8217; Thus in Taarieth, fol. 7:1, &#8216;Whoever gives attention to the
law on account of the law itself, to him it becomes an <i>aromatic of life</i>,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yyj
&#181;s</font><font face="Palatino"> (<i>sam chiim</i>); but to him who does not

</i>the idea of which is, that as medicines skilfully applied will heal, but if
unskilfully applied will aggravate a disease, so it is with the words of the
law. Again, &#8216;The word of the law which proceeds out of the mouth of God is
an <i>odour</i> <i>of life</i> to the Israelites, but an odour of death to the

Charnock, in his &#8220;Discourse on the Efficient of Regeneration,&#8221; makes
an interesting allusion to CALVIN&#8217;S exposition of this verse.
&#8220;Thinking,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is the lowest step in the ladder of
preparation; &#8216;tis the first act of the creature in any rational
production; yet this the Apostle doth remove from man, as in every part of it
his own act,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:5)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Not that we are
sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves, but our sufficiency
is of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word signifies<i> &#8212; </i>reasoning: no
rational act can be done without reasoning; this is not purely our own. We have
no sufficiency of ourselves, <i>as of ourselves</i>, originally and radically of
ourselves, as if we were the author of that sufficiency, either naturally or
meritoriously. And CALVIN observes, that the word is not
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aujta&gt;rkeia</font><font face="Palatino">,
but
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">iJkano&gt;th</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;

in every part of it, it is from him, not from ourselves? For as <i>thinking</i>
is the first requisite, so it is perpetually requisite to the progress of any
rational act, so that every thought in any act, and the whole progress, wherein
there must be a whole flood of thoughts, is from the sufficiency of
God.&#8221;<i> &#8212; Charnock&#8217;s Works</i>, volume 2:p. 149.<i> &#8212;

profitable in some way, some for doctrine, some for reproof, some for
correction, and some for instruction in righteousness, but all is not to be

The word in this application is always rendered in our language

translators also have done. In the Geneva French, the word is rendered both ways
in the title, that the one may serve in explaining the other. &#8216;Le Nouveau

is unquestionable; but the title appropriated by custom to a particular book is
on the same footing with a proper name, which is hardly considered as a subject
for criticism. Thus we call Caesar&#8217;s Diary Caesar&#8217;s Commentaries,

CALVIN, when commenting on the passage referred to, remarks, that &#8220;the

from God, (as the Manicheans imagined,) but because, by God&#8217;s permission,
he exercises his tyranny over the world.&#8221;<i> &#8212; </i>CALVIN on John,

this he says in the lnstitutes, (volume 1,) that the &#8220;title,&#8221; God,
&#8220;is not conferred on any man without some addition, as when it is said
that Moses would be a god to Pharaoh.&#8221;

fearful choice have they made! Fallen into a league with those wicked creatures

CALVIN manifestly refers to an expression made use of by the Council of Nice,
A.D. 325, to express unity of essence in the first and second persons of the
Trinity, the Son having been declared to be
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oJmoou&gt;siv tw~|
Patri&lt;</font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; co &#8212; essential with the
Father</i>. &#8220;It had been used in the same sense by some writers before the
meeting of the Council. It is remarkable, however, that it had been rejected by
the Council of Antioch, A.D. 263, on account of the inference which Paul of
Samosata pretended to draw from it, namely, that if Christ and the Spirit were
consubstantial with the Father, it followed that there were three substances<i>
&#8212; </i>one prior and two posterior<i> &#8212; </i>derived from it. To guard
against this inference, the Council declared that the Son was not
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oJmoou&gt;siov tw~|
Patri&lt;</font><font face="Palatino"> (<i>consubstantial with the Father</i>.)
&#8220;Paul&#8221; (<i>of Samosata</i>) &#8220;seems to have explained the term
as signifying <i>specific</i>, or <i>of the same species</i>; and it is certain
that this sense had sometimes been given to it. Thus Aristotle calls the stars
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oJmoou&gt;sia</font><font face="Palatino">
meaning that they were all of the same nature. But in the creed of Nice it is
expressive of unity of essence, and was adopted, after considerable discussion,
as proper to be opposed to the Arians, who affirmed that the essence of the Son
was different and separate from the Father.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Dick&#8217;s
Theology</i>, volume 2. The reader will also find the same expression largely

and it is evidently employed to convey the idea of <i>putting to death</i>, the
main idea intended to be expressed being, as our author shows, that the apostles
were, for the sake of Christ, subjected to humiliating and painful sufferings,
which gave them, in a manner, an outward conformity to their Divine Master in
the <i>violent death</i> inflicted upon him. The term mortification, when taken
in strict accordance with its etymology, in the sense of putting to death,
appears to bring out more fully the apostle&#8217;s meaning, than the word
&#8220;dying,&#8221; made use of in our authorized version. Beza, who gives the
same rendering as CALVIN, subjoins the following valuable observations:<i>

Ambrosius maluit <i>mortem</i> interpretari, nempe quia in altero membro sit

that miserable condition of believers, and more especially of ministers, (for it

it is added<i> &#8212; of the Lord Jesus</i>, or (as the old interpreter renders
it) <i>of Jesus Christ</i>, partly with the view of explaining the reason why
the world thus persecutes them, and partly because in this respect also they are
conformed to Christ, the Head, and even Christ himself is, in them, in a manner
put to death. Ambrose has preferred to render it <i>death</i>, for this reason,
that in the other clause mention is made of the <i>life</i> of Christ. For my
own part, however, were I to depart from Paul&#8217;s words, I would rather
render it <i>slaughter</i>, inasmuch as Paul did not rashly make use of

&#8220;There were also at this time&#8221; (about the year 1540) &#8220;certain
persons who, having renounced the Protestant faith through dread of persecution,
flattered themselves, that there was no harm in remaining in the external
communion of the Church of Rome, provided they embraced the true religion in
their hearts. And because CALVIN who condemned so pernicious a sentiment was
considered by them as carrying his severity to an extreme, he showed clearly
that his opinion was in unison, not only with those of the fathers of the
Church, but also with the doctrine of the most learned theologians of the age,
such as Melancthon, Bucer, and Martyr, as well as the ministers of Zurich; and

Cicero, who argues at considerable length, and as it might seem most
convincingly, for the immortality of the soul, introduces one as complaining
that while, on reading the arguments in favor of this tenet, he thought himself
convinced, as soon as he laid aside the book and began to reason with himself,
his conviction was gone. &#8220;I know not,&#8221; says he, &#8220;how it
happens, that when I read, I assent, but when I have laid down the book, all
that assent vanishes.&#8221; Hence Seneca, (Ep. 102,)when speaking of the
reasonings of the ancient heathen philosophers on this important point, justly
observes, that &#8220;immortality, however desirable, was rather promised than
<i>proved</i> by those great men.&#8221;<i> &#8212; Ed.</i></font><br></div>

translated <i>substance</i>,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:1,) there has been a good deal of discussion, and it has been understood to
signify <i>confidence</i> or <i>subsistence</i>. Faith is the confidence of
things hoped for; because it assures us, not only that there are such things,
but that, through the power and faithfulness of God, we shall enjoy them. It is
the <i>subsistence</i> of things hoped for; because it gives them, although
future, a present <i>subsistence</i> in the minds of believers, so that they are
influenced by them as if they were actually present. Thus the word was
understood by some of the Greek commentators, who were the most competent judges
of its meaning. &#8216;Since things which we hope for,&#8217; says Chrysostom,
&#8216;seem not to subsist, faith gives them subsistence, or rather it does not
<i>give</i> it, but is itself their substance. Thus the resurrection of the dead
is not past, nor does it subsist, but faith gives it subsistence in our
souls.&#8217; &#8216;Faith,&#8217; says another, &#8216;gives subsistence to the
resurrection of the dead, and places it before our eyes... The objects of faith
are not only future good, but invisible things, both good and evil, which are
made known by divine revelation; and of these it is the evidence,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e]legcov</font><font face="Palatino">
the <i>demonstration</i> or <i>conviction</i>... Being past, and future, and
invisible on account of their distance from us, or the spirituality of their
nature, they cannot be discovered by our senses, but the conviction of their
reality is as strong in the mind of a believer, as if they were placed before
his eyes.&#8221;<i> &#8212; Dick&#8217;s Theology</i>, volume 3. <i>&#8212;

sort of people as dwell in bodies, a like sort of people to himself, and would
be no longer a home &#8212; dweller with them, but travel away from them, to
join and be a dweller with another people. For also, on the other hand, he

The views held by Servetus respecting the Supreme Being, and a Trinity of
persons in the Godhead, &#8220;were obscure and chimerical beyond all measure,
and amounted, in general, to the following propositions:<i> &#8212; </i>That the
Deity, before the creation of the world, had produced within himself two
personal representations, or manners of existence, which were to be the medium
of intercourse between him and mortals, and by whom, consequently, he was to
reveal his will, and to display his mercy and beneficence to the children of
men; .... and that these two representations were to cease after the destruction
of this terrestrial globe, and to be <i>absorbed into the substance of the
Deity</i>, from whence they had been formed.&#8221;<i> &#8212; Moshem&#8217;s

burst asunder the ties of kindred, it requires of all its followers that they be
guided by higher considerations in advancing its interests. This may throw light
on the bold expression which we find him elsewhere using, when he is speaking of
the obligations which believers are under, &#8216;not to live to themselves, but
unto him which died for them, and rose again.&#8217; &#8216;Henceforth know we

&#8220;<i>The grace of God</i>,&#8221; says Dr. Brown, when commenting on Peter
5:12, &#8220;properly signifies<i> &#8212; </i>the kindness, the free favor of
God, as a principle in the Divine mind; but is often employed to signify the
deeds of kindness, the gifts and benefits, in which the principle finds
expression. It has been common to interpret the phrase here as equivalent to the
gospel, the revelation of God&#8217;s grace; and the Apostle has been considered
as affirming that the doctrine which those he was writing to had embraced, and
to which they had adhered<i> &#8212; </i>to use the Apostle Paul&#8217;s phrase,
&#8216;which they had received, and in which they stood,&#8217; was the true
gospel. But I doubt if the gospel is ever called the grace of God in the New
Testament; and I equally doubt whether the words, thus understood, are an
accurate statement of what this Epistle actually contains. There are just two
other passages in the New Testament in which the grace of God has been supposed
to be a designation of the gospel. After stating the message of mercy, which the
ministers of reconciliation are called to deliver, the Apostle, in his Second
Epistle to the Corinthians, says &#8212; &#8217;We beseech you that ye receive
not <i>the grace</i>, or <i>this grace of God in vain</i>,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 6:1.) The reference here is, no doubt, to the gospel, but the
meaning of the phrase, <i>the grace of God</i>, is plainly just this divine
favor, this benefit which so expresses, and, as it were, embodies, the divine
grace. And in the Epistle to Titus, the same Apostle states, that &#8216;the
grace of God bringing salvation&#8217; has been manifested, or has
&#8216;appeared, teaching&#8217; those who apprehend it, &#8216;to deny
ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in
the present world.&#8217;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;560211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
2:11, 12.) The grace of God is often said to mean here the gospel, but the
gospel is the manifestation, the revelation of this grace; and the truth, taught
in the passage is, that the free, sovereign mercy of God, when it is apprehended
by the sinner, is the true principle of holiness in the heart and
life.&#8221;<i> &#8212; Brown&#8217;s</i> Expository Discourses on First Peter,

The term

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">anti</font><font face="Palatino">
over against, and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">largov</font><font face="Palatino">,
a stork. It is employed to denote <i>reciprocal affection</i>, from an
interesting peculiarity in the disposition of the <i>stork</i>. &#8220;This
bird,&#8221; says Paxton, in his Illustrations of Scripture, (Edin. 1842,)
volume 2:p. 432, &#8220;has long been celebrated for her amiable and pious
dispositions, in which she has no rival among the feathered race. . . Her kind
benevolent temper she discovers in feeding her parents in the time of
incubation, when they have not leisure to seek their food, or when they have
become old, and unable to provide for themselves.&#8221; The English word
<i>stork</i> is derived from
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">storgh&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">,
affection, while the Hebrew name for this animal,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hdysj</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>chasidah</i>,) is derived from
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">dsj</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>chesed</i>,) <i>beneficence</i>, because, says <i>Bythner</i>, &#8220;the
stork nourishes, supports, and carries on its back, when weary, its aged
parents.&#8221; See CALVIN on the Psalms, vol. 4. p. 158, n. 2. CALVIN, when

&#8220;<i>Joachim Camerarius</i>, in his Commentary on the New Testament,
(Cambridge 1642,) suggests, that
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejterozugou~ntev</font><font face="Palatino">,
may have a reference to a <i>balance</i>, and that Paul<i> &#8212; </i>would not

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">zugostatein</font><font face="Palatino">,
as he observes, is employed to denote the <i>adjusting of scales in balance</i>.
It seems more natural, however, to understand the word, as CALVIN and most other

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e{terov</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>Another</i>,) and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">zugo&lt;v</font><font face="Palatino">,

from </font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ly[wm
ylb</font><font face="Palatino"> <i>beli mohil</i>, (<i>worthless</i>,) and that
the term, viewed as having this derivation, is peculiarly appropriate to Satan,
as being diametrically opposed to Christ, the Greatest and Best; while Jerome
derives it from

Satan as an <i>apostate</i> spirit.<i> &#8212; </i>The original term

without were fightings; within were fears.&#8217; At last Titus arrives with

produced the intended effects; a spirit of repentance had fallen upon the

The expression here quoted from Polybius, (lib. 6: cap. 53, p. 691,) is made use
of by the historian in relating a heroic exploit of Publius Horatius Cocles,
who, on occasion of a sudden attempt being made upon the city of Rome by
Porsena, king of Clusium, the most powerful prince at that time in Italy, having
stationed himself, with singular intrepidity, on the Sublician bridge, along
with two others, withstood the attack of the enemy, and effectually obstructed
their progress, until the bridge was cut down from behind, after which he leaped
into the river, and swam across to his friends in safety, amidst the darts of
the enemy. In honor of this daring adventure, a statue of Cocles, as is stated
by Livy, (2:10,)was placed in the <i>Comitium, </i>and a grant of land was made
to him, as much as he could plow round in one day. <i>Raphelius </i>adduces

eternal life has been committed to the Apostles, so, on the other hand, they
have been armed with <i>vengeance</i> against all the ungodly, who reject the
salvation offered to them, as Paul teaches. (2 Cor. 10:6.) But this is placed in
last order, because it was proper that the true and real design of preaching the
gospel should be first exhibited. That we are reconciled to God belongs to the
nature of the gospel; that believers are adjudged to eternal life may be said to
be accidentally connected with it. For this reason, Paul, in the passage which I
lately quoted, when he threatens vengeance against unbelievers, immediately adds
&#8212; <i>after that your obedience shall have been fulfilled;</i> (2 Cor
10:6;) for he means, that it belongs peculiarly to the gospel to invite all to
salvation, but that it is accidental to it that it brings destruction to
any.&#8221; &#8212; CALVIN on John, vol. 2. p. 273. &#8212;

&#8220;<i>Once</i> was I stoned.&#8221; Paley remarks in his &#8220;Horae
Paulinae,&#8221; that this clause, &#8220;when confronted with the
history,&#8221; (contained in the Acts of the Apostles,) &#8220;furnishes the
nearest approach to a contradiction, without a contradiction being actually
incurred, of any that he remembers to have met with.&#8221; While the narrative
contained in the Acts of the Apostles gives an account of only one instance in
which Paul was actually stoned,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441419&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
14:19,) there was, previously to that, &#8220;an<i> </i>assault&#8221; made upon
Paul and Barnabas at Iconium, &#8220;both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews,
with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, but they were
ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441405&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

&#8220;been<i> </i>completed; had the history related that a stone was thrown,
as it relates that preparations were made both by Jews and Gentiles to stone
Paul and his companions; or even had the account of this transaction stopped,
without going on to inform us that Paul and his companions were <i>aware of
their danger and fled, a </i>contradiction between the history and the Apostle
would have ensued. Truth is necessarily consistent; but it is scarcely possible
that independent accounts, not having truth to guide them, should thus advance
to the very brink of contradiction without falling into <i>it.</i>&#8221;<i>

Episcopi, et Galliarum Apostoli, opera-Translatio Noua Ambrosii
Florentini,&#8221; etc.; &#8212; &#8220;The works of St. Dionysius the
Areopagite, the renowned Martyr, Bishop of Athens, and Apostle of the Gauls
&#8212; a New Translation by Ambrosius Florentine,&#8221; etc. &#8212; CALVIN,
in his Institutes, (volume 1,) when treating of angels, adverts to the writings
of Dionysius, in the following terms: &#8220;None can deny that Dionysius
(whoever he may have been) has many shrewd and subtle disquisitions in his
Celestial Hierarchy, but on looking at them more closely, every one must see
that they are merely idle talk. The duty of a theologian, however, is not to
tickle the ear, but confirm the conscience, by teaching what is true, certain,
and useful. When you read the work of Dionysius, you would think that the man
had come down from heaven, and was relating, not what he had learned, but what
he had actually seen. Paul, however, though he was carried to the third heaven,
so far from delivering any thing of the kind positively, declares, that it was
not lawful for man to speak the secrets which he had seen. Bidding adieu,
therefore, to that nugatory wisdom, let us endeavor to ascertain from the simple
doctrine of Scripture, what it is the Lord&#8217;s pleasure that we should know
concerning angels.&#8221; &#8212;<i> Beza, </i>in his Annotations on

&#8220;<i>Dionysius Areopaita. </i>This is that famous Denys that first
converted France, and wrote those notable and divine works &#8212; &#8217; De
Ecclesiastica et Caelesti Hierarchia, de diuinis nominibus,&#8217; and others;
in which he confirmeth, and proveth plainely, almost all things that the Church
now useth in the ministration of the Holy Sacrament, and affirmeth that he
learned them of the Apostles, giving also testimony for the Catholike faith in
most things now controuersed, so plainely that our adversaries have no shift but
to deny this Denys to have been the author of them, raining that they be
another&#8217;s of later age.&#8221; To these statements Dr. Fulke, in his
elaborate work in refutation of the errors of the Rhemish Translators, (p. 403,)
replies as follows: &#8220;That Dionysius Areopagita was author of those bookes
which now beare his name, you bring no proofe at all. We alleage that Eusebius,
Hierome, Gennadius, neuer heard of his writings, for if they had heard,
Dionysius Areopagita should have been registered by them among ecclesiasticall
writers.&#8221; &#8212; It is stated by <i>Mosheim </i>in his Ecclesiastical
History, (London 1825,) volume 2, <i>n. </i>(<i>u</i>)<i>, </i>that
&#8220;<i>the </i>spuriousness of these works is now universally granted by the
most learned and impartial of the Roman Catholic writers, as they contain
accounts of many events that happened several ages after the time of Dionysius,
and were not at all mentioned until after the fifth century.&#8221; <i>Turretine

</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Dr. Campbell, in his Translation of the
Gospels, makes use of the term <i>manslayer, </i>as CALVIN does here, and makes
the following observations in support of this rendering: &#8220;The common term
for <i>murderer </i>in the New Testament is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">foneu&lt;v</font><font face="Palatino">.
I have here made choice of a less usual name, not from any disposition to trace
etymologies, but because I think it is not without intention, that the devil, as
being not of earthly extraction, is rather called
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnqrwpokto&gt;nov
</font><font face="Palatino">than
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">foneu&lt;v,</font><font face="Palatino">
as marking, with greater precision, his ancient enmity to the human race. When
the name <i>murderer </i>is applied to a rational being of a species different
from ours, it naturally suggests, that the being so denominated is a destroyer
of others of his own species. As this is not meant here, the Evangelist&#8217;s
term is peculiarly apposite. At the same time, I am sensible, that our word
<i>manslaughter </i>means, in the language of the law, such killing as is,
indeed, criminal, though not so atrocious as murder. But, in common use, it is
not so limited. Heylyn says, to the same purpose &#8212; a <i>slayer of
men.</i>&#8221;<i> &#8212; Campbell </i>on the Gospels, (Edin. 1807,) volume 2.

friendly to the exercise of guile, that it is a manifest disavowal of it. It is
an <i>irony. </i>The Apostle does not describe what had actually been his
conduct, but that of which he stood accused by the Corinthian teachers. They
insinuated, that he was a sly, crafty man, going about preaching, persuading,
and catching people with guile. Paul acknowledges, that he and his colleagues
did, indeed, &#8216;persuade men,&#8217; and could not do otherwise, for &#8216;
the love of Christ constrained them.&#8217;

from mercenary motives. &#8216;We have wronged no man,&#8217; says he, &#8216;we

Mercenary men, who wish to draw people after them, have an <i>end </i>to answer:
and &#8216; what end, says Paul, could I have in view, in <i>persuading </i>you
to embrace the gospel? Have I gained any thing by you? When I was with you, was
I burdensome to you? No: nor, as things are, will I be burdensome. <i>Yet being

It might almost seem as if Baxter must have had this passage of CALVIN in his
eye, when penning his celebrated apology for animadverting so freely on the
faults of the ministers of religion in his times. &#8220;If it should be
objected, that I should not have spoken so plainly and sharply against the sins
of the ministry, or that I should not have published it to the view of the
world, or, at least, that I should have done it in another tongue, and not in
the ears of the vulgar. when the sin is open in the sight of the world, it is in
vain to attempt to hide it; and when the sin is public, the confession should
also be public. If the ministers of England had sinned only in Latin, I would
have made shift to have admonished them in Latin, or else should have said
nothing to them. But if they will sin in English, they must hear of it in
<i>English.</i>&#8221;<i> &#8212; Baxter&#8217;s </i>Reformed Pastor, (Glasgow,

The Rhemish Translators, when commenting on this <i>very </i>passage, take
occasion to oppose the idea of the attainableness of assurance of faith.
&#8220;The Heretiques,&#8221; say they, &#8220;argue hereupon, that every one
may know himself certainly to be in grace; where the Apostle speaketh expressly
and onely of faith, the act whereof a man may know and feele to be in himself,
because it is an act of understanding, though he cannot be assured that he hath
his sinnes remitted, and that he is in all pointes in a state of grace and
salvation; because euery man that is of the Catholike faith is not alwaies of
good life and agreeable thereunto, nor the acts of our will so subject to
understanding, that we can knowe certainely whether we be good or euill.&#8221;
Dr. Fulke, in his Refutation of the errors of the Rhemish Doctors, (Loud.
1601,)p. 584, after furnishing suitable replies to the arguments thus advanced,
concludes by remarking, that &#8220;our certeintie dependeth not upon our will
or workes, but upon the promise of God through faith, that Christ is in us, and
we in him, therefore we shall not misse of the performance of his
promises.&#8221; &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>
