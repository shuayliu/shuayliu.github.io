<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark 6:12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they departed, and
preached</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Matthew silently passes over
what the Apostles did. Mark and Luke relate that they proceeded to execute the
commission which they had received; and from their statements it appears more
clearly, that the office which Christ at that time bestowed upon them, as I have
formerly mentioned, was temporary, and indeed lasted but a few days. They tell
us that the Apostles went through the cities and villages: and they
unquestionably returned in a short time to their Master, as we shall find to be
stated in another passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The only matter that requires exposition here is the
fact related by Mark, that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>anointed with oil many diseased
persons</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Christ having conferred on them
the power of healing, it is asked, why did they apply <i>oil? </i>Some learned
persons suppose that it was a sort of medicine; and I acknowledge that in these
countries the use of <i>oil </i>was very common. But nothing is more
unreasonable than to imagine, that the Apostles employed ordinary and natural
remedies, which would have the effect of obscuring the miracles of Christ. They
were not instructed by our Lord in the art and science of healing, but, on the
contrary, were enjoined to perform miracles which would arouse all Judea. I
think, therefore, that this <i>anointing </i>was a visible token of spiritual
grace, by which the healing that was administered by them was declared to
proceed from the secret power of God; for under the Law <i>oil</i> was employed
to represent the grace of the Spirit. The absurdity of an attempt to imitate the
Apostles, by making the <i>anointing </i>of the sick a perpetual ordinance of
the Church, appears from the fact, that Christ bestowed on the Apostles the gift
of healing, not as an inheritance which they should hand down to posterity, but
as a temporary seal of the doctrine of the Gospel. In our own day,<i> </i>the
ignorance of the Papists is exceedingly ridiculous in maintaining that their
nasty <i>unction</i>, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by
which they hurry to the grave persons who are fast dying, is a
Sacrament.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 11:1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it happened that when
Jesus had made an end</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In this passage
Matthew means nothing more than that Christ did not desist from the exercise of
his office, while the Apostles were laboring in another direction. As soon,
therefore, as he sent them away, with the necessary instructions, to perambulate
Judea, he performed the duties of a teacher in Galilee. The word <i>commanding,
</i>which Matthew employs, is emphatic; for he means that they did not receive a
commission to do what they pleased, but were restricted and enjoined as to the
statements which they should make, and the manner in which they should conduct
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now when John had
heard.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Evangelists do not mean that
John was excited by the miracles to acknowledge Christ at that time as Mediator;
but, perceiving that Christ had acquired great reputation, and concluding that
this was a fit and seasonable time for putting to the test his own declaration
concerning him, he sent to him his disciples. The opinion entertained by some,
that he sent them partly on his own account, is exceedingly foolish; as if he
had not been fully convinced, or obtained distinct information, that Jesus is
the Christ. Equally absurd is the speculation of those who imagine that the
Baptist was near death, and therefore inquired what message he should carry,
from Christ&#8217;s mouth as it were, to the deceased fathers. It is very
evident that the holy herald of Christ, perceiving that he was not far from the
end of his journey, and that his disciples, though he had bestowed great pains
in instructing them, still remained in a state of hesitation, resorted to this
last expedient for curing their weakness. He had faithfully labored, as I have
said, that his disciples should embrace Christ without delay. His continued
entreaties had produced so little effect, that he had good reason for dreading
that, after his death, they would entirely fall away; and therefore he earnestly
attempted to arouse them from their sloth by sending them to Christ. Besides,
the pastors of the Church are here reminded of their duty. They ought not to
endeavor to bind and attach disciples to themselves, but to direct them to
Christ, who is the only Teacher. From the beginning, John had openly avowed that
he was not <i>the bridegroom,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:39.) As the faithful <i>friend of the bridegroom </i>he presents the bride
chaste and uncontaminated to Christ, who alone is the <i>bridegroom </i>of the
Church. Paul tells us that he kept the same object in view,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 11:2,) and the example of both is held out for imitation to all the
ministers of the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Art thou he who was to
come?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>John takes for granted what the
disciples had known from their childhood; for it was the first lesson of
religion, and common among all the Jews, that Christ <i>was to come,
</i>bringing salvation and perfect happiness. On this point, accordingly, he
does not raise a doubt, but only inquires if Jesus be that promised Redeemer;
for, having been persuaded of the redemption promised in the Law and the
Prophets, they were bound to receive it when exhibited in the person of Christ.
He adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do we look for
another?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this expression, he
indirectly glances at their sloth, which allowed them, after having been
distinctly informed, to remain so long in doubt and hesitation. At the same
time, he shows what is the nature and power of faith. Resting on the truth of
God, it does not gaze on all sides, does not vary, but is satisfied with Christ
alone, and will not be turned to another.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go and relate to
John</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As John had assumed for the time a
new character, so Christ enjoins them to carry to him that message, which more
properly ought to have been addressed to his disciples. He gives an indirect
reply, and for two reasons: first, because it was better that the thing should
speak for itself; and, secondly, because he thus afforded to his herald a larger
subject of instruction. Nor does he merely supply him with bare and rough
materials in the miracles, but adapts the miracles to his purpose by quotations
from the Prophets. He notices more particularly one passage from the 35th, and
another from the 61st, chapter of Isaiah, for the purpose of informing
John&#8217;s disciples, that what the Prophets declared respecting the reign of
Christ was accomplished and fulfilled. The former passage contains a description
of Christ&#8217;s reign, under which God promises that he will be so kind and
gracious as to grant relief and assistance for every kind of disease. He speaks,
no doubt, of spiritual deliverance from all diseases and remedies; but under
outward symbols, as has been already mentioned, Christ shows that he came as a
spiritual physician to cure souls. The disciples would consequently go away
without any hesitation, having obtained a reply which was clear and free from
all ambiguity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The latter passage resembles the former in this
respect. It shows that the treasures of the grace of God would be exhibited to
the world in Christ, and declares that Christ is expressly set apart for the
poor and afflicted. This passage is purposely quoted by Christ, partly to teach
all his followers the first lesson of humility, and partly to remove the offense
which the flesh and sense might be apt to raise against his despicable flock. We
are by nature proud, and scarcely anything is much valued by us, if it is not
attended by a great degree of outward show. But the Church of Christ is composed
of poor men, and nothing could be farther removed from dazzling or imposing
ornament. Hence many are led to despise the Gospel, because it is not embraced
by many persons of eminent station and exalted rank. How perverse and unjust
that opinion is, Christ shows from the very nature of the Gospel, since it was
designed only for the poor and despised. Hence it follows, that it is no new
occurrence, or one that ought to disturb our minds, if the Gospel is despised by
all the great, who, puffed up with their wealth, have no room to spare for the
grace of God. Nay, if it is rejected by the greater part of men, there is no
reason to wonder; for there is scarcely one person in a hundred who does not
swell with wicked confidence. As Christ here guards his Gospel against contempt,
he likewise reminds us who they are that are qualified to appreciate the grace
of salvation which it offers to them; and in this manner, kindly inviting
wretched sinners to the hope of salvation, raises them to full
confidence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The poor receive the message
of the Gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By <i>the poor </i>are
undoubtedly meant those whose condition is wretched and despicable, and who are
held in no estimation. However mean any person may be, his poverty is so far
from being a ground of despair, that it ought rather to animate him with courage
to seek Christ. But let us remember that none are accounted <i>poor </i>but
those who are really such, or, in other words, who lie low and overwhelmed by a
conviction of their poverty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And blessed is he who shall
not be offended in me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. By </i>this
concluding statement Christ intended to remind them, that he who would adhere
firmly and steadfastly to the faith of the Gospel must encounter <i>offenses,
</i>which will tend to interrupt the progress of faith. This is said by way of
anticipation, to fortify us against offenses; for we shall never want reasons
for rejecting it, until our minds are raised above every offense. The first
lesson, therefore, to be learned is, that we must contend with <i>offenses,
</i>if we would continue in the faith of Christ; for Christ himself is justly
denominated a</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">rock of offense and stone
of stumbling, by which many
fall,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Peter 2:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This happens, no doubt, through our own fault, but
that very fault is remedied, when he pronounces those to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blessed who shall not be offended
in him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>from which too we infer, that
unbelievers have no excuse, though they plead the existence of innumerable
offenses. For what hinders them from coming to Christ? Or what drives them to
revolt from Christ? It is because he appears with his cross, disfigured and
despised, and exposed to the reproaches of the world; because he calls us to
share in his afflictions; because his glory and majesty, being spiritual, are
despised by the world; and in a word, because his doctrine is totally at
variance with our senses. Again, it is because, through the stratagems of Satan,
many disturbances arise, with the view of slandering and rendering hateful the
name of Christ and the Gospel; and because every one, as if on purpose, rears up
a mass of<i> offenses, </i>being instigated by not less malignity than zeal to
withdraw from Christ.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 11:7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And while they were
departing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Christ praises John before
the people, in order that they may state from recollection what they have heard
from him, and may give credit to his testimony. For his name was widely
celebrated, and men spoke of him in lofty terms: but his doctrine was held in
less estimation, and there were even few that waited on his ministrations.
Christ reminds them, that those who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went out to see him in the
wilderness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>lost their pains, if they did
not devoutly apply their minds and faculties to his doctrine. The meaning of the
words, <i>you went out into the wilderness, </i>is this: <i>&#8220;Your
</i>journey would have been an act of foolish and ridiculous levity, if you had
not a fixed object in view. But it was neither worldly splendor nor any sort of
amusement  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that you
were in quest of: your design was, to hear the voice of God from the mouth of
the Prophet. If therefore you would reap advantage from your undertaking, it is
necessary that what he spoke should remain fixed in your

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Clothed with soft
garments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Those who think that Christ
here condemns the extravagance of a court are mistaken. There are many other
passages in which luxury of dress, and excessive attention to outward
appearance, are censured. But this passage simply means, that there was nothing
in the wilderness to attract the people from every quarter; that every thing
there was rude and unpolished, and fitted only to inspire disgust; and that such
elegance of dress as delights the eyes is rather to be looked for in the courts
of kings.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f13</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Verily I say to
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>These words not only maintain the
authority of John, but elevate his doctrine above the ancient prophets, that the
people may keep in view the right end of his ministry; for they mistook the
design of his mission, and, in consequence of this, derived almost no advantage
from his discourses. Accordingly, Christ extols and places him above the rank of
the prophets, and gives the people to understand that he had received a special
and more excellent commission. When he elsewhere says respecting himself that he
was <i>not a Prophet,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:21,) this is not inconsistent with the designation here bestowed upon him by
Christ. He was, no doubt, a Prophet, like others whom God had appointed in his
Church to be expounders of the Law, and messengers of his will; but he was
<i>more excellent </i>than the Prophets in this respect, that he did not, like
them, make known redemption at a distance and obscurely under shadows, but
proclaimed that the time of redemption was now manifest and at hand. Such too is
the import of Malachi&#8217;s prediction,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
3:1,) which is immediately added, that the pre-eminence of John consisted in his
being the herald and forerunner of Christ; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for
although the ancient Prophets spoke of his kingdom, they were not, like John,
placed <i>before his face, </i>to point him out as present. As to the other
parts of the passage, the reader may consult what has been said on the first
chapter of Luke&#8217;s Gospel.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f15</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There hath not
arisen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Our Lord proceeds farther, and
declares that the ministers of the Gospel will be as far superior to John as
John was superior to the Prophets. Those who think that Christ draws a
comparison between himself and John have fallen into a strange blunder; for
nothing is said here about personal rank, but commendation is bestowed on the
pre-eminence of office. This appears more clearly from the words employed by
Luke, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there is not a greater
Prophet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for they expressly restrict his
eminence to the office of teaching. In a word, this magnificent eulogium is
bestowed on John, that the Jews may observe more attentively the commission
which he bore. Again, the teachers who were afterwards to follow are placed
above him, to show the surpassing majesty of the Gospel above the Law, and above
that preaching which came between them. Now, as Christ intended to prepare the
Jews for receiving the Gospel, we ought also, in the present day, to be aroused
to listen with reverence to Christ speaking to us from the lofty throne of his
heavenly glory; lest he take revenge for our contempt of him by that fearful
curse which he pronounces on unbelievers by Malachi in the same
passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The kingdom of heaven and the
kingdom of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>denote the new condition
of the Church, as in other passages which have already occurred; for it was
promised that at the coming of Christ all things would be restored.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that is least in the
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mikro&gt;terov</font><font face="Palatino">,
which I have rendered <i>least, </i>is in the comparative degree, and signifies
<i>less; </i>but the meaning is more clearly brought out, that all the ministers
of the Gospel are included. Many of them undoubtedly have received a small
portion of faith, and are therefore greatly inferior to John; but this does not
prevent their preaching from being superior to his, because it holds out Christ
as having rendered complete and eternal satisfaction by his one sacrifice, as
the conqueror of death and the Lord of life, and because it withdraws the vail,
and elevates believers to the heavenly sanctuary.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Since the days of
John</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have no doubt that Christ speaks
honorably of the majesty of the Gospel on this ground, that many sought after it
with warm affection; for as God had raised up John to be the herald of the
kingdom of his Son, so the Spirit infused such efficacy into his doctrine, that
it entered deeply into the hearts of men and kindled that zeal. It appears,
therefore, that the Gospel, which comes forward in a manner so sudden and
extraordinary, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
awakens powerful emotions, must have proceeded from God. But in the second
clause is added this restriction, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the violent take it by
force</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The greater part of men were no
more excited than if the Prophets had never uttered a word about Christ, or if
John had never appeared as his witness; and therefore Christ reminds them, that
the <i>violence, </i>of which he had spoken, existed only in men of a particular
class. The meaning therefore is, A vast assembly of men is now collected, as if
men were rushing <i>violently </i>forward to seize <i>the kingdom of God;
</i>for, aroused by the voice of one man, they come together in crowds, and
receive, not only with eagerness, but with vehement impetuosity, the grace which
is offered to them. Although very many are asleep, and are no more affected than
if John in the wilderness were acting a play which had no reference to them, yet
many flock to him with ardent zeal. The tendency of our Lord&#8217;s statement
is to show, that those who pass by in a contemptuous manner, and as it were with
closed eyes, the power of God, which manifestly appears both in the teacher and
in the hearers, are inexcusable. Let us also learn from these words, what is the
true nature and operation of faith. It leads men not only to give, cold and
indifferent assent when God speaks, but to cherish warm affection towards Him,
and to rush forward as it were with a violent struggle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 16:16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Law and the Prophets were

earnestness of the people was a prelude to those things which <i>the Prophets
</i>had foretold as to the future renovation of the Church. He now compares the
ministry of John to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Law and
the Prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>&#8220;It<i> </i>is not
wonderful,&#8221; he tells us, &#8220;that God should now act so powerfully on
the minds of men; for he is not as formerly, seen at a distance under dark
shadows, but appears openly and at hand for the establishment of his
kingdom.&#8221; Hence it follows, that those who obstinately reject
<i>John&#8217;s </i>doctrine are less excusable than those who despised

the eyes of men, but represented him under figures and shadows as absent. The
comparison, we now perceive, is intended to show, that it is highly criminal in
men to remain indifferent, when they have obtained a manifestation of the
presence of God, who held his ancient people in suspense by predictions. Christ
does not class <i>John </i>with the ministers of the Gospel, though he formerly
assigned to him an intermediate station between them and <i>the Prophets.
</i>But there is no inconsistency here: for although John&#8217;s preaching was
a part of the Gospel, it was little more than a first lesson.</font><br></div>

have their ears closed. But now, as every man is hindered not only by his own
unbelief, but by the mutual influence which men exercise on each other, Christ
here exhorts the elect of God, whose ears have been pierced, to consider
attentively this remarkable secret of God, and not to remain deaf with
unbelievers.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 7:29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all the people
hearing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This part is left out by
Matthew, though it throws no small light on the connection of the words; for it
was this circumstance which gave rise to Christ&#8217;s expostulation, when he
perceived that the scribes persisted so obstinately in despising God. The
substance of this passage is, that the common <i>people </i>and the <i>publicans
</i>gave glory to God; while <i>the Scribes, </i>flattering themselves with
confidence in their own knowledge, cared little for what Christ said. At first
sight, this tends only to obscure, and even to disfigure, the glory of the
Gospel, that Christ could not gather disciples to himself, except from the dregs
and offscourings of the people; while he was rejected by those who had any
reputation for holiness or learning. But the Lord intended, from the beginning,
to hold out this example, that neither the men of that age, nor even posterity,
might judge of the Gospel by the approbation of men; for we are all by nature
inclined to this vice. And yet nothing is more unreasonable than to submit the
truth of God to the judgment of <i>men, </i>whose acuteness and sagacity amounts
to nothing more than mere vanity. Accordingly, as Paul says, <i>&#8220;God
</i>hath chosen that part which is weak and foolish in the eyes of the world,
that he may cast down from its height whatever appears to be mighty and
wise,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460127&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:27.) Our duty is to prefer this <i>foolishness of God, </i>to use
Paul&#8217;s expression,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:25,) to all the display of human wisdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Justified
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is a very remarkable
expression. Those who respectfully embrace the Son of God, and assent to the
doctrine which he has brought, are said to ascribe righteousness to God. We need
not therefore wonder, if the Holy Spirit everywhere honors faith with remarkable
commendations, assigns to it the highest rank in the worship of God, and
declares that it is a very acceptable service. For what duty can be deemed more
sacred than to vindicate God&#8217;s righteousness? The word <i>justify
</i>applies generally, no doubt, to every thing connected with the praises of
God, and conveys the idea, that God is beheld with approbation, and crowned with
glory, by the people who embrace that doctrine of which He is the author. Now,
since faith <i>justifies </i>God, it is impossible, on the other hand, but that
unbelief must be blasphemy against him, and a disdainful withholding of that
praise which is due to his name. This expression also teaches us, that men are
never brought into complete subjection to the faith until, disregarding the
flesh and sense, they conclude that every thing which comes from God is just and
holy, and do not permit themselves to murmur against his word or his
works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having been baptized with the
baptism of John.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke means that the
fruits of <i>the baptism </i>which they had received were then beginning to
appear; for it was a useful preparation to them for receiving the doctrine of
Christ. It was already an evidence of their piety that they presented themselves
to be <i>baptized. </i>Our Lord now leads them forward from that slender
instruction to a higher degree of progress, as the scribes, in despising the
baptism of John, shut against themselves, through their pride, the gate of
faith. If, therefore, we desire to rise to full perfection, let us first guard
against despising the very least of God&#8217;s invitations, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and be
prepared in humility to commence with small and elementary instructions.
Secondly, let us endeavor that, if our faith shall have a feeble beginning, it
may regularly and gradually increase.</font><br></div>

mentioned by way of respect, as contrasted with the wicked pride of the scribes;
for the term <i>counsel </i>carries along with it a dignity, which protects the
doctrine of God against the contempt of men. Literally, Luke says, that they
<i>despised </i>AGAINST THEMSELVES: and indeed I do not disapprove of the
meaning which is preferred by some, that the scribes were rebellious to their
own destruction. But as Luke&#8217;s narrative is simple, and as the preposition

have chosen rather to translate it,

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To what shall I
compare?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He does not include all the men
of his age, but speaks particularly of the scribes and their followers. He
charges them with this reproach, that while the Lord endeavored, by various
methods, to draw them to himself, they repelled his grace with incorrigible
obstinacy. He employs a comparison, which was probably taken from a common
amusement of children; for there is probability in the conjecture, that the
children divided themselves into two bands, and sang in that manner. And,
indeed, I think that, in order to abase the pride of the scribes, Christ
intentionally borrowed from children the materials of his reproof: thus
declaring that, however distinguished they were, nothing more was necessary to
condemn them than a song which children were wont to sing in the market-place
for their amusement.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>33.

thundered out repentance and severe reproofs, and sung, as it were, a plaintive
song; while the Lord endeavored, by a cheerful and sprightly song, to draw them
more gently to the Father. Neither of those methods had any success, and what
reason could be assigned except their hardened obstinacy? This passage also
shows us, why so wide a difference existed, as to outward life, between Christ
and the Baptist, though both had the same object in view. Our Lord intended, by
this diversity, and by assuming as it were a variety of characters, to convict
unbelievers more fully; since, while he yielded and accommodated himself to
their manners, he did not bend them to himself. But if the men of that age are
deprived of every excuse for repelling, with inveterate malice, a twofold
invitation which God had given them, we too are held guilty in their persons;
for God leaves not untried any sort of pleasing melody, or of plaintive and
harsh music, to draw us to himself, and yet we remain hard as stones. They
called John a <i>demoniac, </i>just as persons of unsound mind, or whose brain
is disturbed, are usually called <i>madmen.</i></font><br></div>

live in the customary way; as Christ says that John
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came neither eating nor
drinking</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because he confined himself to
a peculiar diet, and even abstained from ordinary food. This is more fully
expressed by the words of Luke,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>neither eating bread nor drinking

perfection consists in outward austerity of life, and who pronounce it to be an
angelical life when a person is abstemious,

mortifies himself by fasting, ought to attend to this passage. On this principle
John would rank higher than the Son of God; but, on the contrary, we ought to
maintain, that</font><br></div>

loose rein to the flesh, by indulging in luxuries and effeminacy: only we must
beware of superstition, lest foolish men, imagining that perfection lies in
matters of a purely elementary nature, neglect the spiritual worship of God.
Besides, while Christ accommodated himself to the usages of ordinary life, he
maintained a sobriety truly divine, and did not encourage the excesses of others
by his dissimulation or by his example.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>35.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Wisdom is
justified</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This passage is variously
explained by commentators. Some maintain that <i>Wisdom </i>was <i>acquitted
</i>by the Jews, because, conscious of guilt, and judges of their own unbelief,
they were compelled to acknowledge, that the doctrine which they rejected was
good and holy. By <i>the children of Wisdom </i>they understand the Jews who
boasted of that title. Others think that it was spoken in irony: &#8220;It is in
this manner that you approve of the <i>Wisdom </i>of God, of which you boast
that you are the <i>children?</i>&#8221;<i> </i>But as the Greek preposition
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpo&gt;</font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> does not
properly relate to an agent, some explain it, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wisdom is acquitted by her
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and is no longer under
obligation to them, in the same manner as when an inheritance is transferred to
another. Thus Paul says, that Christ <i>was justified
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dedikai&gt;wtai</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
from sin,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:7,) because the curse of sin had no longer any power over
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some interpret it more harshly, and with greater
excess of freedom, to mean that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wisdom is estranged from her
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But granting that this were
the import of the Greek preposition, I look upon the other meaning as more
appropriate, that <i>Wisdom, </i>however wickedly she may be slandered by her
own sons, loses nothing of her worth or rank, but remains unimpaired. The Jews,
and particularly the scribes, gave themselves out as <i>children </i>of the
<i>Wisdom </i>of God; and yet, when they trod their mother under their feet,
they not only flattered themselves amidst such heinous sacrilege, but desired
that Christ should fall by their decision. Christ maintains, on the contrary,
that, however wicked and depraved her <i>children </i>may be, <i>Wisdom
</i>remains entire, and that the malice of those who wickedly and malignantly
slander her takes nothing from her authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have not yet brought forward that meaning which
appears to my own mind the most appropriate and natural. First, the words of
Christ contain an implied contrast between true <i>children </i>and bastards,
who hold but an empty title without the reality; and they amount to this:
<i>&#8220;Let </i>those who haughtily boast of being the <i>children </i>of
<i>Wisdom </i>proceed in their obstinacy: she will, notwithstanding, retain the
praise and support of her own <i>children. </i>Accordingly, Luke adds a term of
universality, by <i>all her children; </i>which means, that the reluctance of
the scribes will not prevent all the elect of God from remaining steadfast in
the faith of the Gospel. With respect to the Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpo&gt;</font><font face="Palatino">,
it undoubtedly has sometimes the same meaning as
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpo&gt;</font><font face="Palatino">.
Not to mention other instances, there is a passage in Luke&#8217;s Gospel,
(17:25,) where Christ says, that <i>he must suffer many things,
</i></font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kai&lt; ajpodokimasqh~nai
ajpo&lt; th~v genea~v tau&gt;thv</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>and be
rejected </i>BY <i>this generation. </i>Everybody will admit, that the form of
expression is the same as in the corresponding clause. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f28</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Besides,
Chrysostom, whose native language was Greek, passes over this matter, as if
there were no room for debate. Not only is this meaning more appropriate, but it
corresponds to a former clause, in which it was said, that God was <i>justified
</i>by <i>the people, </i>(v. 29.) Although many apostates may revolt from the
Church of God, yet, among all the elect, who truly belong to the flock, the
faith of the Gospel will always remain uninjured.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 10:1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And after these things the
Lord appointed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>That the Apostles had
returned to Christ before these <i>seventy </i>were substituted in their room,
may be inferred from many circumstances. The twelve, therefore, were sent to
awaken in the Jews the hope of an approaching salvation. After their return, as
it was necessary that higher expectation should be excited, others were sent in
greater numbers, as secondary heralds, to spread universally in every place the
report of Christ&#8217;s coming. Strictly speaking, they received no commission,
but were only sent by Christ as heralds, to prepare the minds of the people for
receiving his doctrine. As to the number <i>seventy, </i>he appears to have
followed that order to which the people had already been long accustomed. We
must bear in mind what has been already said about the <i>twelve </i>Apostles, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that as
this was the number of the tribes when the people were in a flourishing
condition, so an equal number of apostles or patriarchs was chosen, to
reassemble the members of the lacerated body, that the restoration of the Church
might thus be complete.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There was a similar reason for these <i>seventy.
</i>We<i> </i>know that Moses, finding himself insufficient for the burden, took
<i>seventy </i>judges to be associated with him in governing the people,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;021822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
18:22; 24:1.) But when the Jews returned from the Babylonish captivity, they had
a council or
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sune&gt;drion</font><font face="Palatino">&#8212;which
was corrupted into <i>Sanedrin</i>  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f31</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8212;consisting<i>
</i>of seventy-two judges. As usually happens with such numbers, when they spoke
of the council, they called them only the <i>seventy </i>judges; and Philo
assures us, that they were chosen out of the posterity of David, that there
might be some remaining authority in the royal line. After various calamities,
this was the finishing stroke, when Herod abolished that council, and thus
deprived the people of a legitimate share in the government. Now as the return
from Babylon prefigured a true and complete redemption, the reason why our Lord
chooses <i>seventy </i>heralds of his coming appears to be, to hold out the
restoration of their fallen state; and as the people were to be united under one
head, he does not give them authority as judges, but only commands them to go
before him, that he may possess the sole power.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And sent them by two and
two.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> H</i>e appears to have done so on
account of their weakness. There was reason to fear, that individually they
would not have the boldness necessary for the vigorous discharge of their
office; and therefore, that they may encourage one another, they are sent

under the ninth chapter of Matthew; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but it
was proper to insert it again in this place, because it is related for a
different purpose. In order to stimulate his disciples the more powerfully to
apply with diligence to their work, he declares that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the harvest is
abundant:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and hence it follows, that
their labor will not be fruitless, but that they will find, in abundance,
opportunities of employment, and means of usefulness. He afterwards reminds them
of dangers, contests, and annoyances, and bids them go and prepare themselves
for traversing with speed the whole of Judea. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
short, he repeats the same injunctions which he had given to the Apostles; and,
therefore, it would serve no good purpose to trouble the reader here with many
words, since a full exposition of all these matters may be found in the passage
already quoted. We may notice briefly, however, the meaning of that expression,
<i>salute no man by the way. </i>It indicates extreme haste, when, on meeting a
person in <i>the way, </i>we pass on without speaking to him, lest he should
detain us even for a short time. Thus, when Elisha sent his servant to the
Shunamite woman, he charged him not to salute any person whom he
met:</font><br></div>

only enjoins them to be satisfied with ordinary and plain food, but allows them
to eat at another man&#8217;s table. Their plain and natural meaning is:
&#8220;you will be at liberty to live at the expense of others, so long as you
shall be on this journey; for it is proper that those for whose benefit you
labor should supply you with food.&#8221; Some think that they were intended to
remove scruples of conscience, that the disciples might not find fault with any
kind of food. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
nothing of this kind was intended, and it was not even his object to enjoin

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then he began to
upbraid.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke states the time when, and
the reason why, Christ uttered such invectives against those cities. It was
while he was sending the disciples away into various parts of Judea, to
proclaim, as they passed along, that the kingdom of God was at hand. Reflecting
on the ingratitude of those among whom he had long discharged the office of a
prophet, and performed many wonderful works, without any good result, he broke
out into these words, announcing that the time was now come, when he should
depart to other cities, having learned, by experience, that the inhabitants of
the country adjoining that lake, among whom he had begun to preach the Gospel
and perform miracles, were full of obstinacy and of desperate malice. But he
says nothing about the doctrine, and reproaches them that his miracles had not
led them to repent. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
object which our Lord had in view, in exhibiting those manifestations of his
power, undoubtedly was to invite men to himself; but as all are by nature averse

</i>in consequence of their proximity, were at that time abhorred for their
ungodliness, pride, debauchery, and other vices, Christ employs this comparison
for the express purpose of making a deeper and more painful impression on his
Jewish countrymen. There was not one of them who did not look upon the
inhabitants of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tyre and
Sidon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as abominable despisers of God. It
is, therefore, no small heightening of his curse, when Christ says, that there
would have been more hope of reformation from those places in which there was no
religion, than is to be seen in Judea itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lest any should raise thorny questions

foresaw would be done either by the one or by the other, but of what both
parties would have done, so far as could be judged from the facts. The
exceedingly corrupt morals and unrestrained debauchery of those cities might be
ascribed to ignorance; for there the voice of God had never been heard, nor had
miracles been performed, to warn them to repent. But in the cities of Galilee,
which Christ <i>upbraids, </i>there was a display of very hardened obstinacy in
despising miracles, of which they had seen a vast number without reaping any
advantage. In short, the words of Christ convey nothing more than that the
inhabitants of

desperate. Those on whom he does not bestow his mercy are justly appointed to
perdition. If he withhold his word from some, and allow them to perish, while,
in order to render others more inexcusable, he entreats and exhorts them, in a
variety of ways, to repentance, who shall charge him, on this account, with
injustice? Let us, therefore, aware of our own weakness, learn to contemplate
this height and depth  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f42</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> with
reverence; for it is intolerable fretfulness and pride that is manifested by
those who cannot endure to ascribe praise to the righteousness of God, except so

them is not fully evident.</font><br></div>

in the Church of God: not that Christ attaches importance to that matter, but
because he accommodates himself to the capacity of the common people. We know
that believers are not only required to exercise repentance for a few days, but
to cherish it incessantly till death. But there is no necessity, in the present
day, for being clothed with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sackcloth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ashes</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i>

repentance, but only when, after some aggravated revolt, men turn to God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sackcloth and ashes
</i></font><font face="Palatino">are, no doubt, indications of guilt, for the
purpose of turning away the wrath of the Judge;  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f44</font></sup><font face="Palatino">and
therefore relate strictly to the beginning of conversion. But as men testify by
this ceremony their sorrow and grief, it must be preceded by hatred of sin, fear
of God, and mortification of the flesh, according to the words of Joel, (2:13,)
<i>Rend your hearts and not your garments. </i>We now see the reason why
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sackcloth and
ashes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>are mentioned by Christ along with
<i>repentance, </i>when he speaks of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tyre and Sidon,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to the inhabitants of which the Gospel could
not have been preached, without condemning their past life, leaving nothing for
them, but to betake themselves to the wretched apparel of criminals for the sake
of humbly beseeching pardon. Such, too, is the reference of the word <i>sitting,
</i>which is employed by Luke, SITTING
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in sackcloth and
ashes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for it denotes <i>&#8220;lying
</i>prostrate on the ground,&#8221;&#8212;a posture adapted to express the grief
of wretched persons, as is evident from many passages of the
Prophets.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Capernaum</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in which he had resided so constantly, that many supposed it to be his
native place. It was indeed an inestimable honor, that the Son of God, when
about to commence his reign and priesthood, had chosen
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Capernaum</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>for the seat of his palace and sanctuary. And yet it was as deeply plunged
in its filth, as if there had never been poured upon it a drop of Divine grace.
On this account, Christ declares, that the punishment awaiting it will be the
more dreadful, in proportion to the higher favors which it had received from
God. It deserves our earnest attention in this passage, that the profanation of
the gifts of God, as it involves sacrilege, will never pass unpunished; and that
the more eminent any one is, he will be punished with the greater severity, if
he shall basely pollute the gifts which God has bestowed upon him; and above
all, an awful vengeance awaits us, if, after having received the spiritual gifts
of Christ, we treat him and his Gospel with contempt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they had been done in

foresaw would happen if he had sent a Prophet to the inhabitants of <i>Sodom.
</i>But if quarrelsome persons are not satisfied with this answer, every ground
of objection is removed by this single consideration, that although God had a
remedy in his power for saving the inhabitants of <i>Sodom, </i>yet in
destroying them he was a just avenger.

<i>receiving </i>had a reference to offices of kindness; but <i>now </i>he
recommends faith, which receives God in his Word. The general meaning is, that
the godliness of men is ascertained by the obedience of faith; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f48</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and that
those who reject the Gospel, though they may boast of being the most eminent of
the worshippers of God, give evidence that they wickedly despise
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now attend to the design of Christ. As a
considerable portion of the world foolishly estimates the Gospel according to
the rank of men, and despises it because it is professed by persons of mean and
despicable condition, our Lord here contradicts so perverse a judgment. Again,
almost all are so proud, that they do not willingly submit to their equals, or
to those whom they look down upon as inferior to them. God has determined, on
the other hand, to govern his Church by the ministry of men, and indeed
frequently selects the ministers of the Word from among the lowest dregs of the
people. It was, therefore, necessary to support the majesty of the Gospel, that
it might not appear to be degraded by proceeding from the lips of
men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable commendation 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f49</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of the
outward ministry, when Christ declares, that whatever honor and respect is
rendered to the preaching of men, provided that the preaching be faithful, God
acknowledges as done to Himself. In two points of view, this recommendation is
useful. Nothing ought to be a stronger encouragement to us to embrace the
doctrine of the Gospel, than to learn that this is the highest worship of God,
and a sacrifice of the sweetest odor, to hear him speaking by human lips, and to
yield subjection to his word, which is brought to us by men, in the same manner
as if he were descending from heaven or making known his will to us by angels.
Again, our confidence is established, and all doubt is removed, when we learn,
that the testimony of our salvation, when delivered to us by men whom God has
sent, is not less worthy of credit, than if His voice resounded from heaven. To
deter us, on the other hand, from despising the Gospel, he adds a severe
threatening:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that despiseth you despiseth me;
and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Those who disdain to listen to
ministers, however mean and contemptible they may be, offer an insult, not to
men only, but to Christ himself, and to God the Father. While a magnificent
eulogium is here pronounced on the rank of pastors, who honestly and faithfully
discharge their office, it is absurd in the Pope and his clergy to take this as
a pretense for cloaking their tyranny. Assuredly, Christ does not speak in such
a manner, as to surrender into the hands of men the power which the Father has
given him, but only to protect his Gospel against contempt. Hence it follows,
that he does not transfer to the persons of men the honor which is due to
himself, but only maintains that it cannot be separated from his Word. If the
Pope wishes to be <i>received, </i>let him bring forward the doctrine by which
he may be recognized as a minister of Christ; but so long as he continues to be
what he now is, a mortal enemy of Christ, and destitute of all resemblance to
the Apostles, let him cease to deck himself with borrowed
feathers.</font><br></div>

slight perception of the Divine power, and are afterwards excited to admiration
by actual experience. What was the nature of that joy will more clearly appear
from Christ&#8217;s reply.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I beheld
Satan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>From one instance Christ leads
them to the whole class; for he commanded his Gospel to be published for the
very purpose of overturning Satan&#8217;s kingdom. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f52</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> So then,
while the disciples rested solely on that demonstration which they had obtained
from experience, Christ reminds them, that the power and efficacy of their
doctrine extends farther, and that its tendency is to extirpate the tyranny
which Satan exercises over the whole human race. We have now ascertained the
meaning of the words. When Christ commanded that his Gospel should be preached,
he did not at all attempt a matter of doubtful result, but foresaw the
approaching ruin of Satan. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now
since the Son of God cannot be deceived, and this exercise of his foresight
relates to the whole course of the Gospel, we have no reason to doubt, that
whenever he raises up faithful teachers, he will crown their labor with
prosperous success.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we infer, that our deliverance from the bondage
of Satan is effected in no other way than through the Gospel; and that those
only make actual proficiency in the Gospel, in whom Satan loses his power, so
that sin is destroyed, and they begin to live to the righteousness of God. We
ought also to attend to the comparison which he employs, that the thunder of the
Gospel makes </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Satan fall like
lightning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for it expresses the divine
and astonishing power of the doctrine, which throws down, in a manner so sudden
and violent, the prince of the world armed with such abundant forces. It
expresses also the wretched condition of men, on whose heads fall the darts of
Satan, who rules in the air, and holds the world in subjection under his feet,
till Christ appear as a Deliverer.</font><br></div>

Christ does not affirm that the gift of which they now boast is not illustrious,
but reminds them, that they ought to keep their eye chiefly on something loftier
still, and not remain satisfied with outward miracles. He does not altogether
condemn their joy, as if it were groundless, but shows it to be faulty in this
respect, that they were immoderately delighted with a temporal favor, and did
not elevate their minds higher. To this disease even the godly are almost all
liable. Though the goodness of God is received by them with gratitude, yet the
acts of the Divine kindness do not assist them, as they ought to do, by becoming
ladders for ascending to heaven. This makes it necessary that the Lord should,
as it were, stretch out his hand to raise them up, that they may not rest
satisfied with the earth, but may aspire to heavenly renovation.

I do not mean that every thing which tends to injure men is placed at his
disposal; but that, being armed with the curse of God, he endeavors to turn to
our destruction all his chastisements, and seizes them as weapons for the
purpose of wounding us.</font><br></div>

to withdraw his disciples from a transitory joy, that they might glory in
eternal life, he leads them to its origin and source, which is, that they were

to rejoice that they had been regenerated by the Spirit of God,

<i>answer,
</i>(</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" size="4" color="Teal">hn[</font><font face="Palatino">,)
is frequently employed even in the commencement of a discourse, yet in this
passage I consider it to be emphatic; for it was from the present occurrence
that Christ took occasion to speak. This is more fully confirmed by the words of
Luke, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the same hour Jesus
rejoiced in spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Whence came that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rejoicing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i>
Was it not because the Church, composed of poor and despised persons, was viewed
by him as not less precious and valuable than if all the nobility and high rank
in the world had lent to it their brilliancy? Let it be observed, also, that the
discourse is addressed to the <i>Father, </i>and consequently is marked by
greater energy than if he had spoken to his disciples. It was on their behalf,
no doubt, and for their sake, that he <i>gave thanks to the Father, </i>that
they might not be displeased with the low and mean aspect of his
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are constantly looking for splendor; and nothing
appears to us more incongruous, than that the heavenly kingdom of the Son of
God, whose glory is so magnificently celebrated by the prophets, should consist
of the dregs and offscourings of the common people. And truly it is a wonderful
purpose of God, that though he has the whole world at his command, he chooses
rather to select a peculiar people to himself from among the contemptible
vulgar, than from the nobility, whose high rank would have been a greater
ornament to the name of Christ. But here Christ withdraws his disciples from a
proud and haughty imagination, that they may not venture to despise that mean
and obscure condition of his Church, in which he delights and <i>rejoices.
</i>To restrain more fully that curiosity which is constantly springing up in
the minds of men, he rises above the world, and contemplates the secret decrees
of God, that he may lead others to unite with him in admiring them. And
certainly, though this appointment of God contradicts our senses, we discover
not only blind arrogance, but excessive madness, if we murmur against it, while
Christ our Head adores it with reverence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I acknowledge to thee, O
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>By these words he declares his acquiescence in that decree of the <i>Father,
</i>which is so greatly at variance with human senses. There is an implied
contrast between this praise, which he ascribes to the Father, and the malicious
slanders, or even the impudent barkings, of the world. We must now inquire in
what respect he glorifies the <i>Father. </i>It is because, while he was Lord of
the whole world, he preferred
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children and ignorant persons to
the wise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It has no small weight, as
connected with this subject, that he calls the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father Lord of heaven and
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for in this manner he declares
that it is a distinction which depends entirely on the will of God,  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f61</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that the
<i>wise </i>remain blind, while the ignorant and unlearned receive the mysteries
of the Gospel. There are many other passages of a similar nature, in which God
points out to us, that those who arrive at salvation have been freely chosen by
him, because he is the Creator and Governor of the world, and all nations are
his.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This expression implies two things. First, that all
do not obey the Gospel arises from no want of power on the part of God, who
could easily have brought all the creatures into subjection to his government.
Secondly, that some arrive at faith, while others remain hardened and obstinate,
is accomplished by his free election; for, drawing some, and passing by others,
he alone makes a distinction among men, whose condition by nature is alike. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f62</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
choosing </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>little
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>rather than the <i>wise, </i>he
has a regard to his glory; for the flesh is too apt to rise, and if able and
learned men had led the way, it would soon have come to be the general
conviction, that men obtain faith by their skill, or industry, or learning. In
no other way can the mercy of God be so fully known as it ought to be, than by
making such a choice, from which it is evident, that whatever men bring from
themselves is nothing; and therefore human wisdom is justly thrown down, that it
may not obscure the praise of divine grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is asked, whom does Christ denominate <i>wise?
</i>And whom does he denominate
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>little
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>For experience plainly shows,
that not all the ignorant and unlearned on the one hand are enlightened to
believe, and that not all the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>learned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>are left in their blindness. It follows, that those are called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wise and
prudent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who, swelled with diabolical
pride, cannot endure to hear Christ speaking to them from above. And yet it does
not always happen that God reprobates those who have a higher opinion of
themselves than they ought to have; as we learn from the instance of Paul, whose
fierceness Christ subdued. If we come down to the ignorant multitude, the
majority of whom display envenomed malice, we perceive that they are left to
their destruction equally with the nobles and great men. I do acknowledge, that
all unbelievers swell with a wicked confidence in themselves, whether their
pride be nourished by their wisdom, or by a reputation for integrity, or by
honors, or by riches. But I consider that Christ here includes all who are
eminent for abilities and learning, without charging them with any fault; as, on
the other hand, he does not represent it to be an excellence in any one that he
is a <i>little </i>child. True, humble persons have Christ for their master, and
the first lesson of faith is, Let no man presume on his wisdom. But Christ does
not speak here as to voluntary childhood. He magnifies the grace of the Father
on this ground, that he does not disdain to descend even to the lowest and most
abominable, that he may raise up the poor out of filth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a question arises. As
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prudence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is a gift of God, how comes it that it hinders us from perceiving the
brightness of God, which shines in the Gospel? We ought, indeed, to remember
what I have already said, that unbelievers corrupt all the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prudence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>which they possess, and that men of distinguished abilities are often
hindered in this respect, that they cannot submit to be taught. But with respect
to the present passage I reply: Though the sagacity of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prudent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>does not stand in their way, they may notwithstanding be deprived of the
light of the Gospel. Since the condition of all is the same or alike, why may
not God take this or that person according to his pleasure? The reason why he
passes by the <i>wise </i>and the <i>great </i>is declared by Paul to be,
that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">God hath chosen the weak
and foolish things of the world to confound the glory of the flesh,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460127&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 1:27.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence also we infer, that the statement made by
Christ is not universal, when he says, that the mysteries of the Gospel are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hidden from the
wise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If out of five <i>wise men
</i>four reject the Gospel and one embraces it, and if, out of an equal number
of unlearned persons, two or three become disciples of Christ, this statement is
fulfilled. This is also confirmed by that passage in Paul&#8217;s writings,
which I lately quoted; for he does not exclude from the kingdom of God all the
<i>wise, </i>and <i>noble, </i>and <i>mighty, </i>but only declares that it does
not contain <i>many </i>of them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The question is now solved. <i>Prudence </i>is not
condemned as far as it is a gift of God, but Christ merely declares that it has
no influence in procuring faith. On the other hand, he does not recommend
ignorance, as if it rendered men acceptable to God, but affirms that it does not
hinder mercy from enlightening ignorant and unlearned men with heavenly wisdom.
It now remains to explain what is meant by <i>revealing </i>and <i>hiding.
</i>That Christ does not speak of the outward preaching may be inferred with
certainty from this circumstance, that he presented himself as a Teacher to all
without distinction, and enjoined his Apostles to do the same. The meaning
therefore is, that no man can obtain faith by his own acuteness, but only by the
secret illumination of the Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Undoubtedly, O
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This expression removes every
pretense for that licentiousness of inquiry, to which we are continually
excited. There is nothing which we yield to God with greater difficulty, than
that his will shall be regarded by us as the highest reason and justice. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f63</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
frequently repeats, that his <i>judgments are a deep abyss,

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f64</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and if
there is any thing that does not please us, we gnash our teeth, or murmur
against him, and many even break out into open blasphemies. On the contrary, our
Lord lays down to us this rule, that whatever God has determined must be
regarded by us as right.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f65</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is
sober wisdom, to acquiesce in the good pleasure of God as alone equal to a
thousand arguments. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Christ
might indeed have brought forward the causes of that distinction, if there were
any; but he is satisfied with the good pleasure of God, and inquires no farther
why he calls to salvation <i>little children </i>rather than others, and
composes his kingdom out of an obscure flock. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f67</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence it
is evident, that men direct their fury against Christ, when, on learning that
some are freely chosen, and others are reprobated, by the will of God, they
storm because they find it unpleasant to yield to God.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All things have been
delivered to me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The connection of this
sentence with the preceding one is not correctly understood by those
commentators who think that Christ intends nothing more than to strengthen the
confidence of his disciples for preaching the Gospel. My opinion is, that Christ
spoke these words for another reason, and with another object in view. Having
formerly asserted that the Church proceeds from the secret source of God&#8217;s
free election, he now shows in what manner the grace of salvation comes to men.
Many persons, as soon as they learn that none are heirs of eternal life but
those whom God <i>chose before the foundation of the world,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:4,) begin to inquire anxiously how they may be assured of God&#8217;s secret
purpose, and thus plunge into a labyrinth, from which they will find no escape.
Christ enjoins them to come direct to himself, in order to obtain certainty of
salvation. The meaning therefore is, that life is exhibited to us in Christ
himself, and that no man will partake of it who does not enter by the gate of
faith. We now see that he connects faith with the eternal predestination of
God,&#8212; two things which men foolishly and wickedly hold to be inconsistent
with each other. Though our salvation was always hidden with God, yet Christ is
the channel through which it flows to us, and we receive it by faith, that it
may be secure and ratified in our hearts. We are not at liberty then to turn
away from Christ, unless we choose to reject the salvation which he offers to
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>None knoweth the
Son.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He says this, that we may not be
guided by the judgment of men, and thus form an erroneous estimate of his
majesty. The meaning therefore is, that if we wish to know what is the character
of Christ, we must abide by the testimony of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who alone can truly and
certainly inform us what authority he hath bestowed upon him. And, indeed, by
imagining him to be what our mind, according to its capacity, conceives of him,
we deprive him of a great part of his excellence, so that we cannot know him
aright but from the voice of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>That voice alone would
undoubtedly be insufficient without the guidance of the Spirit; for the power of
Christ is too deep and hidden to be attained by men, until they have been
enlightened by <i>the
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>We must understand him to mean, not that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Father
knoweth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for himself, but that He
<i>knoweth </i>for us to reveal him to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the sentence appears to be incomplete, for the
two clauses do not correspond to each other. Of <i>the Son </i>it is said, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>none knoweth the Father except
himself, and he to whom he shall be pleased to reveal
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Of <i>the Father </i>nothing more
is said than this, that He alone k<i>noweth the Son. </i>Nothing is said about
revelation. I reply, that it was unnecessary to repeat what he had already said;
for what else is contained in the previous thanksgiving, than that the Father
hath revealed the Son to those who approve of him? When it is now added that He
alone <i>knoweth the Son, </i>it appears to be the assigning of a reason; for
this thought might, have occurred, What neccessity was there that <i>the Son,
</i>who had openly exhibited himself to the view of men, should be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>revealed by the
Father?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We now perceive the reason why
it was said, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>none knoweth
the Son but the Father only</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It now
remains that we attend to the latter clause:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>None knoweth the Father except the
Son, and he to whom the Son shall be pleased to reveal
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is a different kind of
knowledge from the former; for the Son is said to <i>know the Father, </i>not
because he reveals Him by his Spirit, but because, being the lively image of
Him, he represents Him visibly in his own person. At the same time, I do not
exclude the Spirit, but explain the <i>revelation </i>here mentioned as
referring to the manner of communicating information. This agrees most
completely with the context; for Christ confirms what he had formerly said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that all things had been
delivered to him by his Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by
informing us that <i>the fullness of the Godhead dwelleth in him,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:9.) The passage may be thus summed up:  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f69</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> First,
it is the gift of <i>the Father, </i>that <i>the Son is known, </i>because by
his Spirit he opens the eyes of our mind to discern the glory of Christ, which
otherwise would have been hidden from us. Secondly, <i>the Father, </i>who
dwells in inaccessible light, and is in himself incomprehensible, is revealed to
us by the Son, because he is the lively image of Him, so that it is in vain to
seek for Him elsewhere.

</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Come to me all that
labor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now kindly invites to himself
those whom he acknowledges to be fit for becoming his disciples. Though he is
ready to reveal the Father to all, yet the greater part are careless about
coming to him, because they are not affected by a conviction of their
necessities. Hypocrites give themselves no concern about Christ, because they
are intoxicated with their own righteousness, and neither <i>hunger </i>nor
<i>thirst
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:6) for his grace. Those who are devoted to the world set no value on heavenly
life. It would be in vain, therefore, for Christ to invite either of these
classes, and therefore he turns to the wretched and afflicted. He speaks of them
as <i>laboring, </i>or groaning under a <i>burden, </i>and does not mean
generally those who are oppressed with grief and vexations, but those who are
overwhelmed by their sins, who are filled with alarm at the wrath of God, and
are ready to sink under so weighty a <i>burden. </i>There are various methods,
indeed, by which God humbles his elect; but as the greater part of those who are
loaded with afflictions still remain obstinate and rebellious, Christ means by
persons laboring<i> and burdened, </i>those whose consciences are distressed by
their exposure to eternal death, and who are inwardly so pressed down by their
miseries that they faint; for this very fainting prepares them for receiving his
grace. He tells us that the reason why most men despise his grace is, that they
are not sensible of their poverty; but that there is no reason why their pride
or folly should keep back afflicted souls that long for relief.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us therefore bid adieu to all who, entangled by
the snares of Satan, either are persuaded that they possess a righteousness out
of Christ, or imagine that they are happy in this world. Let our miseries drive
us to seek Christ; and as he admits none to the enjoyment of his rest but those
who sink under the burden, let us learn, that there is no venom more deadly than
that slothfulness which is produced in us, either by earthly happiness, or by a
false and deceitful opinion of our own righteousness and virtue. Let each of us
labor earnestly to arouse himself, first, by vigorously shaking off the luxuries
of the world; and, secondly, by laying aside <i>every </i>false confidence. Now
though this preparation for coming to Christ makes them as dead men, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f71</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> yet it
ought to be observed, that it is the gift of the Holy Spirit, because it is the
commencement of repentance, to which no man aspires in his own strength. Christ
did not intend to show what man can do of himself, but only to inform us what
must be the feelings of those who come to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They who limit the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burden</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>labor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to ceremonies of the Law, take a very narrow view of Christ&#8217;s meaning.
I do acknowledge, that the Law was intolerably burdensome, and overwhelmed the
souls of worshippers; but we must bear in mind what I have said, that Christ
stretches out his hand to all the afflicted, and thus lays down a distinction
between his disciples and those who despise the Gospel. But we must attend to
the universality of the expression; for Christ included all, without exception,
who <i>labor and are burdened, </i>that no man may shut the gate against himself
by wicked doubts. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f72</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And yet
all such persons are few in number; for, among the innumerable multitude of
those that perish, few are aware that they are perishing. The <i>relief
</i>which he promises consists in the free pardon of sins, which alone gives us
peace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take my yoke upon
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Many persons, we perceive, abuse
the grace of Christ by turning it into an indulgence of the flesh; and therefore
Christ, after promising joyful rest to wretchedly distressed consciences,
reminds them, at the same time, that he is their Deliverer on condition of their
submitting to his yoke. He does not, he tells us, absolve men from their sins in
such a manner, that, restored to the favor of God, they may sin with greater
freedom, but that, raised up by his grace, they may also
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>take his yoke upon
them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and that, being free in spirit,
they may restrain the licentiousness of their flesh. And hence we obtain a
definition of that rest of which he had spoken. It is not at all intended to
exempt the disciples of Christ from the warfare of the flesh, that they may
enjoy themselves at their ease, but to train them under the burden of
discipline, and keep them under the yoke.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Learn of
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is a mistake, I think, to suppose
that Christ here assures us of his meekness<i>, </i>lest his disciples, under
the influence of that fear which is usually experienced in approaching persons
of distinction, should remain at a distance from him on account of his Divine
glory. It is rather his design to form us to the imitation of himself, because
the obstinacy of the flesh leads us to shrink from his <i>yoke </i>as harsh and
uneasy. Shortly afterwards, he adds, (verse 30,)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>my yoke is
easy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>But how shall any man be brought
willingly and gently to bend his neck, unless, by putting on meekness, he be
conformed to Christ? That this is the meaning of the words is plain; for Christ,
after exhorting his disciples to bear his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>yoke</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and desirous to prevent them from being deterred by its difficulty,
immediately adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Learn of
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>thus declaring that, when his
example shall have accustomed us to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>meekness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and humility, we shall no longer feel his <i>yoke </i>to be troublesome. To
the same purpose he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will
relieve you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>So long as the flesh kicks,
we rebel; and those who refuse the yoke of Christ, and endeavor to appease God
in any other manner, distress and waste themselves in vain. In this manner, we
see the Papists wretchedly torturing themselves, and silently enduring the
dreadful tyranny under which they groan, that they may not bow to the <i>yoke
</i>of Christ.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 12:1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus was walking on the
Sabbath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was the design of the
Evangelists, in this history, to show partly what a malicious disposition the
Pharisees had, and partly how superstitiously they were attached to outward and
slight matters, so as to make holiness to consist in them entirely. They blame
the disciples of Christ for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>plucking the ears of corn on the
Sabbath, </i></font><font face="Palatino">during their journey, when they were
pressed with hunger, as if, by so doing, they were violating the <i>Sabbath.
</i>The keeping of the <i>Sabbath </i>was, indeed, a holy thing, but not such a
manner of keeping it as they imagined, so that one could scarcely move a finger
without making the conscience to tremble. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f76</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It was
hypocrisy, therefore, that made them so exact in trifling matters, while they
spared themselves in gross superstitions; as Christ elsewhere upbraids them
with</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">paying tithe of mint and
anise, and neglecting the</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">important
matters of the Law,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
23:23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is the invariable practice of hypocrites to allow
themselves liberty in matters of the greatest consequence, and to pay close
attention to ceremonial observances. Another reason why they demand that outward
rites should be more rigorously observed is, that they wish to make their duty
toward God to consist only in carnal worship. But it was malevolence and envy,
still more than superstition, that led them to this act of censure; for towards
others they would not have been equally stern. It is proper for us to observe
the feelings by which they were animated, lest any one should be distressed by
the fact, that the very Doctors of the Law were so hostile to
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 6:1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On the second-first
Sabbath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is beyond all question that
this Sabbath belonged to some one of the festival-days which the Law enjoined to
be observed once every year. Some have thought that there were two festival-days
in immediate succession; but as the Jews had arranged their festival-days after
the Babylonish captivity so that one day always intervened between them, that
opinion is set aside. Others maintain with greater probability, that it was the
last day of the solemnity, which was as numerously attended as the first. I am
more inclined to favor those who understand by it the second festivity in the
year; and this agrees exceedingly well with the name given to it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the second-first
Sabbath,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because, among the great
Sabbaths which were annually observed, it was the second in the order of time.
Now the <i>first </i>was the Passover, and it is therefore probable that this
was <i>the feast of first-fruits,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
23:15, 16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark 2:24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why do they on the Sabbath
what is not lawful?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Pharisees do not
blame the disciples of Christ for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>plucking ears of
corn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>from a field that was not their
own, but for violating </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Sabbath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as if there had been a precept
to this effect, that famishing men ought rather to die than to satisfy their
hunger. Now the only reason for keeping the Sabbath was, that the people, by
sanctifying themselves to God, might be employed in true and spiritual worship;
and next, that, being free from all worldly occupations, they might be more at
liberty to attend the holy assemblies. The lawful observation of it, therefore,
must have a reference to this object; for the Law ought to be interpreted
according to the design of the Legislator. But this shows clearly the malicious
and implacable nature of superstition, and particularly the proud and cruel
dispositions of hypocrites, when ambition is joined to hatred of the person. It
was not the mere affectation of pretended holiness, as I have said, that made
the Pharisees so stern and rigorous; but as they expressly wished to carp at
every thing that Christ said or did, they could not do otherwise than put a
wrong meaning in cases where there was nothing to blame, as usually happens with
prejudiced interpreters. The accusation was brought&#8212;according to Matthew
and Mark&#8212;against our Lord, and&#8212;according to Luke&#8212;against his
disciples. But there is no inconsistency here; for the disciples were in all
probability so harassed, that the charge was directed chiefly against the Master
himself. It is even possible that the Pharisees first wrangled with the
disciples, and afterwards with Christ, and that, in the rage of their malice,
they blamed him for remaining silent, and permitting his disciples to break the
Sabbath.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 12:3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have you not read what David
did?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ employs five arguments to
refute their calumny. <i>First, </i>he apologizes for his disciples by pleading
the example of <i>David,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;092106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 21:6.) While David was fleeing from the rage of Saul, he applied for
provisions to the high-priest Ahimelech; and there being no ordinary food at
hand, he succeeded in obtaining a part of the holy bread. If David&#8217;s
necessity excused him, the same argument ought to be admitted in the case of
others. Hence it follows, that the ceremonies of the Law are not violated where
there is no infringement of godliness. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f77</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now
Christ takes for granted, that David was free from blame, because the Holy
Spirit bestows commendation on the priest who allowed him to partake of the holy
bread. When he says, that <i>it was not lawful to eat </i>that bread <i>but for
the priests alone, </i>we must understand him to refer to the ordinary
law:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">they shall eat those
things wherewith the atonement was
made,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"> to consecrate and to
sanctify them; but a stranger shall
not</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">eat thereof, because they are
holy,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022933&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Exodus
29:33.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If David had attempted to do what was contrary to
law, it would have been in vain for Christ to plead his example; for what had
been prohibited for a particular end no necessity could make
lawful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That on the Sabbaths the
priests profane the Sabbath.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the
<i>second </i>argument by which Christ proves that the violation of the Sabbath,
of which the Pharisees complained, was free from all blame; because <i>on the
Sabbaths </i>it is lawful to slay beasts for sacrifice, to circumcise infants,
and to do other things relating to the worship of God. Hence it follows, that
the duties of piety are in no degree inconsistent with each other. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f78</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But if
<i>the temple </i>sanctifies manual operations connected with sacrifices, and
with the whole of the outward service, the holiness of the true and spiritual
<i>temple </i>has greater efficacy, in exempting its worshippers from all blame,
while they are discharging the duties of godliness. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f79</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now the
object which the disciples had in view was, to present to God souls which were
consecrated by the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Matthew alone glances at this argument. When Christ
says, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the priests Profane
the Sabbath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the expression is not
strictly accurate, and is accommodated to his hearers; for when the Law enjoins
men to abstain from their employments, it does not forbid them to perform the
services of religion. But Christ admits that to be true which might appear to be
so in the eye of ignorant persons, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f80</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
rests satisfied with proving, that the labors performed in the temple are not
offensive to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if you
knew</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This <i>Third </i>argument is also
mentioned by Matthew alone. Christ conveys an indirect reproof to the Pharisees,
for not considering why ceremonies were appointed, and to what object they are
directed. This has been a common fault in almost every age; and therefore the
prophet Hosea (6:6) exclaims against the men of his own age for being too much
attached to ceremonies, and caring little about the duties of kindness. But God
declares aloud, that he sets a higher value on <i>mercy </i>than on sacrifice,
employing the word <i>mercy, </i>by a figure of speech, for offices of kindness,
as <i>sacrifices </i>include the outward service of the Law. This statement
Christ applies to his own time, and charges the Pharisees with wickedly
torturing the Law of God out of its true meaning, with disregarding the second
table, and being entirely occupied with ceremonies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a question arises: Why does God declare that he
is indifferent about ceremonies, when he strictly enjoined in his Law that they
should be observed? The answer is easy. External rites are of no value in
themselves, and are demanded by God in so far only as they are directed to their
proper object. Besides, God does not absolutely reject them, but, by a
comparison with deeds of kindness, pronounces that they are inferior to the
latter in actual value. Nor is it inconsistent with this to say, that in the
perfection of righteousness the highest rank belongs to the worship of God, and
the duties which men owe to each other occupy the second rank. For, though piety
is justly reckoned to be as much superior to charity as God is higher than men,
yet as believers, by practicing justice towards each other, prove that their
service of God is sincere, it is not without reason that this subject is brought
under the notice of hypocrites, who imitate piety by outward signs, and yet
pervert it by confining their laborious efforts to the carnal worship alone. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f81</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> From the
testimony of the Prophet, Christ justly infers that no blame attaches to his
disciples; for while God trained his people in the rudiments of the Law, it was
far from being his design to kill wretched men with famine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Son of man is Lord
even of the Sabbath.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some connect this
sentence with a preceding statement,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that one greater than the temple
is in this place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>(ver. 6;) but I look
upon them as different. In the former case, Christ, by an allusion to <i>the
temple, </i>affirmed that whatever was connected with his personal holiness was
not a transgression of the Law; but now, he declares that he has received
authority to exempt his followers from the necessity of observing the Sabbath.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Son of
man,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>(he says,) in the exercise of his
authority, can relax the Sabbath in the same manner as other legal ceremonies.
And certainly out of Christ the bondage of the Law is wretched, from which he
alone delivers those on whom he bestows the free <i>Spirit of adoption, </i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f82</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark 2:27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Sabbath was made for
man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This <i>Fifth </i>argument is
related by Mark alone. The general meaning is, that those persons judge amiss
who turn to man&#8217;s destruction, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f83</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the
Sabbath which God appointed for his benefit. The Pharisees saw the disciples of
Christ employed in a holy work; they saw them worn out with the fatigue of the
journey, and partly with want of food; and yet are offended that, when they are
hungry, they take a few grains of corn for the support of their wearied bodies.
Is not this a foolish attempt to overturn the purpose of God, when they demand
to the injury of men that observation of the Sabbath which he intended to be
advantageous? But they are mistaken, I think, who suppose that in this passage
the Sabbath is entirely abolished; for Christ simply informs us what is the
proper use of it. Though he asserted, a little before, that he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord of the
Sabbath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>yet the full time for its
abolition 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f84</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was not

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 12:9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And having departed
thence.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This narrative and that which
immediately precedes it have the same object; which is to show, that the scribes
watched with a malicious eye for the purpose of turning into slander every thing
that Christ did, and consequently that we need not wonder if men, whose minds
were so depraved, were his implacable enemies. We see also, that it is usual
with hypocrites to pursue what is nothing more than a shadow of the
righteousness of the Law, and as the common saying is, to stickle more about the
form than about the substance. First, then, let us learn from this passage to
keep our minds pure, and free from every wicked disposition, when we are about
to form a decision on any question; for if hatred, or pride, or anything of that
description, reign within us, we will not only do injury to men, but will insult
God himself, and turn light into darkness. No man, who was free from malice,
would have refused to acknowledge that it was a Divine work, which those good
teachers do not scruple to condemn. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Whence
comes such fury, but because all their senses are affected by a wicked hatred of
Christ, so that they are blind amidst the full brightness of the sun? We learn
also, that we ought to beware lest, by attaching undue importance to ceremonial
observances, we allow other things to be neglected, which are of far higher
value in the sight of God, and which Christ in another passage calls <i>the more
important matters of the Law,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:23.) For so strongly are we inclined to outward rites, that we shall never
preserve moderation in this respect, unless we constantly remember, that
whatever is enjoined respecting the worship of God is, in the first place,
spiritual; and, secondly, ought to be regulated by the rule which Christ has
laid down to us in this passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They asked him,
saying.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Mark and Luke say only that they
<i>watched </i>what our Lord would do; but Matthew states more clearly that they
also attacked him by words. It is probable, that some others had been previously
cured on Sabbath-days; and hence they take occasion to ask if he believes it to
be <i>lawful </i>for him to do again what he had formerly done. They ought to
have considered whether it was a work of God, or of man, to restore a withered
hand by a mere touch, or by a single word. When God appointed the Sabbath, he
did not lay down a law for himself, or impose upon himself any restraint from
performing operations on the Sabbath, when he saw it to be proper, in the same
manner as on other days. It was excessive folly, therefore, to call this in
question, and thus to prescribe rules for God himself, and to restrain the
freedom of his operations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What man shall there be among
you who shall have a sheep?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ again
points out what is the true way of keeping the Sabbath; and, at the same time,
reproves them for slander, in bringing as a charge against him what was a
universal custom. For if any man&#8217;s
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sheep had fallen into a
ditch,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>no person would have hindered it
from being taken out: but in proportion as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a man is of more value than a
sheep,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>so much the more are we at
liberty to assist him. It is plain, therefore, that if any man should relieve
the necessity of brethren, he did not, in any degree, violate the rest which the
Lord has enjoined. Mark and Luke take no notice of this comparison, but only
state that Christ inquired, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is it
lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil?</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He who takes away the life of a man is held to be a
criminal; and there is little difference between manslaughter and the conduct of
him who does not concern himself about relieving a person in distress. So then
Christ indirectly charges them with endeavoring, under the pretense of a holy
act, to compel him <i>to do evil; </i>for sin is committed, as we have already
said, not only by him who does any thing contrary to the Law, but also by him
who neglects his duty. Hence also we perceive, that Christ did not always employ
the same arguments in refuting this slander; for he does not reason here about
his divinity as he does in the case mentioned by John, (v. 18.) Nor was there
any necessity for doing so; since the Pharisees were completely refuted by this
single defense, that nothing could be more unreasonable than to pronounce a man,
who imitated God, to be a transgressor of the Sabbath.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 12:8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But he knew their
thoughts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If Matthew states the truth,
they had openly declared by their language what was in their minds; and
therefore Christ replies not to <i>their secret thoughts, </i>but to express
words. But both may be true, that they spoke plainly, and yet that Christ
discerned their secret <i>thoughts</i>;<i> </i>for they did not openly avow
their designs, and Matthew himself tells us that their question was intended to
take Christ by surprise; and, consequently, Luke means nothing more than that
Christ was aware of their insidious designs, though not expressed in
words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark 3:5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when he had looked around
upon them with indignation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>To convince
us that this was a just and holy anger, Mark explains the reason of it to be,
that he was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grieved on account of
the blindness of their hearts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>First,
then, Christ <i>is
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grieved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because men who have been instructed in the Law of God are so grossly
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>but as it was malice that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blinded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>them, his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grief</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is accompanied by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>indignation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>This is the true moderation of zeal, to be distressed about the destruction
of wicked men, and, at the same time, to be filled with wrath at their
ungodliness. Again, as this passage assures us, that Christ was not free from
human passions, we infer from it, that the passions themselves are not sinful,
provided there be no excess. In consequence of the corruption of our nature, we
do not preserve moderation; and our anger, even when it rests on proper grounds,
is never free from sin. With Christ the case was different; for not only did his
nature retain its original purity, but he was a perfect pattern of
righteousness. We ought therefore to implore from heaven the Spirit of God to
correct our excesses.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 12:14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then the Pharisees took
counsel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>How obstinate is the rage which
drives the wicked to oppose God! Even after having been convinced, they pour out
their venom more and more. It is truly monstrous and shocking, that the most
distinguished teachers of the Law, who were entrusted with the government of the
Church, are engaged, like robbers, in contriving murder. But this must happen,
whenever the malice of men reaches such a height, that they wish to destroy
every thing that is opposed to their fancy, even though it may be from
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The circumstance of Christ&#8217;s making his escape
by flight must not be ascribed to fear; for he did not become more courageous by
the lapse of time, but was endued with the same fortitude of the Spirit at the
time when he fled, as when, at a later period, he voluntarily presented himself
to die. And this was a part of that <i>emptying of himself </i>which Paul
mentions,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:7,) that when he could easily have protected his life by a miracle, he chose
rather to submit to our weakness by taking flight. The only reason why he
delayed to die was, that the seasonable time, which had been appointed by the
Father, <i>was not yet come,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430730&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
7:30; 8:20.) And yet it is manifest, that he was preserved by heavenly power
rather than by flight; for it would not have been difficult for his enemies to
find out the place to which he had retired, and so far was he from shrouding
himself in darkness, that he carried a great company along with him, and
rendered that place illustrious by his miracles. He withdrew from their presence
for the sole purpose of not aggravating their rage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark 3:6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Pharisees took counsel
with the Herodians. :</i></font><font face="Palatino">Now they regarded <i>the
Herodians </i>with the fiercest hatred; for their eagerness to be considered the
guardians and protectors of public liberty made it necessary for them to make an
open profession of mortal hatred to the ministers of that tyrant. And yet this
aversion is counteracted by their hatred and fury against Christ, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which
makes them not only enter into a conspiracy with foreigners, but insinuate
themselves into the good graces of those with whom, on other occasions, they
would have shrunk from intercourse. While ungodliness hurries men in various
directions, and drives them to different courses, it engages them, with one
consent, in a contest with God. No hostilities prevent them from giving their
hand to each other for opposing the truth of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he threatened

explained the reason why he did not choose to have such witnesses. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f90</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And yet
there is no room to doubt, that divine power extorted from the devils this
confession; but having made it evident that they were subject to his dominion,
Christ properly rejected their testimony. But <i>Matthew </i>goes farther, and
states, that Christ discharged them from spreading the fame of the miracles
which he was performing. Not that he wished that fame to be wholly repressed,
(as we have pointed out on other occasions, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f91</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but to
allow it to strike root, that it might bring forth abundant fruit at the proper
season. We know that Christ did not perform miracles for the purpose of
amusement, but had a distinct object in view, which was to prove that he was the
Son of God, and the appointed Redeemer of the world. But he was manifested
gradually, and by regular steps, and was not revealed in his true
character</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;until the time

<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, it deserves our attention, that
when wicked men do their utmost to extinguish the glory of God, they are so far
from gaining their wish, that, on the contrary, God turns their rebellious
designs in an opposite direction. Though Christ withdrew from a populous
district, yet in this very concealment 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f92</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> his
glory continues to shine, and even bursts forth magnificently into its full
splendor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That it might be fulfilled
which was spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Matthew does not mean
that this prediction was entirely fulfilled by Christ&#8217;s prohibiting loud
and general reports to be circulated respecting his power 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f93</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, but
that this was an exhibition of that mildness which Isaiah describes in the
person of the Messiah. Those wonderful works which Christ performed in presence
of a few, and which he did not wish to be announced in pompous terms, were
fitted to <i>shake heaven and earth,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581226&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:26.) It was, therefore, no ordinary proof, how widely he was removed from the
pomp and ostentation of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it will be proper for us to examine more closely
the design of Matthew. By this circumstance he intended to show, that the glory
of Christ&#8217;s divinity ought not to be the less admired, because it appeared
under a vail of infirmity. This is unquestionably the very object to which the
Holy Spirit directed the eyes of the prophet. The flesh is constantly longing
for outward display, and to guard believers against seeking any thing of this
description in the Messiah, the Spirit of God declared that he would be totally
different from earthly kings, who, in order to draw admiration upon themselves,
produce great noises wherever they go, and fill cities and towns with commotion.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f94</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We now
perceive how appropriately Matthew applies the prediction of the prophet to the
case in hand. God appointed for his Son a low and mean appearance, and that
ignorant persons may not take offense at an aspect which has no attraction, and
is fitted to awaken contempt, both the prophet and Matthew come forward to
declare, that it is not by accident, but in consequence of a decree of Heaven,
that he assumes such a character. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f95</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence it
follows, that deep blame attaches to all who despise Christ, because his outward
condition does not correspond to the wishes of the flesh. We are not at liberty
to imagine to ourselves a Christ that corresponds to our fancy, but ought simply
to embrace him as he is offered by the Father. He who is offended by the low
condition of Christ, which God declares to be agreeable to his will, is unworthy
of salvation. I now come to examine the words of the prophet,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
42:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo, my servant, whom I have
chosen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To fix our attention more
closely on his will, God points out by the finger, as it were, the person whom
he is about to send; and this is the design of the exclamation, Lo! A similar
reason may be assigned for the epithets that follow, when God calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his servant, his elect in whom
his soul is well pleased.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For whence
comes it, that men venture to measure Christ by their own sense, but because
they do not consider that their redemption depends exclusively on the grace of
God? When God offers to us an invaluable treasure, it is excessive and wicked
presumption to regulate our estimation of it by the disdainful views of our
flesh. He is called a <i>servant, </i>not as if he were of the ordinary rank,
but by way of eminence, and as the person to whom God has committed the charge
and office of redeeming his Church. As:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">no man taketh this honor
to himself, but he who is called of God
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
5:6)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">is justly entitled to this rank, God declares that he
who comes forward in this character was <i>elected </i>by his decree. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f96</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence it
follows, that men are not at liberty to reject him; because, by doing so, they
would be guilty of contempt and rebellion against God. And, indeed, it were the
height of absurdity that our choice or our pride should set aside that calling
of God which ought to be regarded as sacred and inviolable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My beloved, in whom my soul is well
pleased.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is a still wider import
in this statement, which God next makes by the prophet, that the delight of his
soul dwells in Christ; for though the calling of each of us proceeds from the
free favor of God as its only source, yet in Christ there is this remarkable
peculiarity, that in his person God the Father embraces in his love the whole
Church. As we are all by nature enemies of God, his love will never come to us
till it first begin with the Head; which we have seen on a former occasion, and
will see again under another passage,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401705&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
17:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will proclaim judgment to the
Gentiles.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The prophet gives a brief
description of Christ&#8217;s office, when he foretells that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he will proclaim judgment to the
Gentiles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By the word <i>judgment
</i>the Jews understand a government which is correctly and properly arranged,
in which order and justice prevail. The design of the prophet is to inform us,
that a person will come who will restore justice that had fallen, who will be
the governor not of one nation only, but will also bring under subjection to God
the Gentiles, among whom dreadful confusion formerly prevailed. And this is the
import of the word <i>bring forth, </i>which the prophet employs; for it was the
office of Christ to spread throughout the whole world the kingdom of God, which
was at that time confined to the corner of Judea; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f97</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as it is
said in another passage,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The Lord will send forth

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will put my Spirit upon
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This explains the manner in which
judgment shall be <i>brought forth. </i>It is no doubt true, that there never
was any portion whatever of <i>righteousness </i>in the world that did not
proceed from the Spirit of God, and that was not maintained by his heavenly
power; as none of the kings of the earth can frame or defend good order, except
so far as he shall be assisted by the same Spirit. But in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bringing forth
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ is greatly superior to
all others, for he has received the Spirit from the Father, that he may pour it
out on all his people; for not only does he by word or writing prescribe what is
proper, but inwardly forms the hearts of men, by the grace of his Spirit, to
preserve the rule of righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He will not
strive</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The general meaning is, that the
coming of Christ will not be attended by noise, will have nothing of royal
splendor and magnificence. He presently adds, that this will turn to the
advantage of men, by inducing them to love that mildness which the world
everywhere despises. And certainly it is an astonishing display of the folly of
men, that their sentiments with regard to Christ are less respectful, because he
mildly and voluntarily accommodates himself to their capacity. Were Christ to
appear in his glory, what else could be expected, but that it would altogether
swallow us up? What wickedness then is it to be less willing to receive him,
when on our account he descends from his elevation?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That the gentleness of Christ may awaken reverence in
believers, Isaiah reminds them how advantageous, and even how necessary that
gentleness must be. Each of us is conscious of his own weakness; and therefore
we ought to consider of what importance it is that Christ should treat us with
kindness. I speak not of unbelievers, who are entirely destitute of all the
graces of the Spirit; but with respect to those whom God has already called, are
they not like </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a half-broken
reed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>smoking
lamp</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>till God kindle them to full
brightness, and supply them with perfect strength? When Christ is thus pleased
to condescend to our weakness, let his unspeakable goodness be embraced by us
with joy. Meanwhile, let none flatter himself in his vices, but let each of us
labor to make greater proficiency, that we may not be <i>tossed about
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:14) through our whole life, or bend, like <i>reeds, </i>to the slightest gale.
Let us grow to the stature of perfect men, that we may remain firm against the
diversified attacks of Satan, that our faith may not only emit slight sparks
encompassed by thick smoke, but may send out bright rays.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The example of Christ instructs all his ministers in
what manner they ought to conduct themselves. But as there are some who falsely
and absurdly maintain that mildness ought to be exercised indiscriminately
towards all, we must attend to the distinction which the prophet expressly makes
between <i>weak </i>and <i>wicked </i>persons. Those who are too stubborn need
to have their hardness beaten violently with a hammer; and those who endeavor to
spread darkness in every direction, or who act as torches to kindle

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark 3:20<i>.
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they come into the
house.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> Mark </i>undoubtedly takes in a
somewhat extended period of time, when he passes from the miracles to that
wicked conspiracy which the relatives of Christ formed with each other, to bind
him as if he had been a <i>madman. Matthew </i>and <i>Luke </i>mention not more
than a single miracle, as having given to the Pharisees an opportunity of
slander; but as all the three agree in this last clause which is contained in
Mark&#8217;s narrative, I have thought it proper to insert it
here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is wonderful that such wickedness should have been
found among the relatives of Christ, who ought to have been the first to aid him
in advancing the kingdom of God. When they see that he has already obtained some
reputation, their ambition leads them to desire that he should be admired in
Jerusalem; for they exhort him to go up to that city,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">that he may show himself
more openly,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430703&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
7:3,4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But now that they perceive him to be hated on one
side by the rulers, exposed on another to numerous slanders, and even despised
by the great body of the people--to prevent any injury, or envy, or dishonor,
from arising to the whole family, they form the design of <i>laying hands on
him, </i>and binding him at home, as if he had been a person who labored under
mental derangement; and, as appears from the words of the Evangelist, such was
their actual belief.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we learn, first, how great is the blindness of
the human mind, in forming such perverse judgments about the glory of God when
openly displayed. Certainly, in all that Christ said and did, the power of the
Holy Spirit shone magnificently; and if others had not clearly perceived it, how
could it be unknown to his relatives, who were intimately acquainted with him?
But because Christ&#8217;s manner of acting does not please the world, and is so
far from gaining its good graces that it exposes him to the resentments of many,
they give out that he is deranged. Let us learn, in the second place, that the
light of faith does not proceed from flesh and blood, but from heavenly grace,
that no man may glory in any thing else than in the regeneration of the Spirit;
as Paul tells us,</font><br></div>

</i>but Matthew says, that a twofold plague had been inflicted on the man. Many
persons, no doubt, are blind and deaf on account of natural defects; but it is
evident, that this man had become blind, and had been deprived of the use of
speech, though there was no defect in his optical nerves, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f104</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or in
the proportion of his tongue. We need not wonder that so much liberty should be
allowed to Satan in injuring the bodily senses, when God justly permits him to
corrupt or pervert all the faculties of the soul.</font><br></div>

was a visible display of the power of God, which drew upon him the admiration of
the great body of the people, who were not at all actuated by any wicked
disposition. For how came it that all admired, but because the fact compelled
them to do so? And certainly there is not one of us, who does not see in this
narrative, as in a mirror, an unwonted power of God: and hence it follows, that
a diabolical venom must have seized the minds of the scribes, who were not
ashamed to slander so remarkable a work of God. But we must attend to the result
of the miracle. Moved with admiration, those who saw it ask each other,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is not Jesus the
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>Acknowledging the power of God,
they are led, as it were by the hand, to faith. Not that they suddenly profited
as much as they ought to have done, (for they speak doubtfully;) but yet it is
no small proficiency to be aroused to consider more attentively the glory of
Christ. Some look upon this as a full affirmation, but the words convey no such
meaning; and the fact itself shows, that an unexpected occurrence had struck
them forcibly, and that they did not form a decided opinion, but only that it
occurred to them that he might be the Christ.</font><br></div>

what Christ did by Divine power. Not only do they obscure the praise of the
miracle, but endeavor to turn it into a reproach, as if it were performed by
magical enchantment; and that work, which could not be ascribed to a man, is
alleged by them to have the devil for its author. Of the word <i>Beelzebub </i>I

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But as Jesus knew their
thoughts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Though Christ knew
sufficiently well, and had often learned by experience, that the scribes, in the
exercise of their malice 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f114</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> were in
the habit of putting an unfavorable construction on every thing that he did, yet
Matthew and Luke, I have no doubt, mean that Christ was a discerner of their
hearts. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f115</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
indeed it is probable, that they spoke so openly against Christ, that their
calumnies reached his ears; but Christ knew by his Divine Spirit the
dispositions which led them to slander him. For it frequently happens that
erroneous judgments are formed by men who do not intentionally, after all,
oppose what is right, but err through ignorance; who do not cherish a hidden and
concealed venom, but whose rashness carries them headlong. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f116</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
meaning therefore is, that Christ reproved them with the greater severity,
because he was a witness and judge of their inward malice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every kingdom divided against
itself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><b><i> </i></b>In refuting the calumny
alleged against him, he first quotes a common proverb. This refutation may
appear to be not quite satisfactory. We know what subtle methods Satan sometimes
employs, presenting all the while an appearance of discord, in order to entrap
the minds of men by superstitions. Thus, for example, the exorcisms of Popery
are nothing else than feats of dexterity, in which Satan pretends to fight with
himself. But no suspicion of this nature fell on Christ; for he cast out devils
in such a manner, as to restore to God the men in whom they dwelt sound and
whole. Whenever Satan enters into a collusion with himself, he pretends to be
vanquished, and yet it is himself that triumphs. But Christ attacked Satan in
open combat, threw him down, and left him nothing remaining. He did not lay him
low in one respect, that he might give him greater stability in another, but
stripped him completely of all his armor. Christ therefore reasons justly, that
there is no community of interest between him and Satan, because that father of
cunning. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f117</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> keeps
one object in view the preservation of his kingdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But perhaps it will be objected, that the devils are
often hurried along, by giddiness and blind madness, to destroy themselves. The
answer is easy. The words of Christ mean nothing more than that it was absurd in
the scribes to maintain, that the devil, who endeavors by every method to make
men his slaves, should, of his own accord, destroy the power which he possessed
over them. Besides, it ought to be remembered, that common proverbs were
employed by Christ in such a manner, as to be merely probable conjectures, and
not solid arguments; and that, when he speaks of what is known and well
attested, he finds it easier to reach the conscience of his adversaries. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f118</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Everybody knew that Christ had driven Satan from his possession, and nothing was
plainer than that all his miracles tended to this object; and hence it was easy
to conclude, that his power, which was so much opposed to Satan, was
divine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By whom do your children cast
them out?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He charges them with passing
an unjust and malicious decision, because in the same case they did not decide
in a similar manner, but as they were affected towards the persons. Now this
inequality shows, that their prevailing motive was not a regard to what is just
and right, but blind love or hatred; and that it was even an evidence of wicked
self-love
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">filauti&gt;av</font><font face="Palatino">)
and envy, to condemn in Christ what they praised in their own

Apostles are so called, because they were acknowledged to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>while Christ was treated as if he had been a foreigner. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f119</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Others
refer it to the ancient Prophets. I have no doubt that he means the
<i>Exorcists, </i>who were at that time generally employed among the Jews, as is
evident from the Acts of the Apostles, (19:19.) There is reason to believe, that
no greater kindness would be exercised in judging of the disciples of Christ
than of their Master; and to apply these words to the dead is a forced
construction, when they manifestly denote a comparison of the present
time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There was indeed no statute of the Law for having
<i>Exorcists </i>among the Jews; but we know that God, in order to maintain
their fidelity to his covenant, and their purity of worship, often testified his
presence among them by a variety of miracles. It is even possible that there
were persons who cast out devils by calling on the name of the Lord; and the
people, having experienced such a display of the power of God, rashly concluded
that it was an ordinary office. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f120</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Papists afterwards, resolving not to occupy a lower rank, imitated them by
creating <i>Exorcists; </i>and in this way were apes of apes. Besides, it was
not necessary that Christ should approve of those <i>exorcisms, </i>in order to
point out the malice of those who wished to have them regarded as sacred, and as
authorized by the name of God; for the objection was, as we say, of a personal
nature.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f121</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore they shall judge
concerning you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These words are not to
be taken literally, but the meaning is: &#8220;We<i> </i>need not go far to seek
your condemnation. You attribute to Beelzebub the miracles which I have
performed, and you praise the same things in your own children. You have at home
what is sufficient to condemn you.&#8221; But if any one prefer to understand
them differently, as reproaching them with the grace of God, which was sometimes
exhibited through the Exorcists, I do not greatly object to that view. Though
they were greatly degenerated, yet the Lord was pleased not to leave them
altogether without evidences of his power, that there might be some testimony to
authorize the priesthood in general, and the service of the temple; for it was
of the highest importance that there should be evident marks to distinguish them
from the superstitions of the Gentiles. I look upon the former view, however, as
the natural one.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Finger</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

power, by his Spirit, it is with propriety that the word

Moses relates that Pharaoh&#8217;s magicians said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the finger of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now Christ infers from what he has
already stated, that the scribes prove themselves to be ungrateful to God, by
being unwilling that He should reign among them. Hitherto, he replied to their
idle calumny; but now, he treats them as convicted persons, and charges them not
to make ungodly opposition to the kingdom of God. He does not confine himself to
a single miracle, but takes occasion from it to discourse on the object of his
coming, reminds them that they ought not merely to look at one remarkable fact,
but at a far more important truth, that it was the will of God, by revealing His
Messiah, to raise up their salvation which was fallen, and to restore his
kingdom among them. Thus we see that Christ complains of their ingratitude, in
madly rejecting from the midst of them the inestimable grace of God.

kingdom of God, </i></font><font face="Palatino">and declares it to be necessary
that Satan be violently driven out, in order that God may establish his
<i>k</i>i<i>ngdom </i>among men. What he now states is nothing else than a
confirmation of the preceding statement. But to ascertain more fully the
intention of Christ, we must call to our recollection that analogy which Matthew
(8:17) traces between the visible and the spiritual layouts which Christ
bestows. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f122</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Every
benefit which the bodies of men received from Christ was intended to have a
reference to their souls. Thus, in rescuing the bodily senses of men from the
tyranny of the devil, he proclaimed that the Father had sent him as a Deliverer,
to destroy his spiritual tyranny over their souls.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now return to his words. He maintains that a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strong</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and powerful tyrant cannot be deprived of his dominion,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>till he is stripped of his
armor;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for if he is not met by a force
superior to his own, he will never yield of his own accord. Why is this
asserted? First, we know that the devil is everywhere called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the prince of the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now the tyranny which he
exercises is defended on every side by strong ramparts. His snares for
entrapping men are beyond all calculation; nay, men are already his slaves, and
so firmly bound by a variety of fetters, that they rather cherish the slavery,
to which they are devoted, than make any aspirations after freedom. There are
also innumerable evils which he inflicts upon them, by which he holds them in
wretched oppression under his feet. In short, there is nothing to prevent him
from tyrannizing over the world without control. Not that he can do anything
without the permission of the Creator, but because Adam, having withdrawn from
the dominion of God, has subjected all his posterity to this foreign
sway.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now though it is contrary to nature that the devil
reigns, and though it is by, just punishment of God, on account of sin, that men
are subjected to his tyranny, yet he remains in quiet possession of his kingdom,
and may insult us at his pleasure, till <i>a stronger than he </i>shall rise up
against him. But this <i>stronger </i>person is not to be found on earth, for
men have not sufficient power to relieve themselves; and therefor it was
promised that a Redeemer would come from heaven. Now this kind of redemption
Christ shows to be necessary, in order to wrench from the devil, by main force,
what he will never quit till he is compelled. By these words he informs us, that
it is in vain for men to expect deliverance, till Satan has been subdued by a
violent struggle.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f123</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He expressly accuses the scribes of ignorance, in not
understanding the principles of the kingdom of God. But this reproof applies
almost equally to all, for all are chargeable with the same folly. There is no
man who does not loudly boast that he desires the kingdom of God; and yet we do
not permit Christ to fight boldly, as the occasion requires, in order to rescue
us from the power of our tyrant; just as if a sick man were to entreat the aid
of a physician, and then to refuse every remedy. We now see the reason why
Christ introduced this parable. It was to show, that the scribes were hostile to
the kingdom of God, the beginnings of which they maliciously resisted. Let us
also learn that, as we are all subject to the tyranny of Satan, there is no
other way in which he commences his reign within us, than when he rescues us, by
the powerful and victorious arm of Christ, from that wretched and accursed
bondage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that is not with
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There are two ways of explaining this
passage. Some suppose that it is an argument drawn from contraries, and that
Christ&#8217;s meaning is: <i>&#8220;</i>I<b> </b>cannot reign till the devil is
overthrown; for the object of all his attempts is, to <i>scatter </i>whatever I
<i>gather.&#8221; </i>And certainly we see abundant evidence of the earnestness
with which that enemy labors to destroy the kingdom of Christ. But I rather
agree in opinion with those who explain it to denote, that the scribes are
declared to be, in two respects, opposed to the kingdom of God, because they
intentionally hinder its progress. <i>&#8220;</i>It<i> </i>was your duty to
assist me, and to give me your hand in establishing the kingdom of God; for
whoever does not assist is, in some measure, opposed to me, or, at least,
deserves to be reckoned among enemies. What then shall be said of you, whose
furious rage drives you into avowed opposition?<i>&#8221;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f124</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he that gathereth not with me
scattereth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The truth of this is
abundantly manifest from what has been already said; for so strong is our
propensity to evil, that the justice of God can have no place but in those who
apply to it in good earnest. This doctrine has a still more extensive bearing,
and implies that they are unworthy to be considered as belonging to the flock of
Christ, who do not apply to it all the means that are in their power; because
their indolence tends to retard and ruin the kingdom of God, which all of us are
called to advance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore I say to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This inference ought not to be
confined to the clause immediately preceding, but depends on the whole
discourse. Having proved that the scribes could not blame him for casting out
devils, without opposing the kingdom of God, he at length concludes that it is
no light or ordinary offense, but an atrocious crime, knowingly and willingly to
pour contempt on the Spirit of God. We have already said, that Christ did not
pronounce this decision on the mere words which they uttered, but on their base
and wicked thought.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All sin and
blasphemy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As our Lord declares
<i>blasphemy against the Holy Ghost </i>to be more heinous than all other sins,
it is of importance to inquire what is the meaning of that term. Those who
define it to be <i>impenitence</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f125</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>may be refuted without any difficulty; for it would have been in vain and to
no purpose for Christ to say, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it is not forgiven in the present
life.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Besides, the word <i>blasphemy
</i>cannot be extended indiscriminately to every sort of crimes; but from the
comparison which Christ makes, we shall easily obtain the true definition. Why
is it said that he who </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blasphemes
against the Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is a more heinous
sinner than he who </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blasphemes
against Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>Is it because the
majesty of the Spirit is greater, that a crime committed against him must be
punished with greater severity? Certainly that is not the reason; for as <i>the
fullness of the Godhead
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:9) shines in Christ, he who pours contempt upon him overturns and destroys, as
far as it lies in his power, the whole glory of God. Now in what manner shall
Christ be separated from his Spirit, so that those who treat the Spirit with
contempt offer no injury or insult to Christ?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Already we begin to perceive, that the reason why
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blasphemy against the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>exceeds other sins, is not that
the Spirit is higher than Christ, but that those who rebel, after that the power
of God has been revealed, cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance. Besides,
it must be observed, that what is here said about <i>blasphemy </i>does not
refer merely to the essence of <i>the Spirit, </i>but to the grace which He has
bestowed upon us. Those who are destitute of the light of the Spirit, however
much they may detract from the glory of the Spirit, will not be held guilty of
this crime. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f126</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We do
not maintain, that those persons are said to pour contempt on the Spirit of God,
who oppose his grace and power by hardened malice; and farther we maintain, that
this kind of sacrilege is committed only when we knowingly endeavor to
extinguish the Spirit who dwells in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason why contempt is said to be poured on the
Spirit, rather than on the Son or the Father, is this. By detracting from the
grace and power of God, we make a direct attack on <i>the Spirit, </i>from whom
they proceed, and in whom they are revealed to us. Shall any unbeliever curse
God? It is as if a blind man were dashing against a wall. But no man curses the
Spirit who is not enlightened by him, and conscious of ungodly rebellion against
him; for it is not a superfluous distinction. that all other <i>blasphemies
</i>shall be forgiven, except that one <i>blasphemy </i>which is directed
against the Spirit. If a man shall simply blaspheme against God, he is not
declared to be beyond the hope of pardon; but of those who have offered outrage
to <i>the Spirit, </i>it is said that God will never forgive them. Why is this,
but because those only are <i>blasphemers </i>against the Spirit, who slander
his gifts and power, contrary to the conviction of their own mind? Such also is
the import of the reason assigned by Mark for the extreme severity of
Christ&#8217;s threatening against the Pharisees;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because they had said that he had
the unclean spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for in this manner
they purposely and maliciously turned light into darkness; and, indeed, it is in
the manner of the <i>giants,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f127</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as the phrase is, to make war against God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a question arises. Do men proceed to such a
pitch of madness as not to hesitate, knowingly and willfully, to rush against
God? for this appears to be monstrous and incredible. I reply: Such audacity
does indeed proceed from mad blindness, in which, at the same time, malice and
virulent rage predominate. Nor is it without reason that Paul says, that though
he was</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">a blasphemer, he obtained
pardon, because he had done it ignorantly in his unbelief,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Timothy 1:13;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for this term draws a distinction between his sin and
voluntary rebellion. This passage refutes also the error of those who imagine
that every sin which is voluntary, or which is committed in opposition to the
conscience, is unpardonable. On the contrary, Paul expressly limits that sin to
the First Table of the Law; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f128</font></sup><font face="Palatino">and our
Lord not less plainly applies the word <i>blasphemy </i>to a single description
of sin, and at the same time shows, that it is of a kind which is directly
opposed to the glory of God. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f129</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From all that has been said, we may conclude that
those persons sin and blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, who maliciously turn to
his dishonor the perfections of God, which have been revealed to him by the
Spirit, in which His glory ought to be celebrated, and who, with Satan, their
leader, are avowed enemies of the glory of God. We need not then wonder, if for
such sacrilege there is no hope of pardon; for they must be desperate who turn
the only medicine of salvation into a deadly venom. Some consider this to be too
harsh, and betake themselves to the childish expedient, that it is said to be
unpardonable, because the pardon of it is rare and difficult to be obtained. But
the words of Christ are too precise to admit of so silly an evasion. It is
excessively foolish to argue that God will be cruel if he never pardon a sin,
the atrocity of which ought to excite in us astonishment and horror.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f130</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Those
who reason in that manner do not sufficiently consider what a monstrous crime it
is, not only to profane intentionally the sacred name of God, but to spit in his
face when he shines evidently before us. It shows equal ignorance to object,
that it would be absurd if even repentance could not obtain pardon; for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blasphemy against the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is a token of reprobation, and
hence it follows, that whoever have fallen into it, have been <i>delivered over
to a reprobate mind,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28.) As we maintain, that he who has been truly regenerated by the Spirit
cannot possibly fall into so horrid a crime, so, on the other hand, we must
believe that those who have fallen into it never rise again; nay, that in this
manner God punishes contempt of his grace, by hardening the hearts of the
reprobate, so that they never have any desire towards
repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither in the present
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>What these words mean, Mark
briefly explains by saying, that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
those who have spoken against the Spirit are exposed to eternal
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Every day we ask from God the
forgiveness of sins, and every day he reconciles us to Him; and, finally, at
death, he takes away all our sins, and declares that he is gracious to us. The
fruit of this mercy will appear at the last day. The meaning therefore
is:&#8212; &#8220;There is no reason to expect that those who shall have
blasphemed against the Spirit will obtain pardon in this life, or will be
acquitted in the last judgment.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the inference drawn by the Papists,
that the sins of men are forgiven after death, there is no difficulty in
refuting their slander. First, they act foolishly in torturing the expression,
<i>future life, </i>to mean an intermediate period, while any one may perceive
that it denotes &#8220;the last judgment.&#8221; But it is likewise a proof of
their dishonesty; for the objection which they sophistically urge is
inconsistent with their own doctrine. Who knows not their distinction, that sins
are freely pardoned in respect of guilt, but that punishment and satisfaction
are demanded? This is an acknowledgment, that there is no hope of salvation to
any one whose guilt is not pardoned before death. To the dead, therefore, there
remains no forgiveness, except as regards punishment; and surely they will not
venture to deny that the subject of this discourse is guilt. Let them now go and
light their fire of purgatory with these cold materials, if ice can kindle a
flame.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f131</font></sup><br></div>

persons Christ is addressing, the difficulty will be speedily resolved. We know
what opinion was generally entertained about the Pharisees; for their pretended
sanctity had so blinded the minds of the common people, that no one ventured to
pass sentence on their vices. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f132</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Wishing
to remove this mask, Christ desires them to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>either good or

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f133</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> So then

as they are double, because they must be <i>either
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good or
bad</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make the
tree</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>some foolishly infer, that it is
in every man&#8217;s power to regulate his own life and conduct. It is a
rhetorical mode of speaking, by which Christ points out the scribes,
dispels&#8212;so to speak&#8212;the smoke of their hypocrisy, and recalls them
to pure and genuine uprightness. He afterwards explains the way and manner in
which they may show that they are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good or bad
trees</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>which is by yielding
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good or bad
fruit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>so that there is no ambiguity in
the meaning. The life of the scribes was not rendered infamous among men by
gross vices. Pride,<i> </i>ambition, and envy, displayed their venom in the
slanders which they uttered; but as that venom was not perceived by ignorant
people, Christ brings the concealed evil from its lurking-place, and drags it
forth to light.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But perhaps it will be objected that, in consequence
of the corruption of our nature, it is impossible to find any man who is
altogether upright, and free from every vice. The answer is ready. Christ does
not demand absolute and entire perfection, but only a sincere and unfeigned
disposition, which the Pharisees whom he addresses were far from possessing. As
Scripture applies the terms, <i>bad and wicked, </i>to those who are completely
given up to Satan, so the sincere worshippers of God, though they are
encompassed by the infirmity of their flesh and by many sins, and groan under
the burden, are called <i>good. </i>This arises from the undeserved kindness of
God, who bestows so honorable a designation on those who aim at
goodness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Offspring of vipers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The similarity
between <i>the tree </i>and <i>the fruit </i>is here applied by Christ to
nothing more than speech, because this afforded an opportunity of detecting the
inward and concealed malice of the scribes; and that is the reason why he dwells
so much on this one kind of sin. It is because their falsehood and slanders
betrayed what was not so visible in the rest of their life, that Christ attacks
them with such severity. &#8220;There is no reason to wonder,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;that you vomit out wicked words; for your heart is full of malice.&#8221;
Nor are we to suppose that he ought to have treated them with greater
gentleness, because some might regard this reproof as excessively severe. There
are other sins, no doubt, that call for harsh reproofs; but when hypocritical
persons pervert what is right, or put a false coloring on what is sinful, such
wickedness renders it necessary that God should thunder against it in a more
terrible manner than against other sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the design of Christ, suggested by the present
occurrence, was to condemn the wicked sophistry which turns light into darkness.
This passage shows how highly valuable in the sight of the Lord truth is, since
he maintains and defends it with such rigor. Would that this were earnestly
considered by those persons, whose ingenuity is too ready to be employed in
defending any cause, and whose venal tongue disguises impostures! In a
particular manner, Christ waxes wroth against those whom ambition, or envy, or
some other fraudulent design, prompts to slander, even when there is nothing
that their conscience condemns. Against the Pharisees, too, as his custom
was,<i> </i>Christ used greater harshness, because they were so captivated by an
unfounded conviction of their righteousness, that an ordinary warning had no
effect upon them. And till hypocrites are sharply pierced, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f134</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> all
that is said to them is treated with scorn and contempt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How can you speak what is
good?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We have formerly hinted, that
proverbial sayings ought not to be rigidly interpreted as an invariable rule,
for they state nothing more than the ordinary fact. Sometimes, no doubt, a cruel
man will deceive the simple by honied flatteries, a cunning man will cheat under
the garb of simplicity, and a man of very wicked thoughts will breathe almost
angelical purity of language. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f135</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But the
ordinary practice demonstrates the truth of what Christ here says,<i> </i>that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>out of the abundance of the heart
the mouth speaketh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>agreeably to the old
proverb, which declared the tongue to be the index of the mind. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f136</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And,
indeed, whatever hidden and crooked recesses may exist in the heart of man, and
whatever may be the amazing contrivances by which every man conceals his vices,
yet the Lord extorts from each of them some kind of confession, so that they
discover by the tongue their natural disposition and hidden feelings. We must
also observe the purpose for which Christ employs those parables; for he
reproaches the Pharisees with having manifested by words the malice which they
had inwardly conceived. Besides, knowing them to be sworn enemies, he takes
occasion from, single calumny to expose their whole life, and to destroy their
credit with the people, which gave them too great influence in deceiving and in
doing mischief. Though <i>good </i>speeches do not always proceed from the
inmost heart, but originate (as the phrase is) on the tip of the tongue, yet it
is an invariable truth, that bad speeches are indications of a bad
heart.</font><br></div>

would God spare the open blasphemies and sacrilegious insolence of those who
bark against his glory? 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f137</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> An

we consider the purpose for which our tongues were made, we will acknowledge,
that those men are justly held guilty who unthinkingly devote them to trifling

maintains such a wise restraint upon himself, as never to allow some <i>idle

rests on the assurance that God will <i>not enter into judgment </i>with us,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19E302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

entertain no doubt that, when he removes the condemnation of our whole life, he

to <i>bridle his tongue,

endeavor to have <i>our speech seasoned with salt,

a meaning somewhat different, that a wicked speech, being the indication of
concealed malice, is enough to condemn a man. The attempt which the Papists make
to torture this passage, so as to set aside the righteousness of faith, is
childish. A man is </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>justified by
his words,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>not because his <i>speech
</i>is the ground of his justification, (for we obtain by faith the favor of
God, so that he reckons us to be righteous persons;) but because pure
<i>speech</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f140</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>absolves us in such a manner, that we are not condemned as wicked persons by
our tongue. Is it not absurd to infer from this, that men deserve a single drop
of righteousness in the sight of God? On the contrary, this passage upholds our
doctrine; for, although Christ does not here treat of the ground of our
justification, yet the contrast between the two words points out the meaning of
the word <i>justify. </i>The Papists reckon it absurd in us to say, that a man
is justified by faith, because they explain the word <i>justified </i>to mean,
that he becomes, and is, actually righteous; while we understand it to mean,
that he is accounted righteous, and is <i>acquitted </i>before the tribunal of
God, as is evident from numerous passages of Scripture. And is not the same
thing confirmed by Christ, when he draws a contrast between <i>justified </i>and
<i>condemned?</i></font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>43.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But when the unclean spirit
hath gone out.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He speaks of scribes and
hypocrites of a similar character, who, despising the grace of God, enter into a
conspiracy with the devil. Against such persons he pronounces that punishment
which their ingratitude deserves. To make his doctrine more extensively useful,
he points out, in a general manner, the condemnation that awaits those who,
despising the grace offered to them, again open the door to the devil. But as
almost every particle has great weight, there are some points that must be
noticed in their order, before we come to treat the substance of the
parable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What Christ says about the <i>going out </i>of the
devil is intended to magnify the power and efficacy of the grace of God.
Whenever God draws near to us, and, above all, when he approaches us in the
person of his Son, the design is, to rescue us from the tyranny of the devil,
and to receive us into his favor. This had been openly declared by Christ in the
miracle which he had lately performed. As it is the peculiar office of Christ to
banish wicked spirits, that they may no longer reign over men, the devil is
justly said to <i>go out of </i>those men to whom Christ exhibits himself as a
Redeemer. Though the presence of Christ is not efficacious to all, because
unbelievers render it useless to them, yet he intended to point out why he
visits us, what is implied in his coming, and how it is regarded by wicked
spirits; for in every case in which Christ operates on men, the devils are drawn
into a contest with him, and sink beneath his power. Let us, therefore, hold it
to be a settled point, that the devil is cast out of us, whenever Christ shines
upon us, and displays his grace towards us by some
manifestation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b><i>Secondly</i></b>, the wretched condition of the
whole human race is here described to us; for it follows that the devil has a
residence within man, since he is driven from it by the Son of God. Now what is
here said relates not to one individual or to another, but to the whole
posterity of Adam. And this is the glory of our nature, that the devil has his
seat within us, and inhabits both the body and the soul. So much the more
illustrious is the display of the mercy of God, when we, who were the loathsome
dens of the devil, are made temples to Himself, and consecrated for a habitation
of His Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b><i>Thirdly</i></b>, we have here a description of
Satan&#8217;s nature. He never ceases to do us injury, but is continually busy,
and moves from one place to another. In a word, he directs all his efforts to
accomplish our destruction; and above all, when he has been vanquished and put
to flight by Christ, it only tends more to whet his rage and keenness to do us
injury. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f142</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Before
Christ makes us partakers of his energy, it seems as if it were in sport and
amusement that this enemy reigns over us;  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f143</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
when he has been driven out, he conceives resentment at having lost his prey,
collects new forces, and arouses all his senses to attack us
anew.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He walketh through dry
places.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is a metaphorical
expression, and denotes that to dwell out of men is to him a wretched
banishment, and resembles a barren wilderness. Such, too, is the import of the
phrase, <i>seeking rest, </i>so long as he dwells out of men; for then he is
displeased and tormented, and ceases not to labor by one means or by another,
till he recover what he has lost. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f144</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us,
therefore, learn that, as soon as Christ calls us, a sharper and fiercer contest
is prepared for us. Though he meditates the destruction of all, and though the
words of Peter apply to all without exception, that he</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">goeth about as a roaring
lion, and seeketh whom he may
devour,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Peter 5:8,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">yet we are plainly taught by these words of Christ,
that Satan views with deeper hatred, and attacks with greater fierceness and
rage, those who have been rescued from his snares. Such an admonition, however,
ought not to inspire us with terror, but to arouse us to keep diligent watch,
and to put on the spiritual armor, that we may make a brave
resistance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>44.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He findeth it
empty</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Christ is unquestionably
describing those who, being destitute of the Spirit of God, are prepared for
receiving the devil; for believers, in whom the Spirit of God efficaciously
dwells, are fortified on all sides, so that no opening is left for Satan. The
metaphor of <i>a </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>house swept
and embellished</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is taken from men who
find pleasure in the cleanness and neatness of their apartments; for to Satan no
sight is beautiful but deformity itself, and no smell is sweet but filth and
nastiness. The meaning therefore is, that Satan never finds a more appropriate
habitation within us, than when, having parted with Christ, we receive Satan as
a guest. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f145</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> His
highest delight is in that <i>emptiness </i>by which the neglect of divine grace
is followed.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f146</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>45.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He taketh with him seven
other spirits</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The number <i>seven
</i>is here used indefinitely, as in many other passages. By these words Christ
shows that if we fall from his grace, our subjection to Satan is doubled, so
that he treats us with greater cruelty than before, and that this is the just
punishment of our slothfulness. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f147</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us
not then suppose that the devil has been vanquished by a single combat, because
he has once gone out of us. On the contrary, let us remember that<b>, </b>as his
lodgment within us was of old standing, ever since we were born, he has
knowledge and experience of all the approaches by which he may reach us; and
that, if there be no open and direct entrance, he has dexterity enough to creep
in by small holes or winding crevices. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f148</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We
must, therefore, endeavor that Christ, holding his reign within us, may block up
all the entrances of his adversary. Whatever may be the fierceness or violence
of Satan&#8217;s attacks, they ought not to intimidate the sons of God, whom the
invincible power of the Holy Spirit preserves in safety. We know that the
punishment which is here threatened is addressed to none but those who despise
the grace of God, and who, by extinguishing the light of faith, and banishing
the desire of godliness,

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 11:27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed is the
womb.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this eulogium the woman
intended to magnify the excellence of Christ; for she had no reference to Mary, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f152</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> whom,
perhaps, she had never seen. And yet it tends in a high degree to illustrate the
glory of Christ, that she pronounces
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the womb that bore
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to be noble and <i>blessed. </i>Nor
was the blessing inappropriate, but in strict accordance with the manner of
Scripture; for we know that offspring, and particularly when endued with
distinguished virtues, is declared to be a remarkable gift of God, preferable to
all others. It cannot even be denied that God conferred the highest honor on
Mary, by choosing and appointing her to be the mother of his Son. And yet
Christ&#8217;s reply is so far from assenting to this female voice, that it
contains an indirect reproof.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nay, rather, blessed are they that
hear the word of God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We see that Christ
treats almost as a matter of indifference that point on which the woman had set
a high value. And undoubtedly what she supposed to be Mary&#8217;s highest honor
was far inferior to the other favors which she had received; for it was of
vastly greater importance to be regenerated by the Spirit of God than to
conceive Christ, according to the flesh, in her womb; to have Christ living
spiritually within her than to suckle him with her breasts. In a word, the
highest happiness and glory of the holy Virgin consisted in her being a member
of his Son, so that the heavenly Father reckoned her in the number of new
creatures.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In my opinion, however, it was for another reason,
and with a view to another object, that Christ now corrected the saying of the
woman. It was because men are commonly chargeable with neglecting even those
gifts of God, on which they gaze with astonishment, and bestow the highest
praise. This woman, in applauding Christ, had left out what was of the very
highest consequence, that in him salvation is exhibited to all; and, therefore,
it was a feeble commendation, that made no mention of his grace and power, which
is extended to all. Christ justly claims for himself another kind of praise, not
that his mother alone is reckoned <i>blessed, </i>but that he brings to us all
perfect and eternal happiness. We never form a just estimate of the excellence
of Christ, till we consider for what purpose he was given to us by the Father,
and perceive the benefits which he has brought to us,<i> </i>so that we who are
wretched in ourselves may become happy in him. But why does he say nothing about
himself, and mention only the word of God? It is because in this way he opens to
us all his treasures; for without the word he has no intercourse with <i>us,
</i>nor we with him. Communicating himself to us by <i>the word, </i>he rightly
and properly calls us to <i>hear and keep it, </i>that by faith he may become
ours.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see the difference between Christ&#8217;s
reply and the woman&#8217;s commendation; for the <i>blessedness, </i>which she
had limited to his own relatives, is a favor which he offers freely to all. He
shows that we ought to entertain no ordinary esteem for him, because he has all
<i>the treasures </i>of life, <i>blessedness, </i>and glory, <i>hidden in him,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:3,) which he dispenses by the word, that they may be communicated to those who
embrace <i>the word </i>by faith; for God&#8217;s free adoption of us, which we
obtain by faith, is the key to the kingdom of heaven. The connection between the
two things must also be observed. We must first <i>hear, </i>and then <i>keep;
</i>for as <i>faith cometh by hearing,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:17,) it is in this way that the spiritual life must be commenced. Now as the
simple hearing is like a transitory <i>looking into a mirror,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f153</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as James says, (1:23,) he likewise adds, <i>the keeping of the word,
</i>which means the effectual reception of it, when it strikes its roots deep
into our hearts, and yields its fruit. The forgetful hearer, whose ears alone
are struck by the outward doctrine, gains no advantage. On the other hand, they
who boast that they are satisfied with the secret inspiration, and on this
ground disregard the outward preaching, shut themselves out from the heavenly
life. What the Son of God <i>hath joined let not men, </i>with wicked rashness,
<i>put asunder,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
19:6.) The Papists discover amazing stupidity by singing, in honor of Mary,
those very words by which their superstition is expressly condemned, and who, in
giving thanks, detach the woman&#8217;s saying, and leave out the correction. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f154</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But it
was proper that such a universal stupefaction should come upon those who
intentionally profane, at their pleasure, the sacred word of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 8:19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his mother and his
brethren came to him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is an
apparent discrepancy here between Luke and the other two Evangelists; for,
according to their arrangement of the narrative, they represent Christ&#8217;s
mother and cousins as having come, while he was discoursing about <i>the unclean
spirit, </i>while he refers to a different occasion, and mentions only the
woman&#8217;s exclamation, which we have just now explained. But we know that
the Evangelists were not very exact as to the order of dates, or even in
detailing minutely every thing that Christ did or said, so that the difficulty
is soon removed. Luke does not state at what precise time Christ&#8217;s mother
came to him; but what the other two Evangelists relate before the parable of the
sower he introduces after it. The account which he gives of the exclamation of
the woman from among the multitude bears some resemblance to this narrative; for
inconsiderate zeal may have led her to exalt to the highest pitch what she
imagined that Christ had unduly lowered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">All the three Evangelists agree in stating, that
while Christ was discoursing in the midst of a crowd of people, his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mother and brethren came to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The reason must have been either
that they were anxious about him, or that they were desirous of instruction; for
it is not without some good reason that they endeavor to approach him, and it is
not probable that those who accompanied the holy mother were unbelievers.
Ambrose and Chrysostom accuse Mary of ambition, but without any probability.
What necessity is there for such a conjecture, when the testimony of the Spirit
everywhere bestows commendation on her distinguished piety and modesty? The
warmth of natural affection may have carried them beyond the bounds of
propriety: this I do not deny, but I have no doubt that they were led by pious
zeal to seek his society. Matthew relates that the message respecting their
arrival was brought by <i>one </i>individual: Mark and Luke say that he was
informed by many persons. But there is no inconsistency here; for the message
which his mother sent to call him would be communicated, as usually happens,
from one hand to another, till at length it reached him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 12:48.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is my
mother?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These words were unquestionably
intended to reprove Mary&#8217;s eagerness, and she certainly acted improperly
in attempting to interrupt the progress of his discourse. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f155</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> At the
same time, by disparaging the relationship of flesh and blood, our Lord teaches
a very useful doctrine; for he admits all his disciples and all believers to the
same honorable rank, as if they were his nearest relatives, or rather he places
them in the room of his </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mother
and brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now this statement is
closely connected with the office of Christ; for he tells us that he has been
given, not to a small number of individuals, but to all the godly, who are
united in one body with him by faith. He tells us also, that there is no tie of
relationship more sacred than spiritual relationship, because we ought not to
think of him according to the flesh, but according to the power of his Spirit
which he has received from the Father to renew men, so that those who are by
nature the polluted and accursed seed of Abraham begin to be by grace the holy
and heavenly sons of God. In like manner, Paul affirms that to <i>know Christ
after the flesh </i>is not to know him properly,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:16,) because we ought rather to consider that renovation of the
world, which far exceeds human power, and which takes place when he forms us
anew by his Spirit to the image of God. To sum up the whole, this passage,
first, teaches us to behold Christ with the eyes of faith; and, secondly, it
informs us, that every one who is regenerated by the Spirit, and gives himself
up entirely to God for true justification, is thus admitted to the closest union
with Christ, and becomes one with him.</font><br></div>

regard to the ties of blood, yet we know that in reality he paid the strictest
attention to human order,

discharged his lawful duties towards relatives; but points out that, in
comparison of spiritual relationship, no regard, or very little, is due to the
relationship of the flesh. Let us therefore attend to this comparison, so as to
perform all that nature can justly claim, and, at the same time, not to be too
strongly attached to flesh and blood. Again, as Christ bestows on the disciples
of his Gospel the inestimable honor of being reckoned as his brethren, we must
be held guilty of the basest ingratitude, if we do not disregard all the desires
of the flesh, and direct every effort towards this object.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 11:16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And others tempting sought
from him a sign.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Something similar to
this is afterwards related by Matthew, (16:4,) and by Mark, (8:11, 12.) Hence it
is evident, that Christ repeatedly attacked them on this subject, so that there
was no end to the wickedness of those men who had once resolved 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f161</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to
oppose the truth. There can be no doubt that they ask a sign, in order to plead,
as a plausible pretense for their unbelief, that Christ&#8217;s calling has not
been duly attested. They do not express such submissiveness as to be prepared to
yield to two or three miracles, and still less to be satisfied with a single
miracle; but as I hinted a little before, they apologize for not believing the
Gospel on this pretense, that Christ shows no sign of it from heaven. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f162</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He had
already performed miracles before their eyes sufficiently numerous and manifest;
but as if these were not enough for the confirmation of doctrine, they wish to
have something exhibited from heaven, by which God will, as it were, make a
visible appearance. They call him <i>Master, </i>according to custom; for such
was the appellation given at that time to all scribes and expounders of the law.
But they do not acknowledge him to be a prophet of God, till he produce a
testimony from heaven. The meaning therefore is:<i> </i>&#8220;Since thou
professest to be a teacher and Master, if thou desirest that we should be thy
disciples, let God declare from heaven that He is the Author of thy teaching,
and let Him confirm thy calling by a miracle.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 12:39.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A wicked
generation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He does not merely charge
that age with malice, but pronounces the Jews&#8212;or at least the scribes, and
those who resembled them&#8212;to be a <i>wicked nation; </i>thus declaring that
they labored under a hereditary disease of obstinacy. The word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">genea&gt;</font><font face="Palatino">
sometimes denotes an <i>age, </i>and sometimes a <i>people </i>or <i>nation.
</i>He calls them <i>adulterous, </i>that is, spurious or illegitimate, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f163</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because
they were degenerated from the holy fathers; as the prophets reproach the men of
their age with being not the descendants of Abraham, but the ungodly seed of
Canaan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seeks a
sign.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This leads to the inquiry, Does
Christ address them with such harshness of language, because they wished to have
a sign given them? for on other occasions God manifests that He is not so much
displeased on this account. Gideon asks <i>a sign,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;070617&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Judges
6:17,) and God is not angry, but grants his request; and though Gideon becomes
importunate and asks another sign, yet God condescends to his weakness. Hezekiah
does not ask a <i>sign, </i>and it is offered to him, though unsolicited,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;233807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
38:7,8.) Ahaz is severely blamed for refusing to ask a sign, as the prophet had
enjoined him to do,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
7:11.) It is not solely, therefore, because they <i>ask a sign, </i>that Christ
makes this attack upon the scribes, but because they are ungrateful to God,
wickedly despise so many of his wonderful works, and try to find a subterfuge
for not obeying his word. What a display was this, I do not say of indifference,
but of malice, in shutting their eyes against so many <i>signs! </i>There was,
therefore, no proper ground for this annoyance; and they had no other object in
view than to appear to have a good reason for rejecting Christ. Paul condemns
their posterity for the same crime, when he says that the Jews <i>require a
sign, </i>(1 Corinthians 1:22.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A sign shall not be given to
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They had already been convicted by
various miracles, and Christ does not abstain from exerting his power among
them, for the purpose of rendering them inexcusable, but only means that <i>one
sign </i>would stand for all, because they were unworthy of having their ungodly
desire granted. &#8220;Let them rest satisfied,&#8221; says he, &#8220;with<i>
</i>this sign, that as Jonah, brought up from the bottom of the sea, preached to
the Ninevites, so they will hear the voice of a prophet risen from the
dead.&#8221; The most of commentators, I am aware, display greater ingenuity in
expounding this passage; but as the resemblance between Christ and Jonah does
not hold at every point, we must inquire in what respect Christ compares himself
to Jonah. For my own part, leaving the speculations of other men, I think that
Christ intends to mark out that single point of resemblance which I have already
hinted, that he will be their prophet after that he is risen from the dead.
&#8220;You despise,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the Son of God, who has come down to
you from heaven: but I am yet to die, and to rise from the grave, and to speak
to you after my resurrection, as Jonah came from the bottom of the sea to
Nineveh.&#8221; In this manner our Lord cuts off every pretense for their wicked
demands, by threatening that he will be their Prophet after his resurrection,
since they do not receive him while clothed with mortal flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 11:30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As Jonah was a sign to the
Ninevites.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He declares that he will be
<i>a sign </i>to them, as <i>Jonah </i>was to the inhabitants of Nineveh. But
the word <i>sign </i>is not taken in its ordinary sense, as pointing out
something, but as denoting what is widely removed from the ordinary course of
nature. In this sense Jonah&#8217;s mission was miraculous, when he was brought
out of the belly of the fish, as if from the grave, to call <i>the Ninevites
</i>to repentance. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Three days and
three nights</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is in accordance with
a well-known figure of speech. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f164</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As the
<i>night </i>is an appendage to the <i>day, </i>or rather, as the day consists
of two parts, light and darkness, he expresses a day by a day and a night, and
where there was half a day, he puts down a whole day.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 12:41.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The men of Nineveh will rise
in judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Having spoken of the
Ninevites, Christ takes occasion to show that the scribes and others, by whom
his doctrine is rejected, are worse than the Ninevites were. &#8220;Ungodly
men,&#8221; he says, &#8220;who never had heard a word of the true God, repented
at the voice of an unknown and foreign person who came to them; while this
country, which is the sanctuary of heavenly doctrine, hears not the Son of God,
and the promised Redeemer.&#8221; Here lies the contrast which is implied in the
comparison. We know who the Ninevites were, men altogether unaccustomed to hear
prophets, and destitute of the true doctrine. <i>Jonah </i>had no rank to secure
their respect, but was likely to be rejected as a foreigner. The Jews, on the
other hand, boasted that among them the Word of God had its seat and habitation.
If they had beheld Christ with pure eyes, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f165</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they
must have acknowledged, not only that he was a teacher sent from heaven, but
that he was the Messiah, and the promised Author of Salvation. But if that
nation was convicted of desperate ungodliness, for despising Christ while he
spoke to them on earth, we are worse than all the unbelievers that ever existed,
if the Son of God, now that he inhabits his sanctuary in heaven, and addresses
us with a heavenly voice, does not bring us to obey him. Whether
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the men of
Nineveh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>were truly and perfectly turned
to God I judge it unnecessary to inquire. It is enough for the present purpose
that they were so deeply affected by the teaching of Jonah, as to have their
minds directed to repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>42.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The queen of the
south.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As Ethiopia lies in a southerly
direction from Judea, I willingly concur with Josephus and other writers, who
assert that she was the queen of Ethiopia. In sacred history she is called
<i>the queen of Sheba,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;140901&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Chronicles 9:1.) We must not suppose this <i>Sheba </i>to be the country of
<i>Saba, </i>which rather lay toward the east, but a town situated in Meroe, an
island on the Nile, which was the metropolis of the kingdom. Here, too, we must
attend to the points of contrast. A woman who had not been at all educated in
the school of God, was induced, by the desire of instruction, to come from a
distant region to Solomon, an earthly king; while the Jews, who had been
instructed in the divine law, reject their highest and only teacher, the Prince
of all the prophets. The word <i>condemn </i>relates not to the persons, but to
the fact itself, and the example which it yields.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">What I have here introduced from Luke belongs,
perhaps, to another time; but I saw no necessity for separating what he has
placed in immediate connection. First, he says that the
<i>tw</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>e</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>lve
</i>apostles </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>preached the kingdom
of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>along with Christ; from which we
infer that, though the ordinary office of teaching had not yet been committed to
them, they constantly attended as heralds to procure an audience for their
Master; and, therefore, though they held an inferior rank, they are said to have
been Christ&#8217;s assistants. Next, he adds, that among those who accompanied
Christ were </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>certain women, who
had been cured of evil spirits and diseases</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>such as </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mary
Magdalene</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who had been tormented
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by seven
devils</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>To be associated with such
persons might be thought dishonorable; for what could be more unworthy of the
Son of God than to lead about with him women who were marked with infamy? But
this enables us more clearly to perceive that the crimes with which we were
loaded before we believed, are so far from diminishing the glory of Christ, that
they tend rather to raise it to a higher pitch. And, certainly, it is not said,
that the Church which he elected was found by him to be without spot and
blemish, but that he cleansed it with his blood, and made it pure and
fair.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The wretched and disgraceful condition of those
women, now that they had been delivered from it, redounded greatly to the glory
of Christ, by holding out public manifestations of his power and grace. At the
same time, Luke applauds their gratitude in following their Deliverer, and
disregarding the ridicule of the world. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f172</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Beyond
all question, they were pointed at with the finger on every side, and the
presence of Christ served for a platform to exhibit them; but they do not refuse
to have their own shame made generally known, provided that the grace of Christ
be not concealed. On the contrary, they willingly endure to be humbled, in order
to become a mirror, by which he may be illustriously displayed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In <i>Mary, </i>the boundless goodness of Christ was
displayed in an astonishing manner. A woman, who had been possessed by <i>seven
devils, </i>and might be said to have been the meanest slave of Satan, was not
merely honored to be his disciple, but admitted to enjoy his society. Luke adds
the surname <i>Magdalene, </i>to distinguish her from the sister of Martha, and
other persons of the name of Mary<i>, </i>who are mentioned in other passages,

to Mary<i>. </i>To me it appears probable that she is placed first in order, as
a person in whom Christ had given a signal display of his power; and that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the wife of Chuza, and

reflects higher commendation on their pious zeal, that they supply

doing, leave the care of their household affairs, and choose to follow him,
attended by reproach and many other inconveniences, through various and
uncertain habitations, instead of living quietly and at ease in their own

alike eager to hear, but not equally desirous to receive instruction. The design
of the parable was to inform them, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of doctrine, which is scattered far and wide, is not everywhere productive;
because it does not always find a fertile and well cultivated soil. Christ
declared that he was there in the capacity of a husbandman, who was going out
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to sow seed,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">but that many of his hearers resembled an
uncultivated and parched soil, while others resembled a thorny soil; so that the
labor and the very seed were thrown away. I forbear to make any farther inquiry
into the meaning of the parable, till we come to the explanation of it; which,
as we shall find, is shortly afterwards given by our Lord. It may only be
necessary, for the present, to remind the reader, that if those who ran from
distant places to Christ, like hungry persons, are compared to an unproductive
and barren soil, we need not wonder if, in our own day, the Gospel does not
yield fruit in many, of whom some are lazy and sluggish, others hear with
indifference, and others are scarcely drawn even to hear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that hath ears to hear,
let him hear. </i></font><font face="Palatino">These words were intended partly
to show that all were not endued with true understanding to comprehend what he
said, and partly to arouse his disciples to consider attentively that doctrine
which is not readily and easily understood by all. Indeed, he makes a
distinction among the hearers, by pronouncing some to have ears, and others to
be deaf. If it is next inquired, how it comes to pass that the former have ears,
Scripture testifies in other passages, that it is the Lord who <i>pierces the
ears,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;194007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
40:7,)and that no man obtains or accomplishes this by his own

it is evident, that the disciples did not merely look to themselves, but wished
also to consult the benefit of others. Being unable to comprehend the parable,
they concluded that it would be as little understood by the people; and,
therefore, they complain that Christ employed language from which his hearers
could derive no profit. Now though parables are generally found to illustrate
the subject of which they treat, yet the uninterrupted course of a metaphor may
lead to obscurity. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f173</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> So then
Christ, in delivering this parable, intended to wrap up, in an allegory, what he
might have said more plainly and fully, without a figure. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f173a</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
now that the exposition is added, the figurative discourse has greater energy
and force than if it had been simple: by which is meant, that it is not only
fitted to produce a more powerful impression on the mind, but is also more
clear. So highly important is the manner in which any thing is said.

learn, that the doctrine of salvation is proclaimed by God to men for various
purposes; for Christ declares that he intentionally spoke obscurely, in order
that his discourse might be a riddle to many, and might only strike their ears
with a confused and doubtful sound. It will perhaps be objected, that this is
inconsistent with that prophecy,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">But the answer is easy: the word of God, in its own
nature, is always bright, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f176</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but its
light is choked by the darkness of men. Though the Law was concealed, as it
were, by a kind of veil, yet the truth, of God shone brightly in it, if the eyes
of many had not been blinded. With respect to the Gospel, Paul affirms with
truth, that it is <i>hidden </i>to none but to the reprobate, and to those who
are devoted to destruction, <i>whose minds Satan hath blinded,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:3,4.) Besides, it ought to be understood, that the power of
enlightening which David mentions, and the familiar manner of teaching which
Isaiah predicts, refer exclusively to the elect people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Still it remains a fixed principle, that the word of
God is not obscure, except so far as the world darkens it by its own blindness.
And yet the Lord conceals its mysteries, so that the perception of them may not
reach the reprobate. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f177</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There
are two ways in which he deprives them of the light of his doctrine. Sometimes
he states, in a dark manner, what might be more clearly expressed; and sometimes
he explains his mind fully, without ambiguity and without metaphor, but strikes
their senses with dulness and their minds with stupidity, so that they are blind
amidst bright sunshine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Such is the import of those dreadful threatenings, in
which Isaiah forewarns, that he will be to the people a barbarian, speaking in a
foreign and unknown language; that the prophetical visions will be to the
learned a shut and sealed book, in which they cannot read; and that when the
book shall be opened, all will be <i>unlearned, </i>and will remain in
amazement, through inability to read,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;232811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:11; 29:11.) Now since Christ has purposely dispensed his doctrine in such a
manner, that it might be profitable only to a small number, being firmly seated
in their minds, and might hold others in suspense and perplexity, it follows
that, by divine appointment, the doctrine of salvation is not proclaimed to all
for the same end, but is so regulated by his wonderful purpose, that it is not
less <i>a savor of death to death </i>to the reprobate than <i>a life-giving
savor </i>to the elect,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:15,16.) And that no one may dare to murmur, Paul declares, in that
passage that whatever may be the effect of the Gospel, its <i>savor, </i>though
deadly, is always <i>a sweet savor </i>to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To ascertain fully the meaning of the present
passage, we must examine more closely the design of Christ, the reason why, and
the purpose for which, these words were spoken. First, the comparison is
undoubtedly intended by Christ to exhibit the magnitude of the grace bestowed on
his disciples, in having specially received what was not given indiscriminately
to all. If it is asked, why this privilege was peculiar to the apostles, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f178</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the
reason certainly will not be found in themselves, and Christ, by declaring that
it was <i>given </i>to them, excludes all merit. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f179</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Christ
declares that there are certain and elect men, on whom God specially bestows
this honor of revealing to them his <i>secrets, </i>and that others are deprived
of this grace. No other reason will be found for this distinction, except that
God calls to himself those whom he has gratuitously elected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For whosoever hath, it shall
be given to him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ pursues the
subject which I have just mentioned; for he reminds his disciples how kindly God
acts towards them, that they may more highly prize his grace, and may
acknowledge themselves to be under deeper obligations to his kindness. The same
words he afterwards repeats, but in a different sense,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402529&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
25:29;) for on that occasion the discourse relates to the lawful use of gifts. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f180</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
here he simply teaches, that more is <i>given </i>to the apostles than to the
generality of men, because the heavenly Father is pleased to display in
perfection his kindness towards them.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">He does not forsake the
work of his own
hand,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19D808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
138:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Those whom he has once begun to form are continually
polished more and more, till they are at length brought to the highest
perfection. The multiplied favors which are continually flowing from him to us,
and the joyful progress which we make, spring from God&#8217;s contemplation of
his own liberality, which prompts him to an uninterrupted course of bounty. And
as his riches are inexhaustible, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f181</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> so he
is never wearied with enriching his children. Whenever he advances us to a
higher degree, let us remember that every increase of the favors which we daily
receive from him flows from this source, that it is his purpose to complete the
work, of our salvation already commenced. On the other hand, Christ declares
that the reprobate are continually proceeding from bad to worse, till, at length
exhausted, they waste away in their own poverty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he that hath not, even that
which he hath shall be taken from him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>This may appear to be a harsh expression; but instead of saying, that
<i>what </i>the ungodly <i>have not is taken from them, </i>Luke softens the
harshness and removes the ambiguity by a slight change of the words:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and whosoever hath not, even that
which he thinketh that he hath shall be taken from
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>And indeed it frequently happens,
that the reprobate are endued with eminent gifts, and appear to resemble the
children of God: but there is nothing of real value about them; for their mind
is destitute of piety, and has only the glitter of an empty show. <i>Matthew
</i>is therefore justified in saying that they <i>have nothing; </i>for what
they have is of no value in the sight of God, and has no permanency within.
Equally appropriate is the statement of <i>Luke, </i>that the gifts, with which
they have been endued, are corrupted by them, so that they shine only in the
eyes of men, but have nothing more than splendor and empty display. Hence, also
let us learn to aim at progress throughout our whole life; for God grants to us
the taste of his heavenly doctrine on the express condition, that we feed on it
abundantly from day to day, till we come to be fully satiated with
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The manner in which <i>Mark </i>introduces this
sentence has some appearance of confusion. <i>Consider, </i>says our Lord,
<i>what you hear; </i>and then, if they make due progress, he holds out the
expectation of more plentiful grace:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it shall be added to you that
hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Lastly, follows the clause which
agrees with the words of <i>Matthew, </i>but is inserted in the middle of a
sentence which I expounded under the seventh chapter of <i>Matthew;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f182</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>for it is not probable that they are here placed in their proper order. The
Evangelists, as we have remarked on former occasions, were not very exact in
arranging Christ&#8217;s discourses, but frequently throw together a variety of
sayings uttered by him. <i>Luke </i>mixes this sentence with other discourses of
Christ spoken at different times, and likewise points out a different purpose
for which Christ used these words. It was that they might be attentive to his
doctrine, and not permit the seed of life to pass away unimproved, which ought
to be cordially received, and take root in their minds. &#8220;Beware,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;lest what has been given be taken away from you, if it yield no
fruit.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this reason I speak by
parables.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He says that he speaks to the
multitude in an obscure manner, because they are not partakers of the true
light. And yet, while he declares that a veil is spread over the blind, that
they may remain in their darkness, he does not ascribe the blame of this to
themselves, but takes occasion to commend more highly the grace bestowed on the
Apostles, because it is not equally communicated to all. He assigns no cause for
it, except the secret purpose of God; for which, as we shall afterwards see more
fully, there is a good reason, though it has been concealed from us. It is not
the only design of <i>a parable </i>to state, in an obscure manner, what God is
not pleased to reveal clearly; but we have said that the <i>parable </i>now
under our consideration was delivered by Christ, in order that the form of an
allegory might present a doubtful riddle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And in them is fulfilled the
prophecy of Isaiah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He confirms his
statement by a prediction of <i>Isaiah, </i>that it is far from being a new
thing, if many persons derive no advantage from the word of God, which was
formerly appointed to the ancient people, for the purpose of inducing greater
blindness. This passage of the Prophet is quoted, in a variety of ways, in the
New Testament. Paul quotes it
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442826&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
28:26) to charge the Jews with obstinate malice, and says that they were blinded
by the light of the Gospel, because they were bitter and rebellious against God.
There he points out the immediate cause which appeared in the men themselves.
But in the Epistle to the Romans (11:7) he draws the distinction from a deeper
and more hidden source; for he tells us, that <i>the remnant was saved according
to the election of grace, </i>and that <i>the rest were blinded, according as it
is written. </i>The contrast must there be observed; for if it is <i>the
election </i>of God, and an undeserved <i>election, </i>which alone saves any
remnant of the people, it follows that all others perish by a hidden, though
just, judgment of God. Who are the <i>rest, </i>whom Paul contrasts with the
<i>elect remnant, </i>but those on whom God has not bestowed a special
salvation?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Similar reasoning may be applied to the passage in
John, (12:38;) for he says that <i>many believed not, </i>because no man
believes, except he to whom God <i>reveals his arm, </i>and immediately adds,
that <i>they could not believe, because it is again written, Blind the heart of
this people. </i>Such, too is the object which Christ has in view, when he
ascribes it to the secret purpose of God, that the truth of the Gospel is not
revealed indiscriminately to all, but is exhibited at a distance under obscure
forms, so as to have no other effect than to overspread the minds of the people
with grosser darkness. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f183</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In all
cases, I admit, those whom God blinds will be found to deserve this
condemnation; but as the immediate cause is not always obvious in the persons of
men, let it be held as a fixed principle, that God enlightens to salvation, and
that by a peculiar gift, those whom He has freely chosen; and that all the
reprobate are deprived of the light of life, whether God withholds his word from
them, or keeps their eyes and ears closed, that they do not hear or
see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hearing you shall
hear.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We now perceive the manner in
which Christ applies the prediction of the prophet to the present occasion. He
does not quote the prophet&#8217;s words, nor was it necessary; for Christ
reckoned it enough to show, that it was no new or uncommon occurrence, if many
were hardened by the word of God. The words of the prophet
were,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Go, blind their minds,
and harden their hearts,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
6:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Matthew ascribes this to the hearers, that they may
endure the blame of their own blindness and hardness; for the one cannot be
separated from the other. All who have been <i>given over to a reprobate mind
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28) do voluntarily, and from inward malice, blind and harden themselves. Nor
can it be otherwise, wherever the Spirit of God does not reign, by whom the
elect alone are governed. Let us, therefore, attend to this connection, that all
whom God does not enlighten with the Spirit of adoption are men of unsound mind;
and that, while they are more and more blinded by the word of God, the blame
rests wholly on themselves, because this blindness is voluntary. Again, the
ministers of the word ought to seek consolation from this passage, if the
success of their labors does not always correspond to their wish. Many are so
far from profiting by their instruction, that they are rendered worse by it.
What has befallen them was experienced by a Prophet, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f184</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to whom
they are not superior. It were, indeed, to be wished, that they should bring all
under subjection to God; and they ought to labor and strive for that end. But
let them not wonder if that judgment, which God anciently displayed through the
ministration of the Prophet, is likewise fulfilled at the present day. At the
same time, we ought to be extremely careful, that the fruit of the Gospel be not
lost through our negligence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark 4:12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That seeing, they may see,
and not perceive.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here it may suffice to
state briefly what has already been fully explained, that the doctrine is not,
strictly speaking, or by itself, or in its own nature, but by accident, the
cause of blindness. When persons of a weak sight come out into sunshine, their
eyes become dimmer than before, and that defect is in no way attributed to the
sun, but to their eyes. In like manner, when the word of God blinds and hardens
the reprobate, as this takes place through their own depravity, it belongs truly
and naturally to themselves, but is accidental, as respects the
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest at any time they should be
converted.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This clause points out the
advantage that is gained by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seeing and
understanding</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is, that men, having
been <i>converted </i>to God, are restored to his favor, and, being reconciled
to him, enjoy prosperity and happiness. The true end for which</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God desires that his word should be preached is, to
reconcile men to himself by renewing their minds and hearts. With respect to the
reprobate, on the other hand, Isaiah here declares that the stony hardness
remains in them, so that they do not obtain mercy, and that the word fails to
produce its effect upon them, so as to soften their minds to
repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 13:15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest I should heal
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In the word <i>healing,
</i>Matthew, as well as the Prophet, includes deliverance from every evil; for a
people afflicted by the hand of God is metaphorically compared by them to a sick
man. They say that <i>healing </i>is bestowed, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f185</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> when
the Lord releases from punishment. But as this healing depends on the pardon of
sins, <i>Mark </i>describes appropriately and justly its cause and source,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lest they should be converted,
and their sins should be forgiven them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>For whence comes the mitigation of chastisements, but because God has been
reconciled to us, and makes us the objects of his blessing? Sometimes, no doubt,
after removing our guilt, he continues to punish us, either with the view of
humbling us the more, or of making us more cautious for the future. And yet, not
only does he show evidences of his favor by restoring us to life and health; but
as punishments usually terminate when the guilt is removed,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>healing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forgiveness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

repentance is the cause of pardon, as if God received into his favor

</i>men, because they deserved it; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f186</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>conversion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

such an order and connection, that God does not forgive the sins of any but
those who are dissatisfied with themselves.</font><br></div>

for in that passage he throws together a variety of our Lord&#8217;s sayings,
without attending to the order of dates. We shall, therefore, follow the text of
Matthew, who explains more clearly the circumstances from which Christ took
occasion to utter these words. Having formerly reminded them of the

the common people, and familiarly admitted to the mysteries of his kingdom, he

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saw the day of

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and

</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430856&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
8:56,) and yet longed to enjoy a nearer view, but did not obtain his wish.
Simeon spoke the sentiments of all, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f188</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> when he
said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now thou sendest thy

which the human race is crushed, they should be otherwise than altogether
inflamed with the desire of a promised deliverance.

<div><font face="Palatino">According to Matthew and Luke, Christ explains the
parable to his disciples simply, and unaccompanied by a reproof; but according
to Mark, he indirectly blames them for being slow of apprehension, because those
who were to be the teachers of all did not run before others. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f192</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
general truth conveyed is, that the doctrine of the Gospel, when it is scattered
like seed, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f193</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is not
everywhere fruitful; because it does not always meet with a fertile and well
cultivated soil. He enumerates four kinds of hearers: the first of which do not
receive the seed; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f194</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> the
second appear, indeed, to receive it, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f195</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but in
such a manner that it does not take deep root; in the third, the corn is choked;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f196</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and so
there remains a fourth part, which produces fruit. Not that one hearer only out
of four, or ten out of forty, embrace the doctrine, and yield fruit; for Christ
did not intend here to fix down an exact number, or to arrange the persons, of
whom he speaks, in equal divisions; and, indeed, where the word is sown, the
produce of faith is not always alike, but is sometimes more abundant, and at
other times more scanty. He only intended to warn us, that, in many persons, the
seed of life is lost on account of various defects, in consequence of which it
is either destroyed immediately, or it withers, or it gradually degenerates.
That we may derive the greater advantage from this warning, we ought to bear in
mind, that he makes no mention of despisers who openly reject the word of God,
but describes those only in whom there is some appearance of docility. But if
the greater part of such men perish, what shall become of the rest of the world,
by whom the doctrine of salvation is openly rejected? I now come down to each
class.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 13:19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When any one heareth the word
of the kingdom, and understandeth it not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>He mentions, in the first place, the barren and uncultivated, who do not
receive the seed within, because there is no preparation in their hearts. Such
persons he compares to a stiff and dry soil, like what we find on a public road,
which is trodden down, and becomes hard, like a pavement. I wish that we had not
occasion to see so many of this class at the present day, who come forward to
hear, but remain in a state of amazement, and acquire no relish for the word,
and in the end differ little from blocks or stones. Need we wonder that they
utterly vanish away?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That which was sown in their
heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This expression, which Christ
employs, is not strictly accurate, and yet it is not without meaning; for the
wickedness and depravity of men do not make the word to lose its own nature, or
to cease to have the character of seed. This must be carefully observed, that we
may not suppose the favors of God to cease to be what they are, though the good
effect of them does not reach us. With respect to God, the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is sown in the
hearts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but it is far from being true,
that the hearts of all <i>receive with meekness </i>what is planted in them, as
James (1:21) exhorts us to <i>receive the word. </i>So then the Gospel is always
a fruitful seed as to its power, but not as to its produce. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f197</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Luke adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

taketh away the seed out of their heart, that they may not believe and be
saved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence we infer that, as hungry
birds are wont to do at the time of sowing, this enemy of our salvation, as soon
as the doctrine is delivered, watches and rushes forth to seize it, before it
acquires moisture and springs up. It is no ordinary praise of the word, when it
is pronounced to be the cause of our salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But he that received the seed
thrown into stony places.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This class
differs from the former; for temporary faith, being a sort of vegetation of the
seed,   </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f199</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
promises at first some fruit; but their hearts are not so properly and
thoroughly subdued, as to have the softness necessary for their continued
nourishment. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f200</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We see
too many of this class in our own day, who eagerly embrace the Gospel, and
shortly afterwards fall off; for they have not the lively affection that is
necessary to give them firmness and perseverance. Let every one then examine
himself thoroughly, that the alacrity which gives out a bright flame may not
quickly go out, as the saying is, like a fire of tow; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f201</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for if
the word does not fully penetrate the whole heart, and strike its roots deep,
faith will want the supply of moisture that is necessary for perseverance. Great
commendation is due, no doubt, to that promptitude, which receives the word of
God with joy, and without delay, as soon as it is published; but let us learn,
that nothing has been done, till faith acquires true firmness, that it may not
wither in the first blade.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When affliction or
persecution ariseth on account of the word.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>By way of example, Christ says that such persons are made uneasy by the
offense of the cross. And certainly, as the heat of the sun discovers the
barrenness of the soil, so <i>persecution </i>and the cross lay open the vanity
of those, who are slightly influenced by I know not what desire, but are not
actually moved by earnest feelings of piety. Such persons, according to Matthew
and Mark, are <i>temporary,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f202</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>not only because, having professed, for a time, that they are the disciples
of Christ, they afterwards fall away through temptation, but because they
imagine that they have true faith. According to Luke, Christ says that they
<i>believe for a time; </i>because that honor which they render to the Gospel
resembles faith. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f203</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> At the
same time we ought to learn, that they are not truly regenerated by the
incorruptible seed, <i>which never fadeth, </i>as Peter tells us,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:4;) for he says that these words of Isaiah, <i>The word of God endureth
for ever,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
40:8;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:25,) are fulfilled in the hearts of believers, in whom the truth of God,
once fixed, never passes away, but retains its vigor to the end. Still, those
persons who take delight in the word of God, and cherish some reverence for it,
do in some manner <i>believe; </i>for they are widely different from
unbelievers, who give no credit to God when he speaks, or who reject his word.
In a word, let us learn that none are partakers of true faith, except those who
are scaled with the Spirit of adoption, and who sincerely call on God as their
Father; and as that Spirit is never extinguished, so it is impossible that the
faith, which he has once engraven on the hearts of the godly, shall pass away or
be destroyed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he who received the seed
among thorns.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He places in the third
class, those who would have been disposed to receive the seed within, if they
had not permitted </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>other
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to corrupt and render it
degenerate. Christ compares to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thorns</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>the pleasures of this life, or wicked desires, and covetousness, and the
other anxieties of the flesh. Matthew mentions only <i>the
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>care of this
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>along with covetousness, but the
meaning is the same; for under that term he includes the allurements of
pleasures, which Luke mentions, and every kind of desire. As corn, which
otherwise might have been productive, no sooner rises into the stalk than it is
choked by thorns and other matters injurious to its growth; so the sinful
affections of the flesh prevail over the hearts of men, and overcome faith, and
thus destroy the force of the heavenly doctrine, before it has reached
maturity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now though sinful desires exert their power on the
hearts of men, before the word of the Lord springs up into the blade, yet, at
first, their influence is not perceived, and it is only when the corn has grown
up, and given promise of fruit, that they gradually make their appearance. Each
of us ought to endeavor to tear the <i>thorns </i>out of his heart, if we do not
choose that the word of God should be <i>choked; </i>for there is not one of us
whose heart is not filled with a vast quantity, and, as I may say, a thick
forest, of <i>thorns. </i>And, indeed, we perceive how few there are that reach
maturity; for there is scarcely one individual out of ten that labors, I do not
say to root out, but even to cut down the <i>thorns. </i>Nay more, the very
number of the <i>thorns, </i>which is so prodigious that it ought to shake off
our sloth, is the reason why most people give themselves no trouble about
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The deceitfulness of
riches.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ employs this phrase to
denote
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covetousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He expressly says, that riches are imposing or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deceitful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in order that men may be more desirous to guard against falling into their
snares. Let us remember that the affections of our flesh, the number and variety
of which are incalculable, are so many injurious influences to corrupt
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
seed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But he that received the seed
into a good soil. None are compared by Christ to a good and fertile
soil,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but those in whom the word of God
not only strikes its roots deep and solid, but overcomes every obstacle that
would prevent it from yielding fruit. Is it objected that it is impossible to
find any one who is pure and free from thorns? It is easy to reply, that Christ
does not now speak of the perfection of faith, but only points out those in whom
the word of God yields fruit. Though the produce may not be great, yet every one
who does not fall off from the sincere worship of God is reckoned a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good and fertile
soil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We ought to labor, no doubt, to
pull out the <i>thorns; </i>but as our utmost exertion will never succeed so
well, but that there will always be some remaining behind, let each of us
endeavor, at least, to deaden them, that they may not hinder the fruit of the
word. This statement is confirmed by what immediately follows, when Christ
informs us that all do not yield fruit in an equal degree.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Some a hundred-fold, and some
sixty-fold, and some thirty-fold.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Though
the fertility of that soil, which yields a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thirty-fold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>produce, is small, compared with that which yields a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hundred-fold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>yet we perceive that our Lord classes together all kinds of soil which do
not entirely disappoint the labors and expectation of the husbandman. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f204</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence
too we learn, that we have no right to despise those who occupy a lower degree
of excellence; for the master of the house himself, though he gives to one the
preference above another on account of more abundant produce, yet bestows the
general designation, <i>good, </i>even on inferior soils. Those three gradations
are absurdly tortured by <i>Jerome, </i>to denote virgins, widows, and married
persons; as if that produce which the Lord demands from us belonged to celibacy
alone, and as if the piety of married persons did not, in many cases, yield more
abundantly every fruit of virtue. It must also be observed, in passing, that
what Christ says about a <i>hundred-fold </i>produce is not hyperbolical; for
such was at that time the fertility of some countries, as we learn from many
historians, who give their report as eye-witnesses.</font><br></div>

reapers, Gather first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but

<div align="center"><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In order to reap the advantage of this parable, it is
necessary to ascertain the object which Christ had in view. Some think that, to
guard a mixed multitude against satisfying themselves with an outward profession
of the Gospel, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f207</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he told
them, that in his own field bad seed is often mixed with the good, but that a
day is coming, when the tares shall be separated from the wheat. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f208</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They
accordingly connect this parable with the one immediately preceding, as if the
design of both had been the same. For my own part, I take a different view. He
speaks of a separation, in order to prevent the minds of the godly from giving
way to uneasiness or despondency, when they perceive a confused mixture of the
good along with the bad. Although Christ has cleansed the Church with his own
blood, that it may be without spot or blemish, yet hitherto he suffers it to be
polluted by many stains. I speak not of the remaining infirmities of the flesh,
to which every believer is liable, even after that he has been renewed by the
Holy Spirit. But as soon as Christ has gathered a small flock for himself, many
hypocrites mingle with it, persons of immoral lives creep in, nay, many wicked
men insinuate themselves; in consequence of which, numerous stains pollute that
holy assembly, which Christ has separated for himself. Many persons, too, look
upon it as exceedingly absurd, that ungodly, or profane or unprincipled men
should be cherished within the bosom of the Church. Add to this, that very many,
under the pretense of zeal, are excessively displeased, when every thing is not
conducted to their wish, and, because absolute purity is nowhere to be found,
withdraw from the Church in a disorderly manner, or subvert and destroy it by
unreasonable severity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In my opinion, the design of the parable is simply
this: So long as the pilgrimage of the Church in this world continues, bad men
and hypocrites will mingle in it with those who are good and upright, that the
children of God may be armed with patience and, in the midst of offenses which
are fitted to disturb them, may preserve unbroken stedfastness of faith. It is
an appropriate comparison, when the Lord calls the Church
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
field</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for believers are the seed of it;
and though Christ afterwards adds that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the field is the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>yet he undoubtedly intended to
apply this designation, in a peculiar manner, to the Church, about which he had
commenced the discourse. But as he was about to drive his plough through every
country of the world, so as to cultivate fields, and scatter the seed of life,
throughout the whole world, he has employed a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>synecdoche</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
to </i>make <i>the world </i>denote what more strictly belonged only to a part
of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now inquire what he means by <i>the
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wheat</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and what by <i>the
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tares</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>These terms cannot be explained as referring to doctrine, as if the meaning
had been that, when the Gospel </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is
sown</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is immediately corrupted and
adulterated by wicked inventions; for Christ would never have forbidden them to
labor strenuously to purge out that kind of corruption. With respect to morals,
those faults of men which cannot be corrected must be endured; but we are not at
liberty to extend such a toleration to wicked errors, which corrupt the purity
of faith.

Besides, Christ removes all doubt, by saying expressly, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the tares are the children of the
wicked one</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And yet it must also be
remarked, that this cannot be understood simply of the persons of men, as if by
creation God sowed good men and the devil sowed bad men. I advert to this,
because the present passage has been abused by the Manicheans, for the purpose
of lending support to their notion of two principles. But we know that whatever
sin exists, either in the devil or in men, is nothing else than the corruption
of the whole nature. As it is not by creation that God makes his elect, who have
been tainted with original sin, to become a good seed, but by regenerating them
through the grace of his Spirit; so wicked men are not created by the devil,
but, having been created by God, are corrupted by the devil, and thrown into the
Lord&#8217;s field, in order to corrupt the pure seed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>37.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that soweth the good
seed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He had formerly said that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the kingdom of heaven resembles a
man sowing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The mode of expression is
unusual, but plainly means, that the same thing happens with the preaching of
the Gospel as usually takes place in the sowing of fields;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the tares grow, up along with the
wheat</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>One peculiarity, however, is
pointed out by him, when he says that the sowing of tares in the field was
effected by the trick of <i>an enemy. </i>This is intended to inform us that,
when many wicked men are mingled with believers, this is no accidental or
natural occurrence, as if they were the same seed, but that we must learn to
charge the blame of this evil on the devil. Not that, by condemning him, men are
acquitted of guilt; but, in the first place, that no blame whatever may be laid
on God on account of this fault which arose from the agency of another; and,
secondly, that we may not be surprised to find <i>tares </i>frequently growing
in the Lord&#8217;s field, since Satan is always on the watch to do mischief.
Again, when Christ says, not that the ministers of the word sow, but that he
alone sows, this is not without meaning; for though this cannot be supposed to
be restricted to his person, yet as he makes use of our exertions, and employs
us as his instruments, for cultivating his field, so that He alone acts by us
and in us, he justly claims for himself what is, in some respects, common to his
ministers. Let us, therefore, remember, that the Gospel is preached, not only by
Christ&#8217;s command, but by his authority. and direction; in short, that we
are only his hand, and that He alone is the Author of the work.</font><br></div>

distressing consideration, that the Church is burdened with the reprobate to the
very </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>end of the
world;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but Christ enjoins on us to
exercise patience till that time, that we may not deceive ourselves with a vain
hope. Pastors ought to labor strenuously to purify the Church; and all the
godly, so far as their respective callings enable them, ought to lend assistance
in this matter; but when all shall have devoted their united exertions to the
general advantage, they will not succeed in such a manner as to purify the
Church entirely from every defilement. Let us therefore hold, that nothing was
farther from the design of Christ than to encourage pollution by lending
countenance to it. All that he intended was, to exhort those who believed in him
not to lose courage, because they are under the necessity of retaining wicked
men among them; and, next, to restrain and moderate the zeal of those who fancy
that they are not at liberty to join in a society with any but pure angels.

Anabaptists, and by others like them, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f211</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to take
from the Church the power of the sword. But it is easy to refute them; for since
they approve of excommunication, which cuts off, at least for a time, the bad

the sword against wicked men? They reply that, when the punishment is not

replying, that Christ does not now speak of the office of pastors or of
magistrates, but removes the offense which is apt to disturb weak minds, when
they perceive that the Church is composed not only of the elect, but of the
polluted dregs of society.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The reapers are the
angels.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This term must be viewed in
reference to the present subject. In another passage, the Apostles are called

their labors,

<div><font face="Palatino">Such also is the import of that statement, that
<i>the fields are white, </i>and are in want of reapers,

<div><font face="Palatino">But here the comparison is applied in a different
manner; for those who occupy a place in the Church are said to be planted in the

<div><font face="Palatino">These words describe the commencement of that
cleansing, which, this passage declares, will not take place before the last
day, because not till then will it be fully completed. Christ will put the last
hand to the cleansing of the Church by means of <i>angels, </i>but he now begins
to do the work by means of pious teachers. He assigns this office to <i>angels,
</i>because they will not remain idle spectators before his tribunal, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f213</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
will hold themselves in readiness to execute his commands. It follows, that
those who proceed, with undue haste, to root out whatever displeases them,
prevent, as far as lies in their power, the sentence of Christ, deprive

expression; for, as the infinite glory which is laid up for the sons of God so
far exceeds all our senses, that we cannot find words to express it, so the
punishment which awaits the reprobate is incomprehensible, and is therefore
shadowed out according to the measure of our capacity. From ignorance of this,
the Sophists have tortured themselves, to no purpose, by fruitless disputes, as
we have already hinted on a former occasion.

sparingly, and to rest satisfied with the plain and natural meaning. If we put a
question to those who are so delighted with matters of curiosity, how it comes
about that, while Christ is <i>asleep, </i>and unacquainted with the affair, the
devil sows tares among the good seed, they will have nothing to reply; but while
I desire to exercise caution, I have endeavored to leave out nothing that is
useful and necessary to be known.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>43.

The sons of God, who now lie covered with dust, or are held in no estimation, or
even are loaded with reproaches, <i>will then shine </i>in full brightness, as
when the sky is serene, and every cloud has been dispelled. The adverb <i>then
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&gt;te</font><font face="Palatino">)
is emphatic; for it contains an implied contrast between their present state and
the ultimate restoration, by the expectation of which Christ animates those who
believe in him. The meaning therefore is, Though many wicked men now hold a high
rank in the Church, yet that blessed day is assuredly to be expected, when the
Son of God shall raise his followers on high, and remove every thing that now
tends to dim or conceal their brightness. It is no doubt true, that the future
glory is promised to none but those in whom the image of God already shines, and
who are transformed into it by continued advances of glory. But as the life of
the godly is now hidden, and as their salvation is invisible, because it
consists in hope, Christ properly directs the attention of believers to heaven,
where they will find the glory that is promised to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In order to make a deeper impression on his hearers,
our Lord unquestionably refers here to a passage in Daniel,

patiently that mixture which, for a time, classes the elect of God with the
reprobate.&#8221; By comparing this glory to <i>the sun, </i>he does not
determine that it will be alike in all. As Christ now distributes his gifts
variously

believers, in like manner will he crown these gifts at the last day. But we must
recollect what I have said, that the restoration, which is delayed till the last

object with the two immediately preceding, yet Christ appears to direct his
discourse purposely to the ministers of the word, that they may not grow
indifferent about the discharge of their duty, because the fruit of their labor
does not immediately appear. He holds out for their imitation the example of
husbandmen, who </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>throw seed into

reaping, and do not torment themselves with uneasiness and anxiety, but go to
bed and rise again; or, in other words, pursue their ordinary and daily toil,
till the corn arrive at maturity in due season. In like manner, though the seed
of the word be concealed and choked for a time, Christ enjoins pious teachers to
be of good courage, and not to allow their alacrity to be slackened through
distrust.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 13:34.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All these things Jesus spoke
in parables. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Though Mark expressly says, that
Christ <i>spoke the word to them as they were able to bear it, </i>yet I think
it probable that he continued to employ <i>parables, </i>not so much for the
purpose of instruction, as to keep the attention of his hearers awake till a
more convenient time. For why did he explain them familiarly to his disciples
when they were apart? Was it because they were more slow of apprehension than
the great body of the people? No; but because he wished to convey to them
privately a knowledge of his meaning, and to allow others to remain in a state
of suspense, till a fitter opportunity should arrive. These were only a sort of
introduction to the Gospel, the full brightness and publication of which was
delayed till the proper time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is an apparent contradiction between this
statement of Matthew and the prediction of Isaiah, which was quoted a little
before. But this is easily removed; for, though he withdrew the light of
doctrine from the reprobate, yet this did not prevent him from accommodating
himself to their capacity, so as to render them inexcusable. He therefore
adopted a method of teaching which was proper and suitable to hearers, whom he
knew to be not yet sufficiently prepared to receive
instruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>35.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That it might be

the psalm, which he quotes, is a prediction which relates peculiarly to Christ,
but that, as the majesty of the Spirit was displayed in the discourse of the
Prophet, in the same manner was his power manifested in the discourse of Christ.
The Prophet, when he is about to speak of God&#8217;s covenant, by which he
adopted the seed of Abraham, of the benefits which he continued to bestow upon
his people, and of the whole government of the Church, introduces his subject in
lofty terms, <i>I will open my mouth in parables,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;197802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
78:2:) that is, &#8220;I will not speak of trifling matters, but will handle
with becoming gravity subjects of the highest importance.&#8221; When he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will utter dark
sayings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the meaning is the same; such
repetitions being very frequent in the Psalms. The Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" size="4" color="Teal">&#181;yl&ccedil;m</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>(Meshalim) </i>signifies <i>comparisons; </i>and it came afterwards to be
applied to &#8220;weighty sentences,&#8221; because <i>comparisons </i>generally
impart beauty and energy to a discourse. The word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" size="4" color="Teal">twdyj</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(Chidoth) </i>sometimes denotes <i>&#8220;riddles,&#8221; </i>and at other
times, &#8220;short sayings.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now though Matthew seems to allude to the word
<i>parable, </i>he undoubtedly means, that Christ spoke figuratively, in order
that his very style, being more brilliant than ordinary discourse, might carry
more weight and dignity. In short, he says that what is contained in the psalm
was <i>fulfilled; </i>because the use of allegories and figures tended to show,
that Christ was treating of the hidden mysteries of God, and to prevent his
doctrine from being despised. Hence, too, we infer, that there was no
inconsistency in the various objects which Christ had in view, when he spoke to
the people in a dark manner. Though he intended to conceal from the reprobate
what he was saying, yet he labored to make them feel, even in the midst of their
amazement, that there was something heavenly and divine in his language.

<div><font face="Palatino">The first two of these parables are intended to
instruct believers to prefer </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Kingdom of heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to the whole world,
and therefore to deny themselves and all the desires of the flesh, that nothing
may prevent them from obtaining so valuable a possession. We are greatly in need
of such a warning; for we are so captivated by the allurements of the world,
that eternal life fades from our view; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f230</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and in
consequence of our carnality, the spiritual graces of God are far from being
held by us in the estimation which they deserve. Justly, therefore, does Christ
speak in such lofty terms of the excellence of eternal life, that we ought not
to feel uneasiness at relinquishing, on account of it, whatever we reckon in
other respects to be valuable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the kingdom of heaven is like a
hidden treasure.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We commonly set a high
value on what is visible, and therefore the new and spiritual life, which is
held out to us in the Gospel, is little esteemed by us, because it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hidden</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and lies in hope. There is the highest appropriateness in comparing it to
<i>a
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>treasure</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the value of which is in no degree diminished, though it may be buried in
the earth, and withdrawn from the eyes of men. These words teach us, that we
ought not to estimate the riches of the grace of God according to the views of
our flesh, or according to their outward display, but in the same manner as a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>treasure</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>though it be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hidden</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is preferred to a vain appearance of wealth. The same instruction is
conveyed by the other parable</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.
One pearl,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>though it be small, is so
highly valued, that a skillful <i>merchant </i>does not hesitate to <i>sell
</i>houses and lands in order to purchase it. The excellence of the heavenly
life is not perceived, indeed, by the sense of the flesh; and yet we do not
esteem it according to its real worth, unless we are prepared to deny, on
account of it, all that glitters in our eyes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the leading object of both parables.
It is to inform us, that none are qualified for receiving the grace of the
Gospel but those who disregard all other desires, and devote all their
exertions, and all their faculties, to obtain it. It deserves our attention,
also, that Christ does not pronounce the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hidden
treasure</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pearl</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>to be so highly valued by all. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>treasure</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is ascertained to be valuable, after that it has been <i>found </i>and
known; and it is the skillful <i>merchant </i>that forms such an opinion about
the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pearl</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f231</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>These words denote the knowledge of faith. &#8220;The heavenly
kingdom,&#8221; Christ tells us, &#8220;is<i> </i>commonly held as of no
account, because men are incapable of relishing it, and do not perceive the
inestimable value of that treasure which the Lord offers to us in the
Gospel.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is asked, is it necessary that we abandon
every other possession, in order that we may enjoy eternal life? I answer
briefly. The natural meaning of the words is, that the Gospel does not receive
from us the respect which it deserves, unless we prefer it to all the riches,
pleasures, honors, and advantages of the world, and to such an extent, that we
are satisfied with the spiritual blessings which it promises, and throw aside
every thing that would keep us from enjoying them; for those who aspire to
heaven must be disengaged from every thing that would retard their progress.
Christ exhorts those who believe in him to deny those things only which are
injurious to godliness; and, at the same time, permits them to use and enjoy
God&#8217;s temporal favors, as if they did not use them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>46.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And bought
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By the word <i>buy </i>Christ does
not mean, that men bring any price, with which they may purchase for themselves
the heavenly life; for we know on what condition the Lord invites believers in
the book of Isaiah, (55:1,) <i>Come and buy wine and milk without money and
without price. </i>But though the heavenly life, and every thing that belongs to
it, is the free gift of God, yet we are said to <i>buy </i>it, when we
cheerfully relinquish the desires of the flesh, that nothing may prevent us from
obtaining it; as Paul says, that he</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">reckoned all things to be
loss and dung, that he might gain Christ,

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>47.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Again, the kingdom of heaven
is like a net.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>No new instruction is
here given by Christ; but what he formerly taught is confirmed by another
parable, that the Church of God, so long as it exists in the world, is a mixture
of the good with the bad, and is never free from stains and pollutions. And yet
the design of this parable is perhaps different. It may be that Christ intends
not only to remove the offense which perplexes many weak minds, because they do
not find in the world all the purity that might be desired, but likewise to
employ the influence of fear and modesty, in restraining his disciples from
delighting themselves with the empty title, or mere profession, of faith. For my
own part, I cheerfully adopt both views. Christ informs us, that a mixture of
the good and the bad must be patiently endured till <i>the end of the word;
</i>because, till that time, a true and perfect restoration of the Church will
not take place. Again, he warns us, that it is not enough, and&#8212;what is
more&#8212;that it is of little consequence to us, to be gathered into the fold,
unless we are his true and chosen sheep. To this effect is the saying of
Paul,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The preaching of the Gospel is justly compared to a
<i>net </i>sunk beneath the water, to inform us that the present state of the

permits hypocrites to remain for a time among believers, till the last day, when
he will bring his kingdom to a state of perfection. So far as lies in our power,
let us endeavor to correct vices, and let us exercise severity in removing
pollutions; but the Church will not be free from every spot and blemish, until
Christ shall have <i>separated the sheep from the goats,

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have you understood all these
things?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We must keep in recollection
what we have formerly seen, that all the parables of Christ were explained in
private. And now the Lord, after having taught them in this kind and familiar
manner, warns them at the same time, that his object, in taking so much pains to
instruct them, was not merely that they might be well informed, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f232</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
that they might communicate to others what they had received. In this way he
whets and excites their minds more and more to desire instruction. He says that
teachers </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>are like
householders</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who are not only careful
about their own food, but have a store laid up for the nourishment of others;
and who do not live at ease as to the passing day, but make provision for a
future and distant period. The meaning, therefore, is, that the teachers of the
Church ought to be prepared by long study for giving to the people, as out of a
storehouse, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f233</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> a
variety of instruction concerning the word of God, as the necessity of the case
may require. Many of the ancient expositors understand by <i>things new and old
</i>the Law and the Gospel; but this appears to me to be forced. I understand
them simply to mean a varied and manifold distribution, wisely and properly
adapted to the capacity of every individual.</font><br></div>

furiously and violently opposed, nor of those who haughtily despised his

sees Christ bestow a gracious reception on a woman who, in his opinion, ought
not to have been permitted to approach or to converse with him; and,
accordingly, disowns him as <i>a prophet, </i>because he does not acknowledge
him to be the Mediator, whose peculiar office it was to bring miserable sinners
into a state of reconciliation with God. It was something, no doubt, to bestow
on Christ the honor due to a prophet; but he ought also to have inquired for
what purpose he was sent, what he brought, and what commission he had received
from the Father. Overlooking the grace of reconciliation, which was the main
feature to be looked for in Christ, the Pharisee concluded that he was

that through the grace of Christ this woman had obtained the forgiveness of her

considering that Christ came to save what was lost, he rashly concludes that
Christ does not distinguish between the worthy and the unworthy. That we may not

to miserable and lost men,

from the natural meaning; for Luke intended to express the place which the woman
held in society, and the opinion universally entertained respecting her. Though
her sudden conversion had rendered her a different person in the sight of God
from what she had previously been, yet among men the disgrace attaching to her
former life had not yet been effaced. She was, therefore, in the general
estimation of men <i>a sinner, </i>that is, a woman of wicked and infamous life;
and this led <i>Simon </i>to conclude, though erroneously, that Christ had not
the Spirit of discernment, since he was unacquainted with that infamy which was
generally known.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f240</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>40.

egregiously Simon was mistaken. Exposing to public view his silent and concealed
thought, he proves himself to possess something more excellent than what
belonged to the <i>Prophets; </i>for he does not reply to his words, but refutes
the sentiment which he kept hidden within his breast. Nor was it only on
Simon&#8217;s account that this was done, but in order to assure every one of
us, that we have no reason to fear lest any sinner be rejected by him, who not
only gives them kind and friendly invitations, but is prepared with equal
liberality, and&#8212;as we might say&#8212;with outstretched arms, to receive
them all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>41.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A certain creditor had two
debtors</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The scope of this parable is to
demonstrate, that Simon is wrong in condemning the woman who is acquitted by the
heavenly judge. He proves that she is righteous, not because she pleased God,
but because <i>her </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sins were
forgiven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for otherwise her case would
not correspond to the parable, in which Christ expressly states, that the
creditor </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>freely forgave the
debtors who were not able to pay.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> We
</i>cannot avoid wondering, therefore, that the greater part of commentators
have fallen into so gross a blunder as to imagine that this woman, by her
<i>tears, </i>and her <i>anointing, </i>and her
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kissing his
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>deserved the pardon of her sins.
The argument which Christ employs was taken, not from the cause, but from the
effect; for, until a favor has been received, it cannot awaken gratitude, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f241</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and the
cause of reciprocal love is here declared to be a free forgiveness. In a word,
Christ argues from the fruits or effects that follow it, that this woman has
been reconciled to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>44.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And turning to the
woman.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Lord appears to compare Simon
with the woman, in such a manner as to make him chargeable with nothing more
than light offenses. But this is spoken only in the way of concession.
&#8220;Suppose now, Simon,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that the guilt from which God
discharges thee was light, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f242</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
that this woman has been guilty of many and very heinous offenses. Yet you see
how she proves by the effect that she has obtained pardon. For what mean those
profuse tears, those frequent kisses of the feet, that precious ointment? What
mean they but to acknowledge, that she had been weighed down by an enormous
burden of condemnation? And now she regards the mercy of God with fervor of love
proportioned to her conviction that her necessity had been
great.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From the words of Christ, therefore, we are not at
liberty to infer, that Simon had been a debtor to a small amount, or that he was
absolved from guilt. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f243</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is
more probable that, as he was a blind hypocrite, he was still plunged in the
filth of his sins. But Christ insists on this single point, that, however wicked
the woman may have been, she gave undoubted proofs of her righteousness, by
leaving no kind of duty undone to testify her gratitude, and by acknowledging,
in every possible way, her vast obligations to God. At the same time, Christ
reminds Simon, that he has no right to flatter himself, as if he were free from
all blame; for that he too needed mercy; and that if even he does not obtain the
favor of God without pardon, he ought to look upon this woman&#8217;s gifts,
whatever might have been her former sins, as evidences of repentance and
gratitude.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must attend to the points of contrast, in which
the woman is preferred to Simon. She
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>moistened his feet with tears,
and wiped them with the hairs of her head;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">while <i>he </i>did not even order <i>water
</i>to be given, according to custom. She
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>did not cease to kiss his
feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>while <i>he </i>did not deign to
receive Christ with the kiss of hospitality. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f244</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> <i>She
</i>poured precious</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> ointment on
his feet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>while <i>he </i>did not even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>anoint his head with
oil.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But why did our Lord, who was a
model of frugality and economy, permit the expense of the <i>ointment? </i>It
was because, in this way, the wretched sinner testified that she owed all to
him. He had no desire of such luxuries, was not gratified by the sweet odor, and
did not approve of gaudy dress. But he looked only at her extraordinary zeal to
testify her repentance, which is also held out to us by Luke as an example; for
her sorrow, which is the commencement of repentance, was proved by her tears. By
placing herself </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at Christ&#8217;s
feet behind him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and there lying on the
ground, she discovered her modesty and humility. By the <i>ointment, </i>she
declared that she offered, as a sacrifice to Christ, herself and all that she
possessed. Every one of these things it is our duty to imitate; but the pouring

differently, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>may her many sins be

meaning:&#8212; &#8220;As this woman evinces by remarkable actions, that she is
full of ardent love to Christ, it would be improper for the Church to act
harshly and severely towards her; but, on the contrary, she ought to be treated

But as

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajfei~ntai</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>we must dispense with that subtlety of exposition which is disapproved by
the context; for a little after, Christ uses the same words in his address to
the woman, where the imperative mood would not apply. Here, too is added a
corresponding clause, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he to
whom less is forgiven loveth
less</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The verb, which is in the present tense, must, no
doubt, be resolved into a preterite. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f246</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> From
the eager desire which she had manifested to discharge all the duties of piety,
Christ infers that, although this woman might have been guilty of many sins, the
mercy of God was so abundant towards her, that she ought no longer to be
regarded as a sinner. Again, <i>loving </i>is not here said to be the cause of
pardon, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f247</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but a
subsequent manifestation, as I have formerly mentioned; for the meaning of the
words is this:&#8212;&#8220;They who perceive the display of deep piety in the
woman form an erroneous judgment, if they do not conclude that God is already
reconciled to her;&#8221; so that the free pardon of sins comes first in order.
Christ does not inquire at what price men may purchase the favor of God, but
argues that God has already forgiven this wretched sinner, and that, therefore,
a mortal man ought not to treat her with severity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>48.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy sins are
forgiven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It may be asked, why does
Christ now promise to her the pardon which she had obtained, and of which she
had been assured? Some reply that these words were uttered, not so much on her
own account, as for the sake of others. For my own part, I have no doubt that it
was chiefly on her own account; and this appears more clearly from the words
that follow. Nor ought we to wonder, that the voice of Christ again pronounces
an absolution of the woman, who had already tasted his grace, and who was even
convinced that he was her only refuge of salvation. Thus, at the present day,
faith is previously necessary, when we pray that the Lord would forgive our
sins; and yet this is not a useless or superfluous prayer, but the object of it
is, that the heavenly Judge may more and more seal his mercy on our hearts, and
in this manner may give us peace. Though this woman had brought with her a
confident reliance on that grace which she had obtained, yet this promise was
not superfluous, but contributed greatly to the confirmation of her
faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>49.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And those who sat at table
with him began to say within themselves.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Hence we again learn, that ignorance of Christ&#8217;s office constantly
leads men to conceive new grounds of offense. The root of the evil is, that no
one examines his own wretched condition, which undoubtedly would arouse every
man to seek a remedy. There is no reason to wonder that hypocrites, who slumber
amidst their vices, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f248</font></sup><font face="Palatino">should
murmur at it as a thing new and unexpected, when Christ forgives
sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>50.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy faith hath saved
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To repress those murmurings, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f249</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and, at
the same time, to confirm the woman, Christ commends her faith. Let others
grumble as they may, but do thou adhere steadfastly to that faith which has
brought thee an undoubted salvation. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f250</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> At the
same time, Christ claims for himself the authority which had been given to him
by the Father; for, as he possesses the power of healing, to him faith is
properly directed. And this intimates that the woman was not led by rashness or
mistake to come to him, but that, through the guidance of the Spirit, she had
preserved the straight road of faith. Hence it follows, that we cannot believe
in any other than the Son of God, without considering that person to have the
disposal of life and death. If the true reason for believing in Christ be, that
God hath given him authority to forgive sins, whenever faith is rendered to
another, that honor which is due to Christ must of necessity be taken from him.
This saying refutes also the error of those who imagine that the forgiveness of
sins is purchased by charity; for Christ lays down a quite different method,
which is, that we embrace by faith the offered mercy. The last clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go in
peace,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>denotes that inestimable fruit of
faith which is so frequently commended in Scripture. It brings <i>peace </i>and
joy to the consciences, and prevents them from being driven hither and thither
by uneasiness and alarm.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>38.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it happened that he
entered into a certain village.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This
narrative shows, that Christ, wherever he came, did not devote himself to his
private concerns, or consult his own ease or comfort; but that the single object
which he kept in view was, to do good to others, and to discharge the office
which had been committed to him by the Father. Luke relates that, having been
hospitably received by Martha, as soon as he entered the house, he began to
teach and exhort. As this passage has been basely distorted into the
commendation of what is called a Contemplative life, we must inquire into its
true meaning, from which it will appear, that nothing was farther from the
design of Christ, than to encourage his disciples to indulge in indolence, or in
useless speculations. It is, no doubt, an old error 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f251</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, that
those who withdraw from business, and devote themselves entirely to a
contemplative, lead an Angelical life. For the absurdities which the
<i>Sorbonnists </i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f252</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>utter on this subject they appear to have been indebted to Aristotle, who
places the highest good, and ultimate end, of human life in contemplation,
which, according to him, is the enjoyment of virtue. When some men were driven
by ambition to withdraw from the ordinary intercourse of life, or when peevish
men gave themselves up to solitude and indolence, the resolution to adopt that
course was followed by such pride, that they imagined themselves to be like the
angels, because they did nothing; for they entertained as great a contempt for
active life, as if it had kept them back from heaven. On the contrary, we know
that men were created for the express purpose of being employed in labor of
various kinds, and that no sacrifice is more pleasing to God, than when every
man applies diligently to his own calling, and endeavors to live in such a
manner as to contribute to the general advantage. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f253</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How absurdly they have perverted the words of Christ
to support their own contrivance, will appear manifest when we have ascertained
the natural meaning. Luke says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mary sat at the feet of
Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Does he mean that she did nothing
else throughout her whole life? On the contrary, the Lord enjoins his followers
to make such a distribution of their time, that he who desires to make
proficiency in the school of Christ shall not always be an idle hearer but shall
put in practice what he has learned; for there is a time to hear, and a time to
act.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f254</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is, therefore, a foolish attempt of the monks to take hold of this passage,
as if Christ were drawing a comparison between a contemplative and an active
life, while Christ simply informs us for what end, and in what manner, he wishes
to be received.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though the hospitality of Martha deserved
commendation, and is commended, yet there were two faults in it which are
pointed out by Christ. The first is, that Martha carried her activity beyond
proper bounds; for Christ would rather have chosen to be entertained in a frugal
manner, and at moderate expense, than that the holy woman should have submitted
to so much toil. The second fault was, that Martha, by distracting her
attention, and undertaking more labor than was necessary, deprived herself of
the advantage of Christ&#8217;s visit. The excess is pointed out by Luke, when
he speaks of <i>much serving; </i>for Christ was satisfied with little. It was
just as if one were to give a magnificent reception to a prophet, and yet not to
care about hearing him, but, on the contrary, to make so great and unnecessary
preparations as to bury all the instruction. But the true way of receiving
prophets is, to accept the advantage which God presents and offers to us through
their agency.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that the kind attention of Martha, though
it deserved praise, was not without its blemishes. There was this additional
evil, that Martha was so delighted with her own bustling operations, as to
despise her sister&#8217;s pious eagerness to receive instruction. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f255</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
example warns us, that, in doing what is right, we must take care not to think
more highly of ourselves than of others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>42.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But one thing is
necessary.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some give a very meager
interpretation of these words, as if they meant that one sort of dish is enough.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f256</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Others
make ingenious inquiries, but beside the purpose, about Unity. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f257</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
Christ had quite another design, which was, that whatever believers may
undertake to do, and in whatever employments they may engage, there is one
object to which every thing ought to be referred. In a word, we do but wander to
no purpose, if we do not direct all our actions to a fixed object. The
hospitality of Martha was faulty in this respect, that she neglected the main
business, and devoted herself entirely to household affairs. And yet Christ does
not mean that every thing else, with the exception of this <i>one thing, </i>is
of no importance, but that we must pay a proper attention to order, lest what is
<i>accessory&#8212;as </i>the phrase is&#8212;become our chief
concern.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mary hath chosen the good
part.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is no comparison here, as
unskillful and mistaken interpreters dream. Christ only declares, that Mary is
engaged in a holy and profitable employment, in which she ought not to be
disturbed. &#8220;You would have a good right,&#8221; he says, &#8220;to blame
your sister, if she indulged in ease, or gave herself up to trifling
occupations, or aimed at something unsuitable to her station, and left to you
the whole charge of the household affairs. But now, when she is properly and
usefully employed in hearing, it would be an act of injustice to withdraw her
from it; for an opportunity so favorable is not always in her power.&#8221;
There are some, indeed, who give a different interpretation to the latter
clause, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which shall not be taken
away from her,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as if Christ intended to
say, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mary hath chosen the
good part</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because the fruit of heavenly
doctrine can never perish. For my own part, I have no objection to that opinion,
but have followed the view which appeared to me to be more in accordance with
Christ&#8217;s design.

undertake the office of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dividing
an inheritance,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>refuses to do so. Now as
this tended to promote brotherly harmony, and as Christ&#8217;s office was, not
only to reconcile men to God, but to bring them into a state of agreement with
one another, what hindered him from settling the dispute between the two
brothers? 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f263</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There
appear to have been chiefly two reasons why he declined the office of <i>a
judge. </i>First, as the Jews imagined that the Messiah would have an earthly
kingdom, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f264</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
wished to guard against doing any thing that might countenance this error. If
they had seen him divide <i>inheritances, </i>the report of that proceeding
would immediately have been circulated. Many would have been led to expect a
carnal redemption, which they too ardently desired; and wicked men would have
loudly declared, that he was effecting a revolution in the state, and
overturning the Roman Empire. Nothing could be more appropriate, therefore, than
this reply, by which all would be informed, that the kingdom of Christ is
spiritual. Let us learn from this to regulate our conduct by prudence, and to
undertake nothing which may admit of an unfavorable
construction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Secondly, our Lord intended to draw a distinction
between the political kingdoms of this world and the government of his Church;
for he had been appointed by the Father to be a Teacher, who
should</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">divide asunder, by the

of the Pope and his clergy, who, while they give themselves out to be pastors of
the Church, have dared to usurp an earthly and secular jurisdiction, which is
inconsistent with their office; for what is in itself lawful may be improper in
certain persons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There was also in my opinion, a third reason of great
weight. Christ saw that this man was neglecting doctrine, and was looking only
to his private concerns. This is too common a disease. Many who profess the
Gospel do not scruple to make use of it as a false pretense for advancing their
private interests, and to plead the authority of Christ as an apology for their
gains. From the exhortations 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f265</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which
is immediately added, we may readily draw this inference; for if that man had
not availed himself of the Gospel as a pretext for his own emolument, Christ
would not have taken occasion to give this warning against
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covetousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>The context, therefore, makes it sufficiently evident, that this was a
pretended disciple, whose mind was entirely occupied with lands or
money.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is highly absurd in the Anabaptists to infer from
this reply, that no Christian man has a right to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>divide
inheritances</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to take a part in legal
decisions, or to discharge any public office. Christ does not argue from the
nature of the thing itself, but from his own calling. Having been appointed by
the Father for a different purpose, he declares that he is not a <i>judge,
</i>because he has received no such command. Let us hold by this rule, that
every one keep within the limits of the calling which God has given
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take heed and beware of
covetousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ first guards his
followers against <i>covetousness, </i>and next, in order to cure their minds
entirely of this disease, he declares, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>our life consisteth not in
abundance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These words point out the
inward fountain and source, from which flows the mad eagerness for gain. It is
because the general belief is, that a man is happy in proportion as he possesses
much, and that the happiness of life is produced by riches. Hence arise those
immoderate desires, which, like a fiery furnace, send forth their flames, and
yet cease not to burn within. If we were convinced that riches, and any kind of
<i>abundance, </i>are evils of the present life, which the Lord bestows upon us
with his own hand, and the use of which is accompanied by his blessing, this
single consideration would have a powerful influence in restraining all wicked
desires; and this is what believers have come to learn from their own
experience. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f266</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
whence comes it, that they moderate their wishes, and depend on God alone, but
because they do not look upon their life as necessarily connected with
<i>abundance, </i>or dependent upon it, but rely on the providence of God, who
alone upholds us by his power, and supplies us with whatever is
necessary?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he spoke a parable to
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This parable presents to us, as in
a mirror, a lively portrait of this sentiment, that men
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do not live by their
abundance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Since the life even of the
richest men is taken away in a moment, what avails it that they have accumulated
great wealth? All acknowledge it to be true, so that Christ says nothing here
but what is perfectly common, and what every man has constantly in his mouth.
But where is the man that honestly believes it? Do not all, on the contrary,
regulate their life, and arrange their schemes and employments in such a manner
as to withdraw to the greatest distance from God,<i> </i>making their life to
rest on a present abundance of good things? It is therefore necessary that all
should immediately arouse themselves, lest, by imagining their happiness to
consist in riches, they entangle themselves in the snares of
<i>covetousness.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This parable shows us, first, that the present life
is short and transitory. Secondly, it points out to us, that riches are of no
avail for prolonging life. We must add a third, which is not expressed, but may
easily be inferred from the other two; that it is a most excellent remedy for
believers, to ask from the Lord their daily bread, and to rely on his providence
alone, whether they are rich or poor.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f267</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and,
next, because they are intoxicated with a foolish confidence which makes them
forget themselves. Thus we find that this <i>rich man </i>lengthens out his
expectation of life in proportion to his large income, and drives far away from
him the remembrance of death. And yet this pride is accompanied by distrust; for
those men, when they have had their fill, are still agitated by insatiable
desire, like this </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rich

man for acting the part of a careful householder in storing up his produce, but
because his ravenous desire, like a deep whirlpool, swallows up and devours many
<i>barns; </i>from which it follows that he does not comprehend the proper use

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So is he that layeth up for

contrasted, the one must be taken into account for the exposition of the other.
Let us ascertain, therefore, what is meant by being <i>rich in God, </i>or,
&#8220;towards God&#8221; or, &#8220;with respect to God.&#8221; Those who are
tolerably acquainted with the Scriptures know that the preposition
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv</font><font face="Palatino">
not unfrequently takes the sense of
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn</font><font face="Palatino">.
But whether it be understood in the one sense or in the other, is of little
consequence; for the meaning comes to this, that they are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rich according to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who do not trust to earthly things,
but depend solely on his providence. It matters not whether they are in
abundance or in want, provided that both classes present their sincere prayers
to the Lord for their daily bread. The corresponding phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>layeth up for
himself,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>conveys the idea that this man
paid no attention to the blessing of God, but anxiously heaped up an immense
store, so that his confidence was shut up in his <i>barns.</i>  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f272</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Hence we may easily conclude that the parable was intended to show, that
vain are the deliberations and foolish attempts of those who, trusting to the
abundance of their wealth, do not rely on God alone, and are not satisfied with
their own share, or prepared for whatever may befall them;

etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage is highly useful, were
it for no other reason than that this disease is almost natural to us, to be too
rigorous and severe in judging of others, and too much disposed to flatter our
own faults. The consequence is, that we not only censure with excessive severity
the offenses of our brethren; but whenever they meet with any calamity, we
condemn them as wicked and reprobate persons. On the other hand, every man that
is not sorely pressed by the hand of God slumbers at ease in the midst of his
sins, as if God were favorable and reconciled to him. This involves a double
fault; for when God chastises any one before our eyes, he warns us of his
judgments, that each of us may examine himself, and consider what he deserves.
If he spares us for a time, we are so far from having a right to take such
kindness and forbearance as an opportunity for slumber, that we ought to regard
it as an invitation to repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To correct the false and cruel judgment which we are
accustomed to pass on wretched sufferers, and, at the same time, to shake off
the indulgence which every man cherishes towards himself, he shows, first, that
those who are treated with severity are not the most wicked of all men; because
God administers his judgments in such a manner, that some are instantly seized
and punished, and others are permitted to remain long in the enjoyment of ease
and luxury, Secondly, he declares that all the calamities which happen in the
world are so many demonstrations of the wrath of God; and hence we learn what an
awful destruction awaits us, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f277</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> if we
do not avert it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The immediate occasion for this exhortation was, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>some told him that Pilate had
mingled human blood with sacrifices,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in
order that so shocking an event might bring <i>sacrifices </i>into abhorrence.
As it is probable that this outrage was committed on the Samaritans, who had
departed from the pure service of the Law, the Jews would easily and readily be
disposed to condemn the Samaritans, and by so doing to applaud themselves. But
our Lord applies it to a different purpose. As that whole nation was hated and
detested by them on account of ungodliness, he puts the question, &#8220;Do you
imagine that those wretched persons, who have been put to death by Pilate, were
worse than others? You are perfectly aware, that that country is full of ungodly
men, and that many who deserved the same punishment are still alive. He is a
blind and wicked judge who decides as to the sins of all men by the punishments
which they now endure. It is not always the most wicked man who is first dragged
to punishment; but when God selects a few out of a large number to be punished,
he holds out in their person a threatening that he will take vengeance on the
remainder, in order that all may be alarmed.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having spoken of the Samaritans, he now approaches
more closely to the Jews
themselves</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>. Eighteen
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>had at that time been killed by the
fall of a <i>tower </i>in Jerusalem. He declares that those men were not more
wicked than others, but that their death was held out to all as a ground of
alarm; for if in them God gave a display of his judgment, no more would others,
though they might be spared for a time, escape his hand. Christ does not,
however, forbid believers to consider attentively the judgments of God, but
enjoins them to observe this order, to begin with their own sins. They will thus
obtain the highest advantage; for they will avert God&#8217;s chastisements by
voluntary repentance. To the same purpose is the warning which Paul
gives,</font><br></div>

parable.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The substance of it is, that
many are endured for a time who deserve to be cut off; but that they gain
nothing by the delay, if they persist in their obstinacy. The wicked flattery,
by which hypocrites are hardened, and become more obstinate, arises from this
cause, that they do not think of their sins till they are compelled; and,
therefore, so long as God winks at these, and delays his chastisements, they
imagine that he is well satisfied with them. Thus they indulge themselves more
freely, as if, to use the words of Isaiah, (28:15,) they <i>had made a covenant
with death, and were in friendship with the grave. </i>And this is the reason
why Paul denounces them in such earnestness of language for</font><br></div>

not because their owners find them to be useful and productive, but because the
careful and industrious husbandman makes every possible trial and experiment
before he determines to remove them out of the field or vineyard. This teaches
us that, when the Lord does not immediately take vengeance on the reprobate, but
delays to punish them, there are the best reasons for his forbearance. Such
considerations serve to restrain human rashness, that no man may dare to murmur
against the supreme Judge of all, if He does not always execute his judgments in
one uniform manner. A comparison is here drawn between the

events which are detailed by Luke alone, without a direct reference to dates;
for on that point, as we have formerly mentioned, the Evangelists did not care
much about exactness. We shall afterwards find a more suitable time for
returning to the <i>Harmony of the Three Evangelists.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.

performed on a woman who was cured, and the offense which the malignity of the
Jews led them to take up, because our Lord had cured her on a
<i>Sabbath</i>-day<i>. </i>Luke says that the <i>woman </i>was held by a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit of
infirmity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>so that her body was bent by
the contraction of her nerves. As the nature of the disease is no farther
described, it is probable that it was not one of an ordinary kind, or which was
understood by physicians; and, therefore, he calls it a spirit of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>infirmity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>We know that diseases of an unusual and extraordinary kind are, for the most
part, inflicted on men through the agency of the devil; and this gave the more
striking display of the divine power of Christ, which triumphed over Satan. Not
that Satan rules over men according to his pleasure, but only so far as God
grants to him permission to injure them. Besides, as the Lord, from whom alone
all our blessings flow, makes his glory to shine with peculiar brightness in
those blessings which are more remarkable, and of rare occurrence; so, on the
other hand, it is his will that the power and tyranny of Satan should be chiefly
regarded in extraordinary chastisements, though his agency is likewise employed
in those more gentle applications of the rod, which we experience from day to
day.</font><br></div>

in others, Christ exhibited a proof both of his power and of his grace; for in
this manner he testified that he had come for the purpose of granting relief to
the wretched. His power is expressed in these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woman, thou art
delivered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for he authoritatively
declares that deliverance was at his own disposal, and employs, at the same
time, the outward sign, the use of which we have explained on a former
occasion.</font><br></div>

other days to seek a <i>cure, </i>as if the power of God lay asleep <i>on
Sabbath, </i>and were not rather exerted chiefly on that day for the salvation

give an opportunity to believers for entreating the Divine assistance? That
ungodly <i>hypocrite </i>talks as if the lawful observation of <i>the Sabbath

him, and took away from them all feeling of his kindness.</font><br></div>

stupidity might easily have been exposed in many ways, but Christ satisfied
himself with this single argument. If it be lawful <i>on the Sabbath, </i>to
perform the offices of humanity to cattle, it is ridiculous to imagine that the
due observance of it will prevent assistance from being granted to the children
of God. The words of Christ present a twofold comparison: that of the cattle
with the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>daughter of
Abraham,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and that of the halter by which
the <i>ass </i>or the <i>ox </i>is tied to <i>its stall </i>with the chains of
Satan, by which he holds men bound to their destruction. &#8220;You,&#8221; says

<div><font face="Palatino">Now though the wicked reprover was struck dumb with
shame, yet we perceive that Christ never performed any work, however
illustrious, which wicked men did not seize as an occasion for slander. Nor need
we wonder that Satan labored, with incessant zeal and exertions, to subvert the
glory of Christ; for he is constantly employed in spreading his clouds, in order

<div><font face="Palatino">It is difficult to ascertain the precise time when
this happened, farther than that Christ was at that time residing in Galilee, as
during the whole period of his public calling he remained longer there than in
any other place. Certain persons, wishing to be considered as his friends,
advise him that, if he wishes to be in safety, he should go beyond the
boundaries of Herod&#8217;s jurisdiction. In what manner those who gave that
advice were affected towards him we have no means of knowing; but I am strongly
inclined to conjecture, that they attempted to drive him to some other place,
because they saw that the greater part of the people in that place were attached
to Christ, so that the Gospel was generally received. We must observe who those
advisers were. Luke says that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>some of the
Pharisees</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now we know that that sect
was not so favorable to Christ as to make it probable that those men were
anxious about his life. What then? Their design was, to awaken in him such fears
as would drive him to some place of concealment; for they expected that, in a
short time, his authority would decline, and that his whole doctrine would
vanish away. But we must also direct our attention to the first originator and
contriver of this scheme, Satan; for, as he endeavored at that time to interrupt
the progress of the Gospel, by terrifying the Son of God, so he constantly
invents and hatches up new grounds of alarm, to strike the ministers of Christ
with dismay, and to constrain them to turn aside.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go, tell that

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fox</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and was as remarkable for servility as for cunning, I do not think that the
term,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fox</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>is intended to refer generally to the cunning of his whole life, but rather
to the insidious methods by which he labored to undermine the doctrine of the
Gospel, when he did not venture to attack it openly. Christ tells him that, with
all his craftiness, he will gain nothing by his schemes. &#8220;Whatever
artifices he may devise,&#8221; says Christ,

which God has enjoined upon me; and when I shall have reached the end of my
course, I shall then be offered in sacrifice.&#8221; That we may perceive more
clearly the meaning of the words, Christ acknowledges, in the former part of his
message, that on <i>the third </i>day&#8212;that is, within a very short
time&#8212;he must die; and in this way shows, that he could not be deterred
from his duty by any fear of death, to which he advanced boldly, with fixed

he sharply attacks the Pharisees. &#8220;Is it you, who&#8212;I

reproach against the ungodly inhabitants of the holy city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It usually
happened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that the prophets were slain

wisdom, should be polluted not by one or another murder,, but by a regular
butchery of the <i>prophets</i>! It undoubtedly shows how obstinate is the
rebellion of the world in rejecting sound doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The exclamation which immediately follows in Luke,
(13:34,) appears to be connected in such a manner, as if Christ had taken
occasion from the present occurrence to inveigh, at this time, against

<div><font face="Palatino">This narrative agrees in some respects, but not
entirely, with the doctrine laid down by Matthew, (10:1-20,) that Christ, in
order to correct the superstition of the people, and particularly of the
scribes, intentionally disregarded outward ceremonies of human invention, which
the Jews were too solicitous to observe. God had prescribed in his Law certain
kinds of <i>washings, </i>that by means of them he might train his people
usefully to the consideration of true purity. The Jews, not satisfied with this
moderate portion had added many other washings, and more especially, that no
person should partake of food till he had been washed with the water of
purification, as Mark relates more minutely, (12:3,4,) and as is also evident
from John, (2:6.) This fault was accompanied by wicked confidence; for they
cared little about the spiritual worship of God, and thought that they had
perfectly discharged their duty, when the figure was substituted in the place of
God. Christ is fully aware that his neglect of this ceremony will give offense,
but he declines to observe it, in order to show that God sets very little value
on outward cleanness, but demands the spiritual righteousness of the
heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>39.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now you
Pharisees</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Christ does not here charge
the <i>Pharisees, </i>as in Matthew, (15:1-20,) and Mark, (12:2-13,) with
serving God in an improper manner by human inventions, and breaking the law of
God for the sake of their traditions; but merely glances at their hypocrisy, in
having no desire of purity except before the eyes of men, as if they had not to
deal with God. Now this reproof applies to all hypocrites, even to those who
believe that righteousness consists in ceremonies appointed by God. Christ
includes more than if he had said, that it is in <i>vain to serve God by the
commandments of men,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;410707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
7:7;) for he condemns generally the error of worshipping God by ceremonies, and
not spiritually, by faith and a pure affection of the heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On this point the prophets had always contended
earnestly with the Jews; but, as the minds of men are strongly inclined to
hypocrisy, they proudly and obstinately adhered to the conviction, that God is
pleased with external worship, even when it is not accompanied by faith. But in
the time of Christ, they had sunk to such depth of folly, that they made
religion to consist entirely in absolute trifles. Accordingly, he directs his
accusation against the <i>Pharisees, </i>for being extremely careful to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wash
cups</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and cherishing
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>within their hearts the most
abominable filth of cruelty and wickedness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He charges them with folly on this ground, that God, who created
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that which is within the
man,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>his soul, as truly as the body,
cannot be satisfied with a mere external appearance. The chief reason why men
are deceived is, that they do not consider that they have to deal with God, or,
they transform Him according to the vanity of their senses, as if there were no
difference between Him and a mortal man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>41.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But out of what you have,
give alms.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ, according to his
custom, withdraws the Pharisees from ceremonies to charity, declaring that it is
not water, but liberality, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f284</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
cleanses both men and food. By these words he does not disparage the grace of
God, or reject the ceremonies of the Law as vain and useless; but addresses his
discourse to those who feel confident that God will be amused by mere signs.
&#8220;It is the lawful use alone,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that sanctifies food.
But food is rightly and properly used by those who supply from their abundance
the necessities of the poor. It would therefore be better
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to give alms out of what you
have</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>than to be careful about washing
hands and cups, and to neglect the poor.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The inference which the Papists draw from these
words, that <i>alms </i>are satisfactions, by which we are cleansed from our
sins, is too absurd to require a lengthened refutation. Christ does not here
inform us by what price we must purchase the forgiveness of sins, but says that
those persons eat their bread with cleanness, who bestow a part of it on the
poor. I understand the words,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ta&lt;
ejno&gt;nta</font><font face="Palatino">, to mean &#8220;the present
supply,&#8221;

not, as Erasmus and the old translator render them, &#8220;what remains
over.&#8221;  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f284b</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reproofs which immediately follow may be
reserved, with greater propriety, for another occasion. I do not think it
probable that Christ, while sitting at table, indulged in this continuous strain
of invective against <i>scribes and Pharisees, </i>but that Luke has introduced
here what was spoken at another time; for the Evangelists, as we have frequently
mentioned, paid little attention to the order of dates.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This narrative contains nothing more than a miracle
which Christ performed, in order to correct the superstitious observance of the
Sabbath. For he did not, intend, as some imagine, absolutely to abolish the
Sabbath, but only to point out, that neither the works of God, nor the duties of
charity, violate the holy rest which is enjoined by the law. Whether or not
those very persons had purposely brought the dropsical man to that place cannot
be known with certainty. He unquestionably could not be present at the table by
accident, nor break into a private dwelling without the permission and consent
of the owner. It is therefore probable, that he was placed there with the
concealed design of tempting Christ, which, on their part, was as foolish an
action as it was wicked; for they had already known by experience what Christ
was accustomed to do, whenever a similar occasion presented
itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is it lawful to cure on
Sabbath? </i></font><font face="Palatino">The meaning of this question is, ought
the <i>curing </i>of a man to be reckoned among the works which violate the
Sabbath? If they had said that the observance of the Sabbath is violated in this
way, the reply was obvious, that it is a work of God. Now the law of the Sabbath
goes no farther, than that men shall rest from their own works. Christ first
puts the question to them, and he does so for the purpose of guarding against
offense. It would not have been necessary for him to pacify them, if they had
not been instigated by hardened malice. Not that he always laid himself under
this restriction; for in many cases he did what had been enjoined on him by the
Father, without attending to the offense that might arise from it. But he
intended to show by this example, that he did not inconsiderately perform
miracles on Sabbath, because he was prepared to assign a reason for what he did.
They, on the other hand, make it evident by their silence, that their desire of
finding fault is stronger than their zeal for the law; and therefore Christ
treats with utter indifference their opinion about his action, because it was
evident that they intentionally sought out an occasion of
offense.</font><br></div>

that Christ should take pains to remove the offense, yet he shows that he did
nothing inconsistent with the observance of the Sabbath. And this he undoubtedly
does, not so much with the view of instructing them, as of protecting himself
against their slanders; for he knew that they were too much blinded by virulent
hatred to yield submissively, to argument, but wished to triumph over their
malice, by compelling them through shame to be silent. If we are at liberty to
relieve brute animals on Sabbath, it would be unreasonable that we should not
perform a similar office of kindness to man, who is formed after the image of
God.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he spoke a parable to
those who were invited. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We know to what an
extent ambition prevailed among the Pharisees and all the scribes. While they
desired to exercise a haughty dominion over all other men, the superiority among
themselves was likewise an object of emulation. It is constantly the case with
men who are desirous of empty applause, that they cherish envy towards each
other, every one endeavoring to draw to himself what others imagine to be due to
them. Thus the Pharisees and scribes, while they were all equally disposed, in
presence of the people, to glory in the title of holy order, are now disputing
among themselves about the degree of honor, because every one claims for himself
the highest place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This ambition of theirs Christ exposes to ridicule by
an appropriate parable. If any one sitting at another man&#8217;s table were to
occupy the highest place, and were afterwards compelled to give way to a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>more
honorable</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>person, it would not be
without shame and dishonor that he was ordered by the master of the feast to
take a different place. But the same thing must happen to all who proudly give
themselves out as superior to others; for God will bring upon them disgrace and
contempt. It must be observed, that Christ is not now speaking of outward and
civil modesty; for we often see that the haughtiest men excel in this respect,
and <i>civilly</i>, as the phrase is, profess great modesty. But by a comparison
taken from men, he describes what we ought to be inwardly before God.
&#8220;Were it to happen that a guest should foolishly take possession of the
highest place, and should, on that account, be put down to the lowest, he would
be so completely overpowered with shame as to wish that he had never gone
higher. Lest the same thing should happen to you, that God would punish your
arrogance with the deepest disgrace, resolve, of your own accord, to be humble
and modest.&#8221;</font><br></div>

that God will be their Judge, who

who desire to exalt themselves, as all who claim for themselves any merit must
of necessity make war with Him. It is a manifestation of pride to boast of the
gifts of God, as if there were any excellence in ourselves, that would exalt us
on the ground of our own merit. Humility, on the other hand, must be not only an
unfeigned abasement, but a real annihilation of ourselves, proceeding from a
thorough knowledge of our own weakness, the entire absence of lofty pretensions,
and a conviction that whatever excellence we possess comes from the grace of God
alone.</font><br></div>

dinner.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Those who think that this is an
absolute condemnation of entertainments given by relatives and friends to each
other, take away a part of civility from among men. It were not only unfeeling,
but barbarous, to exclude relatives from the hospitable table, and to class them
only with strangers. Christ did not intend to dissuade us from every thing
courteous, but merely to show, that acts of civility, which are customary among
men, are no proof whatever of charity. To perform any act, in the hope of a
reward, to rich men, from whom we expect a similar return, is not generosity,
but a system of commercial exchange; and, in like manner, kind offices, rendered
from mercenary views, are of no account in the sight of God, and do not deserve
to be ascribed to charity. If I entertain at supper my relatives or rich
friends, the act of civility ought not in itself to be condemned, but, as a
proof of charity, it will have no value whatever; for we frequently see that
persons who are extremely selfish grudge no expense or luxury in treating their
friends. What then? You may spread a table for the rich, but, at the same time,
you must not neglect the poor; you may feast with your friends and relatives,
but you must not shut out strangers, if they shall happen to be poor, and if you
shall have the means of relieving their wants. In a word, the meaning of the
passage is, that those who are kind to relatives and friends, but are niggardly
towards the poor, are entitled to no commend-ation; because they do not exercise
charity, but consult only their own gain or ambition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Christ addresses, in a particular manner, the person
who had invited him; because he perceived that he was too much addicted to pomp
and luxury, and was so desirous to obtain the applause and favor of the rich,
that he cared very little about the poor. Accordingly, in the person of one man,
this reproof is directed against all those who spend their wealth in ambitious
display, or who bargain for mutual compensation, but leave nothing over for the
poor, as if they were afraid that whatever is gratuitously bestowed would be
lost.</font><br></div>

expect a reward from God.</font><br></div>

this parable among other discourses which were delivered by Christ about the
time of the last Passover, yet as he does not specify any particular time, and
as <i>Luke </i>expressly affirms that Christ delivered this discourse
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>while he sat at table in the
house of a Pharisee,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have thought it
better to follow this order. The design which Matthew had in view was, to point
out the reasons why the scribes were excited to the highest pitch of fury; and
therefore he properly placed it in the midst of those discourses which were
hateful to them, and interwove it with those discourses, without attending to
the order of time. But we must attend to <i>Luke&#8217;s </i>narrative, who says
that, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when one of those who sat
at table with him said, Blessed is he that eateth bread in the kingdom of

derision; but, as persons who have a moderate knowledge of the faith, and are
not openly wicked, are in the habit of indulging, amidst their cups, in idle
talk about eternal life, I think that this man threw out a remark about future
blessedness, in order to draw out some observation in return from Christ. And
his words make it manifest, that he had nothing in view beyond what was gross
and earthly; for he did not employ the phrase, <i>eat bread, </i>as a metaphor
for </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>enjoy eternal
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but appears to have dreamed of I
know not what state, filled with prosperity and abundance of all things. The
meaning is, <i>Blessed shall they be who shall eat the bread of God,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f287</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>after that he has collected his children into <i>his
kingdom.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The kingdom of heaven is like
a human king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As it was long ago said by
a Spartan, that the Athenians knew what was right, but did not choose to
practice it; so Christ now brings it as a reproach against the Jews, that they
gave utterance to beautiful expressions about <i>the
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kingdom of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but, when God kindly and gently
invited them, they rejected his grace with disdain. There is no room to doubt
that the discourse is expressly levelled against the Jews, as will more plainly
appear a little afterwards.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Matthew </i>and <i>Luke </i>differ in this
respect, that <i>Matthew </i>details many circumstances, while <i>Luke
</i>states the matter summarily, and in a general manner. Thus, <i>Matthew
</i>says that <i>a </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>king made
a marriage for his son:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> Luke </i>only
mentions </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a great
supper</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The former speaks of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>many
servants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>while the latter refers to no
more than </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one
servant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>the former describes <i>many
</i>messages, the latter mentions <i>one </i>only; the former says that some of
the servants were <i>abused </i>or slain, the latter speaks only of their being
treated with contempt. Lastly, the former relates that a man was cast out, who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gone in to the marriage
without a wedding garment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>of which Luke
makes no mention. But we have formerly pointed out a similar distinction, that
<i>Matthew, </i>in explaining the same thing, is more copious, and enters into
fuller details. There is a remarkable agreement between them on the main points
of the parable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God bestowed on the Jews distinguished honor, by
providing for them, as it were, a hospitable table; but they despised the honor
which had been conferred upon them. The marriage of the king&#8217;s son is
explained by many commentators to mean, that <i>Christ is the end of the Law,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:4.) and that God had no other design in his covenant, than to make him the
Governor of his people, and to unite the Church to him by the sacred bond of a
spiritual marriage. I have no objection to that view. But when he says, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>servants were sent to call those
who were invited,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>these words are
intended to point out a double favor which the Jews had received from God;
first, in being preferred to other nations; and, secondly, in having their
adoption made known to them by the prophets. The allusion is to a practice
customary among men, that those who intended to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>make a
marriage</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>drew up a list of the persons
whom they intended to have as guests, and afterwards sent invitations to them by
their servants. In like manner, God elected the Jews in preference to others, as
if they had been his familiar friends, and afterwards
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called them
</i></font><font face="Palatino">by the prophets to partake of the promised
redemption, which was, as it were, to feast
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at a
marriage</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is true that those who were
first invited did not live till the coming of Christ; but we know that all
received an offer of the same salvation, of which they were deprived by their
ingratitude and malice; for from the commencement, God&#8217;s invitation was
impiously despised by that people. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f288</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Again he sent other
servants.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He speaks as if it had been
the same persons who were invited, for it was one body of the people. The
meaning is, that when the happy and joyful day of redemption drew near, they
were warned to be ready; for they had been long ago informed as to the time. But
now Christ told them that, at the very hour, fresh messengers were sent to
entreat them to come with haste; for the first invitation which he mentions
includes all the former prophecies, down to the publication of the Gospel. For a
long period, they exercised cruelty on the prophets; but their fury grew as the
time advanced, and at length spent all its force on Christ and the apostles. For
this reason, he charges the ancient people with nothing more than contempt and
pride, but says, that the servants who had been last sent, and who arrived at
the hour of supper, were <i>abused </i>or <i>slain. </i>That people arrived at
the highest pitch of their crimes, when their haughty rejection of his grace was
followed by the madness of cruelty. And yet he does not charge all of them
equally with crime; for even at the latest call, which was given by the Gospel,
the grace of God was in part ridiculed by careless despisers, and in part was
furiously rejected by hypocrites. And thus it usually happens, that ungodly men
break out into fiercer rage against God, in proportion to the earnestness with
which he invites them to salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now consider that part of doctrine which is
conveyed both by Matthew and by Luke.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One went to his field, and
another to his merchandise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>or, as Luke
expresses it, one pleaded that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
had married a wife</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>another that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>purchased a
field</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and another that he had <i>bought
five yoke of oxen. </i>By these words Christ pronounces the Jews to have been so
entirely devoted to the world and to earthly things, that no man found leisure
to approach to God; for the cares of this world, when we become entangled by
them, are so many impediments in our way to keep us back from the kingdom of
God. It is truly base and shameful, that men who were created for a heavenly
life, should be under the influence of such brutish stupidity, as to be entirely
carried away after transitory things. But this disease is universally prevalent;
so that hardly one person in a hundred can be found, who prefers the kingdom of
God to fading riches, or to any other kind of advantages. Though all are not
infected with the same disease, every man is led away by his desires; in
consequence of which, all are wandering in various directions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, it deserves our attention, that ungodly men
hold out fair pretences for rejecting the grace of God; as if their indolence
might be excused, because they are entirely occupied with the affairs of the
present life, and care little about a heavenly inheritance. But we see how
Christ takes from us all such excuses, that no man may imagine it to be of any
advantage for him to plead that he is detained by engagements of an earthly
nature. On the contrary, men commit a double fault, when they allow themselves
to be retarded by those things which are in themselves lawful, and which ought
rather to have aided their progress. For why does God allow us the conveniences
of the present life, but in order to draw us to himself? And yet so far is it
from being true, that all have earnest desires towards heaven, in proportion as
they are assisted by acts of the Divine kindness, that even holy marriage, and
fields, and other riches, are so many snares to bind every man more closely to
the earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But when the king heard
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This punishment is mentioned by
<i>Matthew </i>alone; for Luke makes no mention of any outrage committed on the
servants. Both concur in stating, that those who did not come at the appointed
time were shut out, and deprived of the honor of being present at the banquet.
But this doctrine applies equally to us; for the same destruction which Christ
denounces against the Jews awaits all the ungodly, who violently oppose the
ministers of the Gospel. Those who are so entirely occupied with earthly cares,
as to set no value on the divine invitation, will at length perish miserably in
famine and want; and therefore, whenever God calls us, let us be prepared and
ready to follow.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.
Go therefore to the highways.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Having
shown that they are unworthy of the grace of God who disdainfully reject it when
offered to them, he now says that their place is supplied by others, by the mean
and despised common people. And here is described the calling of the Gentiles,
which is to excite the Jews to jealousy, as we have it in the Song of
Moses;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">They have provoked me by

<div><font face="Palatino">Having been first elected, they imagined that the
grace of God was bound to them, as if God could not want them; and how haughtily
they despised all others is well known. Thus by way of admission, he compares
the Gentiles <i>to the poor, the blind, </i>and <i>the lame. </i>He says that
they are called from the <i>cross-roads, </i>and from the <i>streets, </i>as
strangers and unknown persons; but yet declares that they will occupy that place
which friends and domestics had treated with indifference. What the prophets had
obscurely foretold about creating a new church is now plainly expressed. This
dishonor was the completion of the divine vengeance on the Jews, when
God</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">cut them off, and
ingrafted wild branches into</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the
stock of the olive-tree,

<div><font face="Palatino">when he threw them off, and received the polluted and
filthy Gentiles into his house. But if at that time <i>he spared not the natural
branches,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:21,) the same punishment will this day be inflicted on us, if we do not
answer to his call. The supper which had been prepared for us will not be lost,
but God will invite other guests.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 14:23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Compel them to come
in.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This expression means, that the
master of the house would give orders to make use, as it were, of violence for
compelling the attendance of the poor, and to leave out none of the lowest dregs
of the people. By these words Christ declares that he would rake together all
the offscourings of the world, rather than he would ever admit such ungrateful
persons to his table. The allusion appears to be to the manner in which the
Gospel invites us; for the grace of God is not merely offered to us, but
doctrine is accompanied by exhortations fitted to arouse our minds. This is a
display of the astonishing goodness of God, who,<i> </i>after freely inviting
us, and perceiving that we give ourselves up to sleep, addresses our
slothfulness by earnest entreaties, and not only arouses us by exhortations, but
even <i>compels </i>us by threatenings to draw near to him. At the same time, I
do not disapprove of the use which Augustine frequently made of this passage
against the Donatists, to prove that godly princes may lawfully issue edicts,
for <i>compelling </i>obstinate and rebellious persons to worship the true God,
and to maintain the unity of the faith; for, though faith is voluntary, yet we
see that such methods are useful for subduing the obstinacy of those who will
not yield until they are compelled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 22:11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the king, having come in
to see the guests. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Here Christ does not
reproach the Jews<i> </i>with having wickedly despised the grace and calling of
God; but gives early warning to those who would be placed in their room, not to
pollute with their filth the holy marriage, when God shall bestow upon them
admission to his table. Hitherto he has taught that the Jews, on account of
their ungodly and disdainful conduct, would be deprived of the peculiar honor
and privilege which they had enjoyed; and that from among the irreligious and
abhorred Gentiles would men be called to occupy their place. But now he
threatens that, out of this very number, those who bring reproach upon the
Church will be expelled; for God invites all indiscriminately by the Gospel, and
thus many unholy and abominable persons creep in, who, though for a time they
are admitted along with others, yet, when God reviews the guests, will be thrown
out and dragged to punishment. The general truth conveyed is, that not all who
have once entered the Church will become partakers of everlasting life, but only
those who are found to wear the dress which befits the heavenly
palace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wedding
garment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is it faith, or is it a holy
life? This is a useless controversy; for faith cannot be separated from good
works, nor do good works proceed from any other source than from faith. But
Christ intended only to state, that the Lord calls us on the express condition
of our being renewed by the Spirit after his image; and that, in order to our
remaining permanently in his house, we must <i>put off the old man with his
pollutions,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:9;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:22,) and lead a new life, that the <i>garment </i>may correspond to so
honorable a calling. But a question arises, how comes it that a beggar is
punished so severely for not bringing a <i>wedding garment; </i>as if it were
unusual to see the wretched people, who beg their bread on the public roads,
wearing tattered and ugly clothes? I reply, the question is not as to the manner
in which the <i>garment </i>is to be procured; for whomsoever the Lord invites
he at the same time supplies with clothing, and in all of us is fulfilled what
Ezekiel says, (16:6-14,) that God finds nothing in us but wretchedness, and
nakedness, and abominable filth, but adorns us with magnificent attire. We know
also, that there is no other way in which we are formed anew after the image of
God, but by <i>putting on Christ,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:14;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480327&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:27.) It is not, therefore, the declaration of Christ, that the sentence of
<i>casting them into outer darkness </i>will be executed on wretched men who did
not bring a costly <i>garment </i>taken from their own wardrobe, but on those
who shall be found in their pollution, when God shall come to make a scrutiny of
his guests.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>few are
chosen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>though
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>many are
called</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>from which we infer, that we
ought not to attempt an ingenious explanation of every minute clause. But
lately, Christ did not threaten that the greater part would be thrown out, but
mentioned one man only; and now we learn from him, that out of a large number
few will be retained. And certainly, though in the present day a more numerous
body of men is collected into the Church by the Gospel than was formerly
collected by the Law, it is but a small portion of them whose faith is evinced
by newness of life. Let us not flatter ourselves with the empty title of faith,
but let every man seriously examine himself, that at the final review he may be
pronounced to be one of the lawful guests; for, as Paul reminds us, that <i>the
vessels </i>in the Lord&#8217;s house are not all of the same kind,

<div><font face="Palatino">The leading object of this parable is, to show that
we ought to deal kindly and generously with our neighbors; that, when we come to
the judgment seat of God, we may reap the fruit of our liberality. Though the
parable appears to be harsh and far-fetched, yet the conclusion makes it
evident, that the design of Christ was nothing else than what I have stated. And
hence we see, that to inquire with great exactness into every minute part of a
parable is an absurd mode of philosophizing. Christ does not advise us to
purchase by large donations the forgiveness of fraud, and of extortion, and of
wasteful expenditure, and of the other crimes associated with unfaithful
administration. But as all the blessings which God confers upon us are committed
by Him to our administration, our Lord now lays down a method of procedure,
which will protect us against being treated with rigor, when we come to render
our account.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They who imagine that alms are a sufficient
compensation for sensuality and debauchery, do not sufficiently consider, that
the first injunction given us is, to live in sobriety and temperance; and that
the next is, that the streams which flow to us come from a pure fountain. It is
certain that no man is so frugal, as not sometimes to waste the property which
has been entrusted to him; and that even those who practice the most rigid
economy are not entirely free from the charge of unfaithful <i>stewardship.
</i>Add to this, that there are so many ways of abusing the gifts of God, that
some incur guilt in one way, and some in another. I do not even deny, that the
very consciousness of our own faulty <i>stewardship </i>ought to be felt by us
as an additional excitement to kind actions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we ought to have quite another object in view,
than to escape the judgment of God by paying a price for our redemption; and
that object is, first, that seasonable and well-judged liberality may have the
effect of restraining and moderating unnecessary expenses; and, secondly, that
our kindness to our brethren may draw down upon us the mercy of God. It is very
far from being the intention of Christ to point out to his disciples a way of
escape, when the heavenly Judge shall require them to give their account; but he
warns them to lose no time in guarding against the punishment which will await
their cruelty, if they are found to have swallowed up the gifts of God, and to
have paid no attention to acts of
beneficence.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f293</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

act absurdly. To make donations out of what belongs to another man, is an action
which is very far from deserving applause; and who would patiently endure that
an unprincipled villain should rob him of his property, and give it away
according to his own fancy? It were indeed the grossest stupidity, if that man
who beheld a portion of his substance taken away, should
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commend</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

Christ only meant what he adds a little afterwards, that ungodly and worldly men
are more industrious and skillful in conducting the affairs of this fading life,
than the children of God are anxious to obtain the heavenly and eternal life, or
careful to make it the subject of their study and meditation.</font><br></div>

does not intend to compare the wisdom of the Spirit to the wisdom of the flesh,
(which could not have been done without pouring contempt on God himself,) but
only to arouse believers to consider more attentively what belongs to the future
life, and not to shut their eyes against the light of the Gospel, when they

the depravity of men does not prevent the Lord from placing on his records all
that we have expended on the poor. The Lord looks not to the persons, but to the
work itself, so that our liberality, though it may happen to be exercised
towards ungrateful men, will be of avail to us in the sight of God. But then he
appears to intimate that eternal life depends on our merits. I reply: it is
sufficiently plain from the context that he speaks after the manner of men. One
who possesses extensive influence or wealth, if he procure friends during his
prosperity, has persons who will support him when he is visited by adversity. In
like manner, our kindness to the poor will be a seasonable relief to us; for
whatever any man may have generously bestowed on his neighbors the Lord
acknowledges as if it had been done to himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When you
fail.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this word he expresses the time
of death, and reminds us that the time of our administration will be short, lest
the confident expectation of a longer continuance of life should make us take a
firmer grasp. The greater part are sunk in slumber through their wealth; many
squander what they have on superfluities; while the niggardliness of others
keeps it back, and deprives both themselves and others of the benefit. Whence
comes all this, but because they are led astray by an unfounded expectation of
long life, and give themselves up to every kind of indulgence?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of the mammon of
unrighteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By giving this name to
riches, he intends to render them an object of our suspicion, because for the
most part they involve their possessors in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unrighteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Though in themselves they are not evil, yet as it rarely happens that they
are obtained without deceit, or violence, or some other unlawful expedient, or
that the enjoyment of them is unaccompanied by pride, or luxury, or some other
wicked disposition, Christ justly represents them as worthy of our suspicion;
just as on another occasion he called them <i>thorns,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:7,22.) It would appear that a contrast, though not expressed, is intended to
be supplied, to this effect; that riches, which otherwise, in consequence of
wicked abuse, polluted their possessors, and are almost in every ease
allurements of sin, ought to be directed to a contrary object, to be the means
of procuring favor for us. Let us also remember what I have formerly stated,
that God does not demand sacrifice to be made from booty unjustly acquired, as
if he were the partner of thieves, and that it is rather a warning given to
believers to keep themselves free from

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He who is faithful in that
which is least.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Those maxims are
proverbs taken from ordinary practice and experience, and it is quite enough if
they are generally true. It will sometimes happen, no doubt, that a deceiver,
who had disregarded a small gain, shall display his wickedness in a matter of
importance. Nay, many persons, by affecting honesty in trifling matters, are
only in pursuit of an enormous gain; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f294</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as that
author  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f295</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
says: &#8220;Fraud establishes confidence in itself in small matters, that, when
a fit opportunity shall arrive, it may deceive with vast advantage.&#8221; And
yet the statement of Christ is not inaccurate; for in proverbs, as I have
mentioned, we attend only to what usually happens.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Christ, therefore, exhorts his disciples to act
faithfully in small matters, in order to prepare themselves for the exercise of
fidelity in matters of the highest importance. He next applies this doctrine to
the proper <i>stewardship </i>of spiritual graces, which the world, indeed, does
not estimate according to their value, but which far surpass, beyond all
question, the fading riches of this world. Those persons, he tells us, who act
improperly and unfaithfully in things of small value, such as the transitory
riches of the world, do not deserve that God should entrust to them the
inestimable treasure of the Gospel, and of similar gifts. There is, therefore,
in these words an implied threatening, that there is reason to fear lest, on
account of our abuse of an earthly <i>stewardship, </i>we fail to obtain
heavenly gifts. In this sense, <i>what is true </i>is contrasted with <i>riches,
</i>as what is solid and lasting is contrasted with what is shadowy and fading.

the expression, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what belongs to
another,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he means what is not within
man; for God does not bestow riches upon us on condition that we shall be
attached to them, but makes us
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stewards</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of them in such a manner, that they may not bind us with their chains. And,
indeed, it is impossible that our minds should be free and disengaged for
dwelling in heaven, if we did not look upon every thing that is in the world as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>belonging to
another</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who shall entrust to you what is
your own?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Spiritual riches, on the other
hand, which relate to a future life, are pronounced by him to be <i>our own,
</i>because the enjoyment of them is everlasting. But now he employs a different
comparison. There is no reason, he tells us, to expect that we shall make a
proper and moderate use of <i>our own </i>property, if we have acted improperly
or unfaithfully in </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>what belonged
to another.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Men usually care less about
abusing, and allow themselves greater liberty in squandering, <i>their own

them; but when a thing has been entrusted to them either in charge or in loan,
and of which they must afterwards render an account, they are more cautious and
more timid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We thus ascertain Christ&#8217;s meaning to be, that
they who are bad <i>stewards </i>of earthly blessings would not be faithful
guardians of spiritual gifts. He next introduces a sentence:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You cannot serve God and

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f298</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> do not
sufficiently comprehend what Luke means. Haughty and disdainful men, I do
acknowledge, view the doctrine of the Gospel with contempt; but Luke expressly
declares the reason why Christ was the object of their derision to have been,
that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>were
covetous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Entertaining a firm and
deep-seated conviction that the rich are happy, and that there is nothing better

guard whatever they have acquired, they reject as foolish paradoxes  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f299</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> all the
sayings of Christ which had a contrary tendency. And, certainly, any one that
speaks of despising riches, or bestowing alms on the poor, is regarded by the
<i>covetous </i>as a madman. Horace&#8217;s words on this subject are well
known:  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f300</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;The people hiss at me, but I am well satisfied with myself.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f301</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But if,
even when they are condemned by universal opinion, they continue to flatter
themselves, how much more will they ridicule as a fable that philosophy of
Christ which is far removed from the ordinary belief?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some other pretense, I have no doubt, was held out by
the Pharisees for ridiculing and evading a doctrine which opposed their vice.
But we must attend to the motive by which they were actuated; for it is a
disease which almost always prevails in the world, that the greater part of men
affect to despise whatever does not fall in with their corrupt morals. Hence the
ridicule, and jest, and merriment, with which the word of God is frequently
assailed; for every man fights in defense of his own vices, and all imagine that
their witticisms will serve for a cloud to screen their
criminality.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is you that justify
yourselves before men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We see that
Christ does not give way to their disdainful conduct, but constantly maintains
the authority of his doctrine in opposition to their mockery; and it is the duty
of all the ministers of the Gospel to pursue the same course, by meeting ungodly
despisers with the dreadful. judgment of God. He declares that the hypocrisy,
with which they deceive the eyes of men, will be of no avail to them at the
judgment-seat of God. They were unwilling to have it thought that their mockery
was intended as a defense of their <i>covetousness. </i>But Christ affirms that
this venom breaks out from a concealed ulcer; just as if one were to tell the
mitred prelates of our own day, that their hostility to the Gospel arises from
the severity with which it attacks their hidden vices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But God knoweth your
hearts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He says that they reckon it
enough if they appear to be good in the eyes of men, and if they can boast of a
pretended sanctity; but that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God,
who knoweth the hearts,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is well
acquainted with the vices which they conceal from the view of the world. And
here we must attend to the distinction between the judgments of God and the
judgments of men; for men bestow approbation on outward appearances, but at the
judgment-seat of God nothing is approved but an upright heart. There is added a
striking observation:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What is highly esteemed by men is
abomination in the sight of God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Not
that God rejects those virtues, the approbation of which He hath engraved on the
hearts of men; but that God detests whatever men are disposed, of their own
accord, to applaud. Hence it is evident in what light we ought to view all
pretended acts of worship which the world contrives according to its own fancy.
How much soever they may please their inventors, Christ pronounces that they are
not only vain and worthless, but are even detestable.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Though Luke introduces some things between them,
there can be no doubt that this example was intended by Christ to confirm the
discourse which we have last examined. He points out what condition awaits those
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f303</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who
neglect the care of the poor, and indulge in all manner of gluttony; who give
themselves up to drunkenness and other pleasures, and allow their neighbors to
pine with hunger; nay, who cruelly kill with famine those whom they ought to
have relieved, when the means of doing so were in their power. Some look upon it
as a simple parable; but, as the name <i>Lazarus </i>occurs in it, I rather
consider it to be the narrative of an actual fact. But that is of little
consequence, provided that the reader comprehends the doctrine which it
contains.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There was a certain rich
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He is, first of all, described as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>clothed in purple and fine
linen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and enjoying every day splendor
and luxury. This denotes a life spent amidst delicacies, and superfluity, and
pomp. Not that all elegance and ornaments of dress are in themselves displeasing
to God, or that all the care bestowed on preparing victuals ought to be
condemned; but because it seldom happens that such things are kept in
moderation. He who has a liking for fine dress will constantly increase his
luxury by fresh additions; and it is scarcely possible that he who indulges in
sumptuous and well garnished tables shall avoid falling into intemperance. But
the chief accusation brought against this man is his cruelty in suffering
<i>Lazarus, </i>poor and</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> full of
sores, to lie</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>out of doors
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at his gate.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These two clauses Christ has exhibited in contrast.
The <i>rich man, </i>devoted to the pleasures of the table and to display,
swallowed up, like an unsatiable gulf, his enormous wealth, but remained unmoved
by the poverty and distresses of <i>Lazarus, </i>and knowingly and willingly
suffered him to pine away with hunger, cold, and the offensive smell of his
<i>sores. </i>In this manner Ezekiel (16:49) accuses <i>Sodom </i>of not
stretching out her hand to the poor amidst <i>fullness of bread </i>and wine.
The<i> fine linen, </i>which is a peculiarly delicate fabric, is well-known to
have been used by the inhabitants of eastern countries for elegance and
splendor; a fashion which the Popish priests have imitated in what they call
their <i>surplices.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And even the dogs
came.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was quite enough to prove the
hardened cruelty of the <i>rich man, </i>that the sight of wretchedness like
this did not move him to compassion. Had there been a drop of humanity in him,
he ought at least to have ordered a supply from his kitchen for the unhappy man.
But the crowning exhibition of his wicked, and savage, and worse than brutal
disposition was, that he did not learn pity even from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
dogs</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There can be no doubt that those
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dogs</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>were guided by the secret purpose of God, to condemn that man by their
example. Christ certainly produces them here as witnesses to convict him of
unfeeling and detestable cruelty. What could be more monstrous than to see
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
dogs</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>taking charge of a man, to whom his
neighbor is paying no attention; and, what is more, to see the very crumbs of
bread refused to a man perishing of hunger, while
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the dogs
</i></font><font face="Palatino">are giving him the service of their tongues for
the purpose of healing his <i>sores? </i>When strangers, or even brute animals,
supply our place, by performing an office which ought rather to have been
discharged by ourselves, let us conclude that they are so many witnesses and
judges appointed by God, to make our criminality the more
manifest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it happened that the
beggar died.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ here points out the
vast change which death effected in the condition of the two men. Death was no
doubt common to both; but to be after death
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>carried by angels into
Abraham&#8217;s bosom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>was a happiness
more desirable than all the kingdoms of the world. On the other hand, to be
sentenced to everlasting torments is a dreadful thing, for avoiding which a
hundred lives, if it were possible, ought to be employed. In the person of
<i>Lazarus </i>there is held out to us a striking proof that we ought not to
pronounce men to be accursed by God, because they drag out, in incessant pain, a
life which is full of distresses. In him the grace of God was so entirely
hidden, and buried by the deformity and shame of the cross, that to the eye of
the flesh nothing presented itself except the curse; and yet we see that in a
body which was loathsome and full of rottenness there was lodged a soul
unspeakably precious, which is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>carried by
angels</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to a blessed life. It was no loss
to him that he was forsaken, and despised, and destitute of every human comfort,
when heavenly spirits deign to accompany him on his removal from the prison of
the flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the rich man also died, and was
buried.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the rich
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>we see, as in a bright mirror, how
undesirable is that temporal happiness which ends in everlasting destruction. It
deserves our attention, that Christ expressly mentions the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burial of the rich
man,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but says nothing of what was done
to <i>Lazarus. </i>Not that his dead body was exposed to wild beasts, or lay in
the open air, but because it was thrown carelessly, and without the slightest
attention, into a ditch; for it may naturally be inferred from the corresponding
clause, that no more attention was paid to him when he was dead than when he was
alive. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The rich
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>on the other hand, buried
magnificently according to his wealth, still retains some remnant of his former
pride.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f304</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In this respect, we see ungodly men striving, as it were, against nature, by
affecting a pompous and splendid funeral for the sake of preserving their
superiority after death; but their souls <i>in hell </i>attest the folly and
mockery of this ambition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Lazarus was carried by
angels.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When he says that <i>Lazarus was
carried, </i>it is a figure of speech by which a part is taken for the whole;
for the soul being the nobler part of man, properly takes the name of the whole
man.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f305</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This office is, not without reason, assigned by Christ to angels, who, we are
aware, have been appointed to be <i>ministering spirits
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:14) to believers, that they may devote their care and labor to their

speculations about
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Abraham&#8217;s
bosom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in which many commentators of
Scripture have indulged, is unnecessary, and, in my opinion, would serve no good
purpose. It is quite enough that we receive what readers well acquainted with
Scripture will acknowledge to be the natural meaning. As Abraham is called
<i>the father </i>of believers, because to him was committed the covenant of
eternal life, that he might first preserve it faithfully for his own children,
and afterwards transmit it to all nations, and as all who are heirs of the same
promise are called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>so those who receive along
with him the fruit of the same faith are said, after death, to be collected into
his <i>bosom. </i>The metaphor is taken from a father 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f306</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, in
whose
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bosom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as it were, the children meet, when they all return home in the evening from
the labors of the day. The children of God are scattered during their pilgrimage
in this world; but as, in their present course, they follow the faith of their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>so they are received at death into that blessed rest, in which he awaits
their arrival. It is not necessary to suppose that reference is made here to any
one place; but the assemblage of which I have spoken is described, for the
purpose of assuring believers, that they have not been fruitlessly employed in
fighting for the faith under the banner of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>for they enjoy the same habitation in heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It will perhaps be asked, Is the same condition
reserved after death for the godly of our own day, or did Christ, when he rose,
open his <i>bosom </i>to admit
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>himself, as well as all the godly? I reply briefly: As the grace of God is
more clearly revealed to us in the Gospel, and as Christ himself, <i>the Sun of
Righteousness,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
4:2,) has brought to us that salvation, which the fathers were formerly
permitted to behold at a distance and under dark shadows, so there cannot be a
doubt that believers, when they die, make a nearer approach to the enjoyment of
the heavenly life. Still, it must be understood, that the glory of immortality
is delayed till the last day of redemption. So far as relates to the word
<i>bosom, </i>that quiet harbor at which believers arrive after the navigation
of the present life, may be called either
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Abraham&#8217;s
bosom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ&#8217;s
bosom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but, as we have advanced farther
than the fathers did under the Law, this distinction will be more properly
expressed by saying, that the members of Christ are associated with their Head;
and thus there will be an end of the metaphor about
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Abraham&#8217;s
bosom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as the brightness of the sun,
when he is risen, makes all the stars to disappear. From the mode of expression
which Christ has here employed, we may, in the meantime, draw the inference,
that the fathers under the Law embraced by faith, while they lived, that
inheritance of the heavenly life into which they were admitted at
death.</font><br></div>

general truth conveyed is, that believing souls, when they have left their
bodies, lead a joyful and blessed life out of this world, and that for the
reprobate there are prepared dreadful torments, which can no more be conceived
by our minds than the boundless glory of the heavens. As it is only in a small
measure&#8212;only so far as we are enlightened by the Spirit of God&#8212;that
we taste by hope the glory promised to us, which far exceeds all our senses, let
it be reckoned enough that the inconceivable vengeance of God, which awaits the
ungodly, is communicated to us in an obscure manner, so far as is necessary to
strike terror into our minds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On these subjects the words of Christ give us slender
information, and in a manner which is fitted to restrain curiosity. The wicked
are described as fearfully tormented by the misery which they feel; as desiring
some relief, but cut off from hope, and thus experiencing a double torment; and
as having their anguish increased by being compelled to remember their crimes,
and to compare the present blessedness of believers with their own miserable and
lost condition. In connection with this a conversation is related, as if persons
who have no intercourse with each other were supposed to talk together. When
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the rich
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father
Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>this expresses an additional
torment, that he perceives, when it is too late, that he is cut off from the
number of the children of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.

remember.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>son</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>appears to be used ironically, as a sharp and piercing reproof to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the rich
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who falsely boasted in his lifetime
that he was one of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sons</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of Abraham. It seems as if pain inflicted by a hot iron wounded his mind,
when his hypocrisy and false confidence are placed before his eyes. When it is
said that he is tormented in hell, because he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>had received his good things in
his lifetime</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>we must not understand the
meaning to be, that eternal destruction awaits all who have enjoyed prosperity
in the world. On the contrary, as Augustine has judiciously observed, poor
Lazarus was carried into the bosom of rich Abraham, to inform us, that riches do
not shut against any man the gate of the kingdom of heaven, but that it is open
alike to all who have either made a sober use of riches, or patiently endured
the want of them. All that is meant is, that <i>the rich man, </i>who yielded to
the allurements of the present life, abandoned himself entirely to earthly
enjoyments, and despised God and His kingdom, now suffers the punishment of his
own neglect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Receivedst THY good
things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The pronoun <i>thy </i>is
emphatic, as if Abraham had said: Thou wast created for an immortal life, and
the Law of God raised time on high to the contemplation of the heavenly life;
but thou, forgetting so exalted a condition, didst choose to resemble a sow or a
dog, and thou therefore receivest a reward which befits brutal pleasures.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But now he enjoys
comfort</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When it is said of Lazarus, on
the other hand, that <i>he
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>enjoys
comfort</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because he had suffered many
distresses in the world, it would be idle to apply this to all whose condition
is wretched; because their afflictions, in many cases, are so far from having
been of service to them, that they ought rather to bring upon them severer
punishment. But <i>Lazarus </i>is commended for patient endurance of the cross,
which always springs from faith and a genuine fear of God; for he who
obstinately resists his sufferings, and whose ferocity remains unsubdued, has no
claim to be rewarded for patience, by receiving from God <i>comfort </i>in
exchange for the cross.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To sum up the whole, they who have patiently endured
the burden of the cross laid upon them, and have not been rebellious against the
yoke and chastisements of God, but, amidst uninterrupted sufferings, have
cherished the hope of a better life, have a rest laid up for them in heaven,
when the period of their warfare shall be terminated. On the contrary, wicked
despisers of God, who are wholly engrossed in the pleasures of the flesh, and
who by a sort of mental intoxication, drown every feeling of piety, will
experience, immediately after death, such torments as will efface their empty
enjoyments. It must also be recollected, that this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>comfort</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which the sons of God enjoy, lies in this, that they perceive a crown of
glory prepared for them, and rest in the joyful expectation of it; as, on the
other hand, the wicked are tormented by the apprehension of the future judgment,
which they see coming upon them.</font><br></div>

the reprobate from the elect can never be broken through. And thus we are
reminded to return early to the path, while there is yet time, lest we rush
headlong into that abyss, from which it will be impossible to rise. The words

their ingenuity very foolishly, by attempting to prove that the dead feel
solicitude about the living. Any thing more ridiculous than this sophistry
cannot be conceived; for with equal plausibility I might undertake to prove,
that believing souls are not satisfied with the place assigned to them, and are
actuated by a desire of removing from it to hell, were it not that they are
prevented by <i>a vast gulf. </i>If no man holds such extravagant views, the
Papists are not entitled to congratulate themselves on the other supposition. It
is not my intention, however, to debate the point, or to defend either one side
or another; but I thought it right to advert, in passing, to the futility of the
arguments on which they rest their belief that the dead intercede with God on
our behalf. I now return to the plain and natural meaning of this
passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They have Moses and the
prophets.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In the persons of <i>the rich
man </i>and <i>Abraham </i>Christ reminds us, that we have received an undoubted
rule of life, and that therefore we have no right to expect that the dead will
rise to instruct and persuade us.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moses and the
prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>were appointed to instruct,
while they lived, the men of their own age; but it was with the design, that the
same advantage should be derived by posterity from their writings. As it is the
will of God that we should receive instructions, in this manner, about a holy
life, there is no reason why the dead should assure us of the rewards and
punishments of the future state; nor is there any excuse for the indifference of
those who shelter themselves under the pretext, that they do not know what is
going on beyond this world. Among irreligious men, we are aware, is frequently
heard this wicked saying, or rather this grunting of hogs, that it is foolish in
men to distress themselves with fears about a matter of uncertainty, since no
one has ever returned to bring us tidings about hell.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With the view of counteracting every enchantment of
Satan of this description, Christ draws their attention to the Law and the
Prophets, agreeably to that passage in the writings of Moses:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest
say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear
it, and do it? Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall
go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?
But the word is very nigh unto thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that
thou shouldest do it,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
30:12-14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They who ridicule as fabulous what Scripture
testifies as to the future judgment, will one day feel how shocking is the
wickedness of giving the lie to the holy oracles of God. From such lethargy
Christ arouses his followers, that they may not be deceived by the hope of
escaping punishment, and thus fail to improve the time allowed for
repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Abraham&#8217;s </i>reply amounts to this: By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moses and the
prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God had sufficiently made known
to his people the doctrine of salvation, and nothing remains for us but that it
obtain the assent of all. So thoroughly infected is the mind of man with a
depraved curiosity, that the greater part of men are always gaping after new
revelations. Now as nothing is more displeasing to God than when men are so
eager to go beyond due bounds, he forbids them to inquire at magicians and
soothsayers respecting the truth, and to consult pretended oracles after the
manner of the Gentiles; and in order to restrain that itching curiosity, he
promises, at the same time, that he will give
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

salvation,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051809&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>were sent for the express purpose; that God might keep his people under the
guidance of his word, he who is not satisfied with this method of instruction is
not actuated by a desire to learn, but tickled by ungodly wantonness; and
therefore God complains that He is insulted, when He alone is not heard <i>from
the living to the dead,

<div><font face="Palatino">The division of the word of God, which Abraham makes,
into the Law and the Prophets, refers to the time of the Old Testament. Now that
the more ample explanation of the Gospel has been added, there is still less
excuse for our wickedness, if our dislike of that doctrine hurries us in every
possible direction, and, in a word, if we do not permit ourselves to be
regulated by the word of God. Hence too we infer how solid is the faith of
Papists about purgatory and such fooleries, when it rests on nothing but
phantoms.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f307</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nay, father
Abraham.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is a personification, as
we have said, which expresses rather the feelings of the living than the anxiety
of the dead. The doctrine of the <i>Law </i>is little esteemed by the world, the
<i>Prophets </i>are neglected, and no man submits to hear God speaking in his
own manner. Some would desire that angels should descend from heaven; others,
that the dead should come out of their graves; others, that new miracles should
be performed every day to sanction what they hear; and others, that voices
should be heard from the sky. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f308</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But if
God were pleased to comply with all their foolish wishes, it would be of no
advantage to them; for God has included in his word all that is necessary to be
known, and the authority of this word has been attested and proved by authentic
seals. Besides, faith does not depend on miracles, or any extraordinary sign,
but is the peculiar gift of the Spirit, and is produced by means of the word.
Lastly, it is the prerogative of God to draw us to himself, and he is pleased to
work effectually through his own word. There is not the slightest reason,
therefore, to expect that those means, which withdraw us from obedience to the
word, will be of any service to us. I freely acknowledge, that there is nothing
to which the flesh is more strongly inclined than to listen to vain revelations;
and we see how eagerly those men, to whom the whole of Scripture is an object of
dislike, throw themselves into the snares of Satan. Hence have arisen necromancy
and other delusions, which the world not only receives with avidity, but runs
after with furious rage. But all that is here affirmed by Christ is, that even
the dead could not reform,

<div><font face="Palatino">The object of this parable is to show that God claims
all that belongs to us as his property, and possesses an entire control over our
persons and services; and, therefore, that all the zeal that may be manifested
by us in discharging our duty does not lay him under obligation to us by any
sort of merit; for, as we are his property, so he on his part can owe us
nothing. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f314</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
adduces the comparison of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
servant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who, after having spent the day
in severe toil, returns home in the evening, and continues his labors till his
master is pleased to relieve him. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f315</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Christ
speaks not of such servants as we have in the present day, who work for hire,
but of the slaves that lived in ancient times, whose condition in society was
such, that they gained nothing for themselves, but all that belonged to
them&#8212;their toil, and application, and industry, even to their very
blood&#8212;was the property of their masters. Christ now shows that a bond of
servitude not less rigorous binds and obliges us to serve God; from which he
infers, that we have no means of laying Him under obligations to
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is an argument drawn from the less to the greater;
for if a mortal man is permitted to hold such power over another man, as to
enjoin upon him uninterrupted services by night and by day, and yet contract no
sort of mutual obligation, as if he were that man&#8217;s debtor, how much more
shall God have a right to demand the services of our whole life, to the utmost
extent that our ability allows, and yet be in no degree indebted to us? We see
then that all are held guilty of wicked arrogance who imagine that they deserve
any thing from God, or that he is bound to them in any way. And yet no crime is
more generally practiced than this kind of arrogance; for there is no man that
would not willingly call God to account, and hence the notion of merits has
prevailed in almost every age.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must attend more closely to the statement made
by Christ, that we render nothing to God beyond what he has a right to claim,
but are so strongly bound to his service, that we owe him every thing that lies
in our power. It consists of two clauses. First, our life, even to the very end
of our course, belongs entirely to God; so that, if a person were to spend a
part of it in obedience to God, he would have no right to bargain that he should
rest for the remainder of the time; as a considerable number of men, after
serving as soldiers for ten years, would gladly apply for a discharge. Then
follows the second clause, on which we have already touched, that God is not
bound to pay us hire for any of our services. Let each of us remember, that he
has been created by God for the purpose of laboring, and of being vigorously
employed in his work; and that not only for a limited time, but till death
itself, and, what is more, that he shall not only <i>live, but die, to God,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With respect to merit, we must remove the difficulty
by which many are perplexed; for Scripture so frequently promises a reward to
our works, that they think it allows them some merit. The reply is easy. A
reward is promised, not as a debt, but from the mere good pleasure of God. It is
a great mistake to suppose that there is a mutual relation between Reward and
Merit; for it is by his own undeserved favor, and not by the value of our works,
that God is induced to reward them. By the engagements of the Law 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f316</font></sup><font face="Palatino">, I
readily acknowledge, God is bound to men, if they were to discharge fully all
that is required from them; but still, as this is a voluntary obligation, it
remains a fixed principle, that man can demand nothing from God, as if he had
merited any thing. And thus the arrogance of the flesh falls to the ground; for,
granting that any man fulfilled the Law, he cannot plead that he has any claims
on God, having done no more than he was bound to do. When he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we are unprofitable
servants</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>his meaning is, that God
receives from us nothing beyond what is justly due but only collects the lawful
revenues of his dominion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are two principles, therefore, that must be
maintained: first, that God naturally owes us nothing, and that all the services
which we render to him are not worth a single straw; secondly, that, according
to the engagements of the Law, a reward is attached to works, not on account of
their value, but because God is graciously pleased to become our debtor. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f317</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It
would evince intolerable ingratitude, if on such a ground any person should
indulge in proud vaunting. The kindness and liberality which God exercises
towards us are so far from giving us a right to swell with foolish confidence,
that we are only laid under deeper obligations to Him. Whenever we meet with the
word <i>reward, </i>or whenever it occurs to our recollection, let us look upon
this as the crowning act of the goodness of God to us, that, though we are
completely in his debt, he condescends to enter into a bargain with us. So much
the more detestable is the invention of the Sophists, who have had the
effrontery to forge a kind of merit, which professes to be founded on a just
claim.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f318</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The word <i>merit, </i>taken by itself, was sufficiently profane and
inconsistent with the standard of piety; but to intoxicate men with diabolical
pride, as if they could merit any thing by a just claim, is far
worse.</font><br></div>

which is nowhere to be found; for the most perfect of all men is still at a
great distance from that righteousness which the law demands. The present
question is not, Are we justified by works? but, Is the observance of the law
meritorious of any reward from God? This latter question is answered in the
negative; for God holds us for his slaves, and therefore reckons all that can
proceed from us to be his just right. Nay, though it were true, that a reward is
due to the observance of the law in respect of merit, it will not therefore
follow that any man is justified by the merits of works; for we all fail: and
not only is our obedience imperfect, but there is not a single part of it that
corresponds exactly to the judgment of God.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We know that perseverance in prayer is a rare and
difficult attainment; and it is a manifestation of our unbelief that, when our
first prayers are not successful, we immediately throw away not only hope, but
all the ardor of prayer. But it is an undoubted evidence of our Faith, if we are
disappointed of our wish, and yet do not lose courage. Most properly, therefore,
does Christ recommend to his disciples to persevere in praying.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>parable </i>which he employs, though
apparently harsh, was admirably fitted to instruct his disciples, that they
ought to be importunate in their prayers to God the Father, till they at length
draw from him what He would otherwise appear to be unwilling to give. Not that
by our prayers we gain a victory over God, and bend him slowly and reluctantly
to compassion, but because the actual facts do not all at once make it evident
that he graciously listens to our prayers. In the <i>parable </i>Christ
describes to us a <i>widow, </i>who obtained what she wanted from an unjust and
cruel <i>judge, </i>because she did not cease to make earnest demands. The
leading truth conveyed is, that God does not all at once grant assistance to his
people, because he chooses to be, as it were, wearied out by prayers; and that,
however wretched and despicable may be the condition of those who pray to him,
yet if they do not desist from the uninterrupted exercise of prayer, he will at
length regard them and relieve their necessities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The parties between whom the comparison is drawn are,
indeed, by no means equal; for there is a wide difference between a wicked and
cruel man and God, who is naturally inclined to mercy. But Christ intended to
assure believers that they have no reason to fear lest their persevering
entreaties to the Father of mercy should be refused, since by importunate
supplication they prevail on men who are given to cruelty. The wicked and
iron-hearted
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>could not avoid yielding at length, though reluctantly, to the earnest
solicitations of the widow: how then shall the prayers of believers, when
perseveringly maintained, be without effect? If exhaustion and weakness are felt
by us when we give way after a slight exertion, or if the ardor of prayer
languishes because God appears to lend a deaf ear, let us rest assured of our
ultimate success, though it may not be immediately apparent. Entertaining this
conviction, let us contend against our impatience, so that the long delay may
not induce us to discontinue our prayers.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but points out a very different reason why those who believe in him are kept
long in suspense, and why he does not actually and at once stretch out his hand
to them: it is because he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forbears</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>If at any time God winks at the injuries done to us longer than we would
wish, let us know that this is done with a fatherly intention&#8212;to train us
to patience. A temporary overlooking of crimes is very different from allowing
them to remain for ever unpunished. The promise which he makes, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God will speedily avenge
them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>must be referred to his
providence; for our hasty tempers and carnal apprehension lead us to conclude
that he does not come quickly enough to grant relief. But if we could penetrate
into his design, we would learn that his assistance is always ready and
seasonable, as the case demands, and is not delayed for a single moment, but
comes at the exact time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is asked, How does Christ instruct his
disciples to seek vengeance, while he exhorts them on another occasion, <i>pray
for those who injure and persecute you,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400544&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:44.) I reply: what Christ says here about vengeance does not at all interfere
with his former doctrine. God declares that he will avenge believers, not for
the purpose of giving a loose rein to their carnal affections, but in order to
convince them that their salvation is dear and precious in his sight, and in
this manner to induce them to rely on his protection. If, laying aside hatred,
pure and free from every wicked desire of revenge, and influenced by proper and
well-regulated dispositions, they implore divine assistance, it will be a lawful
and holy wish, and God himself will listen to it. But as nothing is more
difficult than to divest ourselves of sinful affections, if we would offer pure
and sincere prayers, we must ask the Lord to guide and direct our hearts by his
Spirit. Then shall we lawfully call on God to be our avenger, and he will answer
our prayers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the Son of man shall
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words Christ informs us
that there will be no reason to wonder if men shall afterwards sink under their
calamities: it will be because they neglect the true remedy. He intended to
obviate an offense which we are daily apt to take, when we see all things in
shameful confusion. Treachery, cruelty, imposture, deceit, and violence, abound
on every hand; there is no regard to justice, and no shame; the poor groan under
their oppressors; the innocent are abused or insulted; while God appears to be
asleep in heaven. This is the reason why the flesh imagines that the government
of fortune is blind. But Christ here reminds us that men are justly deprived of
heavenly aid, on which they have neither knowledge nor inclination to place
reliance. They who do nothing but murmur against the Lord in their hearts, and
who allow no place for his providence, cannot reasonably expect that the Lord
will assist them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall he find faith on the
earth?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ expressly foretells that,
from his ascension to heaven till his return, unbelievers will abound; meaning
by these words that, if the Redeemer does not so speedily appear, the blame of
the delay will attach to men, because there will be almost none to look for him.
Would that we did not behold so manifest a fulfillment of this prediction! But
experience proves that though the world is oppressed and overwhelmed by a huge
mass of calamities, there are few indeed in whom the least spark of <i>faith
</i>can be discerned. Others understand the word<i> faith </i>to denote
uprightness, but the former meaning is more agreeable to the
context.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Christ now gives directions about another virtue,
which is necessary to acceptable prayer. Believers must not come into the
presence of God but with humility and abasement. No disease is more dangerous
than arrogance; and yet all have it so deeply fixed in the marrow of their
bones, that it can scarcely be removed or extirpated by any remedy. It is no
doubt strange that men should be so mad as to venture to raise their crests
against God, and to plead their own merits before him. Though men are carried
away by their ambition, yet when we come into the presence of God, all
presumption ought to be laid aside; and yet every man thinks that he has
sufficiently humbled himself, if he only presents a hypocritical prayer for
forgiveness. Hence we infer that this warning which our Lord gives was far from
being unnecessary.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are two faults at which Christ glances, and
which he intended to condemn,&#8212;wicked confidence in ourselves, and the
pride of despising brethren, the one of which springs out of the other. It is
impossible that he who deceives himself with vain confidence should not lift
himself up above his brethren. Nor is it wonderful that it should be so; for how
should that man not despise his equals, who vaunts against God himself? Every
man that is puffed up with self-confidence carries on open war with God, to whom
we cannot be reconciled in any other way than by denial of ourselves; that is,
by laying aside all confidence in our own virtue and righteousness, and relying
on his mercy alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Two men went

pray</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>seem to manifest the same ardor of
piety, while yet they are exceedingly unlike.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
Pharisee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>possessing outward sanctity,
approaches to God with a commendation which he pronounces on his whole life, and
as if he had an undoubted right to offer the sacrifice of praise.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
publican</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>on the other hand, as if he
had been some outcast, and knew that he was unworthy to approach, presents
himself with trembling and with humble confession. Christ affirms that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Pharisee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>was rejected, and that the
prayers of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
publican</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>were acceptable to God. The
reasons why the Pharisee was rejected are stated to be these two:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he trusted in himself that he was
righteous, and despised
others</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God, I thank
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>And yet he is not blamed for
boasting of the strength of his free-will, but for trusting that God was
reconciled to him by the merits of his works. For this thanksgiving, which is
presented exclusively in his own name, does not at all imply that he boasted of
his own virtue, as if he had obtained righteousness from himself, or merited any
thing by his own industry. On the contrary, he ascribes it to the grace of God
that he is righteous. Now though his thanksgiving to God implies an
acknowledgment, that all the good works which he possessed were purely the gift
of God, yet as he places reliance on works, and prefers himself to others,
himself and his prayer are alike rejected. Hence we infer that men are not truly
and properly humbled, though they are convinced that they can do nothing, unless
they likewise distrust the merits of works, and learn to place their salvation
in the undeserved goodness of God, so as to rest upon it all their
confidence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable passage; for some think it
enough if they take from man the glory of good works, so far as they are the
gifts of the Holy Spirit; and accordingly they admit that we are justified
freely, because God finds in us no righteousness but what he bestowed. But
Christ goes farther, not only ascribing to the grace of the Spirit the power of
acting aright, but stripping us of all confidence in works; for the Pharisee is
not blamed on the ground of claiming for himself what belongs to God, but
because he trusts to his works, that God will be reconciled to him, because he
deserves it. Let us therefore know that, though a man may ascribe to God the
praise of works, yet if he imagines the righteousness of those works to be the
cause of his salvation, or rests upon it, he is condemned for wicked arrogance.
And observe, that he is not charged with the vainglorious ambition of those who
indulge in boasting before men, while they are inwardly conscious of their own
wickedness, but is charged with concealed hypocrisy; for he is not said to have
been the herald of his own praises, but to have prayed silently within himself.
Though he did not proclaim aloud the honor of his own righteousness, his
internal pride was abominable in the sight of God. His boasting consists of two
parts: first, he acquits himself of that guilt in which all men are involved;
and, secondly, he brings forward his virtues. He asserts that he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not as other
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because he is not chargeable with
crimes which everywhere prevail in the world.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I fast twice in the week, I
give tithes of all that I possess.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This
is equivalent to saying that he performed more than the law required; just as
the Popish monks talk loftily of their works of <i>supererogation, as </i>if
they found no great difficulty in fulfilling the law of God. It must be admitted
that each of us, according to the measure of the virtues which God has bestowed
upon him, is the more strongly bound to thank the Author of them; and that it is
an exercise of holy meditation for each of us to ponder on the benefits which he
has received, so as not to bury in ingratitude the kindness of God. But there
are two things here that must be observed: we must not swell with confidence, as
if we had satisfied God; and, next, we must not look down with disdainful
contempt upon our brethren. In both respects the Pharisee erred; for, by falsely
claiming righteousness for himself, he left nothing to the mercy of God; and,
next, he despised all others in comparison of himself. And, indeed, that
thanksgiving would not have been disapproved by Christ, if it had not labored
under these two defects;  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f325</font></sup><font face="Palatino">but as
the proud hypocrite, by winking at his sins, met the justice of God with a
pretense of complete and perfect righteousness, his wicked and detestable
hardihood could not but make him fall. For the only hope of the godly, so long
as they labor under the weakness of the flesh, is, after acknowledging what is
good in them, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f326</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to
betake themselves to the mercy of God alone, and to rest their salvation on
prayer for forgiveness.

<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, how did this man, who was
blinded by wicked pride, maintain such sanctity of life; for such integrity
proceeds only from the Spirit of God, who, we are certain, does not reign in
hypocrites? I reply: he trusted only to outward appearance, as if the hidden and
inward uncleanness of the heart would not be taken into the account. Though he
was full of wicked desires within, yet as he looks only at the appearance, he
boldly maintains his innocence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our Lord does not, indeed, accuse him of vanity, in
falsely claiming for himself what he does not possess; but it ought to be
believed that no man is pure from extortion, injustice, uncleanness, and other
vices, unless he is governed by the Spirit of God.</font><br></div>

lay down a general rule, as if it were necessary, whenever we pray, to cast down
our eyes to the ground. He merely describes the tokens of humility, which alone
he recommends to his disciples. Now humility lies in not refusing to acknowledge
our sins, but condemning ourselves, and thus anticipating the judgment of God;
and, with the view of being reconciled to God, in making an honest confession of
guilt. Such, too, is the cause of that shame which always accompanies
repentance; for Christ insists chiefly on this point, that <i>the
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>publican</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>sincerely acknowledged himself to be miserable and lost, and fled to the
mercy of God. Though he is a sinner, he trusts to a free pardon, and hopes that
God will be gracious to him. In a word, in order to obtain favor, he owns that
he does not deserve it. And, certainly, since it is the forgiveness of sins that
alone reconciles God to us, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f329</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> we must
begin with this, if we desire that he would accept our prayers. He who
acknowledges that he is guilty and convicted, and then proceeds to implore
pardon, disavows all confidence in works; and Christ&#8217;s object was to show
that God will not be gracious to any but those who betake themselves with
trembling to his mercy alone.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This man went down

for Christ does not merely assign to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
publican</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>a certain degree of
superiority, as if
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the publican
</i></font><font face="Palatino">was accepted by God, while
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Pharisee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>was totally rejected. And this
passage shows plainly what is the strict meaning of the word <i>justified:
</i>it means, to stand before God as if we were righteous. For it is not said
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
publican</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>was justified, because he
suddenly acquired some new quality, but that he obtained grace, because his
guilt was blotted out, and his sins were washed away. Hence it follows, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>consists in the forgiveness of sins. As the virtues of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Pharisee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>were defiled and polluted by
unfounded confidence, so that his integrity, which deserved commendation before
the world, was of no value in the sight of God; so
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
publican</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>relying on no merits of works,
obtained righteousness solely by imploring pardon, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f331</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because
he had no other ground of hope than the pure mercy of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be thought absurd, that all should be
reduced to the same level, since the purity of saints is widely different from
that of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
publican</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I reply: whatever proficiency
any man may have made in the worship of God and in true holiness, yet if he
consider how far he is still deficient, there is no other form of prayer which
he can properly use than to begin with the acknowledgment of guilt; for though
some are more, and others less, yet all are universally guilty. We cannot doubt,
therefore, that Christ now lays down a rule for all to this effect, that God
will not be pacified towards us, unless we distrust works, and pray that we may
be freely reconciled. And, indeed, the Papists are compelled to acknowledge this
in part, but immediately afterwards they debase this doctrine by a wicked
invention. They admit that all need the remedy of forgiveness, because no man is
perfect; but they first intoxicate wretched men with reliance on what they call
<i>imperfect righteousness, </i>and next add satisfactions, in order to blot out
their guilt. But our faith needs no other support than this, that God has
accepted us, not because we deserved it, but because he does not impute our
sins.</font><br></div>

however, is different; for it describes the base and incredible ingratitude of
the Jewish nation, to prevent us from wondering that so many of Christ&#8217;s
favors had been suppressed, and so many of his wonderful works buried, among
them. One circumstance, too, is added, which greatly heightens the infamy of
their crime. Our Lord had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cured

obligation to Christ. There is, therefore, on the one hand, a display of
Christ&#8217;s divine power; and, on the other hand, a reproof of the impiety of
the Jews, in consequence of which so remarkable a miracle as this received
scarcely any attention.</font><br></div>

because they implore Christ&#8217;s assistance, but because they honor him with
the title of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Master</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>That they made use of that expression sincerely, and not in hypocrisy, may
be inferred from their ready obedience; for, although they perceive that the
filthy scab still remains in their flesh, yet as soon as they are commanded to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>show themselves to the
priests,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>they do not refuse to obey. Add
to this that, but for the influence of faith, they would never have set out to

to present themselves to the judges of leprosy, for the purpose of attesting

as of no more value than a mere inspection of the disease. They bear a visible
leprosy in their flesh; and yet, trusting to Christ&#8217;s word alone, they
have no scruple about declaring that they are clean. It cannot therefore be
denied, that some seed of faith had been implanted in their hearts. Now though
it is certain that they were not regenerated by the Spirit of adoption, yet
there is no absurdity in supposing that they had some beginnings of piety. There
is the greater reason to fear that sparks of faith, which make their appearance
in us, may be extinguished; for, although lively faith, which has its roots
deeply fixed by the Spirit of regeneration, never dies, yet we have seen
formerly that many conceive a temporary faith, which immediately disappears.
Above all, it is too common a disease that, when we are urged by strong
necessity, and when the Lord himself prompts us by a secret movement of the
Spirit, we seek God, but, when we have obtained our wishes, ungrateful
forgetfulness swallows up that feeling of piety. Thus poverty and hunger beget
faith, but abundance kills it.</font><br></div>

priests</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>a tenth part only shall return
to Christ, and all the rest shall wickedly revolt. They cannot plead this
passage in behalf of their confession, without giving us liberty to throw back
upon them this advantage which it yields, that none return from the priests
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to give glory to
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But, not to dwell on these
fooleries, we have ascertained the reason why <i>the priests </i>were
mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It happened that, while they were
going, they were cleansed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here was
displayed the divine power of Christ and of his words, and there was also a
proof of the high estimation in which God holds the obedience of faith; for the
great suddenness of the cure arose from the confident hope which induced them to
undertake the journey, without hesitation, at the command of Christ. But if that
transitory faith&#8212;which wanted a living root, and produced nothing more
than the blade&#8212;was honored by God with a remarkable effect, how much more
valuable is the reward that awaits our faith, if it is sincerely and permanently
fixed on God? Though the <i>nine lepers </i>derived no advantage to salvation
from the cure of the flesh, but only obtained a temporary gift by means of a
fleeting and transitory faith, yet this figure points out to us the great
efficacy which will attend true faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And one of them,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is uncertain if he returned when
they were halfway, and Luke&#8217;s words appear to imply this; but I think it
more probable, that it was not till he had heard the decision of the priests
that he returned to give thanks. He must have obtained permission from the
priests to return to the ordinary intercourse of life; and he had no right to
neglect the command of Christ, and to defraud the temple of God of a sacrifice.
Some will perhaps be better pleased with a different conjecture, that as soon as
he saw that he was cleansed, and before he applied to the priests for a
testimony, he was seized with a devout and holy zeal, and returned to the Author
of the cure, so as to commence his sacrifice with thanksgiving. The words of
Christ contain an expostulation with the whole nation; for it is by way of
reproach that he draws a comparison between one stranger and many Jews, because
it was customary with them to swallow up God&#8217;s favors without any feeling
of piety. And this was the reason why Christ gained hardly any reputation among
them by miracles so numerous and so splendid. Let us learn that this complaint
is brought generally against all of us, if we do not at least repay the divine
favors by the duty of gratitude.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy faith hath saved
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word <i>save </i>is restricted
by some commentators to the cleanness of the flesh. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f335</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But if
this be the case, since Christ commends the lively faith of this Samaritan, it
may be asked, how were the other nine
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?
</i>for all of them without exception obtained the same cure. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f336</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We must
therefore arrive at the conclusion, that Christ has here pronounced a different
estimate of the gift of God from that which is usually pronounced by ungodly
men; namely, that it was a token or pledge of God&#8217;s fatherly love. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nine lepers were
cured</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but as they wickedly efface the
remembrance of the grace of God, the cure itself is debased and contaminated by
their ingratitude, so that they do not derive from it the advantage which they
ought. It is faith alone that sanctifies the gifts of God to us, so that they
become pure, and, united to the lawful use of them, contribute to our salvation.
Lastly, by this word Christ has informed us in what manner we lawfully enjoy
divine favors. Hence we infer, that he included the eternal salvation of the
soul along with the temporal gift. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Samaritan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>by his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>How? Certainly not because he was cured of leprosy, (for this was likewise
obtained by the rest,) but because he was admitted into the number of the
children of God, and received from His hand a pledge of fatherly
kindness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And being interrogated by the
Pharisees</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This question was undoubtedly
put in mockery; for, since Christ was continually speaking of the kingdom of God
as at hand, while no change was taking place in the outward condition of the
Jews, wicked and malicious persons looked upon this as a plausible excuse for
harassing him. As if all that Christ said about the kingdom of God were idle
talk and mere trifling, they put a sarcastic question to him, &#8220;When shall
that kingdom come?&#8221; If any one shall consider this question to have been
put on account of the grossness of their own views, rather than for the sake of
jeering, I have no objection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The kingdom of God will not come
with observation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>My opinion is, that
Christ now disregards those dogs, and accommodates this reply to the disciples;
just as on many other occasions, when he was provoked by wicked men, and seized
the opportunity of giving instruction. In this manner God disappoints their
malice, while the truth, which is maintained in opposition to their sophistry,
is the more fully displayed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>observation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

declares, that the kingdom of God will not make its appearance at a distance, or
attended by pompous display. He means, that they are greatly mistaken who seek
with the eyes of the flesh </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
kingdom of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which is in no respect
carnal or earthly, for it is nothing else than the inward and spiritual renewal
of the soul. From the nature of the kingdom itself he shows that they are
altogether in the wrong, who look around <i>here </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in order to observe visible marks. &#8220;That restoration of the
Church,&#8221; he tells us, &#8220;which God has promised, must be looked for

his kingdom </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>within

reproves the stupidity of the Pharisees, because they aimed at nothing but what
was earthly and fading. It must be observed, however, that Christ speaks only of
the beginnings of the kingdom of God; for we now begin to be formed anew by the
Spirit after the image of God, in order that our entire renovation, and that of
the whole world, may afterwards follow in due time.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 13:53.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When Jesus had
concluded.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> Matthew </i>does not mean, that
immediately after delivering these discourses, he came into his own country; for
it is evident from <i>Mark, </i>that some interval of time elapsed. But the
meaning is, that after having taught for some time in Judea, he returned again
to the Galileans, but did not receive from them kind treatment. A narrative
which Luke gives (4:22) is nearly similar, but is not the same. Nor ought we to
wonder that Christ&#8217;s countrymen, when they perceived that his family was
mean and despised, and that he had been poorly educated, were at first so much
offended as to murmur at his doctrine, and afterwards persevered in the same
malice to such an extent, that they did not cease to slander him, when he chose
to discharge the office of a prophet amongst them. This second rejection of
Christ shows that the space of time which had intervened had not effected a
reformation on the inhabitants of Nazareth, but that the same contempt was
constantly thrown as an obstacle in the way, to prevent them from hearing
Christ.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f341</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>54.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So that they were
amazed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They are struck with
<i>amazement </i>at the novelty of the occurrence, that Christ, who had not
learned letters, but had been employed from youth to manhood in a mechanical
occupation, is so eminent a teacher, and is filled with divine wisdom. In this
miracle they ought to have perceived the hand of God; but their ingratitude made
them cover themselves with darkness. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f342</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They
are compelled to admire him, whether they will or not; and yet they treat him
with contempt. And what is this but to reject a prophet whom God has taught,
because he has not been educated by men? They cut their throat by means of their
own acknowledgment, when they render so honorable a testimony to the doctrine of
Christ, which after all has no influence on them, because it does not take its
origin, in the usual way, from the earth. Why do they not rather lift their eyes
to heaven, and learn that what exceeds human reason must have come from
God?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, the miracles, which were added to the
doctrine, ought to have affected them the more powerfully, or at least to have
aroused them from their excessive carelessness and stupidity to glorify God; for
certainly, when God adopts unwonted methods of procedure, so much the more
clearly does he display the power of his hand. And yet this was the very reason
why the inhabitants of Nazareth maliciously drew a veil over their eyes. We see,
then, that it is not mere ignorance that hinders men, but that, of their own
accord, they search after grounds of offense, to prevent them from following the
path to which God invites. We ought rather to argue in the opposite way, that,
when human means fail, the power of God is clearly revealed to us, and ought to
receive undivided praise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>55.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is not this the
carpenter&#8217;s son?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was, we are
aware, by the wonderful purpose of God, that Christ remained in private life
till he was thirty years of age. Most improperly and unjustly, therefore, were
the inhabitants of Nazareth offended on this account; for they ought rather to
have received him with reverence, as one who had suddenly come down from heaven.
They see God working in Christ, and intentionally turn away their eyes from this
sight, to behold Joseph, and Mary, and all his relatives; thus interposing a
veil to shut out the clearest light. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brothers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>we have formerly mentioned, is employed, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, to
denote any relatives whatever; and, accordingly, <i>Helvidius </i>displayed
excessive ignorance in concluding that Mary must have had many sons, because
Christ&#8217;s <i>brothers </i>are sometimes mentioned.

at considerable length, where it occurs in the Gospel of John, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f345</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> (4:44.)
It may, no doubt, be a general proverb, that those who are distinguished by
eminent gifts are nowhere held in less estimation than
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in their own
country</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and this manifests the
ingratitude of men, who, in proportion to the greater familiarity with which God
exhibits himself to them, are the more bold to reject him in the influences of
his Spirit. I readily agree, however, with Chrysostom, who thinks that this
proverb was applied in a peculiar manner to the Jews. But what was usually
spoken against the whole nation, Christ now asserts with special reference to
his Galilean countrymen; for nowhere did he receive less honor than on his
native soil. There were good grounds for the charge which he brings against
them, that, instead of being the first to accept the grace offered to them, as
they ought to have been, they drive him to a distance from them; for it is truly
extraordinary that a prophet of God, whom others warmly receive as a
newly-arrived stranger, should be despised in the place where he was
born.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>58.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he did not perform many
miracles in that place.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> Mark </i>states it
more emphatically, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he could
not perform any miracle.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But they are
perfectly agreed as to the substance of what is said, that it was the impiety of
Christ&#8217;s countrymen that closed the door against the performance of a
greater number of miracles among them. He had already given them some taste of
his power; but they willingly stupify themselves, so as to have no relish for
it. Accordingly, <i>Augustine </i>justly compares faith to the open mouth of a
vessel, while he speaks of faith as resembling a stopper, by which the vessel is
closed, so as not to receive the liquor 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f346</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which
God pours into it. And undoubtedly this is the case; for when the Lord perceives
that his power is not accepted by us, he at length withdraws it; and yet we
complain that we are deprived of his aid, which our unbelief rejects and drives
far from us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When <i>Mark </i>declares that Christ
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>could not perform any
miracles,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he represents the aggravated
guilt of those by whom his goodness was prevented; for certainly unbelievers, as
far as lies in their power, bind up the hands of God by their obstinacy; not
that God is overcome, as if he were an inferior, but because they do not permit
him to display his power. We must observe, however, what <i>Mark </i>adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>some sick
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>notwithstanding,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>were
cured</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for hence we infer, that the
goodness of Christ strove with their malice, and triumphed over every obstacle. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f347</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We have
experience of the same thing daily with respect to God; for, though he justly
and reluctantly restrains his power, because the entrance to us is shut against
him, yet we see that he opens up a path for himself where none exists, and
ceases not to bestow favors upon us. What an amazing contest, that while we are
endeavoring by every possible method to hinder the grace of God from coming to
us, it rises victorious, and displays its efficacy in spite of all our
exertions!</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">The reason why the Evangelists relate this occurrence
is, to inform us that the name of Christ was universally celebrated, and,
therefore, the Jews could not be excused on the plea of ignorance. Many might
otherwise have been perplexed by this question, &#8220;How came it that, while
Christ dwelt on the earth, Judea remained in a profound sleep, as if he had
withdrawn into some corner, and had displayed to none his divine power?&#8221;
The Evangelists accordingly state, that the report concerning him was everywhere
spread abroad, and penetrated even into the court of Herod.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And said to his
servants.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From the words of Luke it may
be inferred, that Herod did not of his own accord adopt this conjecture, but
that it was suggested to him by a report which was current among the people.
And, indeed, I have no doubt that the hatred which they bore to the tyrant, and
their detestation of so shocking a murder, gave rise, as is commonly the ease,
to those rumors. It was a superstition deeply rooted, as we have formerly
mentioned, in the minds of men, that the dead return to life in a different
person. Nearly akin to this is the opinion which they now adopt, that Herod,
when he cruelly put to death the holy man, was far from obtaining what he
expected; because he had suddenly risen from the dead by the miraculous power of
God, and would oppose and attack his enemies with greater severity than
ever.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Mark </i>and <i>Luke, </i>however, show that men
spoke variously on this subject: some thought that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and others that he was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one of
the prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or that he was so
eminently endued with the gifts of the Spirit, that he might be compared to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
prophets.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The reason why they thought
that he might be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>rather than any other prophet, has been already stated. Malachi having
predicted (4:5,6) that <i>Elijah would come </i>to gather the scattered Church,
they misunderstood that prediction as relating to the person of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>instead of being a simple comparison to the following effect: &#8220;That
the coming of Messiah may not be unknown, and that the people may not remain
ignorant of the grace of redemption, there will be an
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to go before, like him who of old raised up that which was fallen, and the
worship of God which had been overthrown. <i>He will go before, </i>by a
remarkable power of the Spirit, to proclaim <i>the great and dreadful day of the
Lord.&#8221; </i>The Jews, with their usual grossness of interpretation, had
applied this to <i>Elijah the Tishbite, </i>(1 Kings 17:1,) as if he were to
appear again and discharge the office of a prophet. Others again conjecture,
either that some one of the ancient prophets had risen, or that he was some
great man, who approached to them in excellence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was astonishing that, amidst the diversity of
views which were suggested, the true interpretation did not occur to any one;
more especially as the state of matters at that very time directed them to
Christ. God had promised to them a Redeemer, who would relieve them when they
were distressed and in despair. The extremity of affliction into which they had
been plunged was a loud call for divine assistance. The Redeemer is at hand, who
had been so clearly pointed out by the preaching of John, and who himself
testifies respecting his office. They are compelled to acknowledge that some
divine power belongs to him, and yet they fall into their own fancies, and
change him into the persons of other men. It is thus that the world is wont, in
base ingratitude, to obliterate the remembrance of the favors which God has
bestowed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With respect to Herod himself, as I hinted, little
ago, the conjecture that John had risen did not at first occur to himself; but
as bad consciences are wont to tremble and hesitate, and turn with every wind,
he readily believed what he dreaded. With such blind terrors God frequently
alarms wicked men; so that, after all the pains they take to harden themselves,
and to escape agitation, their internal executioner gives them no rest, but
chastises them with severity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And therefore miracles work in
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We naturally wonder what reasoning
could have led them to this conclusion. John had performed no miracle during the
whole course of his preaching. There appears to be no probability, therefore, in
the conjecture, that it was John whom they saw performing extraordinary
miracles. But they imagine that miracles are now performed by him for the first
time, in order to prove his resurrection, and to show that the holy prophet of
God had been wickedly put to death by Herod, and now came forward with a visible
and divine protection, that no man might afterwards venture to assail him. They

<div><font face="Palatino">This narrative is at present omitted by Luke, because
he had explained it on a former occasion; and for my own part, as I am unwilling
to annoy my readers by writing the same thing twice, I shall handle this passage
with greater brevity 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f351</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Evangelists relate that John was seized, because he had openly condemned
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Herod</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>for carrying off <i>Herodias, </i>and for his incestuous marriage with her.
Josephus assigns a different reason, namely, that Herod, dreading on his own
account a change of affairs, regarded John with suspicion, (Ant. 18. 5:2;) and
it is possible that this may have been the pretext on which the tyrant excused
his crime, or that such a report may have been in circulation; for it frequently
happens that various motives are assigned for unjust violence and cruelty. The
true state of the fact, however, is pointed out by the Evangelists: Herod was
offended at the holy man, because he had been reproved by him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Josephus is mistaken in supposing that Herodias was
carried off, not from his brother Philip, but from Herod, King of Chalcis, his
uncle, (Ant. 18:5:4.) For not only was the crime still recent when the
Evangelists wrote, but it was committed before the eyes of all. What is
elsewhere stated by Josephus, (Ant. 18:4:6,) that Philip was a person of amiable
dispositions, emboldened Herod, I have no doubt, to expect that an outrage
committed on a mild, gentle, and peaceable man, would pass with impunity.
Another probable conjecture may be mentioned. There is greater reason to suppose
that Herodias was married to her uncle Philip than to her grand-uncle, her
grandfather&#8217;s brother, who must have been at that time in the decrepitude
of old age. Now Herod Antipas (who is here mentioned) and Philip were not
brothers by the same mother; for Herod was the son of Marthaca, third wife of
Herod the Great, and Philip was the son of Cleopatra. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f352</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To return to the Evangelists, they tell us that John
was thrown into prison, because he had reproved Herod&#8217;s crime with greater
freedom than the ferocity of the tyrant would endure. The atrocious character of
the deed was in itself sufficiently detestable and infamous; for not only did he
keep in his own house another man&#8217;s wife, whom he had torn away from
lawful wedlock, but the person on whom he had committed this outrage was his own
brother. When, in addition to this, he is freely reproved by John, Herod has
some reason to fear that sedition will suddenly break out. His lust did not
allow him to correct his fault; but having imprisoned the prophet of God, he
promises to himself repose and liberty. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f353</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Ignorance of history has led many persons into a
fruitless debate; &#8220;Have I a right to marry the woman who was formerly
married to my brother?&#8221; Though the modesty of nature recoils from such a
marriage, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f354</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> yet
John condemns the rape still more than the incest; for it was by violence or by
stratagem 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f355</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
Herod had deprived his brother of his lawful wife: and otherwise it would have
been less lawful for him to marry his niece than to marry his brother&#8217;s
widow. There cannot be a doubt, that a crime so flagrant was universally blamed.
But others loaded Herod with their curses in his absence. John alone comes into
his presence, and reproves him boldly to his face, if by any means he may be
brought to repentance. Hence we learn with what unshaken fortitude the servants
of God ought to be armed when they have to do with princes; for in almost every
court hypocrisy and servile flattery are prevalent; and the ears of princes,
having been accustomed to this smooth language, do not tolerate any voice which
reproves their vices with any severity. But as a prophet of God ought not to
overlook so shocking a crime, John steps forward, though a disagreeable and
unwelcome adviser, and, rather than fail in his duty, scruples not to incur the
frown of the tyrant, even though he knew Herod to be so strongly held by the
snares of the prostitute, that he could scarcely be moved from his
purpose.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And though he wished to put him
to death.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is some appearance of
contradiction between the words of <i>Matthew </i>and <i>Mark: </i>for the
former says that Herod was desirous to commit this shocking murder, but was
restrained by the fear of the people; while the latter charges Herodias alone
with this cruelty. But the difficulty is soon removed. At first Herod would have
been unwilling, if a stronger necessity had not compelled him reluctantly to do
so, to put to death the holy man; because he regarded him with reverence, and,
indeed, was prevented by religious scruples from practising such atrocious
cruelty against a prophet of God; and that he afterwards shook off this fear of
God, in consequence of the incessant urgency of Herodias; but that afterwards,
when infuriated by that demon he longed for the death of the holy man, he was
withheld by a new restraint, because he dreaded on his own account a popular
commotion. And here we must attend to the words of Mark,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Herodias lay in wait for
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f356</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>which imply, that as Herod was not of himself sufficiently disposed to
commit the murder, she either attempted to gain him over by indirect wiles, or
labored to find some secret method of putting the holy man to death. I am more
disposed to adopt the former view, that she employed stratagems for influencing
the mind of her husband, but did not succeed, so long as Herod was prevented by
remorse of conscience from pronouncing sentence of death on the holy man. Next
followed another fear that the business of his death should excite the people to
some insurrection. But Mark glances only at what prevented Herod from yielding
immediately to the entreaties of the prostitute; for Herodias would have wished
that, as soon as John was thrown into prison, he should be privately executed.
Herod, on the contrary, reverenced the holy man, so far as even to comply
willingly with his advises: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Herod
feared John</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now the <i>fear </i>which
is here mentioned, was not a <i>dread </i>arising from a mistaken opinion, as we
<i>dread </i>those who have obtained some authority over us, though we reckon
them to be unworthy of the honor. But this <i>fear </i>was a voluntary respect;
for Herod was convinced that he was a holy man and a faithful servant of God,
and therefore did not dare to despise him. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f357</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
this deserves our attention; for though John knew by experience that it was, in
many respects, advantageous for him to have some share in the good wishes of the
tetrarch, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f358</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> yet he
was not afraid to offend him, when he could find no other way of securing that
favor, than by wickedly conniving at a known and disgraceful crime. He might
indeed have protested that he did not at all consult his private interests, and
that he had no other object in view than the public advantage; for it is certain
that he requested nothing from motives of ambition 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f359</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
that Herod yielded to his holy counsels, which had a reference to the lawful
administration of the kingdom. But as he perceives that he has no right to
accept this kind of compensation, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f360</font></sup><font face="Palatino">which
would procure for him some kind offices by betraying the truth, he chooses
rather to turn a friend into an enemy than to encourage, by flattery or silence,
an evil which he is laid under the necessity of reproving with
severity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">John has thus, by his example, furnished an undoubted
rule for pious teachers, not to wink at the faults of princes, so as to purchase
their favor at this price, how advantageous soever that favor might appear to be
to the public interests. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f361</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
Herod, on the other hand, the Spirit of God exhibits, as in a mirror, how
frequently it happens that those who do not sincerely worship God are
nevertheless willing, in some measure, to obey His commands, provided that He
will grant them some indulgence or abatement. But whenever they are hard
pressed, they throw off the yoke, and break out not only into obstinacy, but
into rage. There is no reason, therefore, why they who comply with many sound
advises should be well satisfied with themselves, till they have learned to
yield and surrender themselves unreservedly to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when Herod&#8217;s
birthday was kept.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Evangelists now
begin to relate the stratagem by which Herodias at length succeeded in a design
which she had long meditated, the taking away of John&#8217;s life. The
opportunity was afforded to her by an annual festival, when Herod was
celebrating his birthday. It is scarcely possible that such magnificent
preparations should not draw luxury, pride, unbridled merriment, and other
crimes, and likewise many other evils, along with them. Not that there is any
thing wrong in the mere act of preparing an expensive banquet; but such is the
tendency of the human mind to licentiousness, that when the reins are loosened,
they quickly go astray. The ancient custom of observing a birthday every year as
an occasion of joy cannot in itself be disapproved; for that day,<i> </i>as
often as it returns, reminds each of us to give thanks to God, who brought us
into this world, and has permitted us, in his kindness, to spend many years in
it; next, to bring to our recollection how improperly and uselessly the time
which God granted to us has been permitted to pass away; and, lastly, that we
ought to commit ourselves to the protection of the same God for the remainder of
our life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But nothing is so pure that the world shall not taint
it with its own vices. A <i>birthday, </i>which ought to have been held sacred,
is profaned by the greater part of men with disgraceful abuses; and there is
scarcely a single entertainment at all costly that is free from wicked
debauchery. First, men drink more freely; next, the door is opened to filthy and
immodest conversation; and, lastly, no moderation is observed. This was the
reason why the patriarch Job was in the habit of offering sacrifices, while his
sons were feasting alternately in each other&#8217;s houses,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;180105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
1:5.) It was because he thought that, when the guests invite one another to
mirth, they are far from maintaining due moderation, and sin in a variety of
ways.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus it happened that Herod, intending to give a rich
entertainment to his guests, permitted his wife&#8217;s daughter to dance.
Hence, too, it appears what sort of discipline existed at his court; for, though
most people at that time thought themselves at liberty to dance, yet for a
marriageable young woman to dance was a shameful display of the impudence of the
strumpet. But the unchaste Herodias had moulded her daughter Salome to her own
manners in such a manner that she might not bring disgrace upon her. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f362</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
what was the consequence? The wicked murder of a holy prophet. The heat of wine
had such an influence on Herod, that, forgetting gravity and prudence, he
promised to a dancing girl, that he would give her
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>even to the half of his
kingdom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A shameful example truly, that
a drunken king not only permits himself to behold with approbation a spectacle 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f363</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which
was disgraceful to his family, but holds out such a reward! Let us therefore
learn to be careful in anticipating and resisting the devil, lest he entangle us
in such snares.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark 6:24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And she went out, and said to her
mother</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We need not wonder that Herodias
attached so much importance to John&#8217;s death. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f364</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
conjecture thrown out by some&#8212;that she was actuated by revenge,&#8212;is
not at all probable. It was rather the dread of being cast off that inflamed and
tormented her; as it usually happens that, when adulterers are visited with
feelings of uneasiness, they become ashamed of their own lust. But she hoped
that this crime would bind Herod more closely to her than ever, if the disgrace
of a pretended marriage were washed out by the blood of the prophet. That her
power might be more secure for the future, she longed for the death of that man
whom she imagined to be her only opponent; and this shows us the wretched
anxiety by which a bad conscience is always tormented. John was detained in
prison, and the haughty and cruel woman might have issued orders that no man
should converse with or approach him; and yet she has no rest, but is oppressed
with anxiety and alarm, till the prophet be removed out of the way. This
likewise serves to show the power of the word of God, that the voice of the holy
man, even when shut up in prison, wounds and tortures in the keenest manner the
mind of the king&#8217;s wife. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f365</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And the king being sorry.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>His heart, as
we have said, was no longer influenced by religious sentiments; but, foreseeing
the detestation that will be excited by such a crime, he dreads both the loss of
character and positive harm, and consequently repents of his levity. And yet he
has not the courage to give a refusal to a dancing girl, lest he should incur
the reproach of unsteadiness; as if it were more dishonorable to retract a rash
and foolish promise than to persist in a heinous crime. With the wonted vanity
of kings, he does not choose that what he has once uttered shall be recalled,
and orders that the prophet shall be instantly slain. We infer that Herod was at
that time supping in the castle of Macherus, where, Josephus tells us, John was
imprisoned, (Ant. 18. 5:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of the oath, and of
those who sat at table with him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It
deserves our attention that the Evangelists state this to be the reason of his
grief; and hence we infer that, though he had sworn a hundred times, yet if
there had been no witness, he would not have held by his oath. No inward
feelings of religion constrained Herod to do this, but the mere love of power
drove him headlong; for he reckoned that he would sink in the estimation of
those who were present, if he did not fulfill his engagement. Thus it frequently
happens that ungodly men fail to perform their duty, because they do not look to
God, but are only intent on this object, that they may not incur the reproaches
of men. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f366</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
though Herod had kept before his eyes the sacredness of an oath alone, and not
the dread of the opinion of men, he committed a more heinous offense in
fulfilling a foolish promise than if he had violated his oath. First, he was
deeply in fault for such haste in swearing; for the design of an oath is to
confirm a promise in a doubtful matter. Next, when it appeared that he could not
be relieved from his engagement without involving himself in an aggravated
crime, he had no right to implicate the sacred name of God in such wickedness;
for what could be more at variance with the nature of God than to lend his
countenance to a shocking murder? If a private loss is at stake, let him who has
made a rash oath suffer the punishment of his folly; but, when a man has taken
the name of God in vain, let him beware of doubling his guilt by employing this
as a pretense for committing some enormous crime. Hence it follows, that
monastic vows, which are attended by open impiety, do not bind the conscience
any more than the enchantments of magicians; for it is not the will of God that
his sacred name shall give support to what is sinful. But this passage teaches
us, that we ought to beware of making promises without consideration; and next,
that lightness must not be followed by obstinacy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And gave it to the
girl.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was an additional aggravation
of this detestable crime, that the head of the holy man was made, after his
death, a matter of sport. But in this way the Lord sometimes gives up his people
to the pride of wicked men, till he at length makes it evident that their blood
is <i>precious in his sight
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
116:15.)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Herodias</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is delighted with the thought of having gained her wicked purpose, and
cruelly triumphs over her reprover; but when afterwards, stripped of her wealth,
and not only deprived of the title of queen, but driven from her native country,
and destitute of all means of support, she dragged out a wretched life in
poverty and banishment, she presented a spectacle gratifying to angels and to
all good people. When we perceive that the guests are compelled to pollute their
eyes by beholding this detestable exhibition, let us learn from it, that those
who sit at the tables of kings are often involved in many crimes; for, granting
that the table is not stained by murder, every thing partakes so largely of all
sorts of wickedness, that they who approach to it must be at least given up to
debauchery.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His disciples
came.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>One thing only remained to
complete the woman&#8217;s cruelty. It was, to leave the corpse of the holy man
unburied; for there is reason to believe that, when
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
disciples</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>performed this duty, the
attendants of the tyrant had thrown out the corpse. Though the honor of burial
is of no importance to the dead, yet it is the will of the Lord that we should
observe this ceremony as a token of the last resurrection; and therefore God was
pleased with the carefulness which was manifested by the disciples, when they
came to commit to the tomb the body of their master. Moreover, it was an
attestation of their piety; for in this way they declared that the doctrine of
their master continued to have a firm hold of their hearts after his death. This
confession was therefore worthy of praise, more especially as it was not without
danger; for they could not do honor to a man who had been put to death by the
executioner without exciting against themselves the rage of the
tyrant.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 14:13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When Jesus heard it.
John,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>who relates the same narrative,
does not mention the reason why Jesus crossed over to the opposite bank, (6: 5.)
<i>Mark </i>and <i>Luke </i>differ somewhat from <i>Matthew; </i>for they
describe the occasion of the journey to have been to give some repose to his
disciples, after that they had returned from their embassy. But there is no
contradiction here; for it is possible that he intended to withdraw his
disciples into a desert place, in order that he might be more at leisure to
train them for higher labors, and that, about the same time, an additional
reason arose out of the death of John. Minds which were still feeble might have
been terrified by the death of John, learning from the melancholy end of that
eminent prophet what condition awaited them all. Certainly, as it was formerly
related that, when John was imprisoned, Christ removed from Herod&#8217;s
territory, in order to avoid his fury for the time, so we may now infer that
Christ, in order to keep his trembling disciples at a distance from the flame,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>withdrew into a desert
place.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How long the Apostles were employed in their first
embassy it is not in our power to determine; for the Evangelists, as we have
formerly remarked, either did not attend to dates, or did not observe them with
great exactness. I think it highly probable that their commission to proclaim
the kingdom of Christ was not confined to a single occasion, but that, as
opportunities were offered, they either repeated their visit to some places, or
went to others after a lapse of time. The words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they came together to
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>I look upon as meaning that ever
afterwards they were his constant attendants; as if the Evangelist had said,
that they did not leave their Master so as to be individually and constantly
employed in the ordinary office of teaching, but that, having discharged a
temporary commission, they went back to school to make greater advances in
learning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They followed him on foot out of
the cities.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Though Christ, who foresaw
all things before they happened, was in no respect ignorant of what would take
place, yet he wished, as a man, to forewarn his disciples, that the fact might
testify the anxiety which he had about them. The vast crowd that had assembled
shows how widely his fame was spread in every direction: and this left the Jews
without excuse in depriving themselves, by their own carelessness, of the
salvation which was offered to them; for even out of this great multitude, which
was inflamed by a sudden zeal to follow Christ, it is evident from what is
stated by John, (6:66, 12:37) that not more than a very small number yielded a
true and steady adherence to his doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He was moved with compassion
towards them. </i></font><font face="Palatino">The other two Evangelists, and
particularly Mark, state more clearly the reason why this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>compassion</i></font><font face="Palatino">
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sumpa&gt;qeia</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>was awakened in the mind of Christ. It was because he saw famishing souls,
whom the warmth of zeal had carried away from their homes and led into a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>desert
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This scarcity of teaching
indicated a wretched state of disorder; and accordingly Mark says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus was moved with compassion
towards them, because they were as sheep not having a
shepherd</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Not that, as to his Divine
nature, he looked upon them all as sheep, but that, as man, he judged according
to the present aspect of the case. It was no small manifestation of piety that
they left their own homes, and flocked in crowds to the Prophet of God, though
he purposely concealed himself from them. Besides, it ought to be remarked, that
Christ was mindful of the character which he sustained; for he had been
commanded to discharge the duties of a public teacher, and was therefore bound
to look upon all the Jews, for the time being, as belonging to the flock of God
and to the Church, till they withdrew from it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So strongly was Christ moved by this feeling of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>compassion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that though, in common with his disciples, he was fatigued and almost worn
out by uninterrupted toil, he did not spare himself. He had endeavored to obtain
some relaxation, and that on his own account as well as for the sake of his
disciples; but when urgent duty calls him to additional labor, he willingly lays
aside that private consideration, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f374</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
devotes himself to teaching the multitudes. Although he has now laid aside those
feelings which belonged to him as a mortal man, yet there is no reason to doubt
that he looks down from heaven on poor sheep that have no shepherd, provided
they ask relief of their wants. Mark says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he began to teach them MANY
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, he spent a long time in
preaching, that they might reap some lasting advantage. Luke says, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spoke to them concerning the
Kingdom of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which amounts to the
same thing. Matthew makes no mention of any thing but miracles, because they
were of great importance in establishing Christ&#8217;s reputation; but it may
naturally be concluded that he did not leave out doctrine, which was a matter of
the highest importance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the evening was drawing
on.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The disciples had now lost their
object, and they see that Christ is again absorbed in teaching, while the
multitudes are so eager to receive instruction that they do not think of
retiring. They<i> </i>therefore advise that for the sake of attending to their
bodily wants, Christ should </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>send
them away into the neighboring villages.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>He had purposely delayed till now the miracle which he intended to perform;
first, that his disciples might consider it more attentively, and might thus
derive from it greater advantage; and next, that the very circumstance of the
time might convince them that, though he does not prevent, and even does not
immediately supply, the wants of his people, yet he never ceases to care for
them, but has always at hand the assistance which he affords at the very time
when it is required.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Give you to them something to
eat.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As a fuller exposition of this
miracle will be found at the sixth chapter of John&#8217;s Gospel, instead of
troubling my readers with a repetition of what I have said, I would rather send
them to that exposition; but rather than pass over this passage entirely, I
shall offer a brief recapitulation. Hitherto Christ had bestowed his whole
attention on feeding souls, but now he includes within his duties as a shepherd
the care even of their bodies. And in this way he confirms his own saying, that
to those who</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">seek the kingdom of God,
and his righteousness,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"> all other
things will be added,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400633&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
6:33.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have no right, indeed, to expect that Christ will
always follow this method of supplying the hungry and thirsty with food; but it
is certain that he will never permit his own people to want the necessaries of
life, but will stretch out his hand from heaven, whenever he shall see it to be
necessary to relieve their necessities. Those who wish to have Christ for their
provider, must first learn not to long for refined luxuries, but to be satisfied
with barley-bread.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Christ commanded that the people should sit down
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
companies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and he did so, first, that by
this arrangement of the ranks the miracle might be more manifest; secondly, that
the number of the men might be more easily ascertained, and that, while they
looked at each other, they might in their turn bear testimony to this heavenly
favor. Thirdly, perceiving that his disciples were anxious, he intended to make
trial of their obedience by giving them an injunction which at first sight
appeared to be absurd; for, as no provisions were at hand, there was reason to
wonder why Christ was making arrangements that resembled a feast. To the same
purpose is what follows, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
gave them the loaves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in order that in
their hands the astonishing increase might take place, and that they might thus
be the ministers of Christ&#8217;s divine power; for as if it had been of small
importance that they should be eye-witnesses, Christ determined that his power
should be handled by them. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f375</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
<i>T</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wo hundred
pence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>according to the computation of
Budaeus, are worth about thirty-four French <i>livres;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f376</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and so when the disciples speak of what is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sufficient for them, that every
one of them may take a little,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>they
calculate at the rate of a farthing for each individual. Forming so high an
estimate of the sum of money that would be required to purchase bread barely
sufficient for procuring a morsel to the people, they are entitled to no small
praise for their obedience, when they implicitly comply with the command of
Christ, and leave the result to his disposal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He
blessed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this passage, as in many
others, <i>blessing</i> denotes thanksgiving. Now Christ has taught us, by his
example, that we cannot partake of our food with holiness and purity, unless we
express our gratitude to God, from whose hand it comes to us. Accordingly, Paul
tells us, that every kind of food which God bestows upon us is <i>sanctifed by
the word of God and prayer,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540405&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:5;) by which he means, that brutal men, who do not regard by faith the
blessing of God, and do not offer to him thanksgiving, corrupt and pollute by
the filth of their unbelief all that is by nature pure; and, on the other hand,
that they are corrupted and defiled by the food which they swallow, because to
unbelievers nothing is clean. Christ has therefore laid down for his followers
the proper manner of taking food, that they may not profane their own persons
and the gifts of God by wicked sacrilege.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Raising his eyes towards
heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This expresses warm and earnest
supplication. Not that such an attitude is at all times necessary when we pray,
but because the Son of God did not choose to disregard the outward forms which
are fitted to aid human weakness. It ought also to be taken into account, that
<i>to </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>raise the
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>upwards is an excitement well
fitted to arouse us from sloth, when our minds are too strongly fixed on the
earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And carried away what was
left.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The <i>fragments </i>that remained
after satisfying so vast a multitude of men were more than twelve times larger
in quantity than what was at first put into their hands, and this contributed
not a little to the splendor of the miracle. In this way all came to know that
the power of Christ had not only created out of nothing the food that was
necessary for immediate use, but that, if it should be required, there was also
provision for future wants; and, in a word, Christ intended that, after the
miracle had been wrought, a striking proof of it should still remain, which,
after being refreshed by food, they might contemplate at
leisure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now though Christ does not every day multiply our
bread, or feed men without the labor of their hands or the cultivation of their
fields, the advantage of this narrative extends even to us. If we do not
perceive that it is the blessing of God which multiplies the corn, that we may
have a sufficiency of food, the only obstacle is, our own indolence and
ingratitude. That, after we have been supported by the annual produce, there
remains seed for the following year, and that this could not have happened but
for an increase from heaven, each of us would easily perceive, were he not
hindered by that very depravity which blinds the eyes both of the mind and of
the flesh, so as not to see a manifest work of God. Christ intended to declare
that, as all things have been delivered into his hands by the Father, so the
food which we eat proceeds from his grace.</font><br></div>

other side. Now in this they testify their great veneration for him, when,
contrary to their own opinions, they yield to his command and obey it. And,
indeed, it had an appearance of absurdity, that he should remain alone
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in a desert
place</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>when night was approaching. But
so much the greater commendation is due to the submissiveness of those who set a
higher value on the authority of their heavenly teacher than on all that could
be pleaded on the other side. And, indeed, we do not truly and perfectly obey
God, unless we implicitly follow whatever he commands, though our feelings may
be opposed to it. There is always the best reason, no doubt, for every thing
that God does; but he often conceals it from us for a time, in order to instruct
us not to be wise in ourselves, but to depend entirely on the expression of his
will. And thus Christ </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>constrained
his disciples</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to cross over, in order to
train them to that rule of obedience which I have mentioned; though there cannot
be a doubt that he intended to prepare the way for the miracle which will
immediately come under our consideration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He went up into a mountain
alone.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is probable that the Son of
God, who was fully aware of the tempest that was coming on, did not neglect the
safety of his disciples in his prayers; and yet we naturally wonder that he did
not rather prevent the danger than employ himself in prayer. But in discharging
all the parts of his office as Mediator, he showed himself to be God and man,
and exhibited proofs of both natures, as opportunities occurred. Though he had
all things at his disposal, he showed himself to be a man by praying; and this
he did not hypocritically, but manifested sincere and human affection towards
us. In this manner his divine majesty was for a time concealed, but was
afterwards displayed at the proper time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>going up into the

that he might have more leisure for praying when removed from all noise. We know
how easily the slightest interruptions destroy the ardor of prayer, or at least
make it languish and cool. Though Christ was in no danger of this fault, yet he
intended to warn us by his example, that we ought to be exceedingly careful to
avail ourselves of every assistance for setting our minds free from all the
snares of the world, that we may look direct towards heaven. Now in this respect
solitude has a powerful influence, by disposing those who engage in prayer, when
God is their only witness, to be more on their guard, to pour their heart into
his bosom, to be more diligent in self-examination; and, in a
word&#8212;remembering that they have to do with God&#8212;to rise above
themselves. At the same time, it must be observed, that he did not lay down a
fixed rule, as if we were never permitted to pray except in retirement; for Paul
enjoins us to <i>pray everywhere, lifting up clean hands,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 2:8;) and Christ himself sometimes prayed in presence of others, and
even instructed his disciples to assemble together for offering social prayer.
But that permission to pray in all places does not hinder them from engaging in
secret prayer at proper seasons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The ship was now in the midst
of the sea.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The reader will find this
narrative expounded by me at the sixth chapter of John&#8217;s Gospel, and
therefore I shall treat it more briefly here. When Christ permitted his
disciples to be tossed about in a perilous condition, for a time, by an opposing
storm, it was to fix their attention more powerfully on the assistance which he
brought to them. For the adverse wind arose about midnight, or at least a little
before it, and Christ appears <i>about the fourth watch, </i>that is, three
hours before sunrise. Their arms were not more fatigued by rowing than their
faith was shaken by grievous terrors. But when they were urged by strong
necessity to desire the presence of their Master, it showed very extraordinary
stupidity to be alarmed at his appearance as if he had been a
ghost.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this reason Mark tells us,
that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> their heart was
blinded,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> they understood not about
the loaves;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for that miracle had given
abundant evidence that Christ possessed divine power to assist his followers,
and that he was careful to assist them, when necessity required. Justly,
therefore, are they now charged with stupidity in not immediately recollecting
that heavenly power, having beheld, on the preceding day, so astonishing a proof
of it, which ought to have been still before their eyes. It is, no doubt, true,
that their blameworthy slowness of apprehension was the reason why they were
astonished; for they had not profited, as they ought to have done, by other and
preceding miracles. But the principal charge brought against them is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blindness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>in allowing so recent an exhibition to fade from their memory, or rather in
not directing their mind to the contemplation of Christ&#8217;s divinity, of
which the multiplication of the loaves was a sufficiently bright
mirror.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Two things are expressed by the words of Mark; first,
that they did not properly consider the glory of Christ, which was exhibited in
the multiplication of the loaves; and, secondly, a reason is assigned, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their heart was
blinded.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This appears to have been
added, not only as an aggravation of their fault, but as a warning to us
respecting the corruption of our understanding, that we may seek from the Lord
new eyes. It certainly was a proof&#8212;as I have lately mentioned&#8212;of
brutal ignorance, that they did not perceive the power of God, when they might
almost feel it with their hands; but as the whole human race labors under the
same disease, Mark purposely mentions <i>blindness, </i>in order to inform us
that it is no new thing if men have their eyes closed against the manifest works
of God, till they are enlightened from above; as Moses also
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The Lord hath not yet
given thee a heart to understand,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
29:4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now though the word <i>heart </i>more frequently
denotes the will or the seat of the affections, yet here, as in that passage
which I have now quoted from Moses, it is put for the
understanding.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But immediately Jesus spake
to them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As Christ is not known to be a
Deliverer till he actually makes his appearance, he speaks, and desires his
disciples to recognize him. That confidence, to which he exhorts them, is
represented by him as founded on his presence; plainly implying that, since they
perceive him to be present with them, there are abundant grounds of hope. But as
terror had already overpowered their minds, he corrects that terror, lest it
should hinder or abate their confidence: not that they could all at once lay
aside fear and experience unmingled joy, but because it was necessary that the
fear which had seized them should be allayed, that it might not destroy their
confidence. Although to the reprobate the voice of the Son of God is deadly, and
his presence appalling, yet the effect which they produce on believers is here
described to us as widely different. They cause inward peace and strong
confidence to hold the sway over our hearts, that we may not yield to carnal
fears. But the reason why we are disturbed by unfounded and sudden alarms is,
that our ingratitude and wickedness prevent us from employing as shields the
innumerable gifts of God, which, if they were turned to proper account, would
give us all necessary support. Now though Christ appeared at the proper time for
rendering assistance, yet the storm did not immediately cease, till the
disciples were more fully aroused both to desire and to expect his grace. And
this deserves our attention, as conveying the instruction, that there are good
reasons why the Lord frequently delays to bestow that deliverance which he has
ready at hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Peter
answering.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The condition which he lays
down shows that his faith was not yet fully settled.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If it is thou, says he, bid me
come to thee on the water.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But he had
heard Christ speak. Why then does he still argue with himself under doubt and
perplexity? While his faith is so small and weak, a wish not well considered
bursts into a flame. He ought rather to have judged of himself according to his
capacity, and to have supplicated from Christ an increase of faith, that by its
guidance and direction he might walk over seas and mountains. But now, without
the wings of faith, he desires to fly at will; and though the voice of Christ
has not its due weight in his heart, he desires that the waters should be firm
under his feet. And yet there is no room to doubt that this longing sprung from
a good principle; but as it degenerates into a faulty excess, it cannot be
applauded as good.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence too it happens that Peter immediately begins to
smart for his rashness. Let believers, therefore, instructed by his example,
beware of excessive haste. Wherever the Lord calls, we ought to run with
alacrity; but whoever proceeds farther, will learn from the mournful result what
it is to overleap the bounds which the Lord has prescribed. Yet it may be asked,
Why does Christ comply with Peter&#8217;s wish? for by so doing he seems to
approve of it. But the answer is obvious. In many eases God promotes our
interests better by refusing our requests; but at times he yields to us, that by
experience we may be the more fully convinced of our own folly. In this manner,
it happens every day that, by granting to those who believe in him more than is
actually needed, he trains them to modesty and sober-mindedness for the future.
Besides, this was of advantage to Peter and to the other disciples, and it is of
advantage to us at the present day. The power of Christ shone more brightly in
the person of Peter, when he admitted him as a companion, than if he had walked
alone on the waters. But Peter knows, and the rest see plainly, that, when he
does not rest with a firm faith, and rely on the Lord, the secret power of God,
which formerly made the water solid, begins to disappear; and yet Christ dealt
gently with him by not permitting him to sink entirely under the waters. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f379</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Both of
these things happen to us; for as Peter was no sooner seized with fear than he
began to sink, so the fleeting and transitory thoughts of the flesh immediately
cause us to sink in the midst of our course of employments. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f380</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Meanwhile, the Lord indulges our weakness, and stretches out his hand, that the
waters may not swallow us up altogether. It must also be observed that Peter,
when he perceives the unhappy and painful consequences of his rashness, betakes
himself to the mercy of Christ. And we too, though enduring just punishment,
ought to betake ourselves to him, that he may have compassion on us, and bestow
the aid of which we are unworthy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O man of little
faith.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>While our Lord kindly preserves
Peter, he does not connive at Peter&#8217;s fault. Such is the object of the
chastisement administered, when Peter is blamed for the weakness of his faith.
But a question arises, Does every kind of fear give evidence of a weakness of
faith? for Christ&#8217;s words seem to imply that, where faith reigns, there is
no room for doubt. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f381</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I
reply: Christ reproves here that kind of doubt which was directly opposed to
faith. A man may sometimes doubt without any fault on his part; and that is,
when the word of the Lord does not speak with certainty on the matter. But the
case was quite different with Peter, who had received an express command from
Christ, and had already experienced his power, and yet leaves that twofold
support, and falls into foolish and wicked fear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>33.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They that were in the
ship.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I understand these words to refer
not only to the disciples, but to the sailors and other passengers. So then
those who had not yet declared that he was their Master, instantly acknowledge
that he is the Son of God, and by this term render to him the honor of the
Messiah. Though at that time this lofty <i>mystery </i>was not generally known,
how <i>God was </i>to be <i>manifested in the flesh,

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They came into the country of
Gennesareth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Evangelists give that
designation to the country which borrowed its name from the lake, though it is
uncertain if it was not rather the name of the country that was bestowed on the
lake; but that is a matter of little consequence. Our chief business is, to
attend to the object which the Evangelists have in view. It is, to show that the
glory of Christ was attested not by one or by another miracle, but that this
part of Judea was filled with innumerable proofs of it, the report of which
might easily be carried to Jerusalem and to other towns in every direction.
Hence we infer, that singularly base and wicked must have been the ingratitude
of that nation which wickedly shut its eyes from perceiving, and even
endeavored, as far as lay in its power, to extinguish the brightness of the
divine glory which was exhibited before them. Our present business is, to
perceive,<i> </i>amidst so large an assemblage of miracles, the reason why
Christ came, which was, that he might offer himself as a physician to heal all
the diseases of all men 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f384</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For we
must bear in mind what Matthew had formerly quoted from the Prophet Isaiah,
(53:4,) that in healing bodies he shadowed out something greater, namely, that
he restores our souls to health, and that it is his peculiar office to remove
spiritual diseases. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f385</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He is
not now an inhabitant of the earth; but it is certain that, now that he is in
heaven, he is authorized to bestow those favors of which he then exhibited a
visible proof. Now as we labor under every kind of diseases till he heal us, let
each of us not only present himself to him, but endeavor to bring others who
need the same remedy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they might touch the

they were under the influence of some superstition, when they limited the grace

honor, since they did not expect any efficacy

that lends countenance to the views of those who seek the grace of God in wood,
or nails, or robes; while Scripture expressly declares, that we have no right to
form any conception respecting Christ but what is spiritual and consistent with
his heavenly glory. The weakness of those who, not knowing that Christ is God,
desired to make a nearer approach to him, was endured for a time. Now that he
fills heaven and earth with the sweet savor of his grace, we must
embrace&#8212;not with hands or eyes, but by faith&#8212;the salvation which he
offers to us from heaven.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 15:1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then scribes and
Pharisees.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the fault that is here
corrected is not only common but highly dangerous, the passage is particularly
worthy of our attention. We see the extraordinary insolence that is displayed by
men as to the form and manner of worshipping God; for they are perpetually
contriving new modes of worship, and when any one wishes to be thought wiser
than others, he displays his ingenuity on this subject. I speak not of
foreigners, but of the very domestics of the Church, on whom God has conferred
the peculiar honor of declaring with their lips the rule of godliness. God has
laid down the manner in which he wishes that we should worship him, and has
included in his law the perfection of holiness. Yet a vast number of men, as if
it were a light and trivial matter to obey God and to keep what he enjoins,
collect for themselves, on every hand, many additions. Those who occupy places
of authority bring forward their inventions for this purpose, as if they were in
possession of something more perfect than the word of the Lord. This is followed
by the slow growth of tyranny; for, when men have once assumed to themselves the
right to issue commands, they demand a rigid adherence to their laws, and do not
allow the smallest iota to be left out, either through contempt or through
forgetfulness. The world cannot endure lawful authority, and most violently
rebels against enduring the Lord&#8217;s yoke, and yet easily and willingly
becomes entangled in the snares of vain traditions; nay, such bondage appears to
be, in the case of many, an object of desire. Meanwhile, the worship of God is
corrupted, of which the first and leading principle is obedience. The authority
of men is preferred to the command of God. Sternly, and therefore tyrannically,
are the common people compelled to give their whole attention to trifles. This
passage teaches us, first, that all modes of worship invented by men are
displeasing to God, because he chooses that he alone shall be heard, in order to
train and instruct us in true godliness according to his own pleasure; secondly,
that those who are not satisfied with the only law of God, and weary themselves
by attending to the traditions of men, are uselessly employed; thirdly, that an
outrage is committed against God, when the inventions of men are so highly
extolled, that the majesty of his law is almost lowered, or at least the
reverence for it is abated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Scribes who had come from
Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>With what design those
<i>scribes </i>came to Jesus is not stated; but I think it probable that their
attention was excited by his fame, and that they came with the desire of
receiving instruction, provided that they should approve of him as a competent
teacher; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f388</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> though
it is possible that they were sent to spy. However that may be, as they had
brought their haughty disdain along with them, they are easily provoked by the
slightest offense to bite or snarl at Christ. Hence we see with what difficulty
those who are influenced by ambition and the lust of power are brought to submit
to sound doctrine. Those especially whose attachment to ceremonies has been
strengthened by long practice cannot endure any novelty, but loudly condemn
every thing to which they have not been accustomed. In short, any thing more
haughty or more disdainful than this class of men cannot be
imagined.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Both Evangelists mention that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>scribes and

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>scribes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>scribes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>belonged to various sects, but that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pharisees</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>were the leaders, because they occupied an honorable station, and at that
time held the government. That the Pharisees should be the first to take offense
at disregard of the laws of which they were authors ought not to excite
surprise; for, as we have said, though they boasted that they were expounders of
the law, and though their name was derived from that circumstance, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f389</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they
had corrupted by their inventions the purity of the word of God. All the
traditions that then existed among the Jews had come out of their workshop; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f390</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
this was the reason why they displayed more than ordinary zeal and bitterness in
defending them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why do thy disciples
transgress?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When we speak of human
traditions, this question has no reference to political laws, the use and object
of which are widely different from enjoining the manner in which we ought to
worship God. But as there are various kinds of human traditions, we must make
some distinction among them. Some are manifestly wicked, for they inculcate acts
of worship which are wicked and diametrically opposed to the word of God. Others
of them mingle profane trifles with the worship of God, and corrupt its purity.
Others, which are more plausible, and are not chargeable with any remarkable
fault, are condemned on this ground., that they are imagined to be necessary to
the worship of God; and thus there is a departure from sincere obedience to God
alone, and a snare is laid for the conscience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To this last description the present passage
unquestionably relates; for the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>washing of
hands,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>on which the Pharisees insisted,
could not in itself be charged with wicked superstition; otherwise Christ would
not have permitted the water-pots to be used at the marriage,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
2:6,) if it had not been an allowable ceremony; but the fault lay in this, that
they did not think that God could be properly worshipped in any other way. It
was not without a specious pretext that the practice of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>washings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>was first introduced. We know how rigidly the Law of God demands outward
cleanness; not that the Lord intended that this should occupy the whole
attention of his servants, but that they might be more careful to guard against
every spiritual defilement. But in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>washings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>the Law preserved some moderation. Next came teachers, who thought that they
would not be reckoned sufficiently acute, if they did not make some appendage to
the word of God; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f391</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
hence arose
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>washings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of which no mention was made in the Law. The legislators themselves did not
give out that they delivered any thing new, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f392</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
only that they administered cautions, which would be of service to assist in
keeping the Law of God. But this was immediately followed by great abuse, when
ceremonies introduced by men began to be regarded as a part of divine worship;
and again, when in matters that were free and voluntary uniformity was
absolutely enjoined. For it was always the will of God, as we have already said,
that he should be worshipped according to the rule laid down in his word, and
therefore no addition to his Law can be endured. Now as he permits believers to
have outward ceremonies, by means of which they may perform the exercises of
godliness, so he does not suffer them to mix up those ceremonies with his own
word, as if religion consisted in them. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f393</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they wash not their
hands.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The ground of offense is
explained more fully by Mark; but the substance of his explanation is, that many
things were practiced by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
scribes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which they had voluntarily
undertaken to keep. They were secondary laws invented by the curiosity of men,
as if the plain command of God were not enough. God commanded that those who had
contracted any defilement should wash themselves,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
11:25,28;) and this extended to cups, and pots, and raiment, and other articles
of household furniture,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031132&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
11:32,) that they might not touch any thing that was polluted or unclean. But to
invent other ablutions was idle and useless. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f394</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They
were not destitute of plausibility, as Paul tells us that the inventions of men
have <i>an appearance of wisdom,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:23;) but if they had rested in the Law of God alone, that modesty would have
been more agreeable to Him than solicitude about small matters.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They were desirous to warn a person not to take food
while he was unclean, through want of consideration; but the Lord reckoned it
enough to wash away those defilements of which they were aware. Besides, no end
or limit could be set to such cautions; for they could scarcely move a finger
without contracting some new spot or stain. But a far worse abuse lay in this,
that the consciences of men were tormented with scruples which led them to
regard every person as chargeable with pollution, who did not on every occasion
wash his body with water. In persons who belonged to a private rank they would
perhaps have overlooked the neglect of this ceremony; but as they had expected
from Christ and his disciples something uncommon and extraordinary, they
reckoned it unbecoming that ceremonies, which were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>traditions of the
elders,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and the practice of which was
held sacred by <i>the scribes, </i>should not be observed by the disciples of a
master who undertook to reform the existing state of things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is a great mistake to compare the sprinkling of
the water of purification, or, as the Papists call it, <i>blessed water,
</i>with the Jewish <i>washing; </i>for, by repeating so frequently the one
baptism,

do all that is in their power to efface it. Besides, this absurd sprinkling is
used for exorcising. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f396</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But if
it were lawful in itself, and were not accompanied by so many abuses, still we

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why do you also
transgress?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There are here two answers
that are given by Christ, the former of which is addressed, as we say, to the
person; while the latter decides as to the fact and the question in hand.
<i>Mark </i>inverts that order; for he first represents Christ as speaking on
the whole subject, and afterwards adds the reproof which is directed against
hypocrites. We shall follow the narrative of Matthew. When the Lord, in his
turn, puts the question to the scribes <i>why </i>they break the Law of God on
account of their traditions, he does not as yet pronounce a direct acquittal of
his disciples from the crime charged against them; but only points out how
improper and unwarrantable is this readiness to take offense. They are
displeased when </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the commandments
of men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>are not observed with exactness;
and how much more criminal is it to spend the whole time in observing them, to
the disregard of the law of God? It is manifest, therefore, that their wrath is
kindled rather by ambition than by a proper kind of zeal, when they thus prefer
men to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>transgress the commandments of
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the meaning of the expression is
easily learned from the context. They did not openly or professedly set aside
the law of God, so as to look upon any thing as lawful which the law had
forbidden; but there was an indirect
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>transgression</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of it, for they permitted duties which God had enjoined to be neglected with
impunity. A plain and familiar instance is adduced by Christ. The <i>commandment
of God </i>is, that children shall honor their parents,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;022012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:12.) Now as the sacred offerings yielded emolument to the priests, the
observance of them was so rigidly enforced, that men were taught to regard it as
a more heinous sin not to make a free-will offering than to defraud a parent of
what was justly due to him. In short, what the Law of God declared to be
voluntary was, in the estimation of the scribes, of higher value than one of the
most important of the commandments of God. Whenever we are so eager to keep the
laws of men as to bestow less care and attention on keeping the law of God
itself, we are held as <i>transgressing </i>it. Shortly afterwards he says, that
they had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>annulled the commandment
of God on account of the traditions of men;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>for the scribes led the people to entertain so strong an attachment to their
own injunctions, that they did not allow them leisure to attend to the word of
God. Again, as they reckoned those persons to have discharged their duty well
who obeyed these injunctions to the letter, hence arose a liberty to commit sin;
for whenever holiness is made to consist in any thing else than in observing the
Law of God, men are led to believe that the law may be violated without
danger.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let any man now consider whether this wickedness does
not at present abound more among the Papists than it formerly did among the
Jews. It is not indeed denied by the Pope, or by the whole of his filthy clergy,
that we ought to obey God; but when we come to the point, we find that they
consider the act of eating a morsel of flesh as nothing less than a capital
crime, while theft or fornication is regarded as a venial fault, and thus, on
account of their traditions, they overturn the Law of God; for it is utterly
insufferable that the enactments of men shall withdraw any part of that
obedience which is due to God alone. Besides, the honor which God commands to be
yielded to parents extends to all the duties of filial piety. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f397</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
latter clause which Christ adds, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he who curseth father or
mother</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>deserves to be put to death, is
intended to inform us, that it is no light or unimportant precept to <i>honor
</i>parents, since the violation of it is so severely punished. And this is no
small aggravation of the guilt of the scribes, that so severe a threatening does
not terrify them from granting an extension of liberty to those who despised
their parents.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But you say,

defective, and is more fully exhibited by Mark, who adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>you suffer them not to do
anything more to their father or to their
mother</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The meaning is, that the scribes
were altogether wrong in acquitting those persons who fail to perform their
duties to their parents, provided that this deficiency be supplied, on their
part, by a voluntary sacrifice, which might have been omitted without offending
God. For we must not understand Christ&#8217;s words to bear that the scribes
had forbidden men to render all proper obedience; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f398</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
they were so eager to pursue their own gain, that children were allowed, in the
meantime, to neglect their duties to their parents.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Well hath Isaiah prophesied
concerning you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Our Lord now proceeds
farther; for he decides on the question in hand, which he divides into two
clauses. The first is, that they relied on outward ceremonies alone, and set no
value on true holiness, which consists in sincere uprightness of heart; and the
second is, that they worshipped God in a wrong way, according to their own
fancy. Now though his reproof of pretended and hypocritical holiness appears
hitherto to be restricted to persons, yet it includes the substance of this
doctrine, from which the full conclusion was, first, that the worship of God is
spiritual, and does not consist in the sprinkling of water, or in any other
ceremony; and, secondly, that there is no reasonable worship of God but what is
directed by the rule of his word. Although Isaiah (29:13) did not prophesy for
futurity alone, but had regard to the men of his own age, yet Christ says that
this prediction relates to the Pharisees and scribes, because they resemble
those ancient hypocrites with whom the prophet had to contend. Christ does not
quote that passage exactly as it stands; but the prophet expressly mentions two
offenses by which the Jews provoked against themselves the divine vengeance.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With their
lips</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>only, and by an outward profession,
they made a pretense of godliness; and, next, they turned aside to modes of
worship invented by men. First, then, it is wicked hypocrisy, when the honor
which men render to God is only in outward appearance; for to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>approach to God with the mouth,
and to honor him with the lips,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>would
not be in itself evil, provided that the heart went before. The substance of
what our Lord states on this subject is, that, since the worship of God is
spiritual, and as nothing pleases him that is not accompanied by the inward
sincerity of the heart, they who make holiness to consist in outward display are
hypocrites.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But in vain do they worship
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The words of the prophet run
literally thus: <i>their fear toward me has been taught by the precept of men.
</i>But Christ has faithfully and accurately given the meaning, that <i>in
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vain is God
worshipped,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>when the will of men is
substituted in the room of doctrine. By these words, all kinds of

</i>as Paul calls it,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:23,) are plainly condemned. For, as we have said, since God chooses to be
worshipped in no other way than according to his own appointment, he cannot
endure new modes of worship to be devised. As soon as men allow themselves to
wander beyond the limits of the Word of God, the more labor and anxiety they
display in worshipping him, the heavier is the condemnation which they draw down
upon themselves; for by such inventions religion is dishonored.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Teaching doctrines, commandments of

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f401</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to
those who are ready to receive instruction, and explains more fully the truth at
which he had formerly glanced, that <i>the kingdom of God does not consist in
meat and drink, </i>as Paul also teaches us,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:17;) for, since outward things are by nature pure, the use of them is free
and pure, and uncleanness is not contracted from the good creatures of God. It
is therefore a general statement, that pollution does not come from without into
a man, but that the fountain is concealed within him. Now when he says that all
the evil actions which any man performs come
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>out of the mouth of
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he employs a <i>synecdoche;</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f402</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>meat and

proceeds from ourselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Knowest thou that the Pharisees
were offended?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the scribes were
presumptuous and rebellious, Christ did not take great pains to pacify them, but
satisfied himself with repelling their hypocrisy and pride. The offense which
they had formerly taken up was doubled, when they perceived that&#8212;not
through oversight, but seemingly on purpose&#8212;Christ despised their
<i>washings </i>as trifles. Now when Christ did not hesitate to inflame still
more, by keen provocation, wicked and malicious persons, let us learn from his
example, that we ought not to be exceedingly solicitous to please every one by
what we say and do. His disciples, however&#8212;as is usually the case with
ignorant and unlearned people&#8212;no sooner perceive the result to be
unfavorable, than they conclude that Christ&#8217;s reply had been unseasonable
and improper. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f403</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For the

Pharisees by softening the harsh expression which he had employed. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f404</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It almost always happens with weak persons, that they
form an unfavorable judgment about a doctrine, as soon as they find that it is
regarded with doubt or meets with opposition. And certainly it were to be
wished, that it should give no offense, but receive the calm approbation of all;
but, as the minds of many are blinded, and even their hearts are kindled into
rage, by Satan, and as many souls are held under the benumbing influence of
brutal stupidity, it is impossible that all should relish the true doctrine of
salvation. Above all, we ought not to be surprised to behold the rage of those
who inwardly nourish the venom of malice and obstinacy. Yet we ought to take
care that, so far as may be in our power, our manner of teaching shall give no
offense; but it would be the height of madness to think of exercising greater
moderation than we have been taught to do by our heavenly Master. We see how his
discourse was made an occasion of offense by wicked and obstinate men; and we
see at the same time, how that kind of offense which arose from malignity was
treated by him with contempt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every
plant.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the indifferent success of the
doctrine had wounded their weak minds, Christ intended to remedy this evil. Now
the remedy which he proposes is, that good men ought not to be distressed, or
entertain less reverence for the doctrine, though to many it be an occasion of
death. It is a mistaken view of this passage which some have adopted, that all
the inventions of men, and every thing that has not proceeded from the mouth of
God, must be <i>rooted up </i>and perish; for it was rather to men that Christ
referred, and the meaning is, that there is no reason to wonder if the doctrine
of salvation shall prove deadly to the reprobate, because they are always
carried headlong to the destruction to which they are doomed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the persons that have been <i>planted </i>by the
hand of God we are to understand those who, by his free adoption, have been
ingrafted into the tree of life, as Isaiah also, when speaking of the Church
renewed by the grace of God, calls it a branch planted by the Lord,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236021&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
60:21.) Now as salvation depends solely on the election of God, the reprobate
must perish, in whatever way this may be effected; not that they are innocent,
and free from all blame, when God destroys them, but because, by their own
malice, they turn to their destruction all that is offered to them, however
salutary it may be. To those who willingly perish the Gospel thus becomes, as
Paul assures us, <i>the savor of death unto death,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:16;) for, though it is offered to all for salvation, it does not
yield this fruit in any but the elect. It belongs to a faithful and honest
teacher to regulate every thing which he brings forward by a regard to the
advantage of all; but whenever the result is different, let us take comfort from
Christ&#8217;s reply. It is beautifully expressed by the parable, that the cause
of perdition does not lie in the doctrine, but that the reprobate who have no
root in God, when the doctrine is presented to them, throw out their hidden
venom, and thus accelerate that death to which they were already
doomed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which my heavenly Father hath not
planted.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hypocrites, who appear for a
time to have been <i>planted </i>like good trees, are particularly described by
Christ; for Epicureans, who are noted for open and shameful contempt of God,
cannot properly be said to resemble trees, but the description must be intended
to apply to those who have acquired celebrity by some vain appearance of
godliness. Such were <i>the scribes, </i>who towered in the Church of God like
the cedars in Lebanon, and whose revolt might on that account appear the more
strange. Christ might have said that it is right that those should perish who
disdainfully reject salvation; but he rises higher, and asserts that no man will
remain steadfast, unless his salvation be secured by the election of God. By
these words he expressly declares, that the first origin of our salvation flows
from that grace by which God elected us to be his children before we were
created.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let them
alone.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He sets them aside as unworthy of
notice, and concludes that the offense which they take ought not to give us much
uneasiness. Hence has arisen the distinction, of which we hear so much, about
avoiding offenses, that we ought to beware of offending the weak, but if any
obstinate and malicious person take offense, we ought not to be uneasy; for, if
we determined to satisfy all obstinate people, we must bury Christ, who is
<i>the stone of offense,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:8.) Weak persons, who are offended through ignorance, and afterwards
return to just views, must be distinguished from haughty and disdainful men who
are themselves the authors of offenses. It is of importance to attend to this
distinction, in order that no one who is weak may be distressed through our
fault. But when wicked men dash themselves through their obstinacy, let us walk
on unmoved in the midst of offenses; for he who spares not weak brethren
tramples, as it were, under foot those to whom we are commanded to stretch out
the hand. It would be idle to attend to others, whom we cannot avoid offending,
if we wish to keep the right path; and when, under the pretext of taking
offense, they happen to fall off and revolt from Christ, we must <i>let them
alone, </i>that they may not drag us along with them.

themselves to be driven hither and thither at the disposal of those men will
miserably perish; for when they stumble on a plain road, it is evident that they
are willfully blind. Why then should any one allow himself to be directed by
them, except that he might fall into the same ditch? Now Christ, who has risen
upon us as <i>the Sun of righteousness,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi
4:2,)<i> </i>and not only points out the road to us by the torch of his Gospel,
but desires that we should keep it before us, justly calls on his disciples to
shake off that slothfulness, and not to wander, as it were, in the dark, for the
sake of gratifying the blind. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f406</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Hence

mentioning any occurrence, but states generally, that Christ made use of this
<i>parable; </i>as in recording many of Christ&#8217;s discourses he says
nothing as to the occasion on which they were delivered. It is no doubt possible
that Christ may have spoken this parable more than once; but, as no place more
appropriate was to be found, I have not hesitated to insert here what Luke
relates without fixing the time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 15:15.

understanding</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and yet does not fail to
act as their teacher. What Matthew ascribes in a peculiar manner to Peter is
related by Mark, in the same sense, as a question put by them all; and this is
evident from Christ&#8217;s reply, in which he reproves the ignorance, not of
Peter only, but of all of them alike. The general meaning is, that men are not
polluted by food, but that they have within themselves the pollution of sins,
which afterwards shows itself in the outward actions. Is it objected that
intemperance in eating is defilement? The solution is easy. Christ speaks only
of the proper and lawful use of those things which God has put in our power. To
eat and drink are things in their own nature free and indifferent: if any
corruption be added, it proceeds from the man himself, and therefore must be
regarded not as external, but internal.

wicked thoughts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence we infer that the
word <i>mouth, </i>as I have mentioned, was used by Christ in a former verse by
way of allusion to the context; for now he makes no mention of <i>the mouth,
</i>but merely says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>out of
the heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of man proceeds all that is
sinful and that corrupts by its pollution. Mark differs from Matthew in this
respect, that he gives a larger catalogue of sins, such as <i>lusts, </i>or
<i>irregular desires. </i>The Greek word
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pleonexi&gt;ai</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>is by some rendered <i>covetousness; </i>but I have preferred to take it in
a general acceptation. Next come <i>fraud </i>and intemperance, and those which
immediately follow. Though the mode of expression be figurative, it is enough to
understand Christ&#8217;s meaning to be, that all sins proceed from the wicked
and corrupt affections of the heart. To say that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an evil
eye</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>proceeds from the heart is not
strictly accurate, but it involves nothing that is absurd or ambiguous; for it
means, that an unholy heart pollutes the eyes by making them the ministers, or
organs, of wicked desires. And yet Christ does not speak as if every thing that
is evil in man were confined to open sins; but, in order to show more clearly
that the heart of man is the abode of all evils,

<div><font face="Palatino">In this miracle we are informed in what manner the
grace of Christ began to flow to the Gentiles; for, though the full time was not
yet come when Christ would make himself known to the whole world, yet he
intended to give some early manifestations of the common mercy which was at
length offered indiscriminately to Jews and Gentiles after his resurrection. A
remarkable picture of faith is presented to us in the woman of Canaan, for the
purpose of instructing us by means of comparison, that the Jews were justly
deprived of the promised redemption, since their impiety was so
shameful.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Greeks</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and hence that contrast between <i>Greeks </i>and<i> Jews, </i>which occurs
so frequently in the writings of Paul. As she was a native of <i>the territories
of Tyre and Sidon, </i>we need not wonder that she is called a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Syrophenician</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for that country was called <i>Syria, </i>and formed part of <i>Phenicia.
</i>The Jews disdainfully gave the name of <i>Canaanites </i>to all the
inhabitants of that district; and it is probable that the majority of them were
descended from the tribes of <i>Canaan, </i>who when banished from their native
country, fled to a sort of retreat in the neighborhood. Both agree in this
point, that the woman was a native of a heathen nation, that she had not been
instructed in the doctrine of the law, and that she came of her own accord to
Christ, humbly to entreat his aid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark
7:24</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>. He wished that no man
should know it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We must attend to this
circumstance, which is mentioned by Mark, that when Christ came to that place,
he did not erect his banner, but endeavored to remain concealed for a time, in
that obscure situation, like a private individual. Mark speaks according to the
ordinary perception of the flesh; for, although Christ by his divine Spirit
foresaw what would happen, yet so far as he was the minister and ambassador of
the Father, he kept himself, as his human nature might have led us to expect,
within the limits of that calling which God had given him; and in that respect
it is said that what he wished, <i>as man, </i>he was unable to accomplish.
Meanwhile, this occurrence, as I have said, tends powerfully to condemn the
Jews, who&#8212;though they boasted that they were the heirs of the covenant of
the Lord, his peculiar people, and a royal priesthood&#8212;were blind and deaf
when Christ, with a loud voice and with the addition of miracles, offered to
them the promised redemption; while this woman, who had no relationship with the
children of Abraham, and to whom, at first sight, the covenant did not at all
belong, came of her own accord to Christ, without having heard his voice or seen
his miracles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 15:22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have compassion on me, O
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Though this woman was an alien,
and did not belong to the Lord&#8217;s flock, yet she had acquired some taste of
piety;  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f413</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for, without some knowledge of the promises, she would not have called Christ
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Son of
David.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Jews indeed had almost
entirely departed, or at least had greatly turned aside, from the pure and sound
doctrine of the Gospel; but a report of the promised redemption was extensively
prevalent. As the restoration of the Church depended on the reign of David,
whenever they spoke of the Messiah, it was customary for them to employ the
name, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Son of
David</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and indeed this confession was
heard from the lips of all. But when the true faith had died out amongst them,
it was an amazing and incredible display of the goodness of God that the sweet
savor of the promises reached the neighboring nations. Though this woman had not
been regularly educated by any teacher, yet her faith in Christ was not a notion
adopted by her at random, but was formed out of the law and the prophets. It was
therefore not less absurd than wicked in that dog, Servetus, to abuse this
example for the purpose of proving that faith may exist without promises. I do
not deny that, in this sense, there may sometimes be a sort of implicit faith,
that is, a faith which is not accompanied by a full and distinct knowledge of
sound doctrine; provided we also hold that faith always springs from the word of
God, and takes its origin from true principles, and therefore is always found in
connection with some light of knowledge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But he made no reply to
her.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In various ways the Evangelists
bestow commendation on the faith of this woman. Here they bring before us her
unshaken constancy; for the silence of Christ was a sort of refusal, and there
is reason to wonder that she was not cast down by this trial, but her
continuance in prayer was a proof of her perseverance. This appears, however, to
be inconsistent with the nature of <i>faith </i>and of <i>calling upon God,
</i>as it is described by Paul, who assures us that no man can pray aright till
he has heard the word of God.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">How shall they call on
him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom
they have not heard?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
10:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Who then will say that this woman had faith, who
takes courage from her own feelings, though Christ is silent? But as Christ has
two ways of speaking and of being silent, it must be observed, that though he
withheld at that time the words of his mouth, yet he spoke within to the mind of
the woman, and so this secret inspiration was a substitute for the outward
preaching. Besides, her prayer arose out of the <i>hearing of faith,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:17;) and, therefore, though Christ does not immediately reply, she
continually hears the sound of that doctrine 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f414</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which
she had already learned, that Christ came as a Redeemer. In this way the Lord
often acts towards those who believe in him; he speaks to them, and yet is
silent. Relying on the testimonies of Scripture, where they hear him speaking,
they firmly believe that he will be gracious to them; and yet he does not
immediately reply to their wishes and prayers, but, on the contrary, seems as if
he did not hear. We see then that the design of Christ&#8217;s silence was not
to extinguish the woman&#8217;s faith, but rather to whet her zeal and inflame
her ardor. But if a small seed of doctrine in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a woman of
Canaan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>yielded such abundant fruit, it
ill becomes us to be dejected, if at any time he delays and does not immediately
grant a favorable answer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Send her
away.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The disciples present no request in favor
of the woman, but as they are annoyed by her importunity, they desire that, in
some way or other, she may be dismissed. It is a childish contrivance, which the
Papists have endeavored to support by means of this passage, that departed
saints are allowed to plead for us; for, granting that this woman solicited the
disciples to give her some favor or assistance &#8212; which, however, cannot be
proved from the passage &#8212; still there is a wide difference between the
dead and living. It must be also observed, that, if they really intended to aid
her by their advocacy, they obtain nothing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am not
sent.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He informs the Apostles that his reason
for refusing the woman of Canaan arises out of his desire to devote himself
entirely to the Jews to whom alone he was appointed to be a minister of the
grace of God. He argues from the call and the command of the Father, that he
must not yield any assistance to strangers; not that the power of Christ was
always confined within so narrow limits, but because present circumstances
rendered it necessary that he should begin with the Jews, and at that time
devote himself to them in a peculiar manner. For as I have said in expounding
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:5<i>, the middle wall of partition</i>
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:14) was not thrown down till after Christ&#8217;s resurrection that he might
proclaim peace to the nations which were aliens from the kingdom of God: and
therefore he prohibited the Apostles, at that time, from scattering anywhere but
in Judea the first seed of doctrine. Justly therefore, does he affirm that, on
this occasion, he was sent to the Jews only, till the Gentiles also followed in
the proper order.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the lost sheep of the house of
Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He bestows the designation of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sheep of the house of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>not on the elect only, but on all
who were descended from the holy fathers; for the Lord had included all in the
covenant, and was promised indiscriminately to all as a Redeemer, as he also
revealed and offered himself to all without exception. It is worthy of
observation, that he declares himself to have been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sent to LOST
sheep,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as he assures us in another
passage that he <i>came to save that which was lost</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401811&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
18:11.) Now as we enjoy this favor, at the present day, in common with the Jews,
we learn what our condition is till he appear as our Savior.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And she came and worshipped
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We might be apt to think that this
woman contends with some measure of obstinacy, as if she would extort something
from Christ in spite of him; but there is no reason to doubt that she was
animated by the conviction which she entertained as to the kindness of the
Messiah. When Christ expressly declared that it did not belong to his office,
she was not intimidated by that refusal, and did not desist from her purpose.
The reason was, that she adhered firmly to that previous sentiment of faith
which I have mentioned, and admitted nothing that was opposed to her hope. And
this is the sure test of faith, that we do not suffer that general commencement
of our salvation, which is founded on the word of God, to be in any way torn
from us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is not
seemly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ&#8217;s reply is harsher
than ever, and one would think that he intended by it to cut off all hope; for
not only does he declare that all the grace which he has received from the
Father belongs to the Jews, and must be bestowed on them, otherwise they will be
defrauded of their just rights; but he disdainfully compares the woman herself
to a <i>dog</i>,<i> </i>thus implying that she is unworthy of being a partaker
of his grace. To make the meaning plain to us, it must be understood that the
appellation of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
children&#8217;s bread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is here given,
not to the gifts of God of whatever description, but only to those which were
bestowed in a peculiar manner on Abraham and his posterity. For since the
beginning of the world, the goodness of God was everywhere diffused&#8212;nay,
filled heaven and earth&#8212;so that all mortal men felt that God was their
Father. But as the children of Abraham had been more highly honored than the
rest of mankind,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the
children&#8217;s bread</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is a name given
to everything that, relates peculiarly to the adoption by which the Jews alone
were elected to be <i>children</i>.<i> </i>The light of the sun, the breath of
life, and the productions of the soil, were enjoyed by the Gentiles equally with
the Jews; but the blessing which was to be expected in Christ dwelt exclusively
in the family of Abraham. To lay open without distinction that which God had
conferred as a peculiar privilege on a single nation, was nothing short of
setting aside the covenant of God; for in this way the Jews, who ought to have
the preference, were placed on a level with the Gentiles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to throw it to the
dogs.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By using the word <i>throw</i>,<i>
</i>Christ intimates that what is taken from the Church of God and given to
heathens is not well bestowed. But this must be restricted to that time when it
was in Judea only that men called on God; for, since the Gentiles were admitted
to partake of the same salvations&#8212;which took place when Christ diffused
everywhere the light of his Gospel&#8212;the distinction was removed, and those
who were formerly <i>dogs </i>are now reckoned among the children. The pride of
the flesh must fall down, when we learn that by nature we are <i>dogs</i>.<i>
</i>At first, no doubt, human nature, in which the image of God brightly shone,
occupied so high a station that this opprobrious epithet did not apply to all
nations, and even to kings, on whom God confers the honor of bearing his name. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f415</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But the
treachery and revolt of Adam made it proper that the Lord should send to the
stable, along with <i>dogs</i>,<i> </i>those who through the guilt of our first
parent became bastards; more especially when a comparison is made between the
Jews, who were exempted from the common lot, and the Gentiles, who were banished
from the kingdom of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Christ&#8217;s meaning is more fully unfolded by
Mark, who gives these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Allow the children first to be
satisfied</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He tells the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>woman of
Canaan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that she acts presumptuously in
proceeding&#8212;as it were, in the midst of the supper&#8212;to seize on what
was on the table. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f416</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> His
chief design was, to make trial of the woman&#8217;s faith; but he also pointed
out the dreadful vengeance that would overtake the Jews, who rejected an
inestimable benefit which was freely offered to them, and which they refused to
those who sought it with warmth and earnestness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Certainly, Lord.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">The woman&#8217;s reply showed that she was not
hurried along by a blind or thoughtless impulse to offer a flat contradiction 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f417</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to what
Christ had said. As God preferred the Jews to other nations, she does not
dispute with them the honor of adoption, and declares, that she has no objection
whatever that Christ should
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>satisfy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>them according to the order which God had prescribed. She only asks that
some
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>crumbs</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8212;falling,<i>
</i>as it were, accidentally&#8212;should come within the reach of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
dogs</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>And at no time, certainly, did God
shut up his grace among the Jews in such a manner as not to bestow a small taste
of them on the Gentiles. No terms could have been employed that would have
described more appropriately, or more justly, that dispensation of the grace of
God which was at that time in full operation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.

faith.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He first applauds the
woman&#8217;s <i>faith</i>,<i> </i>and next declares, that on account of her
<i>faith </i>he grants her prayer. The greatness of her <i>faith </i>appeared
chiefly in this respect, that by the aid of nothing more than a feeble spark of
doctrine, she not only recognized the actual office of Christ, and ascribed to
him heavenly power, but pursued her course steadily through formidable
opposition; suffered herself to be annihilated, provided that she held by her
conviction that she would not fail to obtain Christ&#8217;s assistance; and, in
a word, so tempered her confidence with humility, that, while she advanced no
unfounded claim, neither did she shut against her the fountain of the grace of
Christ, by a sense of her own unworthiness. This commendation, bestowed on a
woman who had been a heathen, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f418</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
condemns the ingratitude of that nation which boasted that it was consecrated to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But how can the woman be said to <i>believe
</i>aright, who not only receives no promise from Christ, but is driven back by
his declaration to the contrary? On that point I have already spoken. Though he
appears to give a harsh refusal to her prayers, yet, convinced that God would
grant the salvation which he had promised through the Messiah, she ceases not to
entertain favorable hopes; and therefore she concludes, that the door is shut
against her, not for the purpose of excluding her altogether, but that, by a
more strenuous effort of faith, she may force her way, as it were, through the
chinks. <i>Be it unto thee as thou desirest</i>.<i> </i>This latter clause
contains a useful doctrine, that faith will obtain anything from the Lord; for
so highly does he value it, that he is always prepared to comply with our
wishes, so far as it may be for our advantage.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jesus departing
thence.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Though it is unquestionably the
same journey of Christ, on his return from the neighborhood of Sidon, that is
related by Matthew and by Mark, yet in some points they do not quite agree. It
is of little moment that the one says he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came to the borders of

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he came to the coasts of

the district which lay between them received both names.

<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Decapolis </i>was so called from its containing
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">de&gt;ka
po&gt;leiv</font><font face="Palatino">) <i>ten cities; </i>and as it was
contiguous to Phenicia and to that part of Galilee which lay towards the sea,
Christ must have passed through it, when he returned from Phenicia into Galilee
of Judea. There is a greater appearance of contradiction in another part of the
narrative, where <i>Matthew </i>says that our Lord cured <i>many </i>who labored
under various diseases, while <i>Mark </i>takes no notice of any but of one
<i>deaf </i>man. But this difficulty need not detain us; for <i>Mark
</i>selected for description a miracle which was performed during the journey,
and the report of which was no sooner circulated than it aroused the inhabitants
of every part of that country to bring <i>many </i>persons to Christ to be
cured. Now we know that the Evangelists are not anxious to relate all that
Christ did, and are so far from dwelling largely on miracles, that they only
glance at a few by way of example. Besides, <i>Mark </i>was satisfied with
producing one instance, in which the power of Christ is as brightly displayed as
in others of the same sort which followed shortly afterwards.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark 7:32.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they implored him to lay his
hands upon him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>may be learned from
passages which we have already considered; for the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>laying on of
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>was a solemn symbol of
consecration, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f420</font></sup><font face="Palatino">and by
means of it, the gifts of the Holy Spirit were also bestowed. And there is no
doubt that this ceremony was frequently used by Christ; so that those men
requested nothing but what they knew that he had been formerly in the habit of
doing. On the present occasion, Christ employs other symbols; for he puts his
<i>spittle </i>on the <i>tongue </i>of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dumb man, and puts his fingers
into his ears.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>laying on of
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>would of itself have been
sufficiently efficacious, and even, without moving a finger, he might have
accomplished it by a single act of his will; but it is evident that he made
abundant use of outward signs, when they were found to be advantageous. Thus, by
touching the <i>tongue </i>with <i>spittle</i>,<i> </i>he intended to point out
that the faculty of speech was communicated by himself alone; and by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>putting his finger into the
ears</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he showed that it belonged to his
office to pierce the ears of the deaf. There is no necessity for having recourse
to allegories; and we find that those who have amused themselves with ingenious
discussions on this subject, are so far from bringing forward any thing of real
value, that they tend rather to hold up the Scriptures to ridicule. Readers of
sobriety and judgment will be satisfied with this single instruction, that we
obtain from Christ, in answer to our prayers, both speech and hearing; for he
pours his energy into our tongues, and pierces our ears with his
fingers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>33.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when he had taken him
aside from the multitude.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This was done,
partly to afford to those who were ignorant, and not yet sufficiently qualified
for becoming witnesses, an opportunity of perceiving at a distance the glory of
his Divine nature, and partly that he might have a better opportunity of pouring
out earnest prayer. When he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>looked up to heaven and
sighed</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>it was an expression of strong
feeling; and this enables us to perceive the vehemence of his love towards men,
for whose miseries he feels so much compassion. Nor can it be doubted, that by
conveying the spittle from his own mouth to the mouth of another, and by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>putting his fingers into his
ears,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he intended to manifest and
express the same feeling of kindness. Yet that he has supreme power to remove
all our defects, and restore us to health, is proclaimed by him when he simply
orders the tongue and ears </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to be
opened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for it was not without a good
reason that Mark inserted that Chaldaic word,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejffaqa&gt;</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>Ephphatha</i>,<i> be opened</i>,<i> </i>but to testify the divine power of
Christ. Among other fooleries with which baptism has been debased by foolish
men, the ceremony used by our Lord is turned into a piece of buffoonery; and
this instance shows us that there is no end to licentiousness, when men wantonly
change at their own pleasure the mysteries of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>36.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then he enjoined them not to
tell it to any person.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Many commentators
torture these <i>injunctions </i>to an opposite meaning, as if Christ had
purposely excited them to spread abroad the fame of the miracle; but I prefer a
more natural interpretation which I have formerly stated, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f421</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
Christ only intended to delay the publication of it till a more proper and
convenient time. I have no doubt, therefore, that their zeal was unseasonable,
when, though <i>enjoined </i>to be silent, they were in haste to speak. We need
not wonder that men unaccustomed to the doctrine of Christ are carried away by
immoderate zeal, when it is not called for. Yet what they unwisely attempted to
do, was made by Christ to promote his own glory; for not only was the miracle
made known, but the whole of that district, in despising the Author of heavenly
gifts, was rendered inexcusable.</font><br></div>

glorified the God of Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is,
because God, taking unusual methods of illustrating his power, had called up the
remembrance of his covenant. But the words of Mark contain perhaps an implied
contrast; for the reports concerning Christ were various, and the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>multitude</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

may be intended to mean that it was only wicked and malicious persons who
slandered his actions, since all that he did was so far from exposing him to
calumny that it deserved the highest praise. But we know, and it is what nature
teaches us, that nothing is more unjust than to make the bestowal of favors an
occasion of envy and ill-will.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 15:32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have compassion on the
multitude.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here a miracle is related not
unlike another which we have lately explained. The only difference is, that on
the former occasion Christ satisfied
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>five thousand
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>five loaves and two

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>twelve

while out of a greater abundance a smaller portion is left. Let us learn from
this, that the power of God is not restricted to means or outward assistance,
and that it is all one with Him whether there be much or little, as Jonathan 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f422</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> said

<div><font face="Palatino">As the blessing of God can make one loaf suffice as

</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;032626&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus

from the oven, it will serve no purpose to stuff the belly. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>three days&#8217;
fasting,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of which Christ speaks, must
not be understood to mean that they had eaten nothing for three days; but that
in desert places they had few conveniences, and must have wanted their ordinary
food. Besides, in those warm countries, hunger is less keen than in our thick
and cold atmosphere; and, therefore, we need not wonder that they should abstain
longer from food.</font><br></div>

the case in hand. As if they had never seen any thing of the same sort, they

indifference does not steal upon us; and we ought to be the more careful not to
allow our minds to be drawn away from the contemplation of divine benefits, that
the experience of the past may lead us to expect for the future the same

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Pharisees
came.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Mark says that they <i>began to
dispute</i>,<i> </i>from which we may conjecture that, when they had been
vanquished in argument, this was their last resource; as obstinate men, whenever
they are reduced to extremities, to avoid being compelled to yield to the truth,
are accustomed to introduce something which is foreign to the subject. Though
the nature of the dispute is not expressed, yet I think it probable that they
debated about the calling of Christ, why he ventured to make any innovation, and
why he made such lofty pretensions, as if by his coming he had fully restored
the kingdom of God. Having nothing farther to object against his doctrine, they
demand that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall give them a
sign from heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But it is certain that
a hundred <i>signs </i>would have no greater effect than the testimonies of
Scripture. Besides, many miracles already performed had placed before their eyes
the power of Christ, and had almost enabled them to touch it with their hands.
<i>Signs</i>,<i> </i>by which Christ made himself familiarly known, are despised
by them; and how much less will they derive advantage from a distant and obscure
<i>sign? </i>Thus the Papists of our own day, as if the doctrine of the Gospel
had not yet been proved, demand that it be ascertained by means of new
miracles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Pharisees, together with the

that, though <i>the

</i>and <i>the
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pharisees</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>looked upon each other as enemies, and not only cherished bitter hatred, but
were continually engaged in hostilities, yet they enter into a mutual league
against Christ. In like manner, though ungodly men quarrel among themselves,
their internal broils never prevent them from conspiring against God, and
entering into a compact for joining their hands in persecuting the
truth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tempting.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>By this word the Evangelists mean that it was not with honest intentions,
nor from a desire of instruction, but by cunning and deceit, that they demanded
what they thought that Christ would refuse, or at least what they imagined was
not in his power. Regarding him as utterly mean and despicable, they had no
other design than to expose his weakness, and to destroy all the applause which
he had hitherto obtained among the people. In this manner unbelievers are said
to <i>tempt </i>God, when they murmur at being denied what their fancy prompted
them to ask, and charge God with want of power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>About the commencement of the

them that his power had been sufficiently manifested, so that they must have
recognised <i>the time of their visitation</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421944&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
19:44,) had they not of their own accord shut their eyes, and refused to admit
the clearest light. The comparison which he employs is beautiful and highly
appropriate; for, though the aspect of the sky is changeable, so that sometimes
a storm unexpectedly arises, and sometimes fair weather springs up when it was
not expected, yet the instructions of nature are sufficient to enable men to
predict from <i>signs </i>whether the day will be fair or cloudy. Christ
therefore asks why they do not recognize the kingdom of God, when it is made
known by <i>signs </i>not less manifest; for this proved clearly that they were
excessively occupied with earthly and transitory advantages, and cared little
about any thing that related to the heavenly and spiritual life, and were
blinded not so much by mistake as by voluntary malice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hypocrites, you can
judge.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He calls them
<i>hypocrites</i>,<i> </i>because they pretend to ask that which, if it were
exhibited to them, they are resolved not to observe. The same reproof applies
nearly to the whole world; for men direct their ingenuity, and apply their
senses, to immediate advantage; and therefore there is scarcely any man who is
not sufficiently well qualified in this respect, or at least who is not
tolerably acquainted with the means of gaining his object. How comes it then
that we feel no concern about the <i>signs </i>by which God invites us to
himself? Is it not because every man gives himself up to willing indifference,
and extinguishes the light which is offered to him? The calling of Christ, and
the immediate exhibition of eternal salvation, were exhibited to the scribes
both by the Law and the Prophets, and by his own doctrine, to which miracles
were added.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are many persons of the same description in the
present day, who plead that on intricate subjects they have a good right to
suspend their judgment, because they must wait till the matter is fully
ascertained. They go farther, and believe that it is a mark of prudence
purposely to avoid all inquiry into the truth; as if it were not an instance of
shameful sloth that, while they are so eagerly solicitous about the objects of
the flesh and of the earth, they neglect the eternal salvation of their souls,
and at the same time contrive vain excuses for gross and stupid
ignorance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A very absurd inference is drawn by some ignorant
persons from this passage, that we are not at liberty to predict from the aspect
of the sky whether we shall have fair or stormy weather. It is rather an
argument which Christ founds on the regular course of nature, that those men
deserve to perish for their ingratitude, who, while they are sufficiently acute
in matters of the present life, yet knowingly and willfully quench the heavenly
light by their stupidity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark 8:12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And groaning in his
spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words Mark informs us
that it occasioned grief and bitter vexation to our Lord, when he saw those
ungrateful men obstinately resist God. And certainly all who are desirous to
promote the glory of God, and who feel concern about the salvation of men, ought
to have such feelings that nothing would inflict on their hearts a deeper wound
than to see unbelievers purposely blocking up against themselves the way of
believing, and employing all their ingenuity in obscuring by their clouds the
brightness of the word and works of God. The words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in his
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>appear to me to be added
emphatically, to inform us that this groan proceeded from the deepest affection
of his heart, and that no sophist might allege that Christ resorted to outward
attitudes to express a grief which he did not inwardly feel; for that holy soul,
which was guided by the zeal of the Spirit, must have been moved by deep sadness
at the sight of such wicked obstinacy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 12:57.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And why even of yourselves,

the evil, and, as it were, applies the lancet to the ulcer. He tells them that
they do not descend into their consciences, and there examine with themselves,
as in the presence of God, what is right. The reason why hypocrites are so much
disposed to make objections is, that they throw their swelling words into the
air without any concern, and never exercise calm thought, or place themselves at
the tribunal of God, that the truth, when once ascertained, may be fully
embraced. When Luke says that this was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spoken to the
multitudes</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he does not contradict the
narrative of Matthew and Mark; for it is probable that Christ adapted his style
generally to the followers and disciples of the scribes, and to other despisers
of God who resembled them, of whom he perceived that there were too many; as the
present complaint or expostulation was applicable to the whole of that
rabble.</font><br></div>

says &#8212; for Mark does not mention Jonah &#8212; but the meaning is the

the circumstance that had just occurred 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f428</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to
exhort his disciples to beware of every abuse that makes an inroad on sincere
piety. The Pharisees had come a little before; the Sadducees joined them; and
apart from them stood Herod, a very wicked man, and an opponent and corrupter of
sound doctrine. In the midst of these dangers it was very necessary to warn his
disciples to be on their guard; for, since the human mind has a natural
inclination towards vanity and errors, when we are surrounded by wicked
inventions, spurious doctrines, and other plagues of the same sort, nothing is
more easy than to depart from the true and simple purity of the word of God; and
if we once become entangled in these things, it will never be possible for the
true religion to hold an entire sway over us. But to make the matter more clear,
let us examine closely the words of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Along with <i>the

speaks of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Herod</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>Luke takes no notice of any but <i>the
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pharisees</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>(though it is not absolutely certain that it is the same discourse of Christ
which Luke relates,) and explains
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
leaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hypocrisy</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>In short, he glances briefly at this sentence, as if there were no ambiguity
in the words. Now the metaphor of <i>leaven</i>,<i> </i>which is here applied to
false doctrine, might have been employed, at another time, to denote the
hypocrisy of life and conduct, or the same words might even have been repeated a
second time. But there is no absurdity in saying, that those circumstances which
are more copiously detailed by the other two Evangelists, in the order in which
they took place, are slightly noticed by Luke in a manner somewhat different,
and out of their proper place or order, but without any real contradiction. If
we choose to adopt this conjecture,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hypocrisy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>will denote here something different from a pretended and false appearance
of wisdom. It will denote the very source and occasion of empty display, which,
though it holds out an imposing aspect to the eyes of men, is of no estimation
in the sight of God. For, as Jeremiah (5:3) tells us that <i>the eyes of the
Lord behold the truth</i>,<i> </i>so they that believe in his word are
instructed to maintain true godliness in such a manner as to cleave to
righteousness with an honest and perfect heart; as in these
words,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">An now, O Israel, what
doth the Lord require from thee, but that thou shouldst cleave to him with all
thy heart, and with all thy soul?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
10:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the other hand, the traditions of men, while they
set aside spiritual worship, wear a temporary disguise, as if God could be
imposed upon by such deceptions; for to whatever extent outward ceremonies may
be carried, they are, in the sight of God, nothing more than childish trifles,
unless so far as they assist us in the exercise of true piety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive the reason why <i>hypocrisy </i>was
viewed by Luke as equivalent to doctrines invented by men, and why he included
under this name the <i>leavens </i>of men, which only puff up, and in the sight
of God contain nothing solid, and which even draw aside the minds of men from
the right study of piety to empty and insignificant ceremonies. But it will be
better to abide by the narrative of Matthew, which is more copious. The
disciples, after having been reproved by our Lord, came at length to understand
that he had charged them to be on their guard against certain doctrine. It was
plainly, therefore, the intention of Christ to fortify them against prevailing
abuses, by which they were attacked on all sides. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pharisees</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sadducees</i></font><font face="Palatino">
were expressly named, because those two sects maintained at that time a
tyrannical sway in the Church, and held opinions so utterly subversive of the
doctrine of the Law and the Prophets, that almost nothing remained pure and
entire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But <i>Herod </i>did not in any way profess to teach;
and a question arises, why does Mark class him with false teachers?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> and </i>OF THE LEAVEN OF HEROD. I
reply: he was half a Jew,<i> </i>was mean and treacherous, and availed himself
of every contrivance that was within his reach to draw the people to his side;
for it is customary with all apostates to contrive some mixture, for the purpose
of establishing a new religion by which the former may be abolished. It was
because he was laboring craftily to subvert the principles of true and ancient
piety, and thus to give currency to a religion that would be exceedingly adapted
to his tyranny, or rather because he was endeavoring to introduce some new form
of Judaism, that our Lord most properly charged them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beware of his
leaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From the temple of God the
scribes disseminated their errors, and the court of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Herod</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>was another workshop of Satan, in which errors of a different kind were
manufactured.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus in our own day we find that not only from Popish
temples, and from the dens of sophists and monks, does Antichrist vomit out her
impostures, but that there is a Theology of the Court, which lends its aid to
prop up the throne of Antichrist, so that no stratagem is left untried. But as
Christ opposed the evils which then prevailed, and as he aroused the minds of
his followers to guard against those which were the most dangerous, let us learn
from his example to make a prudent inquiry what are the abuses that may now do
us injury. Sooner shall water mix with fire than any man shall succeed in
reconciling the inventions of the Pope with the Gospel. Whoever desires to
become honestly a disciple of Christ, must be careful to keep his mind pure from
those <i>leavens; </i>and if he has already imbibed them, he must labor to
purify himself till none of their polluting effects remain. There are restless
men, on the other hand, who have endeavored in various ways to corrupt sound
doctrine, and, in guarding also against such impostures, believers must maintain
a strict watch, that they may keep a perpetual Passover</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why do you think within
yourselves, etc.?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The disciples again
show how little they had profited by the instructions of their Master, and by
his wonderful works. What he had said about being on their guard against <i>the
leaven </i>is rashly interpreted by them as if Christ intended only to withdraw
them from outward intercourse. As it was customary among the Jews not to take
food in company with irreligious men, the disciples imagine that the Pharisees
were classed with such persons. This ignorance might perhaps have been endured;
but they are forgetful of a favor which they lately received, and do not
consider that Christ has the remedy his power to hinder them from being
compelled to pollute themselves by meat and drink, and therefore he reproves
them sharply, as they deserved. And certainly it was shameful ingratitude that,
after having seen bread created out of nothing, and in such abundance as to
satisfy many thousands of men, and after having seen this done twice, they are
now anxious about bread, as if their Master did not always possess the same
power. From these words we infer that all who have once or twice experienced the
power of God, and distrust it for the future are convicted of unbelief; for it
is faith that cherishes in our hearts the remembrance of the gifts of God, and
faith must have been laid asleep, if we allow them to be
forgotten.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then they
understood.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word <i>leaven </i>is
very evidently used by Christ as contrasted with the pure and uncorrupted word
of God. In a former passage,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401333&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:33,) Christ had used the word in a good sense, when he said that the Gospel
resembled <i>leaven; </i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f430</font></sup><font face="Palatino">but for
the most part this word is employed in Scripture to denote some foreign
substance, by which the native purity of any thing is impaired. In this passage,
the naked truth of God, and the inventions which men contrive out of their own
brain, are unquestionably the two things that are contrasted. The sophist must
not hope to escape by saying that this ought not to be understood as applicable
to every kind of doctrine; for it will be impossible to find any doctrine but
what has come from God that deserves the name of pure and <i>unleavened</i>.<i>
</i>Hence it follows that <i>leaven </i>is the name given to every foreign
admixture; as Paul also tells us that faith is rendered spurious, as soon as we
are</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">drawn aside from the

Christ,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 11:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must now be apparent who are the persons of whose
doctrine our Lord charges us to beware. The ordinary government of the Church
was at that time in the hands of the scribes and priests, among whom the
Pharisees held the highest rank. As Christ expressly charges his followers to
beware of <i>their </i>doctrine, it follows that all who mingle their own
inventions with the word of God, or who advance any thing that does not belong
to it, must be rejected, how honorable soever may be their rank, or whatever
proud titles they may wear. Accursed and rebellious, therefore, is the obedience
of those who voluntarily submit to the inventions and laws of the
Pope.</font><br></div>

the purpose of proving, in the case of this man, that he had full liberty as to

different, What do men think about Jesus the Son of Mary? He calls himself,
according to custom, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Son of
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>as much as to say, Now that clothed
in flesh I inhabit the earth like other men, what is the opinion entertained
respecting me? The design of Christ was, to confirm his disciples fully in the
true faith, that they might not be tossed about amidst various reports, as we
shall presently see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Some [say,] John the
Baptist.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This inquiry does not relate to
the open enemies of Christ, nor to ungodly scoffers, but to the sounder and
better part of the people, who might be called the choice and flower of the
Church. Those only are mentioned by the disciples who spoke of Christ with
respect; and yet, though they aimed at the truth, not one of them reaches that
point, but all go astray in their vain fancies. Hence we perceive how great is
the weakness of the human mind; for not only is it unable of itself to
understand what is right or true, but even out of true principles it coins
errors. Besides, though Christ is the only standard of harmony and peace, by
which God gathers the whole world to himself, the greater part of men seize on
this subject as the occasion of prolonged strife. Among the Jews, certainly, the
unity of faith related solely to Christ; and yet they who formerly appeared to
have some sort of agreement among themselves now split into a variety of
sects.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see too how one error quickly produces another;
for a preconceived opinion, which had taken a firm hold of the minds of the
common people, that souls passed from one body to another, made them more ready
to adopt this groundless fancy. But though, at the time of Christ&#8217;s
coming, the Jews were divided in this manner, such a diversity of opinions ought
not to have hindered the godly from desiring to attain the pure knowledge of
him. For if any man, under such a pretense, had given himself up to sloth, and
neglected to seek Christ, we would have been forced to declare that there was no
excuse for him. Much less then will any man escape the judgment of God who is
led by the variety of sects to entertain a dislike of Christ, or who, disgusted
by the false opinions of men, does not deign to attach himself to
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But who do you say that I
am?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here Christ distinguishes his
disciples from the rest of the crowd, to make it more fully evident that,
whatever differences may exist among others, we at least ought not to be led
aside from the unity of faith. They who shall honestly submit to Christ, and
shall not attempt to mix with the Gospel any inventions of their own brain, will
never want the true light. But here the greatest vigilance is necessary, that,
though the whole world may be carried away by its own inventions, believers may
continually adhere to Christ. As Satan could not rob the Jews of the conviction
which they derived from the Law and the Prophets, that Christ would come, he
changed him into various shapes, and, as it were, cut him in pieces. His next
scheme was, to bring forward many pretended Christs, that they might lose sight
of the true Redeemer. By similar contrivances, he continued ever afterwards
either to tear Christ in pieces, or to exhibit him under a false character.
Among the confused and discordant voices of the world, let this voice of Christ
perpetually sound in our ears, which calls us away from unsettled and wavering
men, that we may not follow the multitude, and that our faith may not be tossed
about amongst the billows of contending opinions.</font><br></div>

which God manifested by the hand of his Son, was clearly divine; and therefore
it was necessary that he who was to be the Redeemer should come from heaven,

more clearly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art the Son of
the living God;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for, though Peter did
not yet understand distinctly in what way Christ was the begotten of God, he was
so fully persuaded of the dignity of Christ, that he believed him to come from
God, not like other men, but by the inhabitation of the true and living Godhead
in his flesh. When the attribute <i>living </i>is ascribed to God, it is for the
purpose of distinguishing between Him and dead idols, who <i>are nothing</i>,<i>

has honestly made such a confession. This was not spoken in a peculiar manner to
Peter alone, but our Lord&#8217;s purpose was, to show in what the only
happiness of the whole world consists. That every one may approach him with
greater courage, we must first learn that all are by nature miserable and
accursed, till they find a remedy in Christ. Next, we must add, that whoever has
obtained Christ wants nothing that is necessary to perfect happiness, since we
have no right to desire any thing better than the eternal glory of God, of which
Christ puts us in possession.</font><br></div>

men are destitute of that sagacity which is necessary for perceiving the
mysteries of heavenly wisdom which are hidden in Christ; and even that all the
senses of men are deficient in this respect, till God opens our eyes to perceive
his glory in Christ. Let no man, therefore, in proud reliance on his own
abilities, attempt to reach it, but let us humbly suffer ourselves to be
inwardly taught by <i>the Father of Lights</i>,<i>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.

thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words Christ declares how
highly he is delighted with the confession of Peter, since he bestows upon it so
large a reward. For, though he had already given to his disciple, Simon, the
name of <i>Peter</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:2;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430142&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John

yet these gifts, though freely bestowed, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f435</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are
here ascribed to faith as if they had been a reward, which we not unfrequently
find in Scripture. Peter receives a twofold honor, the former part of which
relates to his personal advantage, and the latter to his office as an
Apostle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art
Peter.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words our Lord assures
him that it was not without a good reason that he had formerly given him this
name, because, as a <i>living stone
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:5) in the temple of God, he retains his stedfastness. This extends, no
doubt, to all believers, each of whom is a temple of God, (l Corinthians 6:19,)
and who, united to each other by faith, make together one temple,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:21.) But it denotes also the distinguished excellence of Peter above the rest,
as each in his own order receives more or less, <i>according to the measure of
the gift of Christ</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And on this
rock.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence it is evident how the name
<i>Peter </i>comes to be applied both to Simon individually, and to other
believers. It is because they are founded on the faith of Christ, and joined
together, by a holy consent, into a spiritual building, <i>that God may dwell in
the midst of them</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;264307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
43:7.) For Christ, by announcing that this would be the common foundation of the
whole Church, intended to associate with Peter all the godly that would ever
exist in the world. &#8220;You are now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;a very small
number of men, and therefore the confession which you have now made is not at
present supposed to have much weight; but ere long a time will arrive when that
confession shall assume a lofty character, and shall be much more widely
spread.&#8221; And this was eminently fitted to excite his disciples to
perseverance, that though their faith was little known and little esteemed, yet
they had been chosen by the Lord as the first-fruits, that out of this mean
commencement there might arise a new Church, which would prove victorious
against all the machinations of hell.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall not prevail against
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The pronoun it
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aujth~v</font><font face="Palatino">)
may refer either to <i>faith </i>or to <i>the Church; </i>but the latter meaning
is more appropriate. Against all the power of Satan the firmness of the Church
will prove to be invincible, because the truth of God, on which the faith of the
Church rests, will ever remain unshaken. And to this statement corresponds that
saying of John,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">This is the victory which
overcometh the world, your
faith,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
John 5:4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is a promise which eminently deserves our
observation, that all who are united to Christ, and acknowledge him to be Christ
and Mediator, will remain to the end safe from all danger; for what is said of
the body of the Church belongs to each of its members, since they are one in
Christ. Yet this passage also instructs us, that so long as the Church shall
continue to be a pilgrim on the earth, she will never enjoy rest, but will be
exposed to many attacks; for, when it is declared that Satan will not conquer,
this implies that he will be her constant enemy. While, therefore, we rely on
this promise of Christ, feel ourselves at liberty to boast against Satan, and
already triumph by faith over all his forces; let us learn, on the other hand,
that this promise is, as it were, the sound of a trumpet, calling us to be
always ready and prepared for battle. By the word <i>gates
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pu&gt;lai</font><font face="Palatino">)
is unquestionably meant every kind of power and of weapons of
war.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will give thee the
keys</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here Christ begins now to speak of
the public office, that is, of the Apostleship, which he dignifies with a
twofold title. First, he says that the ministers of the Gospel are porters, so
to speak, of the kingdom of heaven, because they carry its <i>keys; </i>and,
secondly, he adds, that they are invested with a power of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>binding and
loosing,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which is ratified in heaven. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f436</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
comparison of <i>the keys </i>is very properly applied to the office of
teaching; as when Christ says
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421152&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
11:52) that the scribes and Pharisees, in like manner, have <i>the key </i>of
the kingdom of heaven, because they are expounders of the law. We know that
there is no other way in which the gate of life is opened to us than by the word
of God; and hence it follows that the key is placed, as it were, in the hands of
the ministers of the word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Those who think that the word <i>keys </i>is here
used in the plural number, because the Apostles received a commission not only
to <i>open </i>but also to <i>shut</i>,<i> </i>have some probability on their
side; but if any person choose to take a more simple view of the meaning, let
him enjoy his own opinion. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f437</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Here a
question arises, Why does the Lord promise that he will give to Peter what he
appeared to have formerly given him by making him an Apostle? But this question
has been already answered, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f438</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> when I
said that <i>the twelve </i>were at first
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:5) nothing more than temporary preachers, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f439</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and so,
when they returned to Christ, they had executed their commission; but after that
Christ had risen from the dead, they then began to be appointed to be ordinary
teachers of the Church. It is in this sense that the honor is now bestowed for
the future.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whatsoever thou shalt bind on
earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The second metaphor, or
comparison, is intended directly to point out the forgiveness of sins; for
Christ, in delivering us, by his Gospel, from the condemnation of eternal death,
<i>looses </i>the cords of the curse by which we are held bound. The doctrine of
the Gospel is, therefore, declared to be appointed for loosing our bonds, that,
being loosed on earth by the voice and testimony of men, we may be actually
<i>loosed </i>in heaven. But as there are many who not only are guilty of
wickedly rejecting the deliverance that is offered to them, but by their
obstinacy bring down on themselves a heavier judgment, the power and authority
to <i>bind </i>is likewise granted to the ministers of the Gospel. It must be
observed, however, that this does not belong to the nature of the Gospel, but is
accidental; as Paul also informs us, when, speaking of the <i>vengeance
</i>which he tells us that he has it in his power to execute against all
unbelievers and rebels, he immediately adds,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">When your obedience shall
have been
fulfilled,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 10:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For were it not that the reprobate, through their own
fault, turn life into death, the Gospel would be to all <i>the power of God to
salvation</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:16;) but as many persons no sooner hear it than their impiety openly breaks
out, and provokes against them more and more the wrath of God, to such persons
its <i>savor </i>must be <i>deadly</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The substance of this statement is, that Christ
intended to assure his followers of the salvation promised to them in the
Gospel, that they might expect it as firmly as if he were himself to descend
from heaven to bear testimony concerning it; and, on the other hand, to strike
despisers with terror, that they might not expect their mockery of the ministers
of the word to remain unpunished. Both are exceedingly necessary; for the
inestimable <i>treasure </i>of life is exhibited to us <i>in earthen
vessels</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:7,) and had not the authority of the doctrine been established in
this manner, the faith of it would have been, almost every moment, ready to give
way.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f440</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The reason why the ungodly become so daring and presumptuous is, that they
imagine they have to deal with men. Christ therefore declares that, by the
preaching of the Gospel, is revealed on the earth what will be the heavenly
judgment of God, and that the certainty of life or death is not to be obtained
from any other source.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a great honor, that we are God&#8217;s
messengers to assure the world of its salvation. It is the highest honor
conferred on the Gospel, that it is declared to be the <i>embassy </i>of mutual
<i>reconciliation </i>between God and men,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:20.) In a word, it is a wonderful consolation to devout minds to
know that the message of salvation brought to them by a poor mortal man is
ratified before God. Meanwhile, let the ungodly ridicule, as they may think fit,
the doctrine which is preached to them by the command of God, they will one day
learn with what truth and seriousness God threatened them by the mouth of men.
Finally, let pious teachers, resting on this assurance, encourage themselves and
others to defend with boldness the life-giving grace of God, and yet let them
not the less boldly thunder against the hardened despisers of their
doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hitherto I have given a plain exposition of the
native meaning of the words, so that nothing farther could have been desired,
had it not been that the Roman Antichrist, wishing to cloak his tyranny, has
wickedly and dishonestly dared to pervert the whole of this passage. The light
of the true interpretation which I have stated would be of itself sufficient,
one would think, for dispelling his darkness; but that pious readers may feel no
uneasiness, I shall briefly refute his disgusting calumnies. First, he alleges
that Peter is declared to be the foundation of the Church. But who does not see
that what he applies to the person of a man is said in reference to
Peter&#8217;s faith in Christ? There is no difference of meaning, I acknowledge,
between the two Greek words
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Pe&gt;trov</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>Peter</i>)<i> </i>and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pe&gt;tra</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>petra</i>,<i> a stone </i>or <i>rock</i>,) 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f441</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>except that the former belongs to the Attic, and the latter to the ordinary
dialect. But we are not to suppose that Matthew had not a good reason for
employing this diversity of expression. On the contrary, the gender of the noun
was intentionally changed, to show that he was now speaking of something
different.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f442</font></sup><font face="Palatino">A
distinction of the same sort, I have no doubt, was pointed out by Christ in his
own language; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f443</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
therefore Augustine judiciously reminds the reader that it is not
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pe&gt;tra</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
(petra</i>,<i> a stone </i>or <i>rock) </i>that is derived from
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Pe&gt;trov</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>Peter</i>,)<i> </i>but
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Pe&gt;trov</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>Peter</i>)<i> </i>that is derived from
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pe&gt;tra</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
(petra</i>,<i> a stone </i>or <i>rock</i>.<i>)</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But not to be tedious, as we must acknowledge the
truth and certainty of the declaration of Paul, that the Church can have no
other <i>foundation </i>than Christ alone,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:11;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490220&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:20,) it can be nothing less than blasphemy and sacrilege when the Pope has
contrived another <i>foundation</i>.<i> </i>And certainly no words can express
the detestation with which we ought to regard the tyranny of the Papal system on
this single account, that, in order to maintain it, the foundation of the Church
has been subverted, that the mouth of hell might be opened and swallow up
wretched souls. Besides, as I have already hinted, that part does not refer to
Peter&#8217;s public office, but only assigns to him a distinguished place among
the sacred stones of the temple. The commendations that follow relate to the
Apostolic office; and hence we conclude that nothing is here said to Peter which
does not apply equally to the others who were his companions, for if the rank of
apostleship was common to them all, whatever was connected with it must also
have been held in common.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it will be said, Christ addresses Peter alone: he
does so, because Peter alone, in the name of all, had confessed Christ to be
<i>the Son of God</i>,<i> </i>and to him alone is addressed the discourse, which
applies equally to the rest. And the reason adduced by Cyprian and others is not
to be despised, that Christ spake to all in the person of one man, in order to
recommend the unity of the Church. They reply, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f444</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that he
to whom this privilege was granted in a peculiar manner is preferred to all
others. But that is equivalent to saying that he was more an apostle than his
companions; for the power to <i>bind </i>and to <i>loose </i>can no more be
separated from the office of teaching and the Apostleship than light or heat can
be separated from the sun. And even granting that something more was bestowed on
Peter than on the rest, that he might hold a distinguished place among the
Apostles, it is a foolish inference of the Papists, that he received the
primacy, and became the universal head of the whole Church. Rank is a different
thing from power, and to be elevated to the highest place of honor among a few
persons is a different thing from embracing the whole world under his dominion.
And in fact, Christ laid no heavier burden on him than he was able to bear. He
is ordered to be the porter of the kingdom of heaven; he is ordered to dispense
the grace of God by <i>binding </i>and <i>loosing; </i>that is, as far as the
power of a mortal man reaches. All that was given to him, therefore, must be
limited to the measure of grace which he received for the edification of the
Church; and so that vast dominion, which the Papists claim for him, falls to the
ground.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But though there were no strife or controversy about
Peter,  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f445</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
still this passage would not lend countenance to the tyranny of the Pope. For no
man in his senses will admit the principle which the Papists take for granted,
that what is here granted to Peter was intended to be transmitted by him to
posterity by hereditary right; for he does not receive permission to give any
thing to his successors. So then the Papists make him bountiful with what is not
his own. Finally, though the uninterrupted succession were fully established,
still the Pope will gain nothing by it till he has proved himself to be
Peter&#8217;s lawful successor. And how does he prove it? Because Peter died at
Rome; as if Rome, by the detestable murder of the Apostle, had procured for
herself the primacy. But they allege that he was also bishop there. How
frivolous 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f446</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
allegation is, I have made abundantly evident in my <i>Institutes</i>,<i>
</i>(Book 4, Chapter 6,) to which I would willingly send my reader for a
complete discussion of this argument, rather than annoy or weary him by
repeating it in this place. Yet I would add a few words. Though the Bishop of
Rome had been the lawful successor of Peter, since by his own treachery he has
deprived himself of so high an honor, all that Christ bestowed on the successors
of Peter avails him nothing. That the Pope&#8217;s court resides at Rome is
sufficiently known, but no mark of a Church there can be pointed out. As to the
pastoral office, his eagerness to shun it is equal to the ardor with which he
contends for his own dominion. Certainly, if it were true that Christ has left
nothing undone to exalt the heirs of Peter, still he was not so lavish as to
part with his own honor to bestow it on apostates.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Having given a proof of his future glory, Christ
reminds his disciples of what </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
must suffer</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that they also may be
prepared to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bear the
cross</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for the time was at hand when
they must enter into the contest, to which he knew them to be altogether
unequal, if they had not been fortified by fresh courage. And first of all, it
was necessary to inform them that Christ must commence his reign, not with gaudy
display, not with the magnificence of riches, not with the loud applause of the
world, but with an ignominious death. But nothing was harder than to rise
superior to such an offense; particularly if we consider the opinion which they
firmly entertained respecting their Master; for they imagined that he would
procure for them earthly happiness. This unfounded expectation held them in
suspense, and they eagerly looked forward to the hour when Christ would suddenly
reveal the glory of his reign. So far were they from having ever adverted to the
ignominy of the cross, that they considered it to be utterly unsuitable that he
should be placed in any circumstances from which he did not receive honor. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f455</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> To them
it was a distressing occurrence that he should
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be rejected by the elders and the
scribes</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>who held the government of the
Church; and hence we may readily conclude that this admonition was highly
necessary. But as the bare mention of the cross must, of necessity, have
occasioned heavy distress to their weak minds, he presently heals the wound by
saying, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on the third day he
will rise again from the dead.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>And
certainly, as there is nothing to be seen in the cross but the weakness of the
flesh, till we come to his resurrection, in which the power of the Spirit shines
brightly, our faith will find no encouragement or support. In like manner, all
ministers of the Word, who desire that their preaching may be profitable, ought
to be exceedingly careful that the glory of his resurrection should be always
exhibited by them in connection with the ignominy of his death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we naturally wonder why Christ refuses to accept
as witnesses the Apostles, whom he had already appointed to that office; for why
were they sent but to be the heralds of that redemption which depended on the
coming of Christ? The answer is not difficult, if we keep in mind the
explanations which I have given on this subject: first, that they were not
appointed teachers for the purpose of bearing full and certain testimony to
Christ, but only to procure disciples for their Master; that is, to induce those
who were too much the victims of sloth to become teachable and attentive; and;
secondly, that their commission was temporary, for it ended when Christ himself
began to preach. As the time of his death was now at hand, and as they were not
yet fully prepared to testify their faith, but, on the contrary, were so weak in
faith, that their confession of it would have exposed them to ridicule, the Lord
enjoins them to remain silent till others shall have acknowledged him to be the
conqueror of death, and till he shall have endued them with increased
firmness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 16:22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Peter, taking him aside,
began to rebuke him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is a proof of
the excessive zeal of Peter, that he reproves his Master; though it would appear
that the respect he entertained for him was his reason for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>taking him
aside,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because he did not venture to
reprove him in presence of others. Still, it was highly presumptuous in Peter to
advise our Lord to <i>spare himself</i>,<i> </i>as if he had been deficient in
prudence or self-command. But so completely are men hurried on and driven
headlong by inconsiderate zeal, that they do not hesitate to pass judgment on
God himself, according to their own fancy. Peter views it as absurd, that the
Son of God,<i> </i>who was to be the Redeemer of the nation, should be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>crucified by the
elders</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and that he who was the Author
of life should be condemned to die. He therefore endeavors to restrain Christ
from exposing himself to death. The reasoning is plausible; but we ought without
hesitation to yield greater deference to the opinion of Christ than to the zeal
of Peter, whatever excuse he may plead.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And here we learn what estimation in the sight of God
belongs to what are called <i>good intentions</i>.<i> </i>So deeply is pride
rooted in the hearts of men, that they think wrong is done them, and complain,
if God does not comply with every thing that they consider to be right. With
what obstinacy do we see the Papists boasting of their devotions! But while they
applaud themselves in this daring manner, God not only rejects what they believe
to be worthy of the highest praise, but even pronounces a severe censure on its
folly and wickedness. Certainly, if the feeling and judgment of the flesh be
admitted, Peter&#8217;s intention was pious, or at least it looked well. And yet
Christ could not have conveyed his censure in harsher or more disdainful
language. Tell me, what is the meaning of that stern reply? How comes it that he
who so mildly on all occasions guarded against <i>breaking </i>even a <i>bruised
reed</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
42:3,) thunders so dismally against a chosen disciple? The reason is obvious,
that in the person of one man he intended to restrain all from gratifying their
own passions. Though the lusts of the flesh, as they resemble wild beasts, are
difficult to be restrained, yet there is no beast more furious than the wisdom
of the flesh. It is on this account that Christ reproves it so sharply, and
bruises it, as it were, with an iron hammer, to teach us that it is only from
the word of God that we ought to be wise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Get thee behind me,
Satan.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is idle to speculate, as some
have done, about the word
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ojpi&gt;sw</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>behind; </i>as if Peter were ordered to follow, and not to go before; for, in
a passage which we have already considered, Luke (4:8) informs us that our Lord
used those very words in repelling the attacks of Satan, and the verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">u[page</font><font face="Palatino">
(from which the Latin word <i>Apage </i>is derived) signifies to
<i>withdraw</i>. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f456</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Christ therefore throws his disciple to a distance from him, because, in his
inconsiderate zeal, he acted the part of <i>Satan; </i>for he does not simply
call him <i>adversary</i>,<i> </i>but gives him the name of the devil, as an
expression of the greatest abhorrence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art an offense to me; for thou
relishest not those things which are of God, but those which are of
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We must attend to this as the
reason assigned by our Lord for sending Peter away from him. Peter was <i>an
offense </i>to Christ, so long as he opposed his calling; for, when Peter
attempted to stop the course of his Master, it was not owing to him that he did
not deprive himself and all mankind of eternal salvation. This single word,
therefore, shows with what care we ought to avoid every thing that withdraws us
from obedience to God. And Christ opens up the original source of the whole
evil, when he says that Peter
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>relishes those things which are
of men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f457</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Lest we and our intentions should be sent away by our heavenly Judge to the
devil,  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f458</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
let us learn not to be too much attached to our own views, but submissively to
embrace whatever the Lord approves. Let the Papists now go and extol their
notions to the skies. They will one day learn, when they appear before the
judgment-seat of God, what is the value of their boasting, which Christ declares
to be from <i>Satan</i>.<i> </i>And with regard to ourselves, if we do not, of
our own accord, resolve to shut ourselves out from the way of salvation by
deadly obstacles, let us not desire to be wise in any other manner than from the
mouth of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Jesus said to his
disciples. </i></font><font face="Palatino">As Christ saw that Peter had a dread
of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
cross</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and that all the rest were
affected in the same way, he enters into a general discourse about
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bearing the
cross</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and does not limit his address to
the twelve apostles, but lays down the same law for all the godly. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f458a</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We
have already met with a statement nearly similar,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401038&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:38.) 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f459</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But in
that passage the apostles were only reminded of the persecution which awaited
them, as soon as they should begin to discharge their office; while a general
instruction is here conveyed, and the initiatory lessons, so to speak,
inculcated on all who profess to believe the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any man will come after
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These words are used for the express
purpose of refuting the false views of Peter 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f460</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Presenting himself to every one as an example of self-denial and of patience, he
first shows that it was necessary for him to endure what Peter reckoned to be
inconsistent with his character, and next invites every member of his body to
imitate him. The words must be explained in this manner: &#8220;If any man would
be my disciple, let him </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>follow me
by denying himself and taking up his cross</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>or, let him conform himself to my example.&#8221; The meaning is, that none
can be reckoned to be the disciples of Christ unless they are true imitators of
him, and are willing to pursue the same course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He lays down a brief rule for our imitation, in order
to make us acquainted with the chief points in which he wishes us to resemble
him. It consists of two parts, <i>self-denial </i>and a voluntary<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bearing of the cross. Let him
deny himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This <i>self-denial </i>is
very extensive, and implies that we ought to give up our natural inclinations,
and part with all the affections of the flesh, and thus give our consent to be
reduced to nothing, provided that God lives and reigns in us. We know with what
blind love men naturally regard themselves, how much they are devoted to
themselves, how highly they estimate themselves. But if we desire to enter into
the school of Christ, we must begin with that folly to which Paul
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:18) exhorts us, <i>becoming fools</i>,<i> that we may be wise;
</i>and next we must control and subdue all our affections.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And let him take up his
cross.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He lays down this injunction,
because, though there are common miseries to which the life of men is
indiscriminately subjected, yet as God trains his people in a peculiar manner,
in order that they may be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>conformed to the image of his
Son,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>we need not wonder that this rule
is strictly addressed to them. It may be added that, though God lays both on
good and bad men the burden of the cross, yet unless they willingly bend their
shoulders to it, they are not said to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bear the
cross</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for a wild and refractory horse
cannot be said to admit his rider, though he carries him. The patience of the
saints, therefore, consists in <i>bearing </i>willingly
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
cross</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which has been laid on them.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f461</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
adds the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>daily</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
&#8212; </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let him take up his
cross</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>DAILY &#8212; which is very
emphatic; for Christ&#8217;s meaning is, that there will be no end to our
warfare till we leave the world. Let it be the uninterrupted exercise of the
godly, that when many afflictions have run their course, they may be prepared to
endure fresh afflictions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he that would save his
life shall lose it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is a most
appropriate consolation, that they who willingly suffer death for the sake of
Christ  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f462</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
do actually obtain life; for Mark expressly states this as the motive to
believers in dying &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for my
sake, and for the sake of the Gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212;
</i>and<i> </i>in the words of Matthew the same thing must be understood. It
frequently happens that irreligious men are prompted by ambition or despair to
despise life; and to such persons it will be no advantage that they are
courageous in meeting death. The threatening, which is contrasted with the
promise, has also a powerful tendency to shake off carnal sloth, when he reminds
men who are desirous of the present life, that the only advantage which they
reap is, to<i> lose </i>life. There is a contrast intended here between temporal
and eternal death, as we have explained under
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401039&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:39, where the reader will find the rest of this subject. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f463</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For what doth it profit a
man?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word <i>soul </i>is here used
in the strictest sense. Christ reminds them that the <i>soul </i>of man was not
created merely to enjoy the world for a few days, but to obtain at length its
immortality in heaven. What carelessness and what brutal stupidity is this, that
men are so strongly attached to the world, and so much occupied with its
affairs, as not to consider why they were born, and that God gave them an
immortal soul, in order that, when the course of the earthly life was finished,
they might live eternally in heaven! And, indeed, it is universally
acknowledged, that the <i>soul </i>is of higher value than all the riches and
enjoyments of the world; but yet men are so blinded by carnal views, that they
knowingly and willfully abandon their souls to destruction. That the world may
not fascinate us by its allurements, let us remember the surpassing worth of our
<i>soul; </i>for if this be seriously considered, it will easily dispel the vain
imaginations of earthly happiness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Son of man will
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That the doctrine which has just
been laid down may more deeply affect our minds, Christ places before our eyes
the future judgment; for if we would perceive the worthlessness of this fading
life, we must be deeply affected by the view of the heavenly life. So tardy and
sluggish is our mind, that it needs to be aided by looking towards heaven.
Christ summons believers to his judgment-seat, to lead them to reflect at all
times that they lived for no other object than to long after that blessed
redemption, which will be revealed at the proper time. The admonition is
intended to inform us, that they do not strive in vain who set a higher value on
the confession of faith than on their own life. &#8220;Place your lives
fearlessly,&#8221; says he, &#8220;in my hand, and under my protection; for I
will at length appear as your avenger, and will fully restore you, though for
the time you may seem to have perished.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the glory of the Father, with
his angels.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>These are mentioned to guard
his disciples against judging of his kingdom from present appearances; for
hitherto he was unknown and despised, being concealed under the form and
condition of a servant. He assures them that it will be far otherwise when he
shall appear as the Judge of the world. As to the remaining part of the passage
in Mark and Luke, the reader will find it explained under the tenth chapter of
Matthew.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f464</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And then will he render to every
one according to his actions.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The reward
of works has been treated by me as fully as was necessary under another passage.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f465</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It
amounts to this: When a <i>reward </i>is promised to good works, their merit is
not contrasted with the justification which is freely bestowed on us through
faith; nor is it pointed out as the cause of our salvation, but is only held out
to excite believers to aim at doing what is right, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f466</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by
assuring them that their labor will not be lost. There is a perfect agreement,
therefore, between these two statements, that we are <i>justified freely</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:24,) because we are received into God&#8217;s favor without any merit; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f467</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and yet
that God, of his own good pleasure, bestows on our works a <i>reward </i>which
we did not deserve.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Verily, I say to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the disciples might still
hesitate and inquire when that day would be, our Lord animates them by the
immediate assurance, that he will presently give them a proof of his future
glory. We know the truth of the common proverb, that to one who is in
expectation even speed looks like delay; but never does it hold more true, than
when we are told to wait for our salvation till the <i>coming </i>of Christ. To
support his disciples in the meantime, our Lord holds out to them, for
confirmation, an intermediate period; as much as to say, &#8220;If it seem too
long to wait for the day of my coming, I will provide against this in good time;
for before you come to die, you will see with your eyes that kingdom of God, of
which I bid you entertain a confident hope.&#8221; This is the natural import of

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 17:1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And after six
days.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We must first inquire for what
purpose Christ clothed himself with heavenly glory for a short time, and why he
did not admit more than three of his disciples to be spectators. Some think that
he did so, in order to fortify them against the trial which they were soon to
meet with, arising from his death. That does not appear to me to be a probable
reason; for why should he have deprived the rest of the same remedy, or rather,
why does he expressly forbid them to make known what they had seen till after
his resurrection, but because the result of the vision would be later than his
death? I have no doubt whatever that Christ intended to show that he was not
dragged unwillingly to death, but that he came forward of his own accord, to
offer to the Father the sacrifice of obedience. The disciples were not made
aware of this till Christ rose; nor was it even necessary that, at the very
moment of his death, they should perceive the divine power of Christ, so as to
acknowledge it to be victorious on the cross; but the instruction which they now
received was intended to be useful at a future period both to themselves and to
us, that no man might take offense at the weakness of Christ, as if it were by
force and necessity that he had suffered. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f472</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It
would manifestly have been quite as easy for Christ to protect his body from
death as to clothe it with heavenly glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are thus taught that he was subjected to death,
because he wished it to be so; that he was crucified, because he offered
himself. That same flesh, which was sacrificed on the cross and lay in the
grave, might have been exempted from death and the grave; for it had already
partaken of the heavenly glory. We are also taught that, so long as Christ
remained in the world, bearing the form of a servant, and so long as his majesty
was concealed under the weakness of the flesh, nothing had been taken from him,
for it was of his own accord that he <i>emptied himself</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:7;) but now his resurrection has drawn aside that veil by which his power had
been concealed for a time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our Lord reckoned it enough to select
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>three
witnesses</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>because that is the number
which the Law has laid down for proving any thing;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">at the mouth of two

17:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The difference as to time ought not to give us
uneasiness. Matthew and Mark reckon
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>six</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>entire
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>days</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>happened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>about eight days
afterwards</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>including both <i>the
</i>day on which Christ spake these words, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>on which he was transfigured. We see
then that, under a diversity of expression, there is a perfect agreement as to
the meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And was transfigured before
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke says<i> </i>that this
happened </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>while he was
praying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and from the circumstances of
time and place, we may infer that he had prayed for what he now obtained, that
in the brightness of an unusual form his Godhead might become visible; not that
he needed to ask by prayer from another what he did not possess, or that he
doubted his Father&#8217;s willingness, but because, during the whole course of
his humiliation, he always ascribed to the Father whatever he did as a divine
Person, and because he intended to excite us to prayer by his
example.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">His <i>transfiguration </i>did not altogether enable
his disciples to see Christ, as he now is in heaven, but gave them a taste of
his boundless glory, such as they were able to comprehend. Then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his face shone as the sun;
</i></font><font face="Palatino">but now he is far beyond the sun in brightness.
In his <i>raiment </i>an unusual and dazzling whiteness appeared; but now
without <i>raiment </i>a divine majesty shines in his whole body. Thus in
ancient times God appeared to the holy fathers, not as He was in Himself, but so
far as they could endure the rays of His infinite brightness; for John declares
that not until</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">they are like him will
they see him as he is,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
John 3:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is no necessity for entering here into

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>countenance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for this was not a complete exhibition of the heavenly glory of Christ, but,
under symbols which were adapted to the capacity of the flesh, he enabled them
to taste in part what could not be fully comprehended.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And, lo, there appeared to
them Moses and Elijah.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is asked, Were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moses and
Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>actually present? or was it only
an apparition that was exhibited to the disciples, as the prophets frequently
beheld visions of things that were absent? Though the subject admits, as we say,
of arguments on both sides, yet I think it more probable that they were actually
brought to that place. There is no absurdity in this supposition; for God has
bodies and souls in his hand, and can restore the dead to life at his pleasure,
whenever he sees it to be necessary.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moses and
Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>did not then rise on their own
account, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f473</font></sup><font face="Palatino">but in
order to wait upon Christ. It will next be asked, How came the apostles to know
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moses and
Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>whom they had never seen? The
answer is easy. God, who brought them forward, gave also signs and tokens by
which they were enabled to know them. It was thus by an extraordinary revelation
that they obtained the certain knowledge that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moses and
Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why did these two appear rather than others who
equally belonged to the company of the holy fathers? It was intended to
demonstrate that Christ alone is the end of the Law and of the Prophets; and
that single reason ought to satisfy us:  for it was of the utmost importance to
our faith that Christ did not come into our world without a testimony, but with
commendations which God had formerly bestowed. I have no objection, however, to
the reason which is commonly adduced, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>was selected, in preference to others, as the representative of all the
Prophets; because, though he left nothing in writing, yet next to Moses he was
the most distinguished of their number, restored the worship of God which had
been corrupted, and stood unrivaled in his exertions for vindicating the Law and
true godliness, which was at that time almost extinct.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they conversed with
Jesus.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>appeared</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>along with Christ, and held
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>conversation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>with him, this was a declaration of their being agreed. The subject on which
they conversed is stated by Luke only: they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>talked of the
decease</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which awaited Christ
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This must not be understood
to refer to them as private individuals, but rather to the commission which they
had formerly received. Though it was now a long time since they had died and
finished the course of their calling, yet our Lord intended once more to ratify
by their voice what they had taught during their life, in order to inform us
that the same salvation, through the sacrifice of Christ, is held out to us in
common with the holy fathers. At the time when the ancient prophets uttered
their predictions concerning the death of Christ, he himself, who was the
eternal wisdom of God, was sitting on the invisible throne of his glory. Hence
it follows that, when he was clothed in flesh, he was not liable to death any
farther than as he submitted to it of his own free will.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord, it is good for us to be
here.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke tells us that Peter uttered
these words </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>while Moses and
Elijah were departing;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and hence we
infer that he was afraid lest, at their departure, that pleasant and delightful
exhibition should vanish away. We need not wonder that Peter was so captivated
by the loveliness of what he beheld, as to lose sight of every other person, and
rest satisfied with the mere enjoyment of it; as it is said in the
psalm,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">In thy presence is
fulnessess of joy,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
16:11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But his desire was foolish; first, because he did not
comprehend the design of the vision; secondly, because he absurdly put the
servants on a level with their Lord; and, thirdly, he was mistaken in proposing
to build fading tabernacles 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f474</font></sup><font face="Palatino">for men
who had been already admitted to the glory of heaven and of the
angels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have said that he did not understand the design of
the vision; for, while he was hearing, from the mouth of <i>Moses and
Elijah</i>,<i> </i>that the time of Christ&#8217;s death was at hand, he
foolishly dreamed that his present aspect, which was temporary, would endure for
ever. And what if the kingdom of Christ had been confined in this way to the
narrow limits of twenty or thirty feet? Where would have been the redemption of
the whole world? Where would have been the communication of eternal salvation?
It was also highly absurd to conceive of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moses and
Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as companions of the Son of God,
as if it had not been proper that all should be reduced to a lower rank, that he
alone may have the pre-eminence. And if Peter is satisfied with his present
condition, why does he suppose that earthly supports were needed by those
persons, the very sight of whom, he imagined, was enough to make him
happy?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Justly, therefore, is it stated by two of the
Evangelists, that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knew not
what he said</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and Mark assigns the
reason, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they were
afraid</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for God did not intend that the
apostles should, at that time, derive any advantage from it beyond that of
beholding for a moment, as in a bright mirror, the divinity of his Son. At a
later period, he pointed out to them the fruit of the vision, and corrected the
error of their judgment. What is stated by Mark must therefore mean, that Peter
was carried away by frenzy, and spoke like a man who had lost his
senses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo, a bright cloud
overshadowed them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Their eyes were
covered by <i>a cloud</i>,<i> </i>in order to inform them, that they were not
yet prepared for beholding the brightness of the heavenly glory. For, when the
Lord gave tokens of his presence, he employed, at the same time, some coverings
to restrain the arrogance of the human mind. So now, with the view of teaching
his disciples a lesson of humility, he withdraws from their eyes the sight of
the heavenly glory. This admonition is likewise addressed to us, that we may not
seek to pry into the secrets which lie beyond our senses, but, on the contrary,
that every man may keep within the limits of sobriety, according to the measure
of his faith. In a word, this <i>cloud </i>ought to serve us as a bridle, that
our curiosity may not indulge in undue wantonness. The disciples, too, were
warned that they must return to their former warfare, and therefore must not
expect a triumph before the time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And, lo, a voice from the
cloud.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It deserves our attention, that
the <i>voice </i>of God was heard from the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cloud</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>but that neither a body nor a face was seen. Let us therefore remember the
warning which Moses gives us, that God has no visible shape, lest we should
deceive ourselves by imagining that He resembled a man,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;050415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
4:15.) There were, no doubt, various appearances under which God made himself
known to the holy fathers in ancient times; but in all cases he refrained from
using signs which might induce them to make for themselves idols. And certainly,
as the minds of men are too strongly inclined to foolish imaginations, there was
no necessity for throwing oil upon the flame. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f475</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
manifestation of the glory of God was remarkable above all others. When he makes
a cloud to pass between Him and us, and invites us to himself by His voice, what
madness is it to attempt to place Him before our eyes by a block of wood or of
stone? Let us therefore endeavor to enter by faith alone, and not by the eyes of
flesh, into that inaccessible light in which God dwells.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
voice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>came
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the
cloud</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that the disciples, knowing it to
have proceeded from God, might receive it with due reverence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is my beloved
Son.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I willingly concur with those who
think that there is an implied contrast of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Moses and
Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>with Christ, and that the
disciples of God&#8217;s own Son are here charged to seek no other teacher. The
word <i>Son </i>is emphatic, and raises him above servants. There are two titles
here bestowed upon Christ, which are not more fitted to do honor to him than to
aid our faith: a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beloved
Son</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and a Master. The Father calls him
my </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and thus declares him to be the
Mediator, by whom he reconciles the world to himself. When he enjoins us to
<i>hear him</i>,<i> </i>he appoints him to be the supreme and only teacher of
his Church. It was his design to distinguish Christ from all the rest, as we
truly and strictly infer from those words, that by nature he was God&#8217;s
<i>only Son</i>.<i> </i>In like manner, we learn that he alone is <i>beloved
</i>by the Father, and that he alone is appointed to be our Teacher, that in him
all authority may dwell.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it will perhaps be objected, Does not God love
angels and men? It is easy to reply, that the fatherly love of God, which is
spread over angels and men, proceeds from him as its source. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Son</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beloved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>by the Father, not so as to make other creatures the objects of his hatred,
but so that he communicates to them what belongs to himself. There is a
difference, no doubt, between our condition and that of the angels; for they
never were alienated from God, and therefore needed not that he should reconcile
them; while we are enemies on account of sin, till Christ procure for us his
favor. Still, it is a fixed principle that God is gracious to both, only so far
as he embraces us in Christ; for even the angels would not be firmly united to
God if Christ were not their Head. It may also be observed that, since the
Father here speaks of himself as different from the Son, there is a distinction
of persons; for they are one in essence and alike in glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hear
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I mentioned a little ago, that
these words were intended to draw the attention of the Church to Christ as the
only Teacher, that on his mouth alone it may depend. For, though Christ came to
maintain the authority of <i>the Law and the Prophets</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:17,) yet he holds the highest rank, so that, by the brightness of his gospel,
he causes those sparks which shone in the Old Testament to disappear. He is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Sun of
righteousness,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>whose arrival brought the
full light of day. And this is the reason why the Apostle says
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:1) that</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">God, who at sundry times and in various
ways spoke formerly by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken to us by his
beloved Son.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, Christ is as truly heard at the present day
in the Law and in the Prophets as in his Gospel; so that in him dwells the
authority of a <i>Master</i>,<i> </i>which he claims for himself alone, saying,
<i>One is your Master</i>,<i> even Christ</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:8.) But his authority is not fully acknowledged, unless all the tongues of
men are silent. If we would submit to his doctrine, all that has been invented
by men must be thrown down and destroyed. He is every day, no doubt, sending out
teachers, but it is to state purely and honestly what they have learned from
him, and not to corrupt the gospel by their own additions. In a word, no man can
be regarded a faithful teacher of the Church, unless he be himself a disciple of
Christ, and bring others to be taught by him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And having heard
this</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>God intended that the disciples
should be struck with this terror, in order to impress more fully on their
hearts the remembrance of the vision. Yet we see how great is the weakness of
our nature, which trembles in this manner at hearing the voice of God. If
ungodly men mock at God, or despise him without concern, it is because God does
not address them so as to cause his presence to be felt; but the majesty of God,
as soon as we perceive him, must unavoidably cast us down.</font><br></div>

flesh, might no longer fill them with terror. Nor is it only by his words that

had a temporary glory, that Christ alone might remain fully in view. If we would
properly avail ourselves of the aid of Moses, we must not stop with him, but
must endeavor to be conducted by his hand to Christ, of whom both he and all the
rest are ministers. This passage may also be applied to condemn the
superstitions of those who confound Christ not only with prophets and apostles,
but with saints of the lowest rank, in such a manner as to make him nothing more
than one of their number. But when the saints of God are eminent in graces, it
is for a totally different purpose than that they should defraud Christ of a
part of his honor, and appropriate it to themselves. In the disciples themselves
we may see the origin of the mistake; for so long as they were terrified by the
majesty of God, their minds wandered in search of men, but when Christ gently
raised them up, they saw him <i>alone</i>.<i> </i>If we are made to experience
that consolation by which Christ relieves us of our fears, all those foolish
affections, which distract us on every hand, will vanish away.</font><br></div>

disciples would not have believed it, if Christ had not given a more striking
proof of his glory in his resurrection. But after that his divine power had been
openly displayed, that temporary exhibition of his glory began to be admitted,
so as to make it fully evident that, even during the time that he <i>emptied
himself</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:7,) he continued to retain his divinity entire, though it was concealed under

under the influence of that dream which is now held as an undoubted oracle among
the Rabbins, that there would be a first and a second coming of the Messiah;
that in the first he would be mean and despised, but that this would be shortly
afterwards followed by his royal dignity. And, indeed, there is some
plausibility in that error, for it springs from a true principle. The Scripture,
too, speaks of a first and a second coming of the Messiah; for it promises that
he will be a Redeemer, to expiate by his sacrifice the sins of the world

death, and as subjecting all things to his dominion. But we see how the Rabbins
corrupt the pure word of God by their inventions; and as every thing was greatly

embraced this foolish notion.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

(4:5,6)had even given to him the name of

Kings 17:1) were to return a second time to the world. Christ now declares that
every thing which Malachi uttered was true, but that his prediction had been
misunderstood and distorted from its true meaning. &#8220;The<i>
</i>promise,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that <i>Eliah </i>would come was true, and
has been already fulfilled; but the scribes have already rejected Elijah, whose
name they idly and falsely plead in opposing me.&#8221;</font><br></div>

over to Christ, who would complete the work which he had begun. Now as the
scribes had shamefully rejected John, Christ reminds his disciples that the
impostures of such men ought not to give them uneasiness, and that it ought not
to be reckoned strange, if, after having rejected the servant, they should, with
equal disdain, reject his Master. And that no one might be distressed by a
proceeding so strange, our Lord mentions that the Scripture contained
predictions of both events, that the Redeemer of the world, and Elijah his
forerunner, would be rejected by false and wicked teachers.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">As Mark is more full, and explains the circumstances
very minutely, we shall follow the order of his narrative. And first he points
out clearly the reason why Christ uses a harshness so unusual with him, when he
exclaims that the Jews, on account of their perverse malice, do not deserve to
be any longer endured. We know how gently he was wont to receive them, even when
their requests were excessively importunate. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f481</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> A
father here entreats in behalf of an only son, the necessity is extremely
urgent, and a modest and humble appeal is made to the compassion of Christ. Why
then does he, contrary to his custom, break out suddenly into passion, and
declare that they can be endured no longer? As the narrative of Matthew and Luke
does not enable us to discover the reason of this great severity, some
commentators have fallen into the mistake of supposing that this rebuke was
directed either against the disciples, or against the father of the afflicted
child. But if we duly consider all the circumstances of the case, as they are
related by Mark, there will be no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion, that
the indignation of Christ was directed against the malice of the scribes, and
that he did not intend to treat the ignorant and weak with such
harshness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">During Christ&#8217;s absence, a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lunatic</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>child had been brought forward. The scribes, regarding this as a plausible
occasion for giving annoyance, seized upon it eagerly, and entreated the
disciples that, if they had any power, they would exercise it in curing the
child. It is probable that the disciples made an attempt, and that their efforts
were unavailing; upon which the scribes raise the shout of victory, and not only
ridicule the disciples, but break out against Christ, as if in their person his
power had been baffled. It was an extraordinary display of outrageous impiety
united with equally base ingratitude, maliciously to keep out of view so many
miracles, from which they had learned the amazing power of Christ; for they
manifestly endeavored to extinguish the light which was placed before their
eyes. With good reason, therefore, does Christ exclaim that they could no longer
be endured, and pronounce them to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an unbelieving and perverse
nation; </i></font><font face="Palatino">for the numerous proofs which they had
formerly beheld ought at least to have had the effect of preventing them from

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He saw a great multitude

doubt, held up to public gaze; as the enemies of the truth are wont, on
occasions of triumph, to assemble a crowd about a trifle. The scribes had made
such a noise about it, as to draw down on the disciples the ridicule of many
persons. And yet it appears that there were some who were not ill disposed; for,
as soon as they see Jesus, they salute him; and even the insolence of the
scribes is restrained by his presence, for, when they are asked what is the
matter in dispute, they have not a word to say.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Master, I have brought to

</i>But both agree as to these two points, that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dumb</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and that at certain intervals he became furious. The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lunatic</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is applied to those who, about the waning of the <i>moon</i>,<i> </i>are
seized with epilepsy, or afflicted with giddiness. I do not admit the fanciful
notion of Chrysostom, that the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lunatic</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>was invented by a trick of Satan, in order to throw disgrace on the good
creatures of God; for we learn from undoubted experience, that the course of the
moon affects the increase or decline of these diseases. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f483</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And yet
this does not prevent Satan from mixing up his attacks with natural means. I am
of opinion, therefore, that the man was not naturally <i>deaf </i>and
<i>dumb</i>,<i> </i>but that Satan had taken possession of his tongue and ears;
and that, as the weakness of his brain and nerves made him liable to epilepsy,
Satan availed himself of this for aggravating the disease. The consequence was,
that he was exposed to danger on every hand, and was thrown into violent
convulsions, which left him lying on the ground, in a fainting state, and like a
dead man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us learn from this how many ways Satan has of
injuring us, were it not that he is restrained by the hand of God. Our
infirmities both of soul and body, which we feel to be innumerable, are so many
darts with which Satan is supplied for wounding us. We are worse than stupid, if
a condition so wretched does not, arouse us to prayer. But in this we see also
an amazing display of the goodness of God, that, though we are liable to such a
variety of dangers, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f484</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
surrounds us with his protection; particularly if we consider with what
eagerness our enemy is bent on our destruction. We ought also to call to
remembrance the consoling truth, that Christ has come to bridle his rage, and
that we are safe in the midst of so many dangers, because our diseases are
effectually counteracted by heavenly medicine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must attend also to the circumstance of the time.
The father replies, that his son had been subject to this grievous disease from
his <i>infancy</i>.<i> </i>If Satan was permitted to exert his power, to such an
extent, on a person of that tender age, what reason have not we to fear, who are
continually exposing ourselves by our crimes to deadly strokes, who even supply
our enemy with darts, and on whom he might justly be permitted to spend his
rage, if it were not kept under restraint by the astonishing goodness of
God?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 17:17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O unbelieving and rebellious
nation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Though Christ appears to direct
his discourse to the father of the <i>lunatic</i>,<i> </i>yet there can be no
doubt that he refers to the scribes, as I have lately explained; for it is
certain that the reproof is directed, not against ignorant and weak persons, but
against those who, through inveterate malice, obstinately resist God. This is
the reason why Christ declares that they are no longer worthy to be endured, and
threatens that ere long he will separate from them. But nothing worse could
happen to them than that Christ should leave them, and it was no light reproach
that they rejected so disdainfully the grace of their visitation. We must also
observe here, that we ought to treat men in various ways, each according to his
natural disposition. For, while our Lord attracts to him the teachable by the
utmost mildness, supports the weak, and gently arouses even the sluggish, he
does not spare those crooked serpents, on whom he perceives that no remedies can
effect a cure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark 9:20.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And as soon as he saw
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That the devil should rage with
more than ordinary cruelty against the man, when he is brought to Christ, ought
not to excite surprise; for in proportion as the grace of Christ is seen to be
nearer at hand, and acts more powerfully, the fury of Satan is the more highly
excited. The presence of Christ awakens him like the sound of a trumpet. He
raises as violent a storm as he can, and contends with all his might. We ought
to be prepared beforehand with such meditations, that our faith may not be
disturbed, when the approach of the grace of Christ is met by more than ordinary
violence on the part of our enemy. Nor ought we to lose sight of another point,
that the true commencement of our cure is, when our affliction is so heavy that
we are almost at the point of death. It must also be taken into account that, by
means of the furious attack of Satan, our Lord lights a torch to cause his grace
to be seen; for, when the spectators were appalled at the dreadful spectacle,
the display of the power of Christ, which immediately followed, was more
distinctly perceived.</font><br></div>

child.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence we infer that this
punishment was not inflicted on account of the sins of the individual, but was a
secret judgment of God. True indeed, even infants, as soon as they have come out
of the womb, are not innocent in the sight of God, or free from guilt; but
God&#8217;s chastisements have sometimes hidden causes, and are intended to try
our obedience. We do not render to God the honor which is due to Him, unless
with reverence and modesty we adore His justice, when it is concealed from us.

God; and the first step to prayer is, to raise it above all opposition by the
firm belief that our prayers are not in vain. As this man did not suppose Christ
to be at all different from other men, his false opinion is corrected; for our
faith must be so formed as to be capable and prepared for receiving the desired
favor. In his reply Christ does not administer a direct reproof, but indirectly
reminding the man of what he had said amiss, points out to him his fault, and
informs him how a remedy may be obtained.</font><br></div>

off the remains of infidelity which adhere to us, to strive against them, and to
pray to God to correct them, and, as often as we are engaged in this conflict,
to fly to him for aid. If we duly inquire what portion has been bestowed on

coming.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The disciples wonder that the
power which they once possessed has been taken from them; but they had lost it
by their own fault. Christ therefore attributes this want of ability to their
unbelief, and repeats and illustrates more largely the statement which he had
previously made, that <i>nothing is impossible to faith</i>.<i> </i>It is a
hyperbolical mode of expression, no doubt, when he declares that faith
<i>removes trees and mountains; </i>but the meaning amounts to this, that God
will never forsake us, if we keep the door open for receiving his grace. He does
not mean that God will give us every thing that we may mention, or that may
strike our minds at random. On the contrary, as nothing is more at variance with
faith than the foolish and irregular desires of our flesh, it follows that those
in whom faith reigns do not desire every thing without discrimination, but only
that which the Lord promises to give. Let us therefore maintain such moderation
as to desire nothing beyond what he has promised to us, and to confine our
prayers within that rule which he has laid down.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be objected, that the disciples did not
know whether or not the Lord was pleased to cure the <i>lunatic</i>.<i> </i>It

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

of the Spirit, which they had formerly exercised in working miracles, but
because they had quenched it by their indolence? But what Christ said about

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 17:22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And while they remained in
Galilee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The nearer that the time of his
death approached, the more frequently did Christ warn his disciples, lest that
melancholy spectacle might give a violent shock to their faith. It was shortly
after the miracle had been performed that this discourse was delivered; for Mark
says that he went from that place to Galilee, in order to spend there the
intervening time in privacy; for he had resolved to come to Jerusalem on the day
of the annual sacrifice, because he was to be sacrificed at the approaching
Passover.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The disciples had previously received several
intimations on this subject, and yet they are as much alarmed as if nothing
relating to it had ever reached their ears. So great is the influence of
preconceived opinion, that it brings darkness over the mind in the midst of the
clearest light. The apostles had imagined that the state of Christ&#8217;s
kingdom would be prosperous and delightful, and that, as soon as he made himself
known, he would be universally received with the highest approbation. They never
thought it possible that the priests, and scribes, and other rulers of the
Church, would oppose him. Under the influence of this prejudice, they admit
nothing that is said on the other side; for Mark says that they <i>understood
not </i>what our Lord meant. Whence came it that a discourse so clear and
distinct was not understood, but because their minds were covered by the thick
veil of a foolish imagination?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They did not venture to make any farther inquiry.
This must have been owing, in part, to their reverence for their Master; but I
have no doubt that their grief and astonishment at what they had heard kept them
silent. Such bashfulness was not altogether commendable; for it kept them in
doubt, and hesitation, and sinful grief. In the meantime, a confused principle
of piety, rather than a clear knowledge of the truth, kept them attached to
Christ, and prevented them from leaving his school. A certain commencement of
faith and right understanding had been implanted in their hearts, which made
their zeal in following Christ not very different from the <i>implicit faith
</i>of the Papists; but as they had not yet made such progress as to become
acquainted with the nature of the kingdom of God and of the renewal which had
been promised in Christ, I say that they were guided by zeal for piety rather
than by distinct knowledge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this way we come to see what there was in them
that deserved praise or blame. But though their stupidity could not entirely be
excused, we have no reason to wonder that a plain and distinct announcement of
the cross of their Master, and of the ignominy to which he would be subjected,
appeared to them a riddle; not only because they reckoned it to be inconsistent
with the glory of the Son of God that he should be rejected and condemned, but
because it appeared to them to be highly improbable that the grace which was
promised in a peculiar manner to the Jews should be set at naught by the rulers
of the nation. But as the immoderate dread of the cross, which had suddenly
seized upon them, shut the door against the consolation which was immediately
added, arising out of the hope of the resurrection, let us learn that, when the
death of Christ is mentioned, we ought always to take into view at once the
whole of the three days, that his death and burial may lead us to a blessed
triumph and to a new life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 18:1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At that time the disciples
came to Jesus.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is evident from the
other two Evangelists, that the disciples did not come to Christ of their own
accord, but that, having secretly
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>disputed on the
road</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>they were brought out of their
lurking-places, and dragged forth to light. There is nothing inconsistent with
this in the account given by Matthew, who hastens to Christ&#8217;s reply, and
does not relate all the circumstances of the case, but passes over the
commencement, and relates in a summary manner the reason why Christ rebuked the
foolish ambition of his disciples for the highest rank. When Christ makes
inquiry about a secret conversation, and forces the disciples to acknowledge
what they would willingly have kept back, this teaches us that we ought to
beware of all ambition, however carefully it may be concealed. We must also
attend to the time at which this occurred. The prediction of his death had made
them sad and perplexed; but as if they had received from it unmingled delight,
as if they had tasted of the nectar which the poets feign, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f492</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they
immediately enter into a dispute about the highest rank. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f493</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> How was
it possible that their distress of mind vanished in a moment, but because the
minds of men are so devoted to ambition, that, forgetful of their present state
of warfare, they continually rush forward, under the delusive influence of a
false imagination, to obtain a triumph? And if the apostles so soon forgot a
discourse which they had lately heard, what will become of us if, dismissing for
a long period meditation on the cross, we give ourselves up to indifference and
sloth, or to idle speculations?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is asked, what occasioned the dispute among
the disciples? I reply, as the flesh willingly shakes off all uneasiness, they
left out of view every thing that had given rise to grief, and fixed on what had
been said about the resurrection; and out of this a debate sprung up among idle
persons. And as they refuse the first part of the doctrine, for which the flesh
has no relish, God permits them to fall into a mistake about the resurrection,
and to dream of what would never take place, that, by mere preaching, Christ
would obtain a kingdom, an earthly kingdom, and would immediately rise to the
highest prosperity and wealth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There were two faults in this debate. First, the
apostles were to blame for laying aside anxiety about the warfare to which they
had been called, and for demanding beforehand repose, and wages, and honors, as
if they had been soldiers that had served their time. The second fault is, that,
instead of laboring with one consent, as they ought to have done, to render
mutual assistance, and to secure for their brethren as large a share of honors
as for themselves, they strove with wicked ambition to excel each other. If we
wish that our manner of life should receive the approbation of the Lord, we must
learn to bear patiently the burden of the cross that has been laid on us, till
the proper time arrive for obtaining the crown, and, as Paul exhorts, <i>in
honor preferring one another</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:10.) To the first of these faults is closely allied the vain curiosity of
those persons in the present day, who, leaving the proper duties of their
calling, eagerly attempt to fly above the clouds. The Lord, who in the Gospel
invites us to his kingdom, points out to us the road by which we are to reach
it. Fickle persons, who give themselves no concern about faith, patience,
calling on God, and other exercises of religion, dispute about what is going on
in heaven; as if a man who was about to commence a journey made inquiry where a
lodging-place was situated, but did not move a step. Since we are commanded by
the Lord to walk on the earth, those who make the condition of departed saints
in heaven the subject of eager debate will be found, in so doing, to retard
their own progress towards heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Jesus called a child to
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The general meaning is, that those
who desire to obtain greatness by rising above their brethren, will be so far
from gaining their object that they do not even deserve to occupy the lowest
corner. He reasons from contraries, because it is humility alone that exalts us.
As we are more powerfully affected by appearances presented to the eyes, he
holds up to them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a little child
</i></font><font face="Palatino">as an emblem of humility. When he enjoins his
followers to become </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>like a
child</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>this does not extend
indiscriminately to all points. We know that in children there are many things
faulty; and accordingly Paul bids us be <i>children</i>,<i> </i>not in
<i>understanding</i>,<i> </i>but <i>in malice</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:20;) and in another passage he exhorts us to strive to reach the
state of <i>a perfect man</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:13.) But as <i>children </i>know nothing about being preferred to each other,
or about contending for the highest rank, Christ desires that their example
should banish from the minds of his followers those eager longings after
distinction, which wicked men and the children of the world continually indulge,
that they may not be allured by any kind of ambition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It will perhaps be objected, that children, even from
the womb, have a native pride, which leads them to desire the highest honor and
distinction; but the reply is obvious, that comparisons must not be too closely
or too exactly carried out, so as to apply at all points. The tender age of
little children is distinguished by simplicity to such an extent, that they are
unacquainted with the degrees of honor, and with all the incentives to pride; so
that they are properly and justly held out by Christ as an
example.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.

Hitherto they had been too much habituated to the ordinary customs of men; and
if they would gain their object, they must pursue a totally different course. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f494</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Every
one wished for himself the first or the second rank; but Christ does not allot
even the lowest place to any man who does not lose sight of distinctions and
<i>humble himself</i>.<i> </i>On the contrary, he says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever shall humble
himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of
heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is intended to guard us
against supposing that we degrade ourselves in any measure by freely
surrendering every kind of distinction. And hence we may obtain a short
definition 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f495</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of
humility. That man is truly humble who neither claims any personal merit in the
sight of God, nor proudly despises brethren, or aims at being thought superior
to them, but reckons it enough that he is one of the members of Christ, and
desires nothing more than that the Head alone should be

such a child.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The term <i>children
</i>is now applied metaphorically by Christ to those who have laid aside lofty
looks, and who conduct themselves with modesty and humility. This is added by
way of consolation, that we may not account it troublesome or disagreeable to
exercise humility, by means of which Christ not only receives us under his
protection, but likewise recommends us to the favor of men. And thus believers
are taught in what way they ought to esteem each other: it is by every one

himself</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>How is mutual friendship
usually maintained among the children of the world but by every man complying
with the wishes of another? The more desirous a man is to obtain renown, the
more insolently does he grasp at power, that he may be raised to a lofty
station, and that others may be ridiculed or despised; but Christ enjoins that
the more a man abases himself, the more highly shall he be honored. Such, too,
is the import of the words given by Luke,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he that is least among you shall
be great</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for our Lord does not enjoin
us to think more highly of those who justly deserve to be despised, but of those
who divest themselves of all pride, and are perfectly willing to occupy the
lowest place.</font><br></div>

one of those little ones.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This appears
to be added for the consolation of the godly, that they may not be rendered
uneasy by their condition, if they are despised by the world. It is a powerful
obstruction to the voluntary exercise of modesty, when they imagine, that by so
doing they expose themselves to contempt; and it is hard to be not only treated
disdainfully, but almost trodden under foot, by haughty men. Christ therefore
encourages his disciples by the consoling truth, that, if their mean condition
draws upon them the insults of the world, God does not despise
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he appears to have had likewise another object in
view; for a dispute had arisen amongst them as to the first place of honor, from
which it might naturally have been inferred that the Apostles were tainted with
sinful ambition. Every man who thinks too highly of himself, or desires to be
preferred to others, must necessarily treat his brethren with disdain. To cure
this disease, Christ threatens a dreadful punishment, if any man in his pride
shall throw down those who are oppressed with poverty, or who in heart are
already humbled.</font><br></div>

them the honor to which they are entitled. Now as there are various kinds of

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Woe to the world on account
of offenses!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage may be
explained in two ways. It may be taken
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>actively</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>as meaning that Christ pronounces a curse on the authors of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offenses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>and then by the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>world</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>we must understand all unbelievers. Or it may be taken
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>passively</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>as meaning that Christ deplores the evils which he perceives to be rapidly
coming on </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the world on account of
offenses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as if he had said, that no
plague will be more destructive, or attended by more fearful calamities, than
the alarm or desertion of many </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on
account of offenses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The latter meaning
is more appropriate; for I have no doubt that our Lord, who had spoken on
another occasion about offenses, proceeded to discourse more largely on this
subject; in order to make his disciples more attentive and watchful in guarding
against them. That Satan may not gain advantage over us through our
sluggishness, our Lord breaks out into an exclamation, that there is nothing
which we ought to dread more than
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offenses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for as Satan has innumerable kinds of them in his hand, he constantly, and
at almost every step, throws new difficulties in our way; while we, through
excessive tenderness or sloth, are too ready to yield. The consequence is, that
there are few who make tolerable progress in the faith of Christ; and of the few
who have begun to walk in the way of salvation, there is scarcely one in ten who
has the courage to persevere till he reaches the goal. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f500</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now
since Christ intended to strike his disciples with terror
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on account of
offenses</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and thus to arouse them to
exertion,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>woe</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to our indifference, if each of us does not earnestly apply himself to
overcome those
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offenses</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For offenses must
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To awaken more powerfully their
care and anxiety, our Lord reminds his disciples that there is no possibility of
walking but in the midst of various
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offenses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>as much as to say, that this is an evil which cannot be avoided. Thus he
confirms the former statement; for Christ shows us how great are the
inconveniences which arise from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offenses</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>since the Church never will be, and indeed never can be, free from this
evil. But he does not state the reason of this necessity, as Paul does, when,
speaking of heresies, he says that they arise, <i>that the good may be made
manifest</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 11:19.) It must be held by us as a fixed principle, that it is the
will of God to leave his people exposed to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offense</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>in order to exercise their faith, and to separate believers, as the refuse
and the chaff, from the pure wheat. Does any one object or complain, that blame
attaches to our Lord for giving loose reins to Satan, to accomplish the
destruction of wretched men? It is our duty to think and speak with the deepest
reverence of the secret purposes of God, of which this is one, that <i>the world
</i>must be disturbed by <i>offenses</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But woe to the man by whom the
offense cometh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After having exhorted
his disciples to beware of <i>offenses</i>,<i> </i>he again breaks out against
those who occasion them. To impart the greater vehemence to the threatening, he
adds, that neither a <i>right eye </i>nor a <i>right hand </i>ought to be
spared, if they occasion <i>offense </i>to us; for I explain these words as
added for the purpose of amplification. Their meaning is, that we ought to be so
constant and so zealous in opposing <i>offenses</i>,<i> </i>that we would rather
choose to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pluck out our eyes, or
cut off our hands,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>than give
encouragement to <i>offenses; </i>for if any man hesitate to incur the loss of
his limbs, he spares them at the risk of throwing himself into eternal
perdition. What dreadful vengeance then awaits those who by <i>offenses
</i>shall bring ruin on their brethren! 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f501</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400529&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

Christ repeats here the same statement.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Beware of despising one of
these little ones</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As pride is the
mother of disdain, and as contempt hardens men in giving <i>offense</i>,<i>
</i>our Lord, for the purpose of applying an appropriate remedy for curing this
disease, forbids his disciples to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>despise the little
ones.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>And certainly, as we have already
hinted, no man who has a proper care for his brethren will ever allow himself,
on light grounds, to give them <i>offense</i>.<i> </i>This conclusion of our
Lord&#8217;s discourse has the same tendency as the commencement of it, to
remind us that we ought to strive with each other who shall be most submissive
and modest; for God embraces with wonderful love the <i>little ones</i>.<i>
</i>It would be strange indeed that a mortal man should <i>despise</i>,<i>
</i>or treat as of no account, those whom God holds in such high esteem. He
proves this love from the fact, that angels, who are ministers of their
salvation, enjoy intimately the presence of God. Yet I do not think that he
intended merely to show what honor God confers on them by appointing <i>angels
</i>to be their guardians, but likewise to threaten those who <i>despise
</i>them; as if he had said, that it is no light matter to <i>despise </i>those
who have <i>angels </i>for their companions and friends, to take vengeance in
their behalf. We ought therefore to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beware of
despising</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>their salvation, which even
angels have been commissioned to advance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The interpretation given to this passage by some
commentators, as if God assigned to each believer his own <i>angel</i>,<i>
</i>does not rest on solid grounds. For the words of Christ do not mean that a
single
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>angel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is continually occupied with this or the other person; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f503</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
such an idea is inconsistent with the whole doctrine of Scripture, which
declares that <i>the</i> <i>angels encamp around
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
34:7) the godly, and that not one
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>angel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>only, but many, have been commissioned to guard every one of the faithful.
Away, then, with the fanciful notion of a good and evil angel, and let us rest
satisfied with holding that the care of the whole Church is committed to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>angels</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>to assist each member as his necessities shall require. It will perhaps be
asked, Do the angels occupy a station inferior to ours, because they have been
appointed to be our ministers? I reply, Though by nature they take rank above
us, this does not prevent them from rendering service to God 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f504</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in
dispensing the favor which he freely bestows upon us. For this reason they are

for he came down from heaven to save not them only, but even the dead who were
<i>lost</i>.<i> </i>It is in the highest degree unreasonable that we should
disdainfully reject those whom the Son of God has so highly esteemed. And even
if the weak labor under imperfections which may expose them to contempt, our

conversing daily with sinners. Christ therefore intended to show that a good
teacher ought not to labor less to recover those that are <i>lost</i>,<i>

Matthew the comparison proceeds farther, and teaches us not only that we ought
to treat with kindness the disciples of Christ, but that we ought to bear with
their imperfections, and endeavor, when they wander, to bring them back to the
road. For, though they happen sometimes to wander, yet as they are <i>sheep
</i>over which God has appointed his Son to be shepherd, so far are we from
having a right to chase or drive them away roughly, that we ought to gather them

<div><font face="Palatino">This parable is nothing else than a confirmation of
the preceding doctrine. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f515</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In the
first part is shown how readily God is disposed to pardon our sins, and in the
second part (which we shall afterwards treat in the proper place) is shown the
great malignity and obstinacy of those who murmur at his compassion. In the
person of a young prodigal who, after having been reduced to the deepest poverty
by luxury and extravagance, returns as a suppliant to his father, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f516</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to whom
he had been disobedient and rebellious, Christ describes all sinners who,
wearied of their folly, apply to the grace of God. To the kind father,

other hand, who not only pardons the crimes of his son, but of his own accord
meets him when returning, he compares God, who is not satisfied with pardoning
those who pray to him, but even advances to meet them with the compassion of a
father. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f518</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us
now examine the parable in detail.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 15:12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the younger of them said
to his father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The parable opens by
describing a mark of wicked arrogance in the youth, which appears in his being
desirous to leave his father, and in thinking that he cannot be right without
being permitted to indulge in debauchery, free from his father&#8217;s control.
There is also ingratitude in leaving the old man, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f519</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and not
only withholding the performance of the duties which be owed to him, but
crippling and diminishing the wealth of his house. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f520</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is
at length followed by wasteful luxury and wicked extravagance, by which he
squanders all that he had. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f521</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> After
so many offenses he deserved to find his father implacable. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f522</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Under this image our Lord unquestionably depicts to
us the boundless goodness and inestimable forbearance of God, that no crimes,
however aggravated, may deter us from the hope of obtaining pardon, There would
be some foundation for the analogy, if we were to say that this foolish and
insolent youth resembles those persons who, enjoying at the hand of God a great
abundance of good things, are moved by a blind and mad ambition to be separated
from Him, that they may enjoy perfect freedom; as if it were not more desirable
than all the kingdoms of the world to live under the fatherly care and
government of God. But as I am afraid that this allusion may be thought
overstrained, I shall satisfy myself with the literal meaning; not that I
disapprove of the opinion, that under this figure is reproved the madness of
those who imagine that it will be advantageous for them to have something of
their own, and to be rich apart from the heavenly Father; but that I now confine
myself within the limits of a Commentator. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f523</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Christ here describes what usually happens with young
men, when they are carried away by their natural disposition. Destitute of sound
judgment, and maddened by passion, they are ill fitted for governing themselves,
and are not restrained by fear or shame. It is therefore impossible but that
they shall abandon themselves to every thing to which their sinful inclination
prompts them, and rush on in a disgraceful course, till they are involved in
shameful poverty. He afterwards describes the punishment which, in the righteous
judgment of God, generally overtakes spendthrifts and prodigals. After having
wickedly squandered their means, they are left to pine in hunger, and not having
known how to use in moderation an abundant supply of the best bread, they are
reduced to eat acorns and <i>husks</i>.<i> </i>In short, they become the
companions of <i>swine</i>,<i> </i>and are made to feel that they are unworthy
to partake of human food; for it is swinish gluttony 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f524</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to
squander wickedly what was given for the support of life. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f525</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As to
the ingenious exposition which some have brought forward, that it is the just
punishment of wicked scorn, when those who have rejected delicious bread in the
house of our heavenly Father are driven by hunger to eat <i>husks</i>,<i> </i>it
is a true and useful doctrine; but in the meantime, we must bear in mind the
difference that exists between allegories and the natural meaning. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f526</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And was desirous to fill his
belly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This means that, in consequence
of hunger, he no longer thought of his former luxuries, but greedily devoured
<i>husks; </i>for of that kind of food he could not be in want, when he was
giving it to the <i>swine</i>.<i> </i>There is a well-known saying of Cyrus who,
having for a long time suffered hunger during a flight, and having been slightly
refreshed by eating coarse black bread, declared that he had never tasted savory
bread till now; so the young man who is here mentioned was compelled by
necessity to betake himself with appetite to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>husks</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>The reason is added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because
no man gave to him;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for the copulative
conjunction <i>and
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kai&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>must, in my opinion, signify
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f527</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and what is here said does not refer to <i>husks</i>,<i> </i>which he had at
hand, but I understand the meaning to be, that no man pitied his poverty; for
prodigals who throw away the whole of their property are persons whom no man
thinks himself bound to relieve, &#8212; nay more, as they have been accustomed
to squander every thing, men think that nothing ought to be given to them. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f528</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when he came to
himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here is described to us the way
in which God invites men to repentance. If of their own accord they were wise,
and became submissive, he would draw them more gently; but as they never stoop
to obedience, till they have been subdued by the rod, he chastises them
severely. Accordingly, to this young man, whom abundance 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f529</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
rendered fierce and rebellious, hunger proved to be the best teacher. Instructed
by this example, let us not imagine that God deals cruelly with us, if at any
time he visits us with heavy afflictions; for in this manner those who were
obstinate and intoxicated with mirth are taught by him to be obedient. In short,
all the miseries which we endure are a profitable invitation to repentance. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f530</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But as
we are slow, we scarcely ever regain <i>a sound mind</i>,<i> </i>unless when we
are forced by extreme distress; for until we are pressed by difficulties on
every hand, and shut up to despair, the flesh always indulges in gaiety, or at
least recoils. Hence we infer, that there is no reason to wonder, if the Lord
often uses violent and even repeated strokes, in order to subdue our obstinacy,
and, as the proverb runs, applies hard wedges to hard knots. It must also be
observed, that the hope of bettering his condition, if he returned to his
father, gave this young man courage to repent; for no severity of punishment
will soften our depravity, or make us displeased with our sins, till we perceive
some advantage. As this young man, therefore, is induced by confidence in his
father&#8217;s kindness to seek reconciliation, so the beginning of our
repentance must be an acknowledgment of the mercy of God to excite in us
favorable hopes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And while he was still afar
off.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the main point of the
parable. If men, who are by nature prone to revenge, and too tenacious of their
own rights, are moved by fatherly love kindly to forgive their children, and
freely to bring them back, when they are sunk in wretchedness, God, whose
boundless goodness exceeds all the affection of parents, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f531</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> will
not treat us more harshly. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f532</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And
certainly nothing is here attributed to an earthly father which God does not
promise with respect to himself. <i>Before they call</i>,<i> </i>says he, <i>I
will answer</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236524&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
65:24.) That passage too of David is well known,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">I said, I will
acknowledge against me my unrighteousness to the Lord and thou forgavest the
iniquity of my
sin,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
32:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As this father, therefore, is not merely pacified by
the entreaties of his son, but meets him when he is coming, and before he has
heard a word, embraces him, filthy and ugly as he is, so God does not wait for a
long prayer, but of his own free will meets the sinner as soon as he proposes to
confess his fault.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is wretched sophistry to infer from this, that the
grace of God is not exhibited to sinners until they anticipate it by their
repentance. &#8220;Here,&#8221; say they, &#8220;is held out to us a father
ready to pardon, but it is after that his son has begun to return to him; and
therefore God does not look, and does not bestow his grace, on any but those who
begin to seek him.&#8221; It is, no doubt, true that, in order to his obtaining
pardon, the sinner is required to have grief of conscience, and to be
dissatisfied with himself; but it is wrong to infer from this, that repentance,
which is the gift of God, is yielded by men from their own movement of their
heart. And in this respect it would be improper to compare a mortal man to God;
for it is not in the power of an earthly father to renew the stubborn heart of
his son, as God changes hearts of stone into hearts of flesh. In short, the
question here is not whether a man is converted by himself, and returns to him;
but only under the figure of a man is commended the fatherly gentleness of God,
and his readiness to grant forgiveness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father, I have sinned against
heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here is pointed out another
branch of repentance, namely, such a conviction of sin as is accompanied by
grief and shame. For he who is not grieved for having sinned, and whose offense
is not placed before his eyes, will sooner attempt any thing than think of
returning to the path of duty. Displeasure with sin must therefore go before
repentance. And there is great emphasis in this expression, that the young man
is said to have <i>come to </i>himself, as one whom the wanderings of wild
desires had hurried away into forgetfulness of himself. And certainly so far
astray are the impulses of the flesh, that any one who gives himself up to them
may be said to have <i>gone out of himself</i>,<i> </i>and to have lost his
senses. For this reason transgressors are commanded to <i>return to the
heart</i>, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f533</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
46:8.) Next follows a confession, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f534</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> not
such a one as the Pope has contrived, but one by which the son appeases his
offended <i>father; </i>for this humility is absolutely necessary in order to
obtain forgiveness of sins. This mode of expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have sinned against heaven, and
before thee,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is of the same import as if
he had said, that God was offended in the person of an earthly father. And
certainly this is the dictate of nature, that every one who rebels against a
<i>father </i>rises wickedly also against God, who has placed children in
subjection to parents.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bring out the best
robe.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although in parables (as we have
frequently observed) it would be idle to follow out every minute circumstance,
yet it will be no violence to the literal meaning, if we say, that our heavenly
Father not only pardons our sins in such a manner as to bury the remembrance of
them, but even restores those gifts of which we had been deprived; as, on the
other hand, by taking them from us, he chastises our ingratitude in order to
make us feel ashamed at the reproach and disgrace of our
nakedness.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This latter portion of the parable charges those
persons with cruelty, who would wickedly choose to set limits to the grace of
God, as if they envied the salvation of wretched sinners. For we know that this
is pointed at the haughtiness of the scribes, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f538</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who did
not think that they received the reward due to their merits, if Christ admitted

which He forgives with fatherly kindness.</font><br></div>

figure of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the first-born
son</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>the Jewish nation is described,
have indeed some argument on their side; but I do not think that they attend
sufficiently to the whole of the passage. For the discourse was occasioned by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the murmuring of the
scribes</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>who took offense at the
kindness of Christ towards wretched persons who had led a wicked life. He
therefore compares the scribes, who were swelled with presumption, to good and
modest men, who had always lived with decency and sobriety, and had honorably
supported their family; nay, even to obedient children, who throughout their
whole life had patiently submitted to their father&#8217;s control. And though
they were utterly unworthy of this commendation, yet Christ, speaking according
to their belief, attributes to them, by way of concession, their pretended
holiness, as if it had been virtue; as if he had said, Though I were to grant to
you what you falsely boast of, that you have always been obedient children to
God, still you ought not so haughtily and cruelly to reject your brethren, when
they repent of their wicked life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore his father went
out.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By these words he reproaches
hypocrites with intolerable pride, which makes it necessary that the Father
should entreat them not to envy the compassion manifested to their brethren. Now
though God does not entreat, yet by his example he exhorts us to bear with the
faults of our brethren. And in order to take away every excuse from wicked
severity, he not only introduces hypocrites as speaking, whose false boasting
might be confuted, but even affirms that, though any man had discharged, in the
most perfect manner, all the duties of piety towards the Father, yet he has no
just reason to complain because his brother obtains pardon. It is certain,
indeed, that the sincere worshippers of God are always pure and free from this
malignant disposition; but the design of Christ is, to show that it would be
unjust in any man to murmur on account of his brother having been received into
favor, even though he were not inferior in holiness to the
angels.</font><br></div>

The first is, that the <i>first-born son </i>has no reason to be angry, when he
sees his brother kindly received without any loss to himself; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f540</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and the
second is, that, without paying any regard to his brother&#8217;s safety, he is

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 18:15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if thy brother shall sin
against thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As he had discoursed about
bearing the infirmities of brethren, he now shows more clearly in what manner,
and for what purpose, and to what extent, we ought to bear with them. For
otherwise it would have been easy to reply, that there is no other way of
avoiding offenses, than by every man winking at the faults of others, and thus
what is evil would be encouraged by forbearance. Christ therefore prescribes a
middle course, which does not give too great offense to the weak, and yet is
adapted to cure their diseases; for that severity which is employed as a
medicine is profitable and worthy of praise. In short, Christ enjoins his
disciples to forgive one another, but to do so in such a manner as to endeavor
to correct their faults. It is necessary that this be wisely observed; for
nothing is more difficult than to exercise forbearance towards men, and, at the
same time, not to neglect the freedom necessary in reproving them. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f547</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Almost
all lean to the one side or to the other, either to deceive themselves mutually
by deadly flatteries, or to pursue with excessive bitterness those whom they
ought to cure. But Christ recommends to his disciples a mutual love, which is
widely distant from flattery; only he enjoins them to season their admonitions
with moderation, lest, by excessive severity and harshness, they discourage the
weak.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he distinctly lays down three steps of brotherly
correction. The first is, to give a private advice to the person who has
offended. The second is, if he shall give any sign of obstinacy, to advise him
again in presence of <i>witnesses</i>.<i> </i>The third is, if no advantage
shall be obtained in that way, to deliver him up to the public decision of
<i>the Church</i>.<i> </i>The design of this, as I have said, is, to hinder
charity from being violated under the pretence of fervent zeal. As the greater
part of men are driven by ambition to publish with excessive eagerness the
faults of their brethren, Christ seasonably meets this fault by enjoining us to
cover the faults of brethren, as far as lies in our power; for those who take
pleasure in the disgrace and infamy of brethren are unquestionably carried away
by hatred and malice, since, if they were under the influence of charity, they
would endeavor to prevent the shame of their brethren.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is asked, Ought this rule to be extended
indiscriminately to every kind of offense? For there are very many who do not
allow any public censures, till the <i>offender </i>has been privately
admonished. But there is an obvious limitation in the words of Christ; for he
does not simply, and without exception, order us to advise or reprove privately,
and in the absence of witnesses, all who have <i>offended</i>,<i> </i>but bids
us attempt this method, when we have been <i>offended </i>in private; by which
is meant, not that it is a business of our own, but that we ought to be wounded
and grieved whenever God is <i>offended</i>.<i> </i>And Christ does not now
speak about bearing injuries, but teaches us in general to cultivate such
meekness towards each other, as not to ruin by harsh treatment those whom we
ought to save.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f548</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Against
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This expression, as is evident
from what we have said, does not denote an injury committed against any one, but
distinguishes between secret and open sins. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f549</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For if
any man shall <i>offend </i>against the whole Church, Paul enjoins that he be
publicly reproved, so that even <i>elders </i>shall not be spared; for it is in
reference to them that he expressly enjoins Timothy, to</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">rebuke them publicly in
presence of all, and thus to make them a general example to others,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Timothy 5:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And certainly it would be absurd that he who has
committed a public offense, so that the disgrace of it is generally known,
should be admonished by individuals; for if a thousand persons are aware of it,
he ought to receive a thousand admonitions. The distinction, therefore, which
Christ expressly lays down, ought to be kept in mind, that no man may bring
disgrace upon <i>his brother</i>,<i> </i>by rashly, and without necessity,
divulging secret offenses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If he shall hear thee, thou hast
gained thy brother.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ confirms his
doctrine by its usefulness and advantage; for it is no small matter to <i>gain
</i>to God a soul which had been the slave of Satan. And how comes it that those
who have fallen do not often repent, but because they are regarded with hatred,
and treated as enemies, and thus acquire a character of hardened obstinacy?
Nothing, therefore, is more appropriate than meekness, which reconciles to God
those who had departed from him. On the other hand, he who inconsiderately
indulges in foolish flattery willingly places in jeopardy the salvation of a
<i>brother</i>,<i> </i>which he had in his hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">According to <i>Luke</i>,<i> </i>Christ expressly
enjoins us to be satisfied with a private reproof, if the <i>brother </i>be
brought to <i>repentance</i>.<i> </i>Hence, too, we infer how necessary it is
that mutual freedom of reproof should subsist among believers. For, since each
of us in many ways commits daily offenses, it would be outrageous cruelty to
betray, by our silence and concealment, the salvation of those whom we might, by
mild reproof, rescue from perdition. Though it does not always succeed, yet he
is chargeable with heinous guilt, who has neglected the remedy which the Lord
prescribes for promoting the salvation of the brethren. It is also worthy of
notice, that the Lord, in order to render us more zealous in performing our
duty, ascribes to us that honor which is his own; for to him alone, and to no
other, does it belong to convert a man; and yet he bestows on us this applause,
though we did not deserve it, that we
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gain a
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>who was lost.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if he shall not hear
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The second step is, that he who
displayed obstinacy, or refused to yield to one man, should be again admonished
in presence of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>witnesses</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>Here some object, that it will serve no purpose to call
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>witnesses</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>if we have to deal with an obstinate and rebellious man, because their
presence will be so far from leading him to acknowledge his guilt, that he will
only make a more wicked denial. But this difficulty will be speedily removed, if
we distinguish between
<i>den</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>i</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>al
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>evasion</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>He who explicitly denies the fact, and declares that he is falsely and
calumniously accused, must be left alone; for it would be ill vain to press him
by calling
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>witnesses</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>But as, in most cases, men shamelessly evade, or impudently excuse, the
improper and unjust actions which they have committed, till greater authority is
employed, towards such persons it is useful to observe this
method.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That Christ&#8217;s discourse ought to be understood
in this sense is evident from the word used,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e]legxon</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
reprove</i>,<i> </i>or <i>argue; </i>for to argue is to convince by
demonstration. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f550</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And how
could I <i>argue </i>with a man 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f551</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who
boldly denies the whole matter? for he who has the effrontery to deny the crime
which he has committed shuts the door against a second
admonition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive for what purpose Christ proposes to
call <i>witnesses</i>.<i> </i>It is, to give greater weight and impressiveness
to the admonition. As to the slightly different meaning to which he has turned
the words of Moses, it involves no absurdity. Moses forbids sentence to be
pronounced on a matter that is unknown, and defines this to be the lawful mode
of proving, that it be <i>established </i>by<i> </i>the testimony
of</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">two or three witnesses.
At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the
matter be established,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
19:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Alluding to that law, Christ says that, when two or
three witnesses shall rise up to condemn the obstinacy of the man, the case will
be clear, at least till the Church be prepared to take cognizance of it; for he
who refuses to hear <i>two or three witnesses</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f552</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>will have no reason to complain that he is dragged forth to
light.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tell it to the
Church.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is asked, what does he mean
by the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Church</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?
</i>For Paul orders
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 5:5) that the incestuous Corinthian shall be excommunicated, not by
a certain chosen number, but by the whole assembly of the godly; and therefore
it might appear to be probable that the power of judging is bestowed on the
whole of the people. But as at that time no
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Church</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as yet was in existence, which acknowledged the authority of Christ, and no
such order had been established, and as our Lord employs the ordinary and
received forms of expression, there can be no doubt that he alludes to the order
of the ancient
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Church</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>as in other places also he accommodates his modes of expression to what was
known and customary. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f553</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When he
commands that:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the offering, which we intend to
present, shall be left at the altar, till we are reconciled to an offended
brother,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400523&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
5:23,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he unquestionably intends, by means of that form of
the worship of God which was then in existence and in force, to teach us, that
we cannot in a right manner either pray, or offer any thing to God, so long as
we are at variance with our brethren. So then he now looked at the form of
discipline which was observed among the Jews; for it would have been absurd to
propose an appeal to the judgment of a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Church</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>which was not yet in existence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now since among the Jews the power of excommunication
belonged to the elders, who held the government of the whole
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Church</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>Christ speaks appropriately when he says that they who sinned must at length
be brought forward publicly to <i>the
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Church</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>if they either despise haughtily, or ridicule and evade, the private
admonitions. We know that, after the Jews returned from the Babylonish
captivity, a council was formed, which they called <i>Sanhedrim</i>,<i> </i>and
in Greek <i>Synedrion</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sune&gt;drion</font><font face="Palatino">)
and that to this council was committed the superintendence of morals and of
doctrine. This government was lawful and approved by God, and was a bridle to
restrain within their duty the dissolute and incorrigible.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It will perhaps be objected that, in the time of
Christ, every thing was corrupt and perverted, so that this tyranny was very far
from deserving to be accounted the judgment of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Church</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>But the reply is easy. Though
the method of procedure was at that time depraved and perverted, yet Christ
justly praises that order, such as it had been handed down to them from the
fathers. And when, shortly afterwards, he erected a <i>Church</i>,<i> </i>while
he removed the abuse, he restored the proper use of excommunication. Yet there
is no reason to doubt that the form of discipline, which prevailed in the
kingdom of Christ, succeeded in the room of that ancient discipline. And
certainly, since even heathen nations maintained a shadowy form of
excommunication, it appears that, from the beginning, this was impressed by God
on the minds of men, that those who were impure and polluted ought to be
excluded from religious services. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f554</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It
would therefore have been highly disgraceful to the people of God to have been
altogether destitute of that discipline, some trace of which remained among the
Gentiles. But what had been preserved under the Law Christ has conveyed to us,
because we hold the same rank with the ancient fathers. For it was not the
intention of Christ to send his disciples to the synagogue, which, while it
willingly cherished in its bosom disgraceful filth, excommunicated the true and
sincere worshippers of God; but he reminded us that the order, which had been
formerly established in a holy manner under the Law, must be maintained in his
<i>Church</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let him be to thee as a heathen and
a publican.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>What is here added as to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heathens and
publicans</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>confirms the interpretation
which I have given. For </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heathens
and publicans</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>having been at that time
regarded by the Jews with the greatest hatred and detestation, he compares to
them unholy and irreclaimable men, who yield to no admonitions. Certainly he did
not intend to enjoin them to avoid the society of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heathens</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>of whom </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Church</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>was afterwards composed; nor is
there any reason at the present day why believers should shrink from associating
with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>publicans</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>But in order that he might be more easily understood by the ignorant, Christ
borrowed a mode of expression from what was then customary among his nation; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f555</font></sup><font face="Palatino">and the
meaning is, that we ought to have no intercourse with the despisers of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Church</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>till they
repent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What things soever you shall
bind.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now repeats the same words
which he had formerly used,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401619&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
16:19,) but in a different sense; for there he intended to maintain their
authority in doctrine, but here he appoints discipline, which is an appendage to
doctrine. There Christ declared that the preaching of the Gospel would not be
without effect, but that the <i>odor </i>of it would either be <i>life-giving
</i>or <i>deadly</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:15,16:) here he affirms that, though wicked men ridicule the
judgment of <i>the Church</i>,<i> </i>it will not be ineffectual. We must attend
to this distinction, that <i>there </i>our Lord&#8217;s discourse relates to the
preached word, but <i>here </i>to public censures and discipline. Let the reader
go to that passage for the import of the metaphor, <i>binding and loosin</i>g. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f556</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The substance of it is this: Whoever, after
committing a crime, humbly confesses his fault, and entreats
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Church</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to forgive him, is absolved not
only by men, but by God himself; and, on the other hand, whoever treats with
ridicule the reproofs and threatenings of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Church</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>if he is condemned by her, the
decision which men have given will be ratified in heaven. If it be objected,
that in this way God is made a sort of petty judge, who concurs in the sentence
of mortal men, the reply is at hand. For when Christ maintains the authority of
his Church, he does not diminish his own power or that of his Father, but, on
the contrary, supports the majesty of his word. As in the former case
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401619&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
16:19) he did not intend to confirm indiscriminately every kind of doctrine, but
only that which had proceeded out of his mouth, so neither does he say in this
place that every kind of decision will be approved and ratified, but only that
in which he presides, and that too not only by his Spirit, but by his word.
Hence it follows, that men do no injury to the authority of God, when they
pronounce nothing but what comes from his mouth, and only endeavor faithfully to
execute what he has commanded. For, though Christ alone is the Judge of the
world, yet he chooses to have ministers to proclaim his word. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f557</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Besides, he wishes that his own decision should be pronounced by the Church; and
thus he takes nothing from his own authority by employing the ministry of men,
but it is Himself alone that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>looses and
binds</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a question arises. Since the Church endures
many hypocrites, and likewise
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>absolves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>looses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>)
</i>many whose professions of repentance are hypocritical, does it follow that
such persons will be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>absolved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>loosed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>)
</i>in heaven? I reply, the discourse is addressed to those only who are truly
and sincerely reconciled to the Church. For Christ, wishing to administer
comfort to trembling consciences, and to relieve them from fear, declares that
any who may have offended are freed from guilt in the sight of God, provided
that they be reconciled to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Church</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>For he has appointed this as the
pledge of heavenly grace, which has no reference to hypocrites, who pervert the
proper use of reconciliation, but awakens in the godly no ordinary confidence,
when they hear that their sins are blotted out before God and angels, as soon as
they have obtained forgiveness from <i>the Church</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the other clause, Christ&#8217;s meaning is not at
all ambiguous; for, since obstinate and haughty men are strongly inclined to
despise the decision of the Church on this pretense, that they refuse to be
subject to men &#8212; as wicked profligates often make bold appeals to the
heavenly tribunal 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f558</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212;
Christ, in order to subdue this obstinacy by terror, threatens that the
condemnation, which is now despised by them, will be ratified in heaven. He
encourages his followers, at the same time, to maintain proper severity, and not
to yield to the wicked obstinacy of those who reject or shake off discipline. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f559</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence, too, we may see how absurdly the Papists
torture this passage to cloak every species of tyranny. That the right of
excommunication is granted to the Church is certain, and is acknowledged by
every person of sound judgment; but does it follow that any individual, even
though not called by the <i>Church</i>,<i> </i>but elected 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f560</font></sup><font face="Palatino">by a
mitered and disguised beast, shall at his own caprice throw out the useless
squibs of excommunications? 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f561</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> On the
contrary, it is evident that the lawful government of the Church is committed to
elders, and not only to the ministers of the word, but to those also who, taken
from among the people, have been added to them for the superintendence of
morals. And yet, not satisfied with this impudence, they endeavor even to prove
from this passage that we must bear all the burdens which they shall impose. I
do not mention that the power which has been granted to the Church is basely
seized and carried off by those outrageous enemies of the Church; and I only
mention that, since Christ speaks only about correcting <i>offenders</i>,<i>
</i>those who by their laws ensnare souls are chargeable with not less folly
than wickedness in abusing this passage. Of the same stamp is their defense of
their auricular confession on this pretense; for if Christ intended that those
who by their own fault had been brought even to a public sentence should be
reconciled to the Church, he does not therefore lay an obligations 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f562</font></sup><font face="Palatino">on every
individual to pour his sins into the ear of the priest. But their fooleries are
so ridiculous, that it is unnecessary to spend any longer time in refuting
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Again I say to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He confirms the former statement;
for not only will God bestow the spirit of wisdom and prudence on those who ask
it, but he will also provide that not one thing which they shall do according to
his word shall want its power and effect. By uniting <i>agreement </i>with
<i>prayer,</i> he reminds us with what moderation and humility believers ought
to conduct themselves in all religious acts. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f563</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
<i>offender </i>must be admonished, and, if he does not receive correction, he
must be excommunicated. Here it is not only necessary to ask counsel at the
sacred mouth of God, so that nothing may be determined but by his word, but it
is proper at the same time to begin with prayer. Hence appears more clearly what
I have formerly stated, that men are not allowed the liberty of doing whatever
they please, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f564</font></sup><font face="Palatino">but that
God is declared to have the sole claim to the government of the
<i>Church</i>,<i> </i>so that he approves and ratifies the decisions of which he
is himself the Author. Meanwhile, when believers assemble, they are taught to
unite their prayers and to pray in common, not only to testify the unity of
faith, but that God may listen to the <i>agreement </i>of them all. So then, as
God frequently promises in other passages that he will graciously listen to the
private requests of each individual, so here Christ makes a remarkable promise
to public prayers, in order to invite us more earnestly to the practice of
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For where two or three are

shall undertake. There is therefore no reason to doubt that those who give
themselves up to his direction will derive most desirable advantage from his
presence. And since it is an invaluable blessing to have Christ for our director
in all our affairs, to bless our deliberations and their results; and since, on
the other hand, nothing can be more miserable than to be deprived of his grace,
this promise ought to add no small excitement to us to unite with each other in
piety and holiness. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f565</font></sup><font face="Palatino">For
whoever either disregards the holy assemblies, or separates himself from
brethren, and takes little interest in the cultivation of unity, by this alone
makes it evident that he sets no value on the presence of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must take care, first of all, that those who
are desirous to have Christ present with them shall <i>assemble in his name;
</i>and we must likewise understand what is the meaning of this expression; for
we perceive how ungodly men falsely and impudently, as well as wickedly, cover
their conspiracies with his sacred name. If therefore we do not wish to expose
Christ to their ridicule, and at the same time to overturn what he has here
promised, we must know first of all what is meant by this phrase. It means that
those who are </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>assembled
together</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>laying aside every thing that
hinders them from approaching to Christ, shall sincerely raise their desires to
him, shall yield obedience to his word, and allow themselves to be governed by
the Spirit. Where this simplicity prevails, there is no reason to fear that
Christ will not make it manifest that it was not in vain for <i>the assembly to
meet in his name</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this is displayed the gross ignorance of the

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 18:21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord, how often shall my
brother offend against me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Peter made this
objection according to the natural feelings and disposition of the flesh. It is
natural to all men to wish to be forgiven; and, therefore, if any man does not
immediately obtain forgiveness, he complains that he is treated with sternness
and cruelty. But those who demand to be treated gently are far from being
equally gentle towards others; and therefore, when our Lord exhorted his
disciples to meekness, this doubt occurred to Peter: &#8220;If we be so strongly
disposed to grant forgiveness, what will be the consequence, but that our lenity
shall be an inducement to <i>offend</i>?&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f566</font></sup><font face="Palatino">He asks,
therefore, if it be proper frequently to forgive offenders; for, since the
number <i>seven </i>is<i> </i>taken for a large number, the force of the adverb,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eJpta&gt;kiv</font><font face="Palatino">)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seven
times</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>is the same as if he had said,
&#8220;How long, Lord, dost thou wish that offenders be received into favor? for
it is unreasonable, and by no means advantageous, that they should, in every
case,<i> </i>find us willing to be reconciled.&#8221; But Christ is so far from
yielding to this objection, that he expressly declares that there ought to be no
limit to forgiving;  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f567 </font></sup>
<font face="Palatino">for he did not intend to lay down a fixed number, but
rather to enjoin us never to become wearied.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Luke </i>differs somewhat from <i>Matthew</i>;<i>
</i>for he states the command of Christ to be simply, that we should be prepared
to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forgive seven
times</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but the meaning is the same, that
we ought to be ready and prepared to grant forgiveness not once or twice, but as
often as the sinner <i>shall repent</i>.<i> </i>There is only this difference
between them, that, according to Matthew, our Lord, in reproving Peter for
taking too limited a view, employs hyperbolically a larger number, which of
itself is sufficient to point out the substance of what is intended. For when
Peter asked if he should </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forgive
seven times,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>it was not because he did
not choose to go any farther, but, by presenting the appearance of a great
absurdity, to withdraw Christ from his opinion, as I have lately hinted. So then
he who shall be prepared to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forgive seven
times</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>will be willing to be reconciled
as far as to the <i>seventieth </i>offense.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the words of Luke give rise to another question;
for Christ does not order us to grant
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forgiveness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>till</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the offender
turn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to us and give evidence of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repentance</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f567a</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>I reply, there are two ways in which offenses are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forgiven.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">If a man shall do me an injury, and I, laying
aside the desire of revenge, do not cease to love him, but even repay kindness
in place of injury, though I entertain an unfavorable opinion of him, as he
deserves, still I am said to<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forgive
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>For when God commands us to wish
well to our enemies, He does not therefore demand that we approve in them what
He condemns, but only desires that our minds shall be purified from all hatred.
In this kind of pardon, so far are we from having any right to wait till he who
has offended shall return of his own accord to be reconciled to us, that we
ought to love those who deliberately provoke us, who spurn reconciliation, and
add to the load of former offenses. A second kind of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forgiving</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is, when we receive a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>brother</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>into favor, so as to think favorably respecting him, and to be convinced
that the remembrance of his offense is blotted out in the sight of God. And this
is what I have formerly remarked, that in this passage Christ does not speak
only of injuries which have been done to us, but of every kind of offenses; for
he desires that, by our compassion, we shall raise up those who have fallen. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f568</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
doctrine is very necessary, because naturally almost all of us are peevish
beyond measure; and Satan, under the pretense of severity, drives us to cruel
rigor, so that wretched men, to whom pardon is refused, are swallowed up by
grief and despair.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here another question arises. As soon as a man by
words makes profession of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repentance</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>are we bound to believe him? Were this done, we must of necessity go
willingly and knowingly into mistake; for where will be discretion, if any man
may freely impose on us, even to the hundredth offense? I answer,
.<i>first</i>,<i> </i>the discourse relates here to daily faults, in which every
man, even the best, needs forgiveness. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f569</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Since,
then, amidst such infirmity of the flesh, our road is so slippery, and snares
and attacks so numerous what will be the consequence if, at the second or third
fall, the hope </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
forgiveness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is cut off? We must add,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>secondly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that Christ does not deprive believers of the exercise of judgment, so as to
yield a foolish readiness of belief to every slight expression, but only desires
us to be so candid and merciful, as to stretch out the hand to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>offenders</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>provided there be evidence that they are sincerely dissatisfied with their
sins. For repentance is a sacred thing, and therefore needs careful examination;
but as soon as the offender gives probable evidence of conversion, Christ
desires that he shall be admitted to reconciliation, lest, on being repulsed, he
lose courage and fall back.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>Thirdly</i>,<i> </i>It must be observed that, when
any man, through his light and unsteady behavior, has exposed himself to
suspicion, we may grant pardon when he asks it, and yet may do so in such a
manner as to watch over his conduct for the future, that our forbearance and
meekness, which proceed from the Spirit of Christ, may not become the subject of
his ridicule. For we must observe the design of our Lord himself, that we ought,
by our gentleness, to assist those who have fallen to rise again. And certainly
we ought to imitate the goodness of our heavenly Father, who meets sinners at a
distance to invite them to salvation. Besides, as repentance is a wonderful work
of the Spirit, and is the creation of the new man, if we despise it, we offer an
insult to God himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The kingdom of heaven is
compared.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As it is difficult to bend us
to mercy, and as we are quickly seized with weariness, particularly when we have
to bear with many faults of brethren, our Lord confirms this doctrine by a most
appropriate parable, the substance of which is, that those who will not yield to
pardon the faults of brethren judge very ill for themselves, and subject
themselves to a very hard and severe law; for they will find God to be equally
stern and inexorable towards themselves. There are three parts in which the
resemblance mainly consists; for the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>master</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is contrasted with the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>servant</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>the large sum of money with small or ordinary sums, and extraordinary
kindness with extreme cruelty. By attending to these three points, it will be
easy to ascertain Christ&#8217;s meaning; for what are we, if we are compared
with God? And how large is the sum which every one of us owes to God? Lastly,
how inconsiderable are the offenses, with which brethren are chargeable towards
us, if we take into account our obligation to God? How ill then does that man
deserve the compassion of God, who, though oppressed with an immense load,
implacably refuses to forgive even the smallest offenses to men like himself? So
far as regards the words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
kingdom of heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>here denotes the
spiritual condition of the Church; as if Christ had said, that the state of
matters between God and men, in regard to the soul and the nature of spiritual
life, is the same as between an ordinary or earthly <i>master </i>and his
<i>servants</i>,<i> </i>in regard to money and the affairs of the present
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His master ordered him to be
sold.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It would be an idle exercise of
ingenuity to examine here every minute clause. For God does not always display
severity at first, till, constrained to pray, we implore pardon, but rather
meets us with undeserved goodness. But Christ only shows what will become of us,
if God shall treat us with the utmost severity; and again, if He shall choose to
demand from us what we owe, how necessary it is for us to betake ourselves to
prayer, because this is the only refuge that remains for transgressors. We must
also attend to the wide difference of the sums; for, since one
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>talent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is worth more than </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a hundred
pence</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>what proportion will
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a hundred
pence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>bear to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ten thousand
talents</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When his fellow-servants saw
what was done.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Though we ought not to
search for mystery in these words &#8212; because they contain nothing but what
nature teaches, and what we learn by daily experience &#8212; we ought to know
that the men who live among us will be so many witnesses against us before God;
for it is impossible but that cruelty shall excite in them displeasure and
hatred, more especially, since every man is afraid that what he sees done to
others will fall upon his own head. As to the clause which immediately follows,
it is foolish to inquire how God punishes those sins 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f570</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which
he has already forgiven; for the simple meaning is this: though he offers mercy
to all, yet severe creditors, from whom no forgiveness can be obtained, are

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 17:24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when they came to
Capernaum.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We must attend, first of all,
to the design of this narrative; which is, that Christ, by paying tribute of his
own accord, declared his subjection, as he had <i>taken upon him the form of a
servant</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:7,) but at the same time showed, both by words and by the miracle, that it was
not by obligation or necessity, but by a free and voluntary submission, that he
had reduced himself so low that the world looked upon him as nothing more than
one of the common people. This was not a tax which was wont to be demanded on
crossing the sea, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f571</font></sup><font face="Palatino">but an
annual tribute laid individually on every man among the Jews, so that they paid
to tyrants what they were formerly in the habit of paying to God alone. For we
know that this tax was imposed on them by the Law, that, by paying every year
half a <i>stater</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;023013&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
30:13,) they might acknowledge that God, by whom they had been redeemed, was
their supreme King. When the kings of Asia appropriated this to themselves, the
Romans followed their example. Thus the Jews, as if they had disowned the
government of God, paid to profane tyrants the sacred tax required by the Law.
But it might appear unreasonable that Christ, when he appeared as the Redeemer
of his people, should not himself be exempted from <i>paying tribute</i>.<i>
</i>To remove that offense, he taught by words, that it was only by his will
that he was bound; and he proved the same thing by a miracle, for he who had
dominion over the sea and the fishes might have released himself from earthly
government.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f572</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Doth not your Master
pay?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some think that the collectors of
the <i>tribute </i>intended to throw blame on Christ, as if he were claiming
exemption from the common law. For my own part, as men of that class are
insolent and abusive, I interpret these words as having been spoken by way of
reproach. It was customary for every man to be enrolled in his own city; but we
know that Christ had no fixed habitation in one place. Those people therefore
inquire if he be exempted from the law on the ground of his frequent removals
from place to place.

satisfy them: &#8220;he will pay,&#8221;

from which we infer that Christ had formerly been accustomed to pay, for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>promises it as a thing about which there was no doubt. That they address him
rather than the other disciples was, as I conjecture, because Christ lived with
him; for if all had occupied the same habitation, the demand would have been
made on all alike. It is therefore very ridiculous in the Papists, on so
frivolous a pretense, to make
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>a partner in the dignity of Christ. &#8220;He chose him (they say) to be his
<i>vicar</i>,<i> </i>and bestowed on him equal honors, by making him equal to
himself in the payment of tribute.&#8221; But in this way they will make all
swine-herds <i>vicars </i>of Christ, for they paid as much as he did. And if the
primacy of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>was manifested in the paying of tribute, whence comes that exemption which
they claim for themselves? But this is the necessary result of the shameful
trifling of those who corrupt Scripture according to their own
fancy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What thinkest thou,
Simon?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this Christ gave a proof of
his Divinity, by showing that nothing was unknown to him. But what is the object
of his discourse? Is it to exempt himself and his followers from subjection to
the laws? Some explain it thus, that Christians have a right to be exempted, but
that they voluntarily subject themselves to the ordinary government, because
otherwise human society cannot be maintained. To me, however, the meaning
appears to be more simple; for there was danger lest the disciples might think
that Christ had come in vain, because, by paying tribute cut off the hope of
deliverance; and therefore he simply affirms that he pays tribute, solely
because he voluntarily refrains from exercising his right and power. Hence it is
inferred that this takes nothing from his reign. But why does he not openly
claim his right? It is because his kingly power was unknown to the collectors of
the tribute. For, though his kingdom be spiritual, still we must maintain, that
as he is the only Son of God, he is also the heir of the whole world, so that
all things ought to be subject to him, and to acknowledge his authority. The
meaning, therefore, is, that God has not appointed kings, and established
governments over mankind, in such a manner as to place him who is the Son in the
same rank indiscriminately with others, but yet that, of his own accord, he will
be a servant along with others, till the glory of his kingdom be
displayed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Pope has not less foolishly than successfully
abused this passage to exempt his clergy from the laws; as if the shaving of the
head made them sons of God, and exempted them from tributes and taxes. But
nothing else was intended by Christ than to claim for himself the honor of a
King&#8217;s Son, so as to have at least a home privileged and exempted from the
common law. And therefore it is also highly foolish in the Anabaptists to
torture these words for overturning political order, since it is more than
certain, that Christ does not say any thing about a privilege common to
believers, but only draws a comparison from the sons of kings, who, together
with their domestics, are exempted.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark 9:38.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Master, we saw
one.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hence it is evident that the
<i>name </i>of Christ was at that time so celebrated, that persons who were not
of the number of his intimate disciples used that <i>name</i>,<i> </i>or perhaps
even abused it, for I will not venture to avouch any thing on this point as
certain. It is possible that he who is here mentioned had embraced the doctrine
of Christ, and betaken himself to the performance of miracles with no bad
intention; but as Christ bestowed this power on none but those whom he had
chosen to be heralds of his Gospel, I think that he had rashly taken, or rather
seized upon, this office. Now though he was wrong in making this attempt, and in
venturing to imitate the disciples without receiving a command to do so, yet his
boldness was not without success: for the Lord was pleased, in this way also, to
throw luster around his name, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f579</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as he
sometimes does by means of those of whose ministry he does not approve as
lawful. It is not inconsistent with this to say, that one who was endued with
special faith followed a blind impulse, and thus proceeded inconsiderately to
work miracles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I now come to <i>John </i>and his companions. They
say that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forbade</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>a man to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>work
miracles</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Why did they not first ask
whether or not he was authorized? For now being in a state of doubt and
suspense, they ask the opinion of their Master. Hence it follows, that they had
rashly taken on themselves the right to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forbid</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i>
</i>and therefore every man who undertakes more than he knows that he is
permitted to do by the word of God is chargeable with rashness. Besides, there
is reason to suspect the disciples of Christ of ambition, because they are
anxious to maintain their privilege and honor. For how comes it that they all at
once
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forbid</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
a </i>man who is unknown to them to work miracles, but because they wish to be
the sole possessors of this right? For they assign the reason, that he
<i>followeth not </i>Christ; as much as to say, &#8220;He is not one of thy
associates, as we are: why then shall he possess equal
honor?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>39.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Forbid him
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ did not wish that he should
be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>forbidden</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i>
</i>not that he had given him authority, or approved of what he did, or even
wished his disciples to approve of it, but because, when by any occurrence God
is glorified, we ought to bear with it and rejoice. Thus Paul,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
1:18,) though he disapproves of the dispositions of those who used the Gospel as
a pretense for aggrandizing themselves, yet rejoices that by this occurrence the
glory of Christ is advanced. We must attend also to the reason which is added,
that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> it is impossible for any man
who works miracles in the name of Christ to speak evil of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>and therefore this ought to be
reckoned as gain; for hence it follows, that if the disciples had not been more
devoted to their own glory than anxious and desirous to promote the glory of
their Master, they would not have been offended when they saw that glory
heightened and enlarged in another direction. And yet Christ declares that we
ought to reckon as friends those who are not open enemies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>40.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he who is not against us

a loose rein to rash men, and to be silent while they intermeddle with this and
the other matter, according to their own fancy, and disturb the whole order of
the Church: for such licentiousness, so far as our calling allows, must be
restrained. He only affirms that they act improperly, who unseasonably prevent
the kingdom of God from being advanced by any means whatever. And yet he does
not acknowledge as his disciples, or reckon as belonging to his flock, those who
hold an intermediate place between enemies and friends, but means that,. so far
as they do no harm, they are useful and profitable: for it is a proverbial
saying, which reminds us that we ought not to raise a quarrel till we are
constrained.</font><br></div>

9:51</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>. While the days of his

relates this narrative, which, however, is highly useful on many accounts. For,
first, it describes the divine courage and firmness of Christ 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f580</font></sup><font face="Palatino">in
despising death; secondly, what deadly enmities are produced by differences
about religion; thirdly, with what headlong ardor the nature of man is hurried
on to impatience; next, how ready we are to fall into mistakes in imitating the
saints; and, lastly, by the example of Christ we are called to the exercise of
meekness. The death of Christ is called his

up,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajna&gt;lhyiv</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>not only because he was then withdrawn from the midst of us, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f581</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
because, leaving the mean prison of the flesh, he ascended on
high.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>52.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he sent
messengers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is probable that our Lord
was, at that time, attended by a great multitude of followers; for the
<i>messengers </i>were not <i>sent </i>to prepare a splendid banquet, or to
select some magnificent palace, but only to tell that a vast number of guests
were approaching. They again, when excluded and repulsed, wait for their Master.
Hence, too, we learn, what I remarked in the second place, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f582</font></sup><font face="Palatino">that
when men differ among themselves about the doctrines of religion, they readily
break out into hatred of each other; for it was an evidence of very bitter
hatred to withhold food from the hungry, and lodging from those who were
fatigued. But the Samaritans have such a dislike and enmity at the Jewish
religion, that they look upon all who follow it as unworthy of any kindness.
Perhaps, too, they were tormented with vexation at being despised; for they knew
that their temple was detested by the Jews as profane, and that they were
considered to be spurious and corrupt worshippers of God. But as the
superstition once admitted kept so firm a hold of them, they strove, with wicked
emulation, to maintain it to the last. At length the contention grew so hot,
that it consumed both nations in one conflagration; for Josephus assures us that
it was the torch which kindled the Jewish war. Now though Christ might easily
have avoided that dislike, he chooses rather to profess himself to be a Jew,
than by an indirect denial to procure a lodging.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>53.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He steadfastly set his
face.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this expression Luke has
informed us that Christ, when he had death before his eyes, rose above the fear
of it, and went forward to meet it; but, at the same time, points out that he
had a struggle, and that, having vanquished terror, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f583</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
boldly presented himself to die. For if no dread, no difficulty, no struggle, no
anxiety, had been present to his mind, what need was there that he should
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>set his face
steadfastly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f584</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>But as he was neither devoid of feeling, nor under the influence of foolish
hardihood, he must have been affected by the cruel and bitter death, or rather
the shocking and dreadful agony, which he knew would overtake him from the
rigorous judgment of God; and so far is this from obscuring or diminishing his
glory, that it is a remarkable proof of his unbounded love to us; for laying
aside a regard to himself that he might devote himself to our salvation, through
the midst of terrors he hastened to death, the time of which he knew to be at
hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>54.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when His disciples James
and John saw it. The</i></font><font face="Palatino"> country itself had perhaps
suggested to them the desire of thundering immediately against the ungodly; for
it was there that <i>Elijah </i>had formerly destroyed, by a fire from heaven,
the king&#8217;s soldiers who had been sent to apprehend him,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;120110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 1:10.) It therefore occurred to them that the Samaritans, who so basely
rejected the Son of God, were at that time devoted to a similar destruction. And
here we see to what we are driven by a foolish imitation 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f585</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of the
holy fathers. <i>James and John </i>plead the example of <i>Elijah</i>,<i>
</i>but they do not consider how far they differ from <i>Elijah</i>;<i> </i>they
do not examine properly their own intemperate zeal, nor do they look at the
calling of God. Under a pretext equally plausible did the Samaritans cloak their
idolatry, <i>our fathers worshipped in this mountain</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430420&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:20.) But both were in the wrong; for, neglecting the exercise of judgment,
they were apes rather than imitators of the holy fathers. Now though it is
doubtful whether they think that they have the power in their own hand, or ask
Christ to give it to them, I think it more probable that, elated with foolish
confidence, they entertain no doubt that they are able to execute vengeance,
provided that Christ give his consent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>55.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You know not of what spirit
you are</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>By this reply he not only
restrained the unbridled fury of the two disciples, but laid down a rule to all
of us not to indulge our temper. For whoever undertakes any thing, ought to be
fully aware that he has the authority and guidance of the Spirit of God, and
that he is actuated by proper and holy dispositions. Many will be impelled by
the warmth of their zeal, but if the spirit of prudence be wanting, their
ebullitions end in foam. Frequently, too, it happens, that the impure feelings
of the flesh are mingled with their zeal, and that those who appear to be the
keenest zealots for the glory of God are blinded by the private feelings of the
flesh. And therefore, unless our zeal be directed by the Spirit of God, it will
be of no avail to plead in our behalf, that we undertook nothing but from proper
zeal. But the Spirit himself will guide us by wisdom and prudence, that we may
do nothing contrary to our duty, or beyond our calling, nothing, in short, but
what is prudent and seasonable; and, by removing all the filth of the flesh, he
may impart to our minds proper feelings, that we may desire nothing but what God
shall suggest. Christ likewise blames his disciples because,<i> </i>though they
are widely distant from the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit of
Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino">, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f586</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>they rashly take upon themselves to do what he did. For
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Elijah</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>executed the judgment of God, which had been committed to him by the Spirit;
but they rush to vengeance, not by the command of God, but by the movement of
the flesh. And therefore the examples of the saints are no defense to us, unless
the same Spirit that directed them dwell in us.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Pharisees came to
him, tempting him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Though the Pharisees
lay snares for Christ, and cunningly endeavor to impose upon him, yet their
malice proves to be highly useful to us; as the Lord knows how to turn, in a
wonderful manner, to the advantage of his people all the contrivances of wicked
men to overthrow sound doctrine. For,<i> </i>by means of this occurrence, a
question arising out of the liberty of divorce was settled, and a fixed law was
laid down as to the sacred and indissoluble bond of marriage. The occasion of
this quibbling was, that the reply, in whatever way it were given, could not, as
they thought, fail to be offensive.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They ask,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is it lawful for a man to divorce
his wife for any cause whatever?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If
Christ reply in the negative, they will exclaim that he wickedly abolishes the
Law; and if in the affirmative, they will give out that he is not a prophet of
God, but rather a pander, who lends such countenance to the lust of men. Such
were the calculations which they had made in their own minds; but the Son of
God, who knew how to <i>take the wise in their own craftiness</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;180513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
5:13,) disappointed them, sternly opposing unlawful divorces, and at the same
time showing that he brings forward nothing which is inconsistent with the Law.
For he includes the whole question under two heads: that the order of creation
ought to serve for a law, that the husband should maintain conjugal fidelity
during the whole of life; and that <i>divorces </i>were <i>permitted</i>, not
because they were lawful, but because Moses had to deal with a rebellious and
intractable nation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have you not
read?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ does not indeed reply
directly to what was asked, but he fully meets the question which was proposed;
just as if a person now interrogated about the Mass were to explain faithfully
the mystery of the Holy Supper, and at length to conclude, that they are guilty
of sacrilege and forgery who venture either to add or to take away any thing
from the pure institution of the Lord, he would plainly overturn the pretended
sacrifice of the Mass. Now Christ assumes as an admitted principle, that at the
beginning God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>joined the male to
the female,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>so that the two made an
entire man; and therefore he who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>divorces his wife
</i></font><font face="Palatino">tears from him, as it were, the half of
himself. But nature does not allow any man to tear in pieces his own
body.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds another argument drawn from the less to the
greater. The bond of marriage is more sacred than that which binds children to
their parents. But piety binds children to their parents by a link which cannot
be broken. Much less then can the husband renounce his wife. Hence it follows,
that a chain which God made is burst asunder, if the husband divorce his wife. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f588</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the meaning of the words is this: God, who
created the human race, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made them
male and female,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>so that every man might
be satisfied with his own wife, and might not desire more. For he insists on the
number <i>two</i>,<i> </i>as the prophet Malachi, (2:15,)when he remonstrates
against polygamy, employs the same argument, that God, whose
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit was so
abundant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that He had it in His power to
create more, yet </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made but one
man,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, such a man as Christ here
describes. And thus from the order of creation is proved the inviolable union of
one husband with one wife. If it be objected, that in this way it will not be
lawful, after the first wife is dead, to take another, the reply is easy, that
not only is the bond dissolved by death, but the second wife is substituted by
God in the room of the first, as if she had been one and the same
woman.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore shall a man leave
his father and mother.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is uncertain
whether Moses represents Adam or God as speaking these words; but it is of
little consequence to the present passage which of these meanings you choose,
for it was enough to quote the decision which God had pronounced, though it
might have been uttered by the mouth of Adam. Now he who marries a wife is not
commanded absolutely to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>leave his
father</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>for God would contradict
himself, if by marriage He set aside those duties which He enjoins on children
towards their parents; but when a comparison is made between the claims, the

father, and shake off the yoke by which he is bound, no man will own such a
monster; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f589</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> much
less will he be at liberty to dissolve a marriage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the two shall be one
flesh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This expression condemns polygamy
not less than it condemns unrestrained liberty in divorcing wives; for, if the
mutual union of two persons was consecrated by the Lord, the mixture of three or
four persons is unauthorized. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f590</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
Christ, as I stated a little ago, applies it in a different manner to his
purpose; namely, to show that whoever divorces his wife tears himself in pieces,
because such is the force of holy marriage, that the husband and wife become one
man. For it was not the design of Christ to introduce the impure and filthy
speculation of Plato, but he spoke with reverence of the order which God has
established. Let the husband and wife, therefore, live together in such a
manner, that each shall cherish the other in the same manner as if they were the
half of themselves. Let the husband rule, so as to be the head, and not the
tyrant, of his wife; and let the woman, on the other hand, yield modestly to his
commands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What God therefore hath
joined.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this sentence Christ
restrains the caprice of husbands, that they may not, by divorcing their wives,
burst asunder the sacred knot. And as he declares that it is not in the power of
the husband to dissolve the marriage, so likewise he forbids all others to
confirm by their authority unlawful divorces; for the magistrate abuses his
power when he grants permission to the husband to divorce his wife. But the
object which Christ had directly in view was, that every man should sacredly
observe the promise which he has given, and that those who are tempted, by
wantonness or wicked dispositions, to divorce, may reflect thus with themselves:
&#8220;Who, art thou that allowest thyself to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>burst asunder what God hath
joined</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i>&#8221;<i> </i>But this doctrine
may be still farther extended. The Papists, contriving for us a church separated
from Christ the Head, leave us an imperfect and mutilated body. In the Holy
Supper, Christ joined the bread and the wine; but they have dared to withhold
from all the people the use of the cup. To these diabolical corruptions we shall
be at liberty to oppose these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What God hath joined let not man
separate</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why then did Moses
order?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They had thought of this calumny,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f591</font></sup><font face="Palatino">if,
which was more probable, Christ should demand a proper cause to be shown in
cases of divorce; for it appears that whatever God permits by his law, whose
will alone establishes the distinction between what is good or evil, is lawful.
But Christ disarms the falsehood and slander by the appropriate reply, that
Moses permitted it on account of their obstinacy, and not because he approved of
it as lawful. And he confirms his opinion by the best argument,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because it was not so at the
beginning.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He takes for granted that,
when God at first instituted marriage, he established a perpetual law, which
ought to remain in force till the end of the world. And if the institution of
marriage is to be reckoned an inviolable law, it follows that whatever swerves
from it does not arise from its pure nature, but from the depravity of
men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is asked, Ought Moses to have permitted what
was in itself bad and sinful? I reply, That, in an unusual sense of the word, he
is said to have<i> permitted </i>what he did not severely forbid; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f592</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for he
did not lay down a law about divorces, so as to give them the seal of his
approbation, but as the wickedness of men could not be restrained in any other
way, he applied what was the most admissible remedy, that the husband should, at
least, attest the chastity of his wife. For the law was made solely for the
protection of the women, that they might not suffer any disgrace after they had
been unjustly rejected. Hence we infer, that it was rather a punishment
inflicted on the husbands, than an indulgence or <i>permission </i>fitted to
inflame their lust. Besides, political and outward order is widely different
from spiritual government. What is lawful and proper the Lord has comprehended
under the <i>ten words</i>. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f593</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Now as it is possible that many things, for which every man&#8217;s
conscience reproves and charges him, may not be called in question at a human
tribunal, it is not wonderful if those things are connived at by political
laws.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us take a familiar instance. The laws grant to us
a greater liberty of litigation than the law of charity allows. Why is this?
Because the right cannot be conferred on individuals, unless there be an open
door for demanding it; and yet the inward law of God declares that we ought to
follow what charity shall dictate. And yet there is no reason why magistrates
should make this an excuse for their indolence, if they voluntarily abstain from
correcting vices, or neglect what the nature of their office demands. But let
men in a private station beware of doubling the criminality of the magistrates,
by screening their own vices under the protection of the laws. For here the Lord
indirectly reproves the Jews for not, reckoning it enough that their
stubbornness was allowed to pass unpunished, if they did not implicate God as
defending their iniquity. And if the rule of a holy and pious life is not
always, or in all places, to be sought from political laws, much less ought we
to seek it from custom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I say to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> Mark </i>relates that this was spoken
to the disciples apart, when they had come
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into the
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but <i>Matthew</i>,<i>
</i>leaving out this circumstance, gives it as a part of the discourse, as the
Evangelists frequently leave out some intermediate occurrence, because they
reckon it enough to sum up the leading points. There is therefore no difference,
except that the one explains the matter more distinctly than the other. The
substance of it is: though the Law does not punish divorces, which are at
variance with God&#8217;s first institution, yet he is an adulterer who rejects
his wife and takes another. For it is not in the power of a man to dissolve the
engagement of marriage, which the Lord wishes to remain inviolate; and so the
woman who occupies the bed of a lawful wife is a concubine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But an exception is added; for the woman, by
fornication, cuts herself off, as a rotten member, from her husband, and sets
him at liberty. Those who search for other reasons ought justly to be set at
nought, because they choose to be wise above the heavenly teacher. They say that
<i>leprosy </i>is a proper ground for divorce, because the contagion of the
disease affects not only the husband, but likewise the children. For my own
part, while I advise a religious man not to touch a woman afflicted with
leprosy, I do not pronounce him to be at liberty to divorce her. If it be
objected, that they who cannot live unmarried need a remedy, that they may not
be <i>burned</i>,<i> </i>I answer, that what is sought in opposition to the word
of God is not a remedy. I add too, that if they give themselves up to be guided
by the Lord, they will never want continence, for they follow what he has
prescribed. One man shall contract such a dislike of his wife, that he cannot
endure to keep company with her: will polygamy cure this evil? Another
man&#8217;s wife shall fall into palsy or apoplexy, or be afflicted with some
other incurable disease, shall the husband reject her under the pretense of
incontinency? We know, on the contrary, that none of those who walk in their
ways are ever left destitute of the assistance of the Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>For the sake of avoiding fornication</i>,<i>
</i>says Paul, <i>let every man marry a wife</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460702&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:2.) He who has done so, though he may not succeed to his wish, has
done his duty; and, therefore, if any thing be wanting, he will be supported by
divine aid. To go beyond this is nothing else than to tempt God. When Paul
mentions another reason, namely, that when, through a dislike of godliness,
wives happen to be rejected by unbelievers, a godly <i>brother or sister </i>is
not, in such a case, liable to <i>bondage</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460712&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:12,15,) this is not inconsistent with Christ&#8217;s meaning. For
he does not there inquire into the proper grounds of divorce, but only whether a
woman continues to be bound to an unbelieving husband, after that, through
hatred of God, she has been wickedly rejected, and cannot be reconciled to him
in any other way than by forsaking God; and therefore we need not wonder if Paul
think it better that she should part with a mortal man than that she should be
at variance with God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the exception which Christ states appears to be
superfluous. For, if the adulteress deserve to be punished with death, what
purpose does it serve to talk of divorces? But as it was the duty of the husband
to prosecute his wife for adultery, in order to purge his house from infamy,
whatever might be the result, the husband, who convicts his wife of uncleanness,
is here freed by Christ from the bond. It is even possible that, among a corrupt
and degenerate people, this crime remained to a great extent unpunished; as, in
our own day, the wicked forbearance of magistrates makes it necessary for
husbands to put away unchaste wives, because adulterers are not punished. It
must also be observed, that the right belongs equally and mutually to both
sides, as there is a mutual and equal obligation to fidelity. For, though in
other matters the husband holds the superiority, as to the marriage bed, the
wife has an equal right: for he is not the lord of his body; and therefore when,
by committing adultery, he has dissolved the marriage, the wife is set at
liberty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And whosoever shall marry her that
is divorced.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This clause has been very
ill explained by many commentators; for they have thought that generally, and
without exception, celibacy is enjoined in all cases when a divorce has taken
place; and, therefore, if a husband should put away an adulteress, both would be
laid under the necessity of remaining unmarried. As if this liberty of divorce
meant only not to lie with his wife; and as if Christ did not evidently grant
permission in this case to do what the Jews were wont indiscriminately to do at
their pleasure. It was therefore a gross error; for, though Christ condemns as
an adulterer the man </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who shall
marry a wife that has been divorced</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>this is undoubtedly restricted to unlawful and frivolous divorces. In like
manner, Paul enjoins those who have been so dismissed</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">to remain unmarried, or
to be reconciled to their
husbands,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 7:11;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">that is, because quarrels and differences do not
dissolve a marriage. This is clearly made out from the passage in Mark, where
express mention is made of the wife who has left her husband:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and if the wife shall divorce her
husband</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Not that wives were permitted
to give their husbands a letter of divorcement, unless so far as the Jews had
been contaminated by foreign customs; but Mark intended to show that our Lord
condemned the corruption which was at that time universal, that, after voluntary
divorces, they entered on both sides into new marriages; and therefore he makes
no mention of adultery.</font><br></div>

husbands to be so bound to their wives, that, so long as they remain chaste,
they are compelled to endure every thing rather than leave them, the disciples,
roused by this answer of Christ, reply, that it is better to want wives than to
submit to a knot of this kind. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f597</font></sup><font face="Palatino">But why
do they not, on the other hand, consider how hard is the bondage of wives, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f598</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
because, devoted to themselves and their own convenience, they are driven by the
feeling of the flesh to disregard others, and to think only of what is
advantageous for themselves? Meanwhile, it is a display of base ingratitude
that, from the dread or dislike of a single inconvenience, they reject a
wonderful gift of God. It is better, according to them, to avoid marriage than
to bind one&#8217;s self by the bond of living always together. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f599</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But if
God has ordained marriage for the general advantage of mankind, though it may be
attended by some things that are disagreeable, it is not on that account to be
despised. Let us therefore learn not to be delicate and saucy, but to use with
reverence the gifts of God, even if there be something in them that does not
please us. Above all, let us guard against this wickedness in reference to holy
marriage; for, in consequence of its being attended by many annoyances, Satan
has always endeavored to make it an object of hatred and detestation, in order
to withdraw men from it. And Jerome has given too manifest a proof of a
malicious and wicked disposition, in not only loading with calumnies that sacred
and divinely appointed condition of life, but in collecting as many terms of
reproach
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">loidori&gt;av</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i>as he could from profane authors, in order to take away its respectability.
But let us recollect that whatever annoyances belong to marriage are accidental,
for they arise out of the depravity of man. Let us remember that, since our
nature was corrupted, marriage began to be a medicine, and therefore we need not
wonder if it have a bitter taste mixed with its sweetness. But we must see how
our Lord confutes this folly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All are not capable of
receiving this saying.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this he means,
that the choice is not placed in our hands, as if we were to deliberate on a
matter submitted to us. If any man thinks it advantageous for him to want a
wife, and, without making any inquiry, lays upon himself an obligation to
celibacy, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f600</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he is
widely mistaken. God, who has declared it to be good that a man should have a
woman to be his helper, will punish the contempt of his own appointment; for
mortals take too much on themselves, when they endeavor to exempt themselves
from the heavenly calling. But Christ proves that it is not free to all to make
what choice they please, because the gift of continence is a special gift; for
when he says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that all are not
capable of receiving it, but those to whom it is
given</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he plainly shows that it was not
given to all. And this reproves the pride of those who do not hesitate to claim
for themselves what Christ so manifestly refuses to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For there are
eunuchs</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Christ distinguishes three
kinds of <i>eunuchs</i>.<i> </i>Those who are so by nature, or who have been
castrated by men, are debarred from marriage by this defect, for they are not
men. He says that there are other <i>eunuchs</i>,<i> </i>who have castrated
themselves, that they may be more at liberty to serve God; and these he exempts
from the obligation to marry. Hence it follows, that all others who avoid
marriage fight against God with sacrilegious hardihood, after the manner of the
giants. When Papists urge the word <i>castrate</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujnou~cisan</font><font face="Palatino">)
as if at their own pleasure men might lay themselves under obligation to
continence, it is too frivolous. For Christ has already declared, that God gives
it to whom he chooses; and, a little afterwards, we shall find him maintaining,
that it is folly in any man to choose to live unmarried, when he has not
received this special gift. This castration, therefore, is not left to free
will; but the plain meaning is, while some men are by nature fit to marry,
though they abstain, they do not tempt God, because God grants them exemption. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f601</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the sake of the kingdom of

meaning, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in order to deserve
eternal life; </i></font><font face="Palatino">as if celibacy contained within
itself some meritorious service, as the Papists imagine that it is an angelical
state. But Christ meant nothing more than that persons unmarried ought to have
this for their object, that, being freed from all cares, they may apply
themselves more readily to the duties of piety. It is, therefore, a foolish
imagination, that celibacy is a virtue; for it is not in itself more pleasing to
God than fasting, and is not entitled to be reckoned among the duties which he
requires from us, but ought to have a reference to another object. Nay more,
Christ expressly intended to declare that, though a man be pure from
fornication, yet his celibacy is not approved by God, if he only consults his
own ease and comfort, but that he is excused on this single ground, that he aims
at a free and unrestrained meditation on the heavenly life. In short, Christ
teaches us, that it is not enough, if unmarried men live chastely, unless they
abstain from having wives, for the express purpose of devoting themselves to
better employments.

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that can receive it, let him

warns them, that the use of marriage is not to be despised, unless we intend,
with blind rashness, to rush headlong to destruction: for it became necessary to
restrain the disciples, whom he saw acting inconsiderately and without judgment.
But the warning is useful to all; for, in selecting a manner of life, few
consider what has been given to them, but men rush forward, without
discrimination, in whatever direction inconsiderate zeal prompts them. And I
wish that the warning had been attended to in past times; but men&#8217;s ears
are stopped by I know not what enchantments of Satan, so that, contrary to

<div><font face="Palatino">This narrative is highly useful; for it shows that

approach to him, but those who are not yet of age to know how much they need his
grace. Those </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>little

solemn act of blessing. We must observe the intention of those who present the
children; for if there had not been a deep-rooted conviction in their minds,
that the power of the Spirit was at his disposal, that he might pour it out on
the people of God, it would have been unreasonable to present their children.
There is no room, therefore, to doubt, that they ask for them a participation of
his grace; and so, by way of amplification, Luke adds the particle

various ways in which he assisted adults, they formed an expectation likewise in

and the prayers of Christ were not idly wasted in air. But he could not present
the infants solemnly to God without giving them purity. And for what did he pray
for them, but that they might be received into the number of the children of
God? Hence it follows, that they were renewed by the Spirit to the hope of
salvation. In short, by embracing them, he testified that they were reckoned by
Christ among his flock. And if they were partakers of the spiritual gifts, which
are represented by Baptism, it is unreasonable that they should be deprived of
the outward sign. But it is presumption and sacrilege to drive far from the fold
of Christ those whom he cherishes in his bosom, and to shut the door, and

that, though he is called a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>young

who upheld the integrity of the

</i>he testifies his reverence for Christ as a faithful teacher. But, on the
other hand, a blind confidence in his works hindered him from profiting under
Christ, to whom, in other respects, he wished to be submissive. Thus, in our own
day, we find some who are not ill-disposed, but who, under the influence of I
know not what shadowy holiness, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f613</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> hardly
relish the doctrine of the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, in order to form a more correct judgment of the

fully afterwards.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Why callest thou me
good?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I do not understand this correction in so
refined a sense as is given by a good part of interpreters, as if Christ
intended to suggest his Divinity; for they imagine that these words mean,
&#8220;If<i> </i>thou perceivest in me nothing more exalted than human nature,
thou falsely appliest to me the epithet <i>good</i>,<i> </i>which belongs to
<i>God alone</i>.&#8221;<i> </i>I do acknowledge that, strictly speaking, men
and even angels do not deserve so honorable a title; because they have not a
drop of goodness in themselves, but borrowed from God; and because in the
former, goodness is only begun, and is not perfect. But Christ had no other
intention than to maintain the truth of his doctrine; as if he had said,
&#8220;Thou falsely </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>callest me a
good Mast</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>er</i>,<i> </i>unless thou
acknowledgest that I have come from God.&#8221; The essence of his Godhead,
therefore, is not here maintained, but the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>young
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is directed to admit the truth of
the doctrine. He had already felt some disposition to obey; but Christ wishes
him to rise higher, that he may hear God speaking. For &#8212; as it is
customary with men to make angels of those who are devils &#8212; they
indiscriminately give the appellation of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good
teachers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to those in whom they perceive
nothing divine; but those modes of speaking are only profanations of the gifts
of God. We need not wonder, therefore, if Christ, in order to maintain the
authority of his doctrine, directs the young
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep the
commandments.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This passage was
erroneously interpreted by some of the ancients, whom the Papists have followed,
as if Christ taught that, by <i>beeping </i>the law, we may merit <i>eternal
life</i>.<i> </i>On the contrary, Christ did not take into consideration what
men can do, but replied to the question, What is the righteousness of works? or,
What does the Law require? And certainly we ought to believe that God
comprehended in his law the way of living holily and righteously, in which
righteousness is included; for not without reason did Moses make this
statement,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">He that does these things
shall live in them,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Leviticus
18:5;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and again,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">I call heaven and earth
to witness that l have</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">this day
showed you life,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053019&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
30:19.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have no right, therefore, to deny that the keeping
of the law is righteousness, by which any man who kept the law perfectly &#8212;
if there were such a man &#8212; would obtain life for himself. But as we are
<i>all destitute of the glory of God</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:23,) nothing but cursing will be found in the law; and nothing remains for us
but to betake ourselves to the undeserved gift of righteousness. And therefore
Paul lays down a twofold righteousness, <i>the righteousness of the law</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:5,) and the righteousness of faith,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:6.) He makes the first to consist in works, and the second, in the free grace
of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we infer, that this reply of Christ is legal,
because it was proper that the <i>young man </i>who inquired about the
righteousness of works should first be taught that no man is accounted righteous
before God unless he has fulfilled the law,  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f614</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> (which
is impossible,) that, convinced of his weakness, he might betake himself to the
assistance of faith. I acknowledge, therefore, that, as God has promised the
reward of <i>eternal life </i>to those who keep his law, we ought to hold by
this way, if the weakness of our flesh did not prevent; but Scripture teaches
us, that it is through our own fault that it becomes necessary for us to receive
as a gift what we cannot obtain by works. If it be objected, that it is in vain
to hold out to us <i>the righteousness which is in the law</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:5,) which no man will ever be able to reach, I reply, since it is the first
part of instruction, by which we are led to the righteousness which is obtained
by prayer, it is far from being superfluous; and, therefore, when Paul says,
that <i>the doers of the law are justified</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:13,) he excludes all from <i>the righteousness of the
law</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage sets aside all the inventions which the
Papists have contrived in order to obtain salvation. For not only are they
mistaken in wishing to lay God under obligation to them by their good works, to
bestow salvation as a debt; but when they apply themselves to do what is right,
they leave out of view the doctrine of the law, and attend chiefly to their
pretended <i>devotions</i>,<i> </i>as they call them, not that they openly
reject the law of God, but that they greatly prefer human traditions.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f615</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
what does Christ say? That the only worship of which God approves is that which
he has prescribed; because <i>obedience is better to him than all
sacrifices</i>,  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f616</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;091522&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 15:22.)<i> </i>So then, while the Papists are employed in frivolous
traditions, let every man who endeavors to regulate his life by obedience to
Christ direct his whole attention to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>keep the
commandments</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of the
law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt not
murder</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It is surprising that, though
Christ intended to show that we are bound to obey the whole law, he should
mention the second table only; but he did so, because from the duties of charity
the disposition of every man is better ascertained. Piety towards God holds, no
doubt, a higher rank;  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f617</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but as
the observation of the first table is often feigned by hypocrites, the second
table is better adapted for making a scrutiny. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f618</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us
know, therefore, that Christ selected those commandments in which is contained a
proof of true righteousness; but by a <i>synecdoche </i>he takes a part for the
whole. As to the circumstance of his placing that commandment last which speaks
of <i>honoring </i>parents, it is of no consequence, for he paid no attention to
the regular order. Yet it is worthy of notice, that this commandment is declared
to belong to the second table, that no one may be led astray by the error of
Josephus, who thought that it belonged to the first table.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f619</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> What is
added at the end, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt love
thy neighbor,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>contains nothing different
from the former commandments, but is, general explanation of them
all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The young man saith to
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The law must have been dead to him,
when he vainly imagined that he was so righteous; for if he had not flattered
himself through hypocrisy, it was an excellent advice to him to learn humility,
to contemplate his spots and blemishes in the mirror of the law. But,
intoxicated with foolish confidence, he fearlessly boasts that he has discharged
his duty properly from his childhood. Paul acknowledges that the same thing
happened to himself, that, so long as the power of <i>the law </i>was unknown to
him, he believed that he <i>was alive; </i>but that, after he knew what <i>the
law </i>could do, a deadly wound was inflicted on him,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450709&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:9.) So the reply of Christ, which follows, was suited to the man&#8217;s
disposition. And yet Christ does not demand any thing beyond the commandments of
the law, but, as the bare recital had not affected him, Christ employed other
words for detecting the hidden disease of avarice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I confess that we are nowhere commanded in the law to
<i>sell all; </i>but as the design of the law is, to bring men to self-denial,
and as it expressly condemns covetousness, we see that Christ had no other
object in view than to correct the false conviction of the <i>young man</i>.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f620</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>for if he had known himself thoroughly, as soon as he heard the mention of
<i>the law</i>,<i> </i>he would have acknowledged that he was liable to the
judgment of God; but now, when the bare words of the law do not sufficiently
convince him of his guilt, the inward meaning is expressed by other words. If
Christ now demanded any thing beyond the commandments of the law, he would be at
variance with himself. He just now taught that perfect righteousness is
comprehended in <i>the commandments </i>of the law: how then will it agree with
this to charge the law with deficiency? Besides, the protestation of Moses,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053015&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
30:15,)which I formerly quoted, would be false.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Mark 10:21.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One thing thou
wantest.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ therefore does not mean
that the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>young man
wanted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>one THING beyond the keeping of
the law, but in the very keeping of the law. For though the law nowhere obliges
us to <i>sell all</i>,<i> </i>yet as it represses all sinful desires, and
teaches us to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bear the
cross,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as it bids us be prepared for
hunger and poverty, the <i>young man </i>is very far from keeping it fully, so
long as he is attached to his riches, and burns with covetousness. And he says
that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one thing is
wanting</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>because he does not need to
preach to him about fornication and murder, but to point out a particular
disease, as if he were laying his finger on the sore.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought also to be observed, that he does not only
enjoin him </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
sell</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>but likewise to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>give to the
poor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for to part with riches would not
be in itself a virtue, but rather a vain ambition. Profane historians applaud
Crates, a Theban, because he threw into the sea his money and all that he
reckoned valuable; for he did not think that he could save himself unless his
wealth were lost; as if it would not have been better to bestow on others what
he imagined to be more than he needed. Certainly, as <i>charity is the bond of
perfection</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:14,) he who deprives others, along with himself, of the use of money, deserves
no praise; and therefore Christ applauds not simply the <i>sellin</i>g<i>
</i>but liberality in assisting <i>the poor</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The mortification of the flesh is still more strongly
urged by Christ, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Follow
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For he enjoins him not only to
become his disciple, but to submit his shoulders to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bear the
cross,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>as Mark expressly states. And it
was necessary that such an excitement should be applied; for, having been
accustomed to the ease, and leisure and conveniences, of home, he had never
experienced, in the smallest degree, what it was to crucify the old man, and to
subdue the desires of the flesh. But it is excessively ridiculous in the monks,
under the pretense of this passage, to claim for themselves state of perfection.
First, it is easy to infer, that Christ does not command all without exception
to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sell all that they
have</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for the husbandman, who had been
accustomed to live by his labor, and to support his children, would do wrong in
selling his possession, if he were not constrained to it by any necessity. To
keep what God has put in our power, provided that, by maintaining ourselves and
our family in sober and frugal manner, we bestow some portion on the poor, is a
greater virtue than to squander all. But what sort of thing is that famous
<i>selling</i>,<i> </i>on which the monks plume themselves? A good part of them,
finding no provision at home, plunge themselves into monasteries as well-stocked
hog-styes. All take such good care of themselves, that they feed in idleness on
the bread of others. A rare exchange truly, when those who are ordered to give
to the poor what they justly possess are not satisfied with their own, but seize
on the property of others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus beholding him, loved
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The inference which the Papists
draw from this, that works morally good &#8212; that is, works which are not
performed by the impulse of the Spirit, but go before regeneration &#8212; have
<i>the merit of congruity</i>,<i> </i>is an excessively childish contrivance.
For if <i>merit </i>be alleged to be the consequence of the love of God, we must
then say that frogs and fleas have merit, because all the creatures of God,
without exception, are the objects of his love. To distinguish the degrees of
love is, therefore, a matter of importance. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f621</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As to
the present passage, it may be enough to state briefly, that God embraces in
fatherly love none but his children, whom he has regenerated with the Spirit of
adoption, and that it is in consequence of this love that they are accepted at
his tribunal. In this sense, to be loved by God, and to be justified in his
sight, are synonymous terms. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f622</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But God is sometimes said to <i>love </i>those whom
he does not approve or justify; for, since the preservation of the human race is
agreeable to Him &#8212; which consists in justice, uprightness, moderation,
prudence, fidelity, and temperance &#8212; he is said to <i>love </i>the
political virtues; not that they are meritorious of salvation or of grace, but
that they have reference to an end of which he approves. In this sense, under
various points of view, God <i>loved </i>Aristides and Fabricius, and also
<i>hated </i>them; for, in so far as he had bestowed on them outward
righteousness, and that for the general advantage, he <i>loved </i>his own work
in them; but as their heart was impure, the outward semblance of righteousness
was of no avail for obtaining righteousness. For we know that by faith alone
hearts are purified, and that the Spirit of uprightness is given to the members
of Christ alone. Thus the question is answered, How was it possible that Christ
should <i>love </i>a man who was proud and a hypocrite, while nothing is more
hateful to God than these two vices? For it is not inconsistent, that the good
seed, which God has implanted in some natures, shall be <i>loved </i>by Him, and
yet that He should reject their persons and works on account of
corruption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 19:22.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He went away
sorrowful.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The result at length showed
how widely distant the <i>young man </i>was from that perfection to which Christ
had called him; for how comes it that he withdraws from the school of Christ,
but because he finds it uneasy to be stripped of his riches? But if we are not
prepared to endure poverty, it is manifest that covetousness reigns in us. And
this is what I said at the outset, that the order which Christ gave, to

Whether or not this temptation was temporary, so that the <i>young man

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 19:23.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A rich man will with
difficulty enter. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Christ warns them, not only
how dangerous and how deadly a plague avarice is, but also how great an obstacle
is presented by riches. In Mark, indeed, he mitigates the harshness of his
expression, by restricting it to those only
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who place confidence in
riches</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>But these words are, I think,
intended to confirm, rather than correct, the former statement, as if he had
affirmed that they ought not to think it strange, that he made the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>entrance into the kingdom of
heaven so difficult for the rich</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because it is an evil almost common to all to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trust in their
riches</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Yet this doctrine is highly
useful to all; to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
rich</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>that, being warned of their
danger, they may be on their guard; to the poor, that, satisfied with their lot,
they may not so eagerly desire what would bring more damage than gain. It is
true indeed, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>riches</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>do not, in their own nature, hinder us from following God; but, in
consequence of the depravity of the human mind, it is scarcely possible for
those who have a great abundance to avoid being intoxicated by them. So they who
are exceedingly <i>rich </i>are held by Satan bound, as it were, in chains, that
they may not raise their thoughts to heaven; nay more, they bury and entangle
themselves, and became utter slaves to the earth. The comparison of the
<i>camel</i>.,<i> </i>which is soon after added, is intended to amplify the
<i>difficulty; </i>for it means that <i>the rich </i>are so swelled with pride
and presumption, that they cannot endure to be reduced to the straits through
which God makes his people to pass. The word <i>camel </i>denotes, I think, a
rope used by sailors, rather than the animal so named.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his disciples, when they
heard these things, were greatly amazed. The disciples are
astonished,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because it ought to awaken
in us no little anxiety, that <i>riches </i>obstruct the <i>entrance into the
kingdom of God; </i>for, wherever we turn our eyes, a thousand obstacles will
present themselves. But let us observe that, while they were struck with
astonishment, they did not shrink from the doctrines of Christ. The case was
different with him who was lately mentioned; for he was so much alarmed by the
severity of the commandment, that he separated from Christ; while they, though
trembling, and inquiring</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, who can
be saved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>do not break off in an
opposite direction, but are desirous to conquer despair. Thus it will be of
service to us to tremble at the threatenings of God: whenever he denounces any
thing that is gloomy or dreadful, provided that our minds are not discouraged,
but rather aroused.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With men this is
impossible.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ does not entirely
free the minds of his disciples from all anxiety; for it is proper that they
should perceive how difficult it is to ascend to heaven; first, that they may
direct all their efforts to this object; and next, that, distrusting themselves,
they may implore strength from heaven. We see how great is our indolence and
carelessness; and what the consequence would be if believers thought that they
had to walk at ease, for pastime, along a smooth and cheerful plain. Such is the
reason why Christ does not extenuate the danger &#8212; though he perceives the
terror which it excited in his disciples &#8212; but rather increases it; for
though formerly he said only that it was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>difficult</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>he now affirms it to be <i>impossible</i>.<i> </i>Hence it is evident, that
those teachers are guilty of gross impropriety, who are so much afraid to speak
harshly, that they give indulgence to the slothfulness of the flesh. They ought
to follow, on the contrary, the rule of Christ, who so regulates his style that,
after men have been bowed down within themselves, he teaches them to rely on the
grace of God alone, and, at the same time, excites them to prayer. In this
manner, the weakness of men is seasonably relieved, not by ascribing anything to
them, but by arousing their minds to expect the grace of God. By this reply of
Christ is also refuted that widely embraced principle &#8212; which the Papists
have borrowed from Jerome &#8212; &#8220;Whoever shall say that it is impossible
to keep the law, let him be accursed. &#8220;For Christ plainly declares, that
it is not possible for men to keep the way of salvation, except so far as the
grace of God assists them.</font><br></div>

which was not unaccompanied by disgrace and by annoyances, and as no better

purpose that they have <i>left all </i>their property, and devoted themselves to

property by the Lord, they should not be restored to a better
condition.</font><br></div>

men, they scarcely had a home to leave, and therefore this boasting might appear
to be ridiculous. And certainly experience shows how large an estimate men
commonly form of their duties towards God, as at this day, among the Papists,
those who were little else than beggars make it a subject of haughty reproach
that they have sustained great damage for the sake of the Gospel. But the
disciples may be excused on this ground, that, though their wealth was not
magnificent, they subsisted at home, by their manual labors, not less cheerfully
than the richest man. And we know that men of humble condition, who have been
accustomed to a quiet and modest life, reckon it a greater hardship to be torn
from their wives and children than those who are led by ambition, or who are
carried in various directions by the gale of prosperity. Certainly, if some
reward had not been reserved for the disciples, it would have been foolish in
them to have changed their course of life.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f633</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
though on that ground they might be excused, they err in this respect, that they
demand a triumph to be given them, before they have finished their warfare. If
we ever experience such uneasiness at delay, and if we are tempted by
impatience, let us learn first to reflect on the comforts by which the Lord
soothes the bitterness of the cup in this world, and next elevate our minds to
the hope of the heavenly life; for these two points embrace the answer of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Verily I say to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That the disciples may not think
that they have lost their pains, and repent of having begun the course, Christ
warns them that the glory of his kingdom, which at that time was still hidden,
was about to be revealed. As if he had said, &#8220;There<i> </i>is no reason
why that mean condition should discourage you; for I, who am scarcely equal to
the lowest, will at length ascend to my throne of majesty. Endure then for a
little, till the time arrive for revealing nay glory.&#8221; And what does he
then promise to them? That they shall be partakers of the same
glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You also shall sit on twelve

<i>thrones</i>,<i> </i>from which they may
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judge the twelve tribes of
Israel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he compares them to assessors,
or first councilors and judges, who occupy the highest seats in the royal
council. We know that the number of those who were chosen to be apostles was
<i>twelve</i>,<i> </i>in order to testify that, by the agency of Christ, God
purposed to collect the remnant of his people which was scattered. This was a
very high rank, but hitherto was concealed; and therefore Christ holds their
wishes in suspense till the latest revelation of his kingdom, when they will
fully receive the fruit of their election. And though the kingdom of Christ is,
in some respects, manifested by the preaching of the Gospel, there is no doubt
that Christ here speaks of the last day.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the

with the following clause. In this sense,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>regeneration</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>would be nothing else than the renovation which shall follow our
restoration, when life shall swallow up what is mortal, and when our mean body
shall be transformed into the heavenly glory of Christ. But I rather explain
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>regeneration</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as referring to the first coming of Christ; for then the world began to be
renewed, and arose out of the darkness of death into the light of life. And this
way of speaking occurs frequently in the Prophets, and is exceedingly adapted to
the connection of this passage. For the renovation of the Church, which had been
so frequently promised, had raised an expectation of wonderful happiness, as
soon as the Messiah should appear; and therefore, in order to guard against that
error, Christ distinguishes between the beginning and the completion of his
reign.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 22:28.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You are they who have
continued with me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although Luke appears
to relate a different discourse of Christ, and one which was delivered at a
different time, yet I have no doubt that it refers to the same time. For it is
not a continued discourse of Christ that is here related, but detached
sentences, without any regard to the order of time, as we shall shortly
afterwards have occasion to state. But he employs more words than Matthew; for
he declares that, as the apostles had accompanied him, and had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>remained steadfastly in his
temptations,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>they would also be
partakers of his glory. It is asked, in what sense does he call them <i>his
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>temptations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?
</i>I think that he means the contests by which God tried him and the apostles
in common. And properly did he use the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>temptations</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for, according to the feeling of human nature, his faith and patience were
actually tried.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for he shares with them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which he received from
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

possess </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of which he alone has the lawful
right to dispose. By his own example, also, he exhorts them to patience; for,
though he was ordained by <i>the
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to be a King, yet he was not immediately raised to his glory, but even
<i>emptied Himself</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:7,) and by the ignominy of the cross obtained kingly honor. To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eat and drink at his
table</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is put metaphorically for being
made partakers of the same glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 19:29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And whosoever shall
forsake.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After having raised the
expectation of his followers to the hope of a future life, he supports them by
immediate consolations,  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f634</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
strengthens them for bearing the cross. For though God permit his people to be
severely afflicted, he never abandons them, so as not to recompense their
distresses by his assistance. And here he does not merely address the apostles,
but takes occasion to direct his discourse generally to all the godly. The
substance of it is this: Those who shall willingly <i>lose all </i>for the sake
of Christ, will be more happy even in this life than if they had retained the
full possession of them; but the chief reward is laid up for them in
heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what he promises about recompensing them <i>a
hundredfold </i>appears not at all to agree with experience; for in the greater
number of cases, those who have been deprived of their parents, or children, and
other relatives &#8212; who have been reduced to widowhood, and stripped of
their wealth, for the testimony of Christ &#8212; are so far from recovering
their property, that in exile, solitude and desertion, they have a hard struggle
with severe poverty. I reply, if any man estimate aright the immediate grace of
God, by which he relieves the sorrows of his people, he will acknowledge that it
is justly preferred to all the riches of the world. For though <i>unbelievers
flourish,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;199207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
92:7,) yet as they <i>know not what awaits them on the morro</i>w<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;590414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
4:14,) they must be always tossed about in perplexity and terror, and it is only
by stupefying themselves in some sort that they can at all enjoy prosperity.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f635</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Yet God
gladdens his people, so that the small portion of good which they enjoy is more
highly valued by them, and far sweeter, than if out of Christ they had enjoyed
an unlimited abundance of good things. In this sense I interpret the expression
used by Mark, <i>with persecutions; </i>as if Christ had said, Though
<i>persecutions </i>always await the godly in this world, and though the cross,
as it were, is attached to their back, yet so sweet is the seasoning of the
grace of God, which gladdens them, that their condition is more desirable than
the luxuries of kings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And many that are first shall

order to shake off the indolence of the flesh. The apostles, though they had
scarcely begun the course, were hastening to demand the prize. And such is the
disposition of almost all of us, that, when a month has elapsed, we ask, like
soldiers who have served their time, to receive a discharge. But Christ exhorts
those who have <i>begun well
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:3; 5:7) to vigorous perseverance, and at the same time gives warning, that it
will be of no avail to <i>runners </i>to have begun with alacrity, if they lose
courage in the midst of the course. In like manner Paul also warns us, that
<i>not all who run obtain t/re prize</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

<div><font face="Palatino">As this parable is nothing else than a confirmation
of the preceding sentence, <i>the
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>last shall be
first,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>it now remains to see in what
manner it ought to be applied. Some commentators reduce it to this general
proposition, that the glory of all; will be equal, because the heavenly
inheritance is not obtained by the merits of works, but is bestowed freely. But
Christ does not here argue either about the equality of the heavenly glory, or
about the future condition of the godly. He only declares that those who were
first in point of time have no right to boast or to insult others; because the
Lord, whenever he pleases, may call those whom he appeared for a time to
disregard, and may make them equal, or even superior, to the first. If any man
should resolve to sift out with exactness every portion of this parable, his
curiosity would be useless; and therefore we have nothing more to inquire than
what was the design of Christ to teach. Now we have already said that he had no
other object in view than to excite his people by continual spurs to make
progress. We know that indolence almost always springs from excessive
confidence; and this is the reason why many, as if they had reached the goal,
stop short in the middle of the course. Thus Paul enjoins us to <i>forget the
things which are behind</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500313&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
3:13,) that, reflecting on what yet remains for us, we may arouse ourselves to
persevere in running. But there will be no harm in examining the words, that the
doctrine may be more clearly evinced.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 20:1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the kingdom of heaven is
like a householder.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The meaning is, that
such is the nature of the divine calling, as if a man were, early in the
morning, to hire laborers for the cultivation of his vineyard at a fixed price,
and were afterwards to employ others without an agreement, but to give them an
equal hire. He uses the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kingdom of
heaven,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because he compares the
spiritual life to the earthly life, and the reward of eternal life to money
which men pay in return for work that has been done for them. There are some who
give an ingenious interpretation to this passage, as if Christ were
distinguishing between Jews and Gentiles. The Jews, they tell us, were called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>at the first
hour,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>with an agreement as to the hire;
for the Lord promised to them eternal life, on the condition that they should
fulfill the law; while, in calling the Gentiles, no bargain was made at least as
to works, for salvation was freely offered to them in Christ. But all subtleties
of that sort are unseasonable; for the Lord makes no distinction in the bargain,
but only in the time; because those who entered <i>last</i>,<i> </i>and in the
evening, <i>into the vineyard</i>,<i> </i>receive the same hire with <i>the
first</i>.<i> </i>Though, in the Law, God formerly promised to the Jews the hire
of works,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
18:5,) yet we know that this was without effect, because no man ever obtained
salvation by his merits.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why then, it will be said, does Christ expressly
mention a bargain  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f636</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in
reference to <i>the first</i>,<i> </i>but make no mention of it in reference to
the others? It was in order to show that, without doing injury to any one, as
much honor is conferred on <i>the last</i>,<i> </i>as if they had been called at
the beginning. For strictly speaking, he owes no man any thing, and from us, who
are devoted to his service, he demands, as a matter of right, all the duties
which are incumbent on us. But as he freely offers to us a <i>reward</i>,<i>
</i>he is said to <i>hire </i>the labors which, on other grounds, were due to
him. This is also the reason why he gives the name of <i>a hire </i>to the crown
which he bestows freely. Again, in order to show that we have no right to
complain of God, if he make us companions in honor with those who followed us
after a long interval, he borrowed a comparison from the ordinary custom of men,
who bargain about the <i>hire</i>,<i> </i>before they send laborers to their
work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any man infer from this, that men are created for
the purpose of doing something, and that every man has his province assigned him
by God, that they may not sit down in idleness, he will offer no violence to the
words of Christ.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f636a</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We are
also at liberty to infer, that our whole life is unprofitable, and that we are
justly accused of indolence, until each of us regulate his life by the command
and calling of God. Hence it follows, that they labor to no purpose, who rashly
undertake this or that course of life, and do not wait for the intimation of the
call of God. Lastly, we learn from the words of Christ, that those only are
pleasing to God, who labor for the advantage of their brethren.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A

again, the night was divided into four

with the doctrine of Paul. They <i>that are alive</i>,<i> </i>he says, <i>at the
coming of Christ will not come before those who previously fell asleep in
Christ</i>,<i> </i>but will follow,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 4:15.) But Christ observes a different order in this passage,
because he could not otherwise have expressed &#8212; what he afterwards adds
&#8212; that <i>the first murmured</i>,<i> </i>because they did not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>receive
more</i></font><font face="Palatino">.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f638</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, he did not intend to say that this
<i>murmuring </i>will take place at the last day, but merely to affirm that
there will be no occasion for <i>murmuring</i>.<i> </i>The <i>personification
(</i></font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">proswpopoi`&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
which he employs throws no small light on this doctrine, that men have no right
to complain of the bounty of God, when he honors unworthy persons by large
rewards beyond what they deserve. There is no foundation, therefore, for what
some have imagined, that these words are directed against the Jews, who were
full of malice and envy towards the Gentiles; for it would be absurd to say that
such persons receive an equal <i>hire </i>with the children of God, and this
malignity, which leads men to exclaim against God, does not apply to believers.
But the plain meaning is, that, since God defrauds no man of a just
<i>hire</i>,<i> </i>He is at liberty to bestow on those whom He has lately
called an undeserved reward.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So the first shall be
last.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He does not now compare the Jews
to the Gentiles, (as in another passages) nor the reprobate, who swerve from the
faith, to the elect who persevere; and therefore the sentence which is
introduced by some interpreters,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>many are called, but few are
chosen,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>does not apply to that point.
Christ only meant to say that every one who has been called before others ought
to run with so much the greater alacrity, and, next, to exhort all men to be
modest, not to give themselves the preference above others, but willingly to
share with them a common prize. As the apostles were the first-fruits of the
whole church, they appeared to possess some superiority; and Christ did not deny
that they would </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sit as judges to
govern the twelve tribes of Israel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But
that they might not be carried away by ambition or vain confidence in
themselves, it was necessary also to remind them that others, who would long
afterwards be called, would be partakers of the same glory, because God is not
limited to any person, but calls freely whomsoever He pleases, and bestows on
those who are called whatever rewards He thinks fit.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though the apostles had been previously informed what
kind of death awaited our Lord, yet as they had not sufficiently profited by it,
he now repeats anew what he had frequently said. He sees that the day of his
death is at hand; nay more, he is already in a state of readiness to offer
himself to be sacrificed; and, on the other hand, he sees the disciples not only
afraid, but overwhelmed by blind alarm. He therefore exhorts them to steadiness,
that they may not immediately yield to temptation. Now there are two methods by
which he confirms them; for, by foretelling what would happen, he not only
fortifies them, that they may not give <i>way</i>,<i> </i>when a calamity, which
has arisen suddenly and contrary to expectation, takes them by surprise, but
meets the offense of the cross by a proof of his .Divinity, that they may not
lose courage at beholding his short abasement, when they are convinced that he
is the Son of God, and therefore will be victorious over death. The second
method of confirmation is taken from his approaching
resurrection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it will be proper to look more closely at the
words. Mark states &#8212; what is omitted by the other two Evangelists &#8212;
that, before our Lord explained to his disciples in private that he was going
straight to the sacrifice of death, not only they, but also the rest of his
followers, were sorrowful and <i>trembli</i>n<i>g</i>.<i> </i>Now why they were
seized with this fear it is not easy to say, if it was not because they had
already learned that they had dangerous adversaries at <i>Jerusalem, </i>and
would therefore have wished that Christ should remain in some quiet retreat
beyond the reach of the darts, rather than voluntarily expose himself to such
inveterate enemies. Although this fear was in many respects improper, yet the
circumstance of their following Christ is a proof of no ordinary respect and
obedience. It would indeed have been far better to hasten cheerfully and without
regret, wheresoever the Son of God chose to lead them; but commendation is due
to their reverence for his person, which appears in choosing to do violence to
their own feelings rather than to forsake him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 20:17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Took the twelve disciples
apart in the way</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It may appear
surprising that he makes </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
twelve</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>alone acquainted with his secret,
since all have need of consolation, for all had been alike seized with fear. I
consider the reason why he did not publish his death to have been, that the
report might not spread too widely before the time. Besides, as he did not
expect that the warning would be of immediate advantage, he reckoned it enough
to entrust it to a few, who were afterwards to be his witnesses. For, as the
seed thrown into the earth does not immediately spring up, so we know that
Christ said many things to the apostles which did not immediately yield fruit.
And if he had admitted all indiscriminately to this discourse, it was possible
that many persons, seized with alarm, might flee, and fill the ears of the
public with this report; and thus the death of Christ would have lost its glory,
because he would have appeared to have rashly brought it on himself. Secretly,
therefore, he addresses the apostles, and does not even select them as qualified
to receive profit by it, but, as I lately hinted, that they may afterwards be
witnesses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On this subject Luke is more full than the others;
for he relates not only that Christ predicted the events which were near at
hand, but also that he added the doctrine, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>those things which had been
written by the prophets would be accomplished in the Son of
man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was an excellent remedy for
overcoming temptation, to perceive in the very ignominy of the cross the marks
by which the Prophets had pointed out the promised Author of salvation. There
can be no doubt that our Lord pointed out also from the Prophets what kind of
fruit they ought to expect from his death; for the Prophets do not only teach
that Christ must suffer, but add the reason, that he may reconcile the world to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lo, we go up to
Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hence we perceive that Christ was
endued with divine fortitude for overcoming the terrors of death, for he
knowingly and willingly hastens to undergo it. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f641</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For why
does he, without any constraint, march forward to suffer a shocking murder, but
because the invincible power of the Spirit enabled him to subdue fear, and
raised him above all human feelings? By a minute detail of the circumstances, he
gives a still more evident proof of his Divinity. For he could not &#8212; as
<i>man &#8212; have </i>foreseen that, after having been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>condemned by the chief priests
and scribes</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he would be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>delivered up to the
Gentiles,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and <i>spat on</i>,<i> </i>and
<i>mocked </i>in various ways, and <i>scourged</i>,<i> </i>and at length dragged
to the punishment of the <i>cross</i>.<i> </i>Yet it must be observed that,
though our Lord was fully acquainted with the weakness of his disciples, he does
not conceal from them a very grievous offense. For &#8212; as we have said on a
former occasion  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f642</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212;
nothing could at that time have happened more powerfully calculated to shake the
minds of the godly, than to see the whole of the sacred order of the Church
opposed to Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And yet he does not spare their weakness by deceiving
them, but, candidly declaring the whole matter, points out the way to overcome
temptation; namely, by looking forward with certainty to his resurrection. But
as it was necessary that His death should go before, he makes their triumph, in
the meantime, to consist in hope.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 18:34.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they understood none of
these things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>What stupidity was this,
not to understand what Christ said to them in a plain and familiar manner, on a
subject not too lofty or intricate, but of which they had, at their own
suggestion, entertained some suspicion! But it is proper also to bear in mind
&#8212; what I have formerly observed &#8212; the reason why they were held in
such gross ignorance, which was, that they had formed the expectation of a
joyful and prosperous advancement, and therefore reckoned it to be in the
highest degree absurd, that Christ should be ignominiously crucified. Hence we
infer with what madness the minds of men are seized through a false imagination;
and therefore we ought to be the more careful not to yield to any foolish
thoughts, and shut our eyes against the light.</font><br></div>

to have. They who are not satisfied with himself alone, but seek this or the
other thing apart from him and his promises, wander egregiously from the right
path. Nor is it enough that, at the commencement, we sincerely apply our minds
to Christ, if we do not stead-lastly maintain the same purity; for frequently,
in the midst of the course, there spring up sinful affections by which we are
led astray. In this way it is probable that the <i>two sons of Zebedee </i>were,
at first, sincere in their adherence to Christ; but when they see that they have
no ordinary share of his favor, and hear his reign spoken of as near at hand,
their minds are immediately led to wicked ambition, and they are greatly
distressed at the thought of remaining in their present situation. If this
happens to two excellent disciples, with what care ought we to walk, if we do
not wish to turn aside from the right path! More especially, when any plausible
occasion presents itself, we ought to be on our guard, lest the desire of honors
corrupt the feeling of piety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though <i>Matthew </i>and <i>Mark </i>differ somewhat
in the words, yet they agree as to the substance of the matter. <i>Matthew
</i>says that the wife of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zebedee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>came, and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>asked for her
sons</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that they might hold the highest
places </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of Christ. Mark represents
themselves as making the request. But it is probable that, being restrained by
bashfulness, they had the dexterity to employ their mother, who would present
the request with greater boldness. That the wish came originally from themselves
may be inferred from this circumstance, that Christ replied to them, and not to
their mother. Besides, when their mother,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bowing
down</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>states that she has something to
ask, and when themselves, according to Mark, apply for a general
engagement,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that whatever they
ask shall be granted to them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>this timid
insinuation proves that they were conscious of something wrong. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f646</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the
kingdom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was worthy of commendation
in the <i>sons of Zebedee</i>,<i> </i>that they expected some <i>kingdom </i>of
Christ, of which not even the slightest trace was then visible. They see Christ
exposed to contempt under the mean aspect of a servant; nay more, they see him
despised and loaded with many reproaches by the world; but they are convinced
that he will soon become a magnificent king, for so he had taught them. It is
unquestionably a noble specimen of faith; but hence we perceive how easily the
pure seed is no sooner implanted in our hearts than it becomes degenerate and
corrupted; for they imagined to themselves a <i>kingdom </i>which had no
existence, and presently committed the folly of desiring the highest places.
Since, therefore, this wicked ambition flowed from a general principle of faith,
which in itself was highly commendable, we ought to pray, not only that the Lord
would open the eyes of our mind, but that he would give us continual direction,
and keep our minds fixed on the proper object. We ought also to pray, not only
that he would bestow faith upon us, but that he would keep it pure from all
mixture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You know not what you
ask.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Their ignorance was worthy of blame
on two accounts; first, because their ambition led them to desire more than was
proper; and, secondly, because, instead of the heavenly kingdom of Christ, they
had formed the idea of a phantom in the air. As to the first of those reasons,
whoever is not satisfied with the free adoption of God, and desires to raise
himself, such a person wanders beyond his limits, and, by unseasonably pressing
himself forward beyond what was proper for him to do, is ungrateful to God. Now
to estimate the spiritual kingdom of Christ according to the feeling of our
flesh is highly perverse. And, indeed, the greater the delight which the mind of
man takes in idle speculations, the more carefully ought we to guard against
them; as we see that the books of the sophists are stuffed with useless notions
of this sort.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Can you drink the cup which I shall
drink?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To correct their ambition, and to
withdraw them from this wicked desire, he holds out to them the cross, and all
the annoyances which the children of God must endure. As if he had said,
&#8220;Does your present warfare allow you so much leisure, that you are now
making arrangements for a triumphal procession?&#8221; For if they had been
earnestly employed in the duties of their calling, they would never have given
way to this wicked imagination. In these words, therefore, those who are
desirous to obtain the prize before the proper time are enjoined by Christ to
employ themselves in attending to the duties of piety. And certainly this is an
excellent bridle for restraining ambition; for, so long as we are pilgrims in
this world, our condition is such as ought to banish vain luxuries. We are
surrounded by a thousand dangers. Sometimes the enemy assails us by ambush, and
that in a variety of ways; and sometimes he attacks us by open violence. Is he
not worse than stupid who, amidst so many deaths, entertains himself at his ease
by drawing pictures of a triumph?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our Lord enjoins his followers, indeed, to feel
assured of victory, and to sing a triumphal song in the midst of death; for
otherwise they would not have courage to fight valiantly. But it is one thing to
advance manfully to the battle, in reliance on the reward which God has promised
to them, and to labor with their whole might for this object; and it is another
thing to forget the contest, to turn aside from the enemy, to lose sight of
dangers, and to rush forward to triumph, for which they ought to wait till the
proper time. Besides, this foolish speed, for the most part, draws men aside
from their calling; for as in battle the greatest coward is the keenest to seize
the booty, so in the kingdom of Christ none are more eager to obtain the
superiority than those who shrink from all the annoyance which attends toil.
Most properly, therefore, does Christ enjoin those who were puffed up with vain
glory to keep by their post.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f647</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The sum
of the whole is, that for none but him who has fought lawfully is the crown
prepared; and especially, that none will be a partaker of the life and the
kingdom of Christ who has not previously shared in his sufferings and
death.</font><br></div>

come into use, I choose to interpret it more simply as denoting the measure of
afflictions which God appoints to every one. For as it is his right to lay on
every one his own burden according to his pleasure, in the same manner as a
householder distributes and allots the portions of the members of his family, so
He is said to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>give them a cup to

have every thing in common with the Son of God? for thus are those things which
at first sight appear to be deadly made to yield to us salvation and life. On
the other hand, how shall he be reckoned among the disciples of Christ, who
desires to be wholly exempted from the cross? For such person refuses to submit
to the baptism of Christ, which is nothing else than to withdraw from the
earliest lessons.

what will take place, that they may be prepared to endure it with patience; and,
in the persons of two men, he addresses all his followers. For though many
believers die a natural death, and without violence or shedding of blood, yet it
is common to all of them, as Paul informs us,

</i>By this reply Christ surrenders nothing, but only states that the Father had
not assigned to him this office of appointing to each person his own peculiar
place in the kingdom of heaven. He came, indeed, in order to bring all his
people to eternal life; but we ought to reckon it enough that the inheritance
obtained by his blood awaits us. As to the degree in which some men rise above
others, it is not our business to inquire, and God did not intend that it should
be revealed to us by Christ, but that it should be reserved till the latest
revelation. We have now ascertained Christ&#8217;s meaning; for he does not here
reason as to his power, but only desires us to consider for what purpose he was
sent by the Father, and what corresponds to his calling, and therefore
distinguishes between the secret purpose of God and the nature of that teaching
which had been enjoined on him. It is a useful warning, that we may learn to be
wise with sobriety, and may not attempt to force our way into the hidden
mysteries of God, and more especially, that we may not indulge excessive
curiosity in our inquiries about the future state; for</font><br></div>

</i>Luke appears to refer this dispute to a different time. But any one who
shall carefully examine that twenty-second chapter will plainly see that
discourses delivered at different times are there brought together, without any
regard to order. The dispute about the primacy, therefore which Luke mentions,
flowed from this source, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
sons of Zebedee </i></font><font face="Palatino">aspired to the first places in
the kingdom of Christ. And yet the displeasure of the rest was far from being
well-founded; for, while the foolish ambition of the <i>two disciples </i>was so
severely blamed, that they retired from Christ with disgrace, what injury was it
to the other <i>ten</i>,<i> </i>that those disciples foolishly wished what they
did not obtain?  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f652</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> For
though they had a good right to be offended at the ambition of those disciples,
yet when it was put down they ought to have been satisfied. But our Lord
intended to seize on this occasion for laying open a disease which was lurking
within them; for there was not one of them who would willingly yield to others,
but every one secretly cherished within himself the expectation of the primacy;
in consequence of which, they envy and dispute with one another, and yet in all
there reigns wicked ambition. And if this fault was found to be natural to
uneducated men of ordinary rank, and if it broke out on a slight occasion, and
almost without any occasion at all, how much more ought we to be on our guard,
when there is abundance of fuel to feed a concealed flame? We see then how
ambition springs up in any man who has great power and honors, and sends out its
flames far and wide, unless the spirit of modesty, coming from heaven,
extinguish the pride which has a firm hold of the nature of
man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You know that the princes of
the Gentiles rule over them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is first
said that Christ </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called them to
him,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that he might reprove them in
private; and next we learn from it that, being ashamed of their ambition, they
did not openly complain, but that a sort of hollow murmur arose, and every one
secretly preferred himself to the rest. He does not explain generally how deadly
a plague ambition is, but simply warns them, that nothing is more foolish than
to fight about nothing. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f653</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
shows that the primacy, which was the occasion of dispute among them, has no
existence in his kingdom. Those persons, therefore, who extend this saying
indiscriminately to all the godly are mistaken; for Christ only takes occasion
from the present occurrence to show that it is absurd in the apostles to dispute
about the degree of power and honor in their own rank, because the office of
teaching, to which they were appointed, has no resemblance to the governments of
the world. I do acknowledge that this doctrine applies both to private persons
and to kings and magistrates; for no man deserves to be reckoned one of
Christ&#8217;s flock, unless he has made such proficiency under the teacher of
humility, as to claim nothing for himself, but condescend to cultivate brotherly
love. This is, no doubt, true; but the design of Christ was, as I have said, to
distinguish between the spiritual government of his Church and the empires of
the world, that the apostles might not look for the favors of a court; for in
proportion as any of the nobles is loved by kings, he rises to wealth and
distinction. But Christ appoints pastors of his Church, not to <i>rule</i>,<i>
</i>but to <i>serve</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This reflects the error of the Anabaptists, who
exclude kings and magistrates from the Church of God, because Christ declares  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f654</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
they are not like his disciples; though the comparison is here made not between
Christians and ungodly men, but between the nature of their offices. Besides,
Christ did not look so much at the persons of men as at the condition of his
Church. For it was possible that one who was governor of a village or of a city
might, in a case of urgent necessity, discharge also the office of teaching; but
Christ satisfied himself with explaining what belongs to the apostolic office
and what is at variance with it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a question arises, Why does Christ, who appointed
separate orders in his Church, disown in this passage all degrees? For he
appears to throw them all down, or, at least, to place them on a level, so that
not one rises above the rest. But natural reason prescribes a very different
method; and Paul, when describing the government of the Church,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:11,) enumerates the various departments of the ministry, in such a manner as
to make the rank of apostleship higher than the office of pastors. Timothy and
Titus also, are unquestionably enjoined by him to exercise authoritative
superintendence over others, according to the command of God. I reply, if we
carefully examine the whole, it will be found that even kings do not rule justly
or lawfully, unless they serve; but that the apostolic office differs from
earthly government in this respect, that the manner in which kings and
magistrates serve does not prevent them from governing, or indeed from rising
above their subjects in magnificent pomp and splendor. Thus David, Hezekiah, and
others of the same class, while they were the willing servants of all, used a
scepter, a crown, a throne, and other emblems of royalty. But the government of
the Church admits nothing of this sort; for Christ allowed the pastors nothing
more than to be ministers, and to abstain entirely from the exercise of
authority. Here, to it ought to be observed, that the discourse relates to the
thing itself rather than to the disposition. Christ distinguishes between the
apostles and the rank of kings, not because kings have a right to act haughtily,
but because the station of royalty is different from the apostolic office.
While, therefore, both ought to be humble, it is the duty of the apostles always
to consider what form of government the Lord has appointed for his
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the words which Matthew employs,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the princes of the Gentiles rule
over them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke conveys the same import
by saying, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they are called
benefactors;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which means, that kings
possess great wealth and abundance, in order that they may be generous and
bountiful. For though kings have greater delight in their power, and a stronger
desire that it should be formidable, than that it should be founded in the
consent of the people, still they desire the praise of munificence.

who aspire to honors, but nothing is farther from their intention than to

perceived. As every man is carried away by a love of himself, he declares that
this passion ought to be directed to a different object. Let the only greatness,

this be your primacy, to be the <i>servants </i>of all.</font><br></div>

reminds them of his death. &#8220;Because I have chosen you to the honor of
being near me, you are seized by a wicked ambition to reign. But I &#8212; by
whose example you ought to regulate your life &#8212; came not to exalt myself,

mean and despised form of the flesh, the ignominy of the cross. &#8220;If it be

<div><font face="Palatino">it is easy to reply, that what he now says refers to
the period of his humiliation. Accordingly, Luke adds, that he lived among them,
<i>as if he were a servant: </i>not that in appearance, or in name, or in
reality, he was inferior to them, (for he always wished to be acknowledged as

have said, in order to withdraw his disciples from the foolish imagination of an

it follows, that we obtain an undeserved reconciliation with God, the price of
which is to be found nowhere else than in the death of Christ. Wherefore, this

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 20:29.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And while they were departing
from Jericho.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> Osiander </i>has resolved to
display his ingenuity by making four blind men out of one. But nothing can be
more frivolous than this supposition. Having observed that the Evangelists
differ in a few expressions, he imagined that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one blind man received
sight</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>when they were entering into the
city, and that the second, and other two,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>received
sight</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>when Christ
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was departing from
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>But all the circumstances agree so
completely, that no person of sound judgment will believe them to be different
narratives. Not to mention other matters, when Christ&#8217;s followers had
endeavored to put the first to silence, and saw him cured contrary to their
expectation, would they immediately have made the same attempt with the other
three? But it is unnecessary to go into particulars, from which any man may
easily infer that it is one and the same event which is
related.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is a puzzling contradiction in this
respect, that <i>Matthew </i>and <i>Mark </i>say that the miracle was performed
on <i>one </i>or on </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>two blind
men,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>when Christ had already
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>departed from the
city;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>while Luke relates that it was
done before he came to the city. Besides, <i>Mark </i>and <i>Luke </i>speak of
not more than </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one blind
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>while <i>Matthew </i>mentions
<i>two</i>.<i> </i>But as we know that it frequently occurs in the Evangelists,
that in the same narrative one passes by what is mentioned by the others, and,
on the other hand, states more clearly what they have omitted, it ought not to
be looked upon as strange or unusual in the present passage. My conjecture is,
that, while Christ was approaching to the city, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blind man cried
out,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>but that, as he was not heard on
account of the noise, he placed himself in the way,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as they were departing from the
city</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f660</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and then was at length called by Christ. And so <i>Luke, </i>commencing with
what was true, does not follow out the whole narrative, but passes over
Christ&#8217;s stay in the city; while the other Evangelists attend only to the
time which was nearer to the miracle. There is probability in the conjecture
that, as Christ frequently, when he wished to try the faith of men, delayed for
a short time to relieve them, so he subjected this <i>blind man </i>to the same
scrutiny.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The second difficulty may be speedily removed; for we
have seen, on a former occasion, that Mark and <i>Luke </i>speak of <i>one
</i>demoniac as having been cured, while <i>Matthew</i>,<i> </i>as in the
present instance, mentions <i>two</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400828&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
8:28;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;410502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark

8:27  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">f661</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)
And yet this involves no contradiction between them; but it may rather be
conjectured with probability, that at first <i>one blind man </i>implored the
favor of Christ, and that another was excited by his example, and that in this
way
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>two</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>persons </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>received
sight</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> Mark </i>and <i>Luke </i>speak of
<i>one </i>only, either because he was better known, or because in him the
demonstration of Christ&#8217;s power was not less remarkable than it was in
both. It certainly appears to have been on account of his having been
extensively known that he was selected by <i>Mark</i>,<i> </i>who gives both his
own name and that of his father:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bartimeus, son of
Timeus</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>By doing so, he does not claim
for him either illustrious descent or wealth; for he was a beggar of the lowest
class. Hence it appears that the miracle was more remarkable in his person,
because his calamity had been generally known. This appears to me to be the
reason why <i>Mark </i>and <i>Luke </i>mention him only, and say nothing about
the other, who was a sort of inferior appendage. But <i>Matthew</i>,<i> </i>who
was an eye-witness,  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f662</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> did not
choose to pass by even this person, though less known.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have mercy on me, O
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I stated, a little ago, that there
was at first but <i>one </i>who <i>cried out</i>,<i> </i>but the other was
induced by a similar necessity to join him. They confer on Christ no ordinary
honor, when they request him to <i>have mercy</i>,<i> </i>and relieve them; for
they must have been convinced that he had in his power the assistance or remedy
which they needed. But their faith is still more clearly exhibited by their
acknowledgment of him as Messiah, to whom we know that the Jews gave this
designation, Son <i>of David</i>.<i> </i>They therefore apply to Christ, not
only as some Prophet, but as that person whom God had promised to be the only
Author of salvation. The <i>cry </i>proved the ardor of the desire; for, though
they knew that what they said exposed them to the hatred of many, who were
highly displeased with the honor done to Christ, their fear was overcome by the
ardor of desire, so that they did not refrain, on this account, from raising
their voice aloud.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the multitude reproved
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is surprising that the
disciples of Christ, who follow him through a sense of duty and of respect,
should wish to drive wretched men from the favor of Christ, and, so far as lies
in them, to prevent the exercise of his power. But it frequently happens that
the greater part of those who profess the name of Christ, instead of inviting us
to him, rather hinder or delay our approach. If Satan endeavored to throw
obstacles in the way of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>two blind
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>by means of pious and simple
persons, who were induced by some sentiments of religion to follow Christ, how
much more will he succeed in accomplishing it by means of hypocrites and
traitors, if we be not strictly on our guard. Perseverance is therefore
necessary to overcome every difficulty, and the more numerous the obstacles are
which Satan throws in the way, the more powerfully ought we to be excited to
earnestness in prayer, as we see that the <i>blind men </i>redoubled their
<i>cry</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>32.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What do you wish that I
should do to you?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He gently and kindly
asks what they desire; for he had determined to grant their requests. There is
no reason to doubt that they prayed by a special movement of the Holy Spirit;
for, as the Lord does not intend to grant to all persons deliverance from bodily
diseases, so neither does he permit them simply to pray for it. A rule has been
prescribed for us what we ought to ask, and in what manner, and to what extent;
and we are not at liberty to depart from that rule, unless the Lord, by a secret
movement of the Spirit, suggest to us some special prayer, which rarely happens.
Christ puts the question to them, not for their sake as individuals, but for the
sake of all the people; for we know how the world swallows God&#8217;s benefits
without perceiving them, unless they are stimulated and aroused. Christ,
therefore, by his voice, awakens the assembled crowd to observe the miracle, as
he awakens them shortly afterwards by a visible sign, when he opens their eyes
by touching them.</font><br></div>

wretchedness; but now the Evangelist expresses that Christ was induced to cure
them, not only by undeserved goodness, but because he pitied their distress. For
the metaphor is taken from the <i>bowels</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">spla&gt;gcna</font><font face="Palatino">,)

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word faith
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is meant not only a confident hope of
recovering sight, but a loftier conviction, which was, that this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blind
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>had acknowledged Jesus to be the
Messiah whom God had promised. Nor must we imagine that it was only some
confused knowledge; for we have already seen that this confession was taken from
the Law and the Prophets. For the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blind
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>did not at random bestow on Christ
the name of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Son of

whose coming he had been taught by the divine predictions to expect. Now Christ
attributes it to faith that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
blind man received sight;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for, though
the power and grace of God sometimes extend even to unbelievers, yet no man
enjoys His benefits in a right and profitable manner, unless he receive them by
faith; nay, the use of the gifts of God is so far from being advantageous to
unbelievers, that it is even hurtful. And therefore, when Christ says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thy faith hath saved
thee,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>safety</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of the soul; as if Christ had said, that by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

And if it was in regard <i>to
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

<div><font face="Palatino">This shows how little attention Luke paid to
observing the order of dates; for, after having detailed the miracle, he now
relates what happened in the city of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jericho</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>He tells us that, while Christ presented himself to the view of all, as he
went along the streets,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zaccheus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>alone was very desirous to see him. For it was an evidence of intense desire
that he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>climbed up a
tree</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>since <i>rich </i>men are, for the
most part, haughty, and plume themselves on affected gravity. It is possible,
indeed, that others entertained the same wish, but this man was most properly
singled out by Luke, both on account of his rank, and on account of his
wonderful conversion, which took place suddenly. Now, though faith was not yet
formed in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zaccheus</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>yet this was a sort of preparation for it; for it was not without a heavenly
inspiration that he desired so earnestly to get a sight of Christ; I mean, in
reference to that design which immediately appeared. Some were led, no doubt, by
vain curiosity to run even from distant places, for the purpose of seeing
Christ, but the event showed that the mind of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zaccheus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>contained some seed of piety. In this manner, before revealing himself to
men, the Lord frequently communicates to them a secret desire, by which they are
led to Him, while he is still concealed and unknown; and, though they have no
fixed object in view, He does not disappoint them, but manifests himself in due
time.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zaccheus</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and does not wait for his invitation, but of his own accord asks lodging at
his house. We know how hateful, nay, how detestable the name of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>publican</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>at that time was; and we shall find that this is shortly afterwards

approach a man, from whom the great body of men recoil, and that before he is
requested to do so. But we need not wonder, if he bestows this honor on one who
was already drawn to him by a secret movement of the Spirit; for it was a more
valuable gift to dwell in his heart than to enter his house. But by this
expression he made it evident, that he is never sought in vain by those who
sincerely desire to know him; for

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>murmur</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he goes to lodge with a
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>who is looked upon as wicked and
infamous, even though nobody invited him. It is thus that the world disregards
the offer of the grace of God, but complains bitterly  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f668a</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> when
it is conveyed to others. But let us consider how unjust this murmuring was.
They think it unreasonable that Christ should bestows so great an honor on a
wicked man; for in this passage, as in many others, the word <i>sinner </i>is
not taken in the ordinary sense,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f669</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but denotes a man of disgraceful and scandalous life. Let us suppose that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zaccheus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>was a person of this description. Still, we ought first to inquire for what
purpose Christ chose to become his guest; for, while out of doors men are
murmuring, <i>within </i>the house God displays magnificently the glory of this
name, and refutes their wicked calumny.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The conversion of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zaccheus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>was an astonishing work of God, and yet there was no good reason why
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zacheus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>should be marked with infamy. He had the charge of collecting the taxes. Now
to collect taxes was no crime in itself, but men of that class were exceedingly
despised and hated by the Jews, because they reckoned it to be in the highest
degree unjust that they should pay tribute. But whatever might be the character
of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zaccheus</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>still the kindness of Christ ought not to be blamed, but commended, in not
refusing his assistance to a wretched man, to rescue him from destruction, and
bring him to salvation. And therefore the offense which was wickedly taken did
not hinder him from proceeding to execute his Father&#8217;s command. With such
magnanimity ought all his ministers to be endued, as to think more highly of the
salvation of one soul than of the murmurs which all ignorant persons may utter,
and not to desist from their duty, even though all their actions and words may
expose them to reproaches.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Zaccheus stood, and
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>From this result they ought to
have formed their opinion of what Christ did; but men are so hasty and
precipitate, that they do not take time to wait for God.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f670</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
conversion of Zaceheus is described by fruits and outward signs. As it was
probable that he had enriched himself to the injury of others,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">if he had wronged any
man, he was ready to restore fourfold. Besides, the half of his goods he
dedicates to the poor. A man might indeed bestow all his goods on the poor,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 13:3,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and yet his generosity might be of no value in the
sight of God; but, though no mention is here made of inward repentance, yet Luke
means that the godly zeal, which he commends in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zaccheus</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>proceeded from that living root. In like manner, Paul, when treating of
repentance, exhorts us to those duties, by which men may learn that we are
changed for the better.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Let him that stole steal
no more; but rather let him labor with his hands, that he may assist the poor

4:28.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought therefore to begin with the heart, but our
repentance ought also to be evinced by works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now let us observe that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zaccheus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>does not make a present to God out of his extortions, as many rich men give
to God a portion of what they have obtained by dishonesty, that they may the
more freely pillage in future, and that they may be acquitted of the wrongs
which they have formerly done. But
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zaccheus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>devotes </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the half of his
goods</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to God in such a manner, as to
give, at the same time, compensation for whatever wrongs he has done; and hence
we infer that the riches which he possessed were not the fruit of dishonest
gain. Thus
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zaccheus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is not only ready to give satisfaction, if he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>has taken any thing by
fraud</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>but shares his lawful possessions
with the poor; by which he shows that he is changed from a wolf not only into a
sheep, but even into a shepherd. And while he corrects the faults which had been
formerly committed, he renounces wicked practices for the future, as God demands
from his people, first of all, that they abstain from doing any act of injury.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zaccheus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>has not laid others under obligation, by his example, to strip themselves of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the half of their

rule which the Lord prescribes, that we dedicate ourselves, and all that we
have, to holy and lawful purposes.</font><br></div>

</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Today is salvation come to
this house.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ, bearing testimony to
Zaccheus, declares that his professions were not hypocritical. And yet he does
not ascribe to the good works of Zaccheus the cause of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>but, as that conversion was an undoubted pledge of the divine adoption, he
justly concludes from it that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is a possessor of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children of
Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he argues that his <i>house
</i>is saved. In order that any man may be reckoned among the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children of

imitate
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Abraham&#8217;s</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

distinguishes the genuine
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children of
Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>from strangers. Let us therefore
know that in Zaccheus faith is chiefly commended, on account of which his good
works were acceptable to God. Nor is there reason to doubt that the doctrine of
Christ went before the conversion of Zaccheus; and, consequently, the
commencement of his salvation was, to hear Christ discoursing on the undeserved
mercy of God, and on the reconciliation of men to Him, and on the redemption of
the Church, and to embrace this doctrine by faith.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Luke 19:11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>While they were hearing these
things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was next to a prodigy that
the disciples, after having been so frequently warned as to the approaching
death of Christ, flew aside from it to think of his kingdom. There were two
mistakes; first, that they pictured to themselves rest and happiness without the
cross; secondly, that they judged of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the kingdom of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>according to their own carnal sense.
Hence it appears how slight and obscure their faith was; for though they had
entertained a hope of the resurrection, yet the taste was too slight for forming
a fixed and decided opinion about Christ. They believe him to be the Redeemer
who had been formerly promised, and hence they conceive a hope that the Church
will be renewed; but that knowledge immediately degenerates into vain
imaginations, which either overturn or obscure the power of his kingdom. But the
strangest thing of all was, that so many warnings should have passed away from
their recollection without yielding any advantage. At least, it was brutal
stupidity that, though Christ had lately declared, in express terms, that he was
just about to undergo a bitter and ignominious death, they not only remained
unconcerned, but rushed forward, as if to a joyful triumph.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A certain
nobleman.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> Matthew </i>interweaves this
parable with others, without attending to the order of time; but, as his
intention was, in the twenty-second chapter, to make a collection of
Christ&#8217;s latest discourses, readers ought not to trouble themselves
greatly with the inquiry which of them was delivered on the first, or the
second, or the third day within that short period. But it is proper to observe
the difference between <i>Matthew </i>and <i>Luke; </i>for, while the former
touches only on one point, the latter embraces two. This point is common to
both, that Christ resembles <i>a nobleman</i>,<i> </i>who, undertaking a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>long
.journey</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for the sake of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>obtaining a
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>has entrusted his <i>money
</i>to the management of <i>his servants</i>,<i> </i>and so on. The other point
is peculiar to Luke, that the subjects abused the absence of the prince, and
raised a tumult in order to shake off his yoke. In both parts Christ intended to
show, that the disciples were greatly mistaken in supposing that his royal
authority was already established, and that he was coming <i>to
Jerusalem</i>,<i> </i>in order to commence immediately a course of prosperity.
Thus by taking away the expectation of an immediate <i>kin</i>g<i>dom</i>,<i>
</i>he exhorts them to hope and patience; for he tells them that they must long
and steadily endure many toils, before they enjoy that glory for which they pant
too earnestly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Into a distant
country.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As the disciples thought that
Christ was now about to enter into the possession of his kingdom, he first
corrects this mistake by informing them, that he must undertake
a</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> long
journey</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>in order <i>to
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>obtain the

</i>As to what is meant by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>distant
country</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> I </i>leave it to the ingenious
expositions of those who are fond of subtleties. For my own part, I think that
Christ expresses nothing more than his long absence, which would extend from the
time of his death to his last coming. For, though he sits at the right hand of
the Father, and holds the government of heaven and earth, and though, from the
time that he ascended to heaven, <i>all power was given to him</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
28:18,) <i>that every knee might bow before him</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:10;) yet as he has not yet subdued his enemies &#8212; has not yet appeared as
Judge of the world, or revealed his majesty &#8212; it is not without propriety
that he is said to be absent from his people, till he return again, clothed with
his new sovereignty. It is true, indeed, that he now reigns, while he
regenerates his people to the heavenly life, forms them anew to the image of
God, and associates them with angels; while he governs the Church by his word,
guards it by his protection, enriches it with the gifts of the Spirit, nourishes
it by his grace, and maintains it by his power, and, in short, supplies it with
all that is necessary for salvation; while he restrains the fury of Satan and of
all the ungodly, and defeats all their schemes. But as this way of reigning is
concealed from the flesh, his manifestation is properly said to be delayed till
the last day. Since, therefore, the apostles foolishly aimed at the shadow of a
kingdom, our Lord declares that he must go to seek a <i>distant </i>kingdom,
that, they may learn to endure delay.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f677</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And having called his ten
servants.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We must not inquire anxiously
into the number of the servants, or into the sums of money. For Matthew, by
expressing various sums, includes a more extensive doctrine, namely, that Christ
does not lay on all an equal charge of trafficking, but commits to one a small,
and to another a larger sum of money. Both agree in this, that till the last day
of the resurrection Christ, in some respects, goes to a distance from his
people, but yet that it would be highly improper for them to sit down in
idleness and do no good; for each has a certain office enjoined him, in which he
ought to be employed, and, therefore, they ought to be diligent in
<i>trading</i>,<i> </i>that they may be careful to increase their Lord&#8217;s
property.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Luke says simply, that to each he gave <i>a pound;
</i>because, whether more or less may be committed to us by our Lord, every man
must equally give account for himself. Matthew, as I have said, is more full and
copious; for he states various degrees. Let us know that the Lord does not
bestow on all indiscriminately the same <i>measure of gifts</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians

Corinthians 12:11,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"> so that some excel others. But whatever gifts the
Lord has bestowed upon us, let us know that it is committed to us as so much
money, that it may yield some gain; for nothing could be more unreasonable than
that we should allow to remain buried, or should apply to no use, God&#8217;s
favors, the value of which consists in yielding fruit.</font><br></div>

not distinguish between natural gifts and the gifts of the Spirit; for we have
neither power nor skill  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f678</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which
ought not to be acknowledged as having been received from God; and, therefore,

What then is meant by saying, that the master of the house gives to each person
more or less, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to his
own ability</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>It is because God, as he
has assigned to every one his place, and has bestowed on him natural gifts,
gives him also this or the other injunction, employs him in the management of
affairs, raises him to various offices, furnishes him with abundant means of
eminent usefulness, and presents to him the opportunity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is absurd, however, in the Papists to infer from
this, that the gifts of God are conferred on every man according to the measure
which he deserves. For, though the old translator,

themselves well, and obtained the praise of <i>virtue</i>,<i> </i>but only so
far as the master of the house has judged them to be suitable. Now we know that
no man is found by God to be suitable till He has made him so; and the Greek
word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">du&gt;namiv</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>

justly compared to <i>trading</i>,<i> </i>for they ought naturally to exchange

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f682</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which
illustrates the glory of God. For, though God is not enriched, and makes no
<i>gain</i>,<i> </i>by our labors, yet when every one is highly profitable to
his brethren, and applies advantageously, for their salvation, the gifts which
he has received from God, he is said to yield <i>profit</i>,<i> </i>or
<i>gain</i>,<i> </i>to God himself. So highly does our heavenly Father value the
salvation of men, that whatever contributes to it he chooses to place to his own
account. That we may not <i>become weary in doing well</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:9,) Christ declares that the labor of those who are faithfully employed in
their calling will not be useless.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">According to <i>Luke</i>,<i> </i>he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he who gained five pounds obtains
the government of five cities;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by which
words he informs them, that the glory of his kingdom will be very different at
his last coming from what it now appears. For now  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f683</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> we have
labor and anxiety in managing, as it were, the affairs of an absent master; but
then he will have at his command an ample and copious supply of honors, to
ennoble and enrich us. The form of expression employed by <i>Matthew </i>is more
simple, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Enter thou into the joy
of thy master</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by which he means that
faithful servants, whose discharge of duty shall meet with his approbation, will
share with himself a blessed abundance of all good things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is asked, What is meant by what is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Take from him the talent, arid
give it to him who hath ten talents</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>For
every kind of <i>trading </i>will then be at an end. I reply, We ought to keep
in remembrance what I formerly mentioned, that those who insist on explaining,
with exactness, every minute phrase, are mistaken. The true meaning is, though
slothful and unprofitable servants are now endued with the gifts of the Spirit,
yet they will at length be deprived of them all, that their wretched and
shameful poverty may redound to the glory of the good. Now these slothful
persons, Christ tells us, <i>hide </i>either the <i>talent </i>or the <i>pound
</i>in the earth; because, while they consult their own ease and gratifications,
they refuse to submit to any uneasiness; as we see very many who, while they are
privately devoted to themselves and to their own advantage, avoid all the duties
of charity, and have no regard to the general edification. When it is said that
the master of the house, after his return, called the servants to account; as
this ought to impart courage to the good, when they understand that they do not
lose their pains, so the indolent and careless, on the other hand, ought to be
struck with no small terror. Let us therefore learn to call ourselves daily to
account, before the Lord come, and <i>make a reckoning </i>with
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I knew thee, that thou art a
harsh man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This <i>harshness </i>has
nothing to do with the substance of the parable; and it is an idle speculation
in which those indulge, who reason from this passage, how severely and
rigorously God deals with his own people. For Christ did not intend to describe
such <i>rigor</i>,<i> </i>any more than to applaud <i>usury</i>,<i> </i>when he
represents the master of the house as saying, that the money ought to have been
deposited with a <i>banker</i>,<i> </i>that it might, at least, <i>gain
interest</i>.<i> </i>Christ only means, that there will be no excuse for the
indolence of those who both conceal the gifts of God, and waste their time in
idleness. Hence also we infer that no manner of life is more praiseworthy in the
sight of God, than that which yields some advantage to human
society.</font><br></div>

terrify such persons by threatening an awful punishment, but also to keep his
own people in faithful subjection; for it was no small temptation to see the
kingdom of God scattered by the treachery and rebellion of many. In order then
that we may preserve our composure in the midst of troubles, Christ informs us
that he will return, and that at his coming he will punish wicked rebellion.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>Matthew 21:1.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then Jesus sent two
disciples</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Jesus <i>sends </i>his
<i>disciples </i>to bring <i>an ass </i>to him, not because he was wearied with
the journey, but for a different reason; for, in consequence of the time of his
death being at hand, he intended to show, by a solemn performance, what was the
nature of his kingdom. He had begun, indeed, to do this at his baptism, but it
remained that this demonstration should be given by him towards the end of his
calling: for why did he hitherto refrain from the title of <i>King, </i>and now
at length openly declare himself to be a <i>King, </i>but because he is not far
from the end of his course?  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f698</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> So
then, as his removal to heaven was at hand, he intended to commence his reign
openly on earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This would have been a ridiculous display, if it had
not been in accordance with the prediction of Zechariah, (9:9.) In order to lay
claim to the honors of royalty, he enters Jerusalem,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>riding an
ass.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>A magnificent display, truly! more
especially when </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
ass</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>was borrowed from some person, and
when the want of a saddle and of accouterments compelled the disciples to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>throw their garments on
it,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which was mark of mean and
disgraceful poverty. He is attended, I admit, by a large retinue; but of what
sort of people? Of those who had hastily assembled from the neighboring
villages. Sounds of loud and joyful welcome are heard;  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f699</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
from whom? From the very poorest, and from those who belong to the despised
multitude. One might think, therefore, that he intentionally exposed himself to
the ridicule of all. But as he had two things to do at the same time, &#8212; as
he had to exhibit some proof of his kingdom, and to show that it does not
resemble earthly kingdoms, and does not consist of the fading riches of this
world, it was altogether necessary for him to take this method.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To wicked men, no doubt, this might be very
unacceptable, had not God long before testified by his Prophet that such would
be the king who would come to restore the salvation of his people. In order,
therefore, that the mean aspect of Christ may not hinder us from perceiving in
this exhibition,  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f700</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> his
spiritual kingdom, let us keep before our eyes the heavenly prediction, by which
God conferred more honor on his Son under the revolting aspect of a beggar, than
if he had been decorated with all the dazzling ornaments of kings. Without this
seasoning, we shall never have any relish for this history; and therefore there
is great weight in the words of Matthew, when he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the prediction of the Prophet was
fulfilled</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f701</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>Perceiving that it was hardly possible that men, who are too much devoted to
wealth and splendor, should derive any advantage from this narrative, when
viewed according to the feeling of the flesh, he leads them away from the simple
contemplation of the fact to the consideration of the prophecy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go into the
village.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As he was <i>at Bethany</i>,<i>
</i>he did not ask for <i>an ass </i>to relieve the fatigue of traveling; for he
could easily have performed the rest of the journey on foot. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f702</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But as
kings are wont to ascend their chariots, from which they may be easily seen, so
the Lord intended to turn the eyes of the people on himself, and to place some
mark of approbation on the applauses of his followers, lest any might think that
he unwillingly received the honor of a king.  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f703</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From what place he ordered <i>the ass </i>to be
brought is uncertain, except, what may naturally be inferred, that it was some
village adjoining to the city; for the allegorical exposition of it, which some
give, as applying to Jerusalem, is ridiculous. Not a whit more admissible is the
allegory which certain persons have contrived about the <i>ass </i>and the
<i>colt</i>.<i> </i>&#8220;The <i>she-ass,&#8221; </i>they tell us, &#8220;is a
figure of the Jewish nation, which had been long subdued, and accustomed to the
yoke of the Law. The Gentiles, again, are represented by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the colt, on which no man ever
sat.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Christ sat first on the <i>ass
</i>for this reason, that it was proper for him to begin with the Jews; and
afterwards he passed over to the <i>colt</i>,<i> </i>because he was appointed to
govern the Gentiles also in the second place.&#8221; And indeed Matthew appears
to say that he rode on both of them; but as instances of <i>Synecdoche </i>occur
frequently in Scripture, we need not wonder if he mentions two instead of one.
From the other Evangelists it appears manifestly that the <i>colt </i>only was
used by Christ; and all doubt is removed by Zechariah, (9:9,)who twice repeats
the same thing, according to the ordinary custom of the Hebrew language. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f704</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And immediately you will
find</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>That the disciples may feel no
hesitation about immediate compliance, our Lord anticipates and replies to their
questions. First, he explains that he does not send them away at random, and
this he does by saying that, at the very entrance into the village, they will
find an </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ass-colt with its
mother</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and, secondly, that nobody will
hinder them from leading him away, if they only reply that He
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hath need of
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>In this way he proved his Divinity;
for both to know absent matters, and to bend the hearts of men to compliance,  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f705</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
belonged to God alone. It was, no doubt, possible that the owner of the ass,
entertaining no unfavorable opinion of Christ, would cheerfully grant it; but to
foresee if he would be at home, if it would then be convenient for him, or if he
would place confidence in unknown persons, was not in the power of a mortal man.
Again, as Christ strengthens the disciples, that they may be more ready to obey,
so we see how they, on the other hand, yield submission. The result shows that
the whole of this affair was directed by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Say to the daughter of
Zion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is not found, word for word,
in Zechariah; but what God commanded one Prophet to proclaim, the Evangelist
justly and appropriately applies to all godly teachers; for the only hope, on
which the children of God ought both to build and to rely, was, that the
Redeemer would at length come. Accordingly, the Prophet shows that the coming of
Christ yields to believers a full and complete ground of joy; for, since God is
not reconciled to them in any other way than through the agency of the Mediator,
and as it is the same Mediator who delivers his people from all evils, what can
there be, apart from him, that is fitted to cheer men ruined by their sins, and
oppressed by troubles? And as we must be altogether overwhelmed with grief when
Christ is absent, so on the other hand, the Prophet reminds believers that, when
the Redeemer is present with them, they ought to be perfectly joyful. Now though
he bestows on Christ other commendations &#8212; namely, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he is just, and having
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; Matthew </i>has taken but
a single portion, which applied to the object he had in view, which is, that
Christ will come, <i>poor </i>or <i>meek;</i> or in other words, that he will be
unlike earthly kings, whose apparel is very magnificent and costly. Another mark
of poverty is added, that he will</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
ride on an ass</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the foal of an
ass</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for there can be no doubt that the
manner of <i>riding </i>which belongs to the common people is contrasted with
royal splendor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the disciples
went</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It was just now remarked, that the
zeal and readiness of <i>the disciples </i>to obey are here mentioned with
commendation; for the influence of Christ was not so great, that his name alone
would be sufficient to produce an impression on unknown persons; and besides,
there was reason to fear that they would be blamed for theft. It is therefore a
proof of the deference which they paid to their Master, when they make no reply,
but proceed readily towards that place to which he has ordered them to go,
relying on his command and promise. Let us also learn by their example to press
forward through every kind of difficulty, so as to render to the Lord the
obedience which he demands from us; for he will remove obstacles, and open up a
path, and will not permit our endeavors to be unavailing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And a very great
multitude.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here the Evangelists relate
that Christ was acknowledged as a king by the people. It might, indeed, appear
to be a ludicrous exhibition,  
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f706</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that a
multitude of obscure persons, by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cutting down trees, and strawing
their garments</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>bestowed on Christ the
empty title of <i>King; </i>but as they did this in good earnest, and as they
gave an honest testimony of their reverence, so Christ looked upon them as fit
heralds of his kingdom. Nor ought we to wonder at such a beginning, when even in
the present day, while sitting at the right hand of the Father, he commissions
from the heavenly throne obscure men, by whom his majesty is celebrated in a
despicable manner. I do not think it probable that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>branches of
palm-trees</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>were cut down, as some
interpreters conjecture, in accordance with an ancient and solemn rite appointed
for that day. On the contrary, it would seem to have been by a sudden movement
of the Spirit that this honor was rendered to Christ, when nothing of this
nature had been intended by the disciples, whom the rest of the multitude
imitated by doing the same thing; for this also may be inferred from the words
of Luke.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hosanna to the Son of
David.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This prayer is taken from
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B825&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
118:25. Matthew relates expressly the Hebrew words, in order to inform us, that
these applauses were not rashly bestowed on Christ, and that the disciples did
not utter without consideration the prayers which came to their lips, but that
they followed with reverence the form of prayer, which the Holy Spirit had
prescribed to the whole Church by the mouth of the Prophet. For, though he
speaks there of his own kingdom, yet there is no reason to doubt that he
principally looks, and intends others to look, to the eternal succession, which
the Lord had promised to him. He drew up a perpetual form of prayer, which would
be observed, even when the wealth of the kingdom was decayed; and therefore it
was a prevailing custom, that prayers for the promised redemption were generally
presented in these words. And the design of Matthew was, as we have just hinted,
to quote in Hebrew a well-known psalm, for the purpose of showing that Christ
was acknowledged by the multitude as a Redeemer. The pronunciation of the words,
indeed, is somewhat changed; for it ought rather to have been written,
<i>Hoshiana</i>, (</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" size="4" color="Teal">an
[y&ccedil;wh</font><font face="Palatino">)<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Save now, we beseech
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>but we know that it is scarcely
possible to take a word from one language into another, without making some
alteration in the sound. Nor was it only the ancient people whom God enjoined to
pray daily for the kingdom of Christ, but the same rule is now laid down for us.
And certainly, as it is the will of God to reign only in the person of his Son,
when we say, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>May thy kingdom
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>under this petition is conveyed
the same thing which is expressed more clearly in the psalm. Besides, when we
pray to God to maintain his Son as our King, we acknowledge that this kingdom
was not erected by men, and is not upheld by the power of men, but remains
invincible through heavenly protection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the name of the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He is said to come in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the name of
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>who not only conducts himself, but
receives the kingdom, by the command and appointment of God. This may be more
certainly inferred from the words of <i>MARK, </i>where another exclamation is
added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed be the kingdom of
our father David, which cometh in the name of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for they speak thus in reference
to the promises; because the Lord had testified that he would at length be a
deliverer of that nation, and had appointed as the means the restoration of the
kingdom of David. We see then that the honor of Mediator, from whom the
restoration of all things and of salvation was to be expected, is ascribed to
Christ. Now as it was mean and uneducated men by whom the kingdom of Christ was
called </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the kingdom of
David,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>let us hence learn that this
doctrine was at that time well known, which in the present day appears to many
to be forced and harsh, because they are not well acquainted with
Scripture.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">f707</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>

correspond to the song of the angels,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glory in

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace on
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>while here both <i>peace </i>and
<i>glory </i>are ascribed to God. But there is no contradiction in the meaning;
for, though the angels state more distinctly the reason why we ought to sing,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Glory to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; namely</i>,<i> </i>because
through his mercy men enjoy peace in this world &#8212; yet the meaning is the
same with what is now declared by the multitude, that there is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace in
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for we know that there is no
other way in which wretched souls find rest in the world, than by God

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>41.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And wept over
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As there was nothing which Christ
more ardently desired than to execute the office which the Father had committed
to him, and as he knew that the end of his calling was to gather
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the lost sheep of the house of
Israel,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401524&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
15:24,) he wished that his coming might bring salvation to all. This was the
reason why he was moved with compassion, and <i>wept over </i>the approaching
destruction of the city of Jerusalem. For while he reflected that this was the
sacred abode which God had chosen, in which the covenant of eternal salvation
should dwell &#8212; the sanctuary from which salvation would go forth to the
whole world, it was impossible that he should not deeply deplore its ruin. And
when he saw the people, who had been adopted to the hope of eternal life, perish
miserably through their ingratitude and wickedness, we need not wonder if he
could not refrain from tears.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to those who think it strange that Christ should
bewail an evil which he had it in his power to remedy, this difficulty is
quickly removed. For as he came down from heaven, that, clothed in human flesh,
he might be the witness and minister of the salvation which comes from God, so
he actually took upon him human feelings, as far as the office which he had
undertaken allowed. And it is necessary that we should always give due
consideration to the character which he sustains, when he speaks, or when he is
employed in accomplishing the salvation of men; as in this passage, in order
that he may execute faithfully his Father&#8217;s commission, he must
necessarily desire that the fruit of the redemption should come to the whole
body of the elect people. Since, therefore, he was given to this people as a
minister for salvation, it is in accordance with the nature of his office that
he should deplore its destruction. He was God, I acknowledge; but on all
occasions when it was necessary that he should perform the office of teacher,
his divinity rested, and was in a manner concealed, that it might not hinder
what belonged to him as Mediator. By this <i>weeping </i>he proved not only that
he loved, like a brother, those for whose sake he became man, but also that God
made to flow into human nature the Spirit of fatherly love.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>42.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O if even thou hadst
known!</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The discourse is pathetic, and
therefore abrupt; for we know that by those who are under the influence of
vehement passion their feelings are not more than half-expressed. Besides, two
feelings are here mingled; for not only does Christ bewail the destruction of
the city, but he likewise reproaches the ungrateful people with the deepest
guilt, in rejecting the salvation which was offered to them, and drawing down on
themselves a dreadful judgment of God. The word <i>even</i>,<i> </i>which is
interwoven with it, is emphatic; for Christ silently contrasts Jerusalem with
the other cities of Judea, or rather, of the whole world, and the meaning is:
&#8220;If EVEN <i>thou</i>,<i> </i>who art distinguished by a remarkable
privilege above the whole world, &#8212; if
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>thou at
least,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>(I say,) who art a heavenly
sanctuary in the earth, <i>hadst known</i>.<i>&#8221; </i>This is immediately
followed by another amplification taken from the time: &#8220;Though hitherto
thou hast wickedly and outrageously rebelled against God, <i>now at least
</i>there is time for repentance.&#8221; For he means that the day is now at
hand, which had been appointed by the eternal purpose of God for the salvation
of Jerusalem, and had been foretold by the prophets. <i>Thus </i>(says Isaiah)
<i>is the accepted time</i>,<i> this is the day of salvation</i>,<i>
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Seek the Lord while he

55:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The things which belong to thy
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Under the word <i>peace </i>he
includes, according to the meaning of the Hebrew phrase, all that is essential
to happiness. Nor does he simply say, that Jerusalem did not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know her peace, but the things
which belonged to her peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for it
frequently happens that men are far from being unacquainted with their
happiness, but they are ignorant of the way and means, (as we say,) because they
are blinded by their wickedness. Now since the compassion is mingled with
reproach, let us observe, that men deserve the heavier punishment in proportion
to the excellence of the gifts which they have received, because to other sins
there is added an impious profanation of heavenly grace. Secondly, let us
observe, that the nearer God approaches to us, and holds out the light of sound
doctrine, the less excusable are we, if we neglect this opportunity. The gate of
salvation, indeed, is always open; but as God is sometimes silent, it is no
ordinary privilege, when He invites us to himself with a loud voice, and in a
familiar manner, and therefore the contempt will be visited by severer
punishment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But now they are hid from thy
eyes.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is not said for the purpose
of extenuating the guilt of Jerusalem; for, on the contrary, it marks with
disgrace the monstrous stupidity of that city, that, when God is present, it
does not perceive him. I do acknowledge that it belongs to God alone to open the
eyes of the blind, and that no man is qualified for understanding the mysteries
of the heavenly kingdom, unless God enlighten him inwardly by his Spirit; but it
does not follow from this that they who perish through their own brutal
blindness are excusable. Christ intended also to remove an offense, which might
otherwise have perplexed the ignorant and weak; for when the eyes of all were
directed to that city, his example might have very great influence in both
respects, either for evil or for good. That no man then may be perplexed by its
unbelief and proud contempt of the Gospel, <i>Jerusalem </i>is condemned for
disgraceful blindness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>43.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the days shall come upon
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now assumes, as it were, the
character of a judge, and addresses Jerusalem with greater severity. In like
manner the prophets also, though they shed tears over the destruction of those
about whom they ought to feel anxiety, yet they summon up courage to pronounce
severe threatenings, because they know that not only are they commanded to watch
over the salvation of men, but that they have also been appointed to be the
heralds of the judgment of God. Under these terms Jesus declares that Jerusalem
will suffer dreadful punishment,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because she did not know the time
of her visitation;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, because she
despised the Redeemer who had been exhibited to her, and did not embrace his
grace. Let the fearful nature of the punishments which she endured now alarm us,
that we may not, by our carelessness, extinguish the light of salvation, but may
be careful to receive the grace of God, and may even run with rigor to meet
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">FOOTNOTES</font><br></div>

explained a phrase or illustrated a fact, he seldom repeats what he had said,

found. It is not improbable that this may have been his leading motive for
adopting the plan of a <i>Harmony, </i>instead of writing a separate Commentary

recollection that, on the occasion alluded to, he satisfied himself with general
remarks on the &#8220;wicked slander&#8221; of the Pharisees, and took no notice

&#8220;Some readers may happen to ask, Who were the <i>Sorbonnists, </i>or, as
they are often called, <i>the Doctors of the Sorbonne?</i> In reply, I take the
liberty of extracting from a volume, which I gave to the world a few years ago,
a few remarks on this subject.&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;The College of the
<i>Sorbonne, </i>in Paris, takes its name from <i>Robert de Sorbonne, </i>who
founded it in the middle of the thirteenth century. Its reputation for
theological learning, philosophy, classical literature, and all that formerly
constituted a liberal education, was deservedly high. In the Doctors of the
Sorbonne the Reformation found powerful adversaries. The very name of this
University, to which the greatest scholars in Europe were accustomed to pay
deference, would be regarded by the multitude with blind veneration. If such men
as Calvin, Beza, Melancthon, and Luther, were prepared by talents and
acquirements of the first order to brave the terrors of that name, they must
have frequently lamented its influence on many of their hearers. Yet our author
meets undaunted this formidable array, and enters the field with the full
assurance of victory. Despising, as we naturally do, the weak superstitions and
absurd tenets held by the Church of Rome, we are apt to underrate our
obligations to the early champions of the Reformed faith, who encountered with
success those veteran warriors, and <i>contended earnestly </i>(Jude, verse 3)
<i>for the faith which was once delivered to the
saints.</i>&#8221;<i>&#8212;(Biblical Cabinet, </i>volume 30:p.

&#8220;the impiety of the Lucianists and Atheists.&#8221;  <i>Lucian</i>,<i>
</i>a celebrated Greek writer, of the second century of the Christian era,
author of <i>Dialogues of the Dead</i>,<i> </i>is here alluded to as the type of
scoffers and <i>Atheists</i>.<i> </i>His subject naturally led him to treat with
sportive humor the solenmities of death and the future judgment; and the wit and
elegance of his pen, had it been guided by ordinary caution, would have been
readily &#8212; far too readily &#8212; sustained as an apology for the tone of
his work. But in defiance of the ordinary feelings of mankind, he attacked so
fearlessly the most sacred truths, and offended the ear of modesty by such
indecent allusions, that his character as a man has been stamped with infamy. 
Modern times have scarcely  produced so daring an infidel, with the exception
perhaps of <i>Voltaire</i>,<i> </i>who took no pains to conceal his intense
hatred of Christianity and of good men. Had he appeared earlier, his name might
perhaps have been substituted for that of <i>Lucian</i>,<i> </i>as the
representative of his class. &#8212; Ed.</font><br></div>

interpreter who was willing to twist a passage, so as to bring out of it any
meaning that he chose, would find the vagueness of the Latin word <i>virtus
</i>to be well suited to his purpose. Its derivation from <i>vir</i>,<i> a
</i>man, shows that it originally signified <i>manliness</i>,<i> </i>from which
it easily passed to denote <i>courage</i>,<i> </i>and, from the high estimation
in which <i>courage </i>was held among warlike nations, became the general
expression for <i>moral excelle</i>n<i>ce</i>,<i> </i>out of which arose the
application of it to other kinds of <i>excellence</i>,<i> </i>as in the phrase,
<i>virtutes orationis</i>,<i> the ornaments of style</i>.<i> </i>Again, from
denoting <i>manly vigor </i>it came naturally to denote <i>ability; </i>and it
is undoubtedly in this sense, with which our English version accords, that
