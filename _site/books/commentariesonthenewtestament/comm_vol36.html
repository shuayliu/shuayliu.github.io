PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE present COMMENTARY, necessarily partaking of the
character of the Book which it is designed to illustrate, is more historical
than doctrinal; and hence does not contain so much profound theological
discussion as some of Calvin&#8217;s other Commentaries. The leading topic is
the progress of the Gospel under the inspired teachers to whom its first
propagation was entrusted, and, in immediate connection with this, the
Constitution of the Apostolic Church, and the privileges enjoyed by its members.
To this latter point the attention of the religious world is now more especially
directed; and whatever be the views entertained with regard to it by any reader
into whose hands this Commentary may fall, if he feels aright, he will not think
that his study of the controversy is complete until he has made himself
acquainted with what has been said upon it by such a man as
Calvin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A work of talent need not be either the less
interesting or the less instructive that it advocates views at variance with our
own. If our opinions have been deliberately and candidly formed, it is a
satisfactory test of their soundness when they continue unshaken by all that the
ablest opponent can urge against them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Translation appears to be well executed. It is,
perhaps, not so strictly literal as that of the Commentary on the Romans, which
the CALVIN SOCIETY has already published; but any difference, in this respect,
is more than compensated by the general superiority of its style. There are
occasional obscurities or mistranslations which the Editor has endeavored, as in
the Commentary on the Romans, to remove by foot-notes; but, on the whole, it is
believed that the present Translation will not suffer by comparison with that of
any Theological Translation of the same period.</font><br></div>

INCREASE OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS, LONG LIFE, AND HAPPY DAYS.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If that (Right Honorable) I should prefix any long
and tedious preface before this work in commendation of your honor, &#8212; I
should of some be suspected of flattery; if in praise of these learned
Commentaries, &#8212; it should seem a thing superfluous, seeing they
sufficiently commend themselves; if in excuse of those faults which are by me in
translating hereof committed, &#8212; some censuring Cato would condemn me,
because I would take in hand a work so weighty, being not able to be without
fault, and by craving pardon for faults laying open my folly. Omitting,
therefore, those things which might carry with them such inconveniences, I
hasten unto that whereof I am chiefly to speak; namely, to lay open the causes
moving me to dedicate this my simple translation unto your
honor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Your deserts of God&#8217;s church, your singular
zeal, your unfeigned faith, your sincere profession, your especial care to
advance God&#8217;s glory, and to root out Papistry, your faithfulness towards
your prince, have been such, that this realm generally, but my countrymen in the
north parts, my native soil, specially, have, and shall have, great cause to
praise God for you in the day of their visitation, even when it shall please God
of his great mercy to behold them with favor-able countenance, and to take from
them in greater measure that blindness and superstition, wherein they had been
long time nousled, and being fast bred by the bone, is not yet (through want of
means) gotten out of the flesh. Seeing all these virtues are in you to be found;
seeing both this church and country have found you so beneficial, whom ought not
these things to provoke to show all thankfulness towards your honor?
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again, when this history of the Acts of the Apostles
was first penned in Greek by Luke, it was dedicated to noble Theophilus. When M.
Calvin did the second time publish his Commentaries thereupon in Latin, he
presented them unto one who was in mind a noble Theophilus. Lest, therefore,
this work, now published in English, should by dedication be any whit debased, I
have made choice of your honor, being no less a noble Theophilus than those
before mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Another thing, which is not so much a cause as an
encouragement, is that courtesy which your honor showeth to those which present
unto you any exercises of learning, how simple soever they be, whereof I have
had full good experience even in my tender years; namely, at such time as I was
trained up in the city of Carlisle, under that man, in his calling painful, and
to the commonwealth profitable, M. Hayes, whom for that duty which to him I owe
I name. At which time, though those exercises which unto your honor we then
presented were simple, yet were they so courteously of you received, that the
remembrance thereof doth even now encourage me to presume to offer unto you some
weightier matter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The last, but not the least, is, the consideration of
that great and undeserved kindness, which all my friends in general, but
especially my brother, your honor&#8217;s servant, have found at your hands,
which, to rip up at large, would be too tedious. In their behalf, therefore,
Right Honorable, as also in mine own, as a small testimony of a thankful heart,
I present unto your honor this work; simple, if you respect the translation, but
most excellent, if you consider the matter. And thus, humbly craving pardon for
my boldness, and much more humbly beseeching the Lord to bless you in the
reading hereof, I conclude, fearing prolixity. The Lord of heaven bless you, and
grant that: as you have been heretofore a good Theophilus, so you may continue
to the glory of God, the increasing of his Church, and the profit of this
commonwealth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From Maighfield in Sussex, this 12th of October,
1585.</font><br></div>

READER.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THOU hast at length, (Christian reader,) through the
blessing of God, wherewith he hath blessed my labors, those learned Commentaries
of M. Calvin upon the Acts of the Apostles, though simply, yet faithfully,
turned into English; and though of many I was the unmeetest to attempt this
travail, yet such was the earnest request of my godly friends, that unless I
should have taken it in hand, I should have seemed void of courtesy, and also of
care to profit God&#8217;s Church. I will not stand to rip up those commodities
which thou by reading these Commentaries mayest reap, but I leave them to thine
own experience. What my travail hath been in this work, those who have endured
like toll can best judge. And forasmuch as I know well, that after great
painstaking some things have escaped me, I beseech thee, (gentle reader,)
condemn me not rashly, but rather amend them friendly. If thou shalt grow
forward in <i>knowledge </i>by reading this work, then praise God, who hath by
this means made thee profit. God give thee good success in reading, that thereby
thou mayest both be better learned, and also better lived.</font><br></div>

TO BE REVERENCED,</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">JOHN
CALVIN.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">WHEREAS I have made mention of the names of those
kings unto whom I had dedicated these my Commentaries, lest the change incur the
crime of lightness among certain unskillful men, I must briefly render some
reason thereof. For although both the remembrance of the father, who is dead,
doth retain that reverence with me which it deserveth, and I do also, as
becometh me, reverence the son; yet the importunities of certain did enforce me
to put out
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F1</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
their names in this second edition, who, being incensed against me with a
furious hatred and fear, lest the majesty of kings do purchase some favor to my
writings, do boast abroad that they did conceive sore displeasure, that their
name was mixed with the doctrine of the sacraments which they themselves
disallow. I leave it indifferent whether that be true or no, neither do I pass;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F2</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
forasmuch as I did neither hunt after any private gain, nor yet seek to win
favor. But because it seemed to me an indecent and filthy thing to enforce those
books upon men which are unwilling to entertain them, which do find willing
readers enough, it was worth the declaring now, that I never did think any thing
less; but that I did hope for more courtesy than I found. In that truly there
can be no offense, if withdrawing myself from the contempt of those who loathe
my dutifullness, I suffer them to enjoy those delights of theirs which they
desire, and wherein they delight.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Of you, most famous prince, have I made choice, not
without good cause, whom I might put in the place of two; both because I think
you most worthy to have your name appear in the spiritual building of
Christ&#8217;s temple; neither do I fear but that my book shall find the same
friendship at your hands, which you did vouchsafe to declare towards me in your
most gentle letters. But, omitting at this time the respect of private
good-will, I will stay in another thing. Moreover, I may full well apply unto
you that speech which I had before with another. Neither am I determined in this
place to commend those most excellent virtues wherewith you have purchased great
authority and singular favor with the King
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of Polonia; I am rather bent unto an exhortation, the sum whereof shall be this,
that with the like readiness and joyfulness wherewith you have at the beginning
received the pure doctrine of the Gospel, that with the like stoutness of
courage wherewith you have hitherto endeavored to maintain the true worship of
God, you do with the same constancy prosecute this course unto the
end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was surely a point of rare virtue, that whereas
you did know that many did hate nothing more than the frank profession and free
study of godliness, yet, so soon as the truth of the Gospel of Christ did once
shine and appear unto you, you did not fear by giving your name to provoke their
hatred against you. Neither do those offices and good turns deserve small
praise, which you did not cease to bestow upon the cherishing and increasing of
the first beginnings of the Church; although this your diligence did purchase
unto you great envy amongst many noblemen, which did not allow the same. But,
because you have no less hard straits to pass through, you must oftentimes stir
up and encourage yourself to overcome them all, until you have finished the last
act; and, so much the more carefully, because many princes, although they see
the estate of the Church filthily corrupt, yet dare they attempt no remedy;
because that danger which they fear will proceed from innovation, when evils
must be driven out of their old and quiet possession, doth hinder and keep them
back from doing their duty. Other some think it to be an absurd and foolish
thing to touch (or set hand to) diseases which are incurable. Other some (I
cannot tell through what forwardness) do flee from and abhor all manner of
reformation. But to intreat of those lets wherewith you are environed on every
side, it were superfluous, especially seeing you know them well enough. Yet,
howsoever Satan doth assault you, and with what combats soever he doth exercise
you, you cannot, without great wickedness, be weary of this holy warfare, which
you have professed under Christ his banner. Furthermore, although you be forward
enough of yourself, yet I hope it will neither be troublesome, nor yet
unprofitable for you, to have your prosperous course of your earnest study,
holpen and furthered with this help which God doth offer unto your hands by me.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F4</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So often as we see things tossed to and fro, and, as
it were, turned topsy-turvy in the world, there can no more fit and sure prop be
found to establish and stay our weak consciences, than when as setting before
our eyes the kingdom of Christ, as it doth now appear, we consider what hath
been
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F5</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the estate and condition of the same from the beginning. When we speak of the
kingdom of Christ, we must respect two things; the doctrine of the gospel,
whereby Christ doth gather unto himself a church, and whereby he governeth the
same, being gathered together; secondly, ,he society of the godly, who being
coupled together by the sincere faith of the gospel, are truly accounted the
people of God. Both which things, how lively they are expressed by Luke, in the
Acts of the Apostles, it is better to know by the reading of the whole book,
than to believe either my commendation, or the commendation of any man else. For
although the Son of God hath always reigned, even from the first beginning of
the world, yet after that, being revealed in the flesh, he published his gospel,
he began then to erect a more famous tribunal-seat than before, whence he doth
now appear most plainly, and to be also most glorious. If we turn our eyes
hither, they shall be fed, not with a vain picture, (as Virgil saith of his
AEneas) but with the sound knowledge of those things from which we must fetch
life. And to the end I may return unto that whereof I determined to speak, this
is the best refuge for the conscience of men, where they may quietly rest amidst
these troublesome tempests wherewith the world is shaken. Finally, this
meditation alone shall bring to pass, that that shall never befall us, which too
too many experiments do prove to have been truly spoken by Ennius in times past
of the more part of men, that <i>wisdom is driven away so often as the matter is
handled by violence. </i>For if, in the greatest and most vehement heat of
combats, the sweet harmony of instruments was of such force amongst the
Lacedemonians, that it did assuage that furiousness and fierceness which was
engendered in that warlike people, and did temper that violence which doth then
out of measure rage in those natures which are otherwise impatient, how much
more shall the kingdom of Christ do this by the heavenly pleasant tune of the
Holy Ghost, which doth not only tame most cruel beasts, but maketh also lambs of
wolves, lions, and bears; which turneth spears into hooks, and swords into
ploughshares? </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, seeing that, most noble prince, I offer
unto you such kind of temperature as the necessity of times requireth, I hope
that this duty of mine shall not be unwelcome to your highness; so that, indeed,
you shall perceive this kind of confirmation to be very profitable and fit to
look into the beginning of the Church, as it is described of Luke, wherein
appeareth both wonderful power of God under the reproach of the cross, and also
most valiant patience of the servants of God, under the huge burden of troubles,
and the success itself incredible to the judgment of the world, bringeth forth
most plentiful fruit of both. But that I may omit other things which you had
better set [seek] out by reading of Luke himself, I will touch one thing which
is proper to earthly princes, and the chief governors of kingdoms and countries;
to wit, that seeing that (the power of the whole world gainsaying, and all men
which were then in authority being armed to oppress the gospel) a few men,
obscure, unarmed, and contemptible, trusting only to the aid of the truth and
the Spirit, did labor so stoutly in spreading abroad the faith of Christ, did
refuse no pains nor danger, did stand stoutly against all assaults, until at
length they got the victory; there remaineth no excuse for Christian nobles, who
are of any dignity, seeing God hath furnished them with the sword to defend the
kingdom of his Son, unless they be at least as constant and bold to take upon
them such an honorable office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, it is not my part to declare how
faithfully and uprightly I have behaved myself in interpreting this history. I
hope, surely, my labor shall be fruitful to all men. And as for you, most worthy
prince, I must again request and beseech you, that you do both privately addict
yourself wholly unto Christ his government, as you have of late happily begun;
and that you would also become not only a faithful helper, but also a most stout
and valiant standard-bearer in furthering the kingdom of Christ unto so many
noble men, whom not only the renown of their stock and lineage, but also the
excellency of their virtues, doth commend. God hath vouchsafed to bestow upon
the realm of Polonia a singular privilege of honor, that the better part of the
nobility, bidding adieu to wicked superstitions, which are as many corruptions
and pollutions of the worship of God, should desire with one consent a true form
of godliness, and a well framed and reformed order of the Church. It is well
known that these men were not a little aided by your authority. But there remain
more combats both for you and also for them, than that, like overworn
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F6</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
soldiers, you should give yourselves to idleness and rest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, although no foreign enemy trouble you, you
shall have business enough to withstand those evils which are at home with you.
You have sufficiently tried with how many sleights Satan is furnished, that he
may work some policy to overthrow that holy concord amongst brethren, wherein
consisteth the safety of the Church; that befalleth you which is common
everywhere, for troublesome men to thrust in themselves when things are out of
order; who, whilst they see a few, and those weaklings troubled by a great
multitude, and that they do with much ado defend the truth, which is covered
with the thick clouds of false accusations, they do more easily come upon them
unawares
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F7</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And by this subtlety doth that chief worker of all deceit and guile seek the
ruin of the Church, not only by cutting, mangling, and pulling in pieces the
unity of the faith, but by burdening the name of Christ with false envy; because
the companies of the godly, amongst whom these wicked knaves mix themselves,
seem to be certain receptacles and sinks of all filthiness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So, whilst that Stancarus, a man of a troublesome
nature, doth, through that ambition wherewith he is wholly set on fire, spread
abroad amongst you his dotings, hereupon brake out that contention which
threateneth some scattering abroad; and you were laid open unto the slanders of
many, because it was thought that his sect did spread itself farther. Behold, on
the other side, a certain physician, called George Blandrata, worse than
Stancarus, because his error is more detestable, and because he hath in his mind
more secret poison. For which cause these also are the more worthy to be
reproved, at whose hands the ungodliness of Servetus hath found such favor of
such a sudden. For although I am persuaded that they are far from those perverse
and sacrilegious opinions, yet they should have taken better heed, and not have
suffered this fox craftily to creep into their company. Because such plagues
will never be wanting, neither will Satan ever cease to bring abroad into the
forefront such champions as have given over themselves to serve him, that he may
trouble the beginnings of the gospel, it is for you to be continually in a
readiness; and to the end you may prevent greater evils, you must set down right
and godly manner of government, which is the faithful keeping of holy peace. For
as it is manifest that purity of doctrine is the soul of the Church, so we may
full well compare discipline unto the sinews, wherewith the body being bound and
knit together, doth maintain his [its] strength.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, on the other side, the ungodliness of other
enemies ought to sharpen your study (and earnestness,) I mean the preachers of
Antichrist of Rome, who, to the end they may deceive the ignorant, do
continually, with shrill voice, sound out the name of the Church. There is no
controversy amongst us about the Church, but all grant that the authority
thereof ought to be reverenced of all the children of God; save only that they,
under false color of honor, do make the shadowish name of the Church subject to
their lusts; we do so reverence the Church from our heart, that we account it
great wickedness to profane the sacred name thereof. That I may omit other godly
ministers of pure and sound doctrine, I myself have again and again heretofore
in many places handled this question. When mention is made of the Church, whose
head is the Son of God, and which he, who is the fountain of life eternal, doth
always quicken by his Spirit, how ridiculous a thing it is to bring forth a body
without a head, and, secondly, a dead carcass.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The hireling flatterers of the Pope do cry out that
they have the Church; but we can know by no means better, whether this be true
or no, than when we look unto the head. As for that, it is manifest that it is
cut off by their sacrilegious violence. For how shall Christ retain the place of
the head, being despoiled of all his power, thrown down from his government,
deprived of his dignity? Upon this condition hath the heavenly Father made him
the head of the Church, that he may govern all men from the greatest to the
least, by the doctrine of his gospel; that he may be the only priest to
reconcile the Father continually, as he hath once appeased his wrath by the
sacrifice of his death; that his death may continually purge our sins; that his
blood may be the only washing; that his obedience may be a perfect satisfaction;
that he may be a (continual and) sole intercessor, through whose means our
prayers may be heard; that he may be a faithful defender and tutor, that he may,
by his aid, defend us; that (the vices of our flesh being tamed) he may reform
us unto righteousness and holiness; that he alone may begin and finish in us a
blessed life. If the Papists have left him any of these things, let them have
the Church on their side. But if the Pope, oppressing men&#8217;s consciences
with his fierce and more cruel tyranny, have disannulled and taken away Christ
his government; if he have brought in a form of government altogether contrary
to the gospel; if he have invented a new and strange priesthood, that he may
thrust-in himself, being but a mortal man, to be the mediator between God and
the world; if he have forged daily sacrifices, that he may trot them in
Christ&#8217;s place; if he have invented a thousand satisfactions for sins; if
he have brought reigned washings from the lake of hell, to make dry the blood of
the Son of God; if he have put in his place infinite patrons; if he have torn in
a thousand pieces that righteousness which must be set [sought] wholly from him;
if, instead of the Holy Ghost, he have erected man&#8217;s free-will; it is,
without all question, that the true Christ is banished far from Papistry. For
this cause have I said that the Papists make boast of a dead carcass instead of
the lively body of Christ, because, though they have extinguished the doctrine
of the gospel, (which is the true soul of the Church, and which duly doth
quicken the same,) yet they do greatly boast of a shadowish and trifling kind of
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We make it full well known how corrupt the purity of
doctrine is amongst them, yea, with what monstrous errors it is polluted. They
do not only cover all their corruptions under the shadow of the Church, but also
complain that we do great injury to the Church, because we say that the same
doth err. But they should first have examined the doctrine, that the Church
might thereby be known. These just and honest judges will have the reigned title
of doctrine to have sufficient force of prejudice to cover and suppress the
difference, and that not to deceive men. For with what sleights and legerdemain
would they assay to blear even dazzling eyes in so great light? But because they
account this liberty of lying a part of their tyranny, they think they reign not
as they would, unless they reproachfully mock miserable souls.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That we may set an example no farther, we have seen
in our times, sometimes the Tridentine Fathers, sometimes the Fathers of
Bononia, who, although they were even at daggers drawing among themselves, yet
did they foam out their vain canons on both sides. And surely if men assent to
their principles, the triumph shall be prepared on both sides. There sit there I
cannot tell how many bishops and abbots, peradventure an hundred horned beasts.
If the most fine flower of all the nation should shine there, yet should it be
nothing else but a wicked conspiracy against God. And now after that the Pope
hath gathered together the bran and chips of his unclean and filthy rotten
flock, shall the representative Church suddenly appear there? And are they not
yet ashamed to call that an holy, general, and lawful Council, which doth not
deserve so much as to be called a vain and comical visor of a Council? But as
for us, to whom the promise is made, that Antichrist, who sitteth in the temple
of God, shall be destroyed with the breath of the Lord&#8217;s mouth; let not us
(I say) cease to refute this filthy and whorish impudency, with that most sacred
word which they so boldly mock, that all men may see what difference there is
between the chaste spouse of Christ and the stinking whore of Belial; between
the sanctuary of God and the brothel-house of Satan; between the spiritual house
of the godly and the stye of hogs; and, finally, between the true Church and the
court of Rome. There can no more certain or plain demonstration be brought
concerning this matter either by Euclid, either yet by Archimedes, than if the
Church, as Luke describeth it, be compared with the Popish synagogue. Neither am
I so strait that I would have that confused lump, being altogether repugnant
unto the order of nature and manner of humanity, to be agreeable in all points
to the rule of the Apostles, which is angelical and heavenly. If they can show
any thing wherein they are like unto them,

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>UPON</b></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE ACTS OF THE
APOSTLES.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the intent that all godly men may, with more
diligence, read this history, and also be more desirous thereof, it shall not be
without profit briefly to note what commodity they shall reap
thereby.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the chiefest praise that a profane history
hath, namely, that it is the mistress of life. If that narration of famous
deeds, which only teacheth men what they ought to follow, or what they ought to
eschew, in their common actions, deserve such a title, of how great praise are
the divine histories worthy, which do not only frame the outward life of man
that he may win praise by virtue, but also (which is more) which declare unto us
that God, from the beginning, hath had a special regard always of his Church,
(and faithful congregation,) that he hath been always a most just revenger of
all wrongs done unto those that have betaken themselves unto his tuition, and
have committed themselves unto his custody; that he hath showed himself
favorable and merciful unto most miserable and wretched sinners; and, lastly, by
teaching us faith, raised us high above the heavens. I say nothing of this, that
they do everywhere set forth the providence of God, that they distinguish the
true worship of God from the false, and never err in the difference of vice and
virtue; although I omit now also those worthy praises which used most commonly
to be attributed unto the sacred histories, intending only shortly to touch
those which are proper to this book which we have taken in
hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Those things which Luke setteth before us in this
place to be learned are not only great, but also of rare profit; for, first, in
that he showeth that the Spirit of God was sent unto the apostles, he doth not
only prove that Christ was faithful (and true) in keeping his promise made unto
his apostles; but also he certifieth us, that he is always mindful of his, and a
perpetual governor of his Church, because the Holy Spirit did descend from
heaven to this end; whereby we learn that the distance of place doth no whit
hinder Christ from being present with those that be his at all times. Now, here
is most lively painted out the beginning of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, and as it
were the renewing of the world; for although the Son of God had gathered
together, by his preaching, a certain Church, before such time as he departed
out of the world, yet, nevertheless, that was the best form of the Church which
began then, when as the apostles, having new power given them from above, began
to preach that that only Shepherd did both die and also rise again, that through
his conduct all those which were dispersed, far and wide, (upon the face of the
whole earth,) might be gathered unto one sheepfold. Here is, therefore, set down
both the beginning and also the increasing of the Church of Christ after his
ascension, whereby he was declared to be King both of heaven and
earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, therein appeareth, as well the marvelous
power of Christ, as the great force and efficacy of the gospel itself; for in
that Christ, by a sort of simple souls, (and of no reputation amongst men,)
being indued also with no eloquence at all, hath subdued the whole world so
easily, by the only voice of the gospel, whereas, notwithstanding Satan did
resist him with so many lets, he hath showed a most manifest token of his divine
power and might therein. And also, we see in the same the incredible force of
the gospel, that it did not only come forth and show itself, although the whole
world did say nay, but also with great glory and majesty, make all that which
did seem stubborn to be obedient unto Christ. Therefore, these few and simple
creatures did more prevail against the troublesome tumults of the world, with
the base and simple sound of their mouth, than if God should openly have thrown
down lightnings
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F12</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from heaven. And, on the other side, the Spirit of God teacheth us, that the
kingdom of Christ beginneth never sooner to flourish, but by and by Satan
opposeth himself most furiously against the same, and useth all his engines
either utterly to overthrow or sore to shake the <i>same. </i>Neither are we
only taught, that Satan doth resist Christ as an enemy, but also that the whole
world doth furiously rage together against him, that he may not reign over them.
Yea, furthermore, that is to be set down as a thing most certain, that wicked
men, whilst they do so rage against the gospel, do both fight under
Satan&#8217;s banner, and are pricked forward by him into so blind fury.
Hereupon do arise so many uproars, so many plaguy conspiracies, so many devilish
endeavors of the reprobate to overthrow the gospel, (and to hinder the free
passage of the same,) which Luke setteth down almost in every
place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lastly, like as the apostles have indeed tried,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F13</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that the doctrine of the gospel is a fire and a sword, so may we learn by their
experience that it will always come to pass, not only by the obstinate malice of
Satan, but also by the fatal stubbornness of men, that the gospel shall suffer
many conflicts, and that thereby many tumults shall be raised. But, on the other
side, he declareth that the apostles, (with a stout stomach,) with a lively
courage and invincible violentness [force] of mind, did, notwithstanding,
execute the office which they knew was enjoined them by God; and also, what
innumerable troubles they suffered with great perseverance, what wearisomeness
they passed over, how patiently they sustained most cruel persecution; and,
lastly, how meekly they suffered reproach, sorrow, and calamity of all sorts.
And we must learn patience by such examples, seeing the Son of God hath
pronounced that the cross and tribulation shall always accompany his gospel; we
must not pamper and cherish ourselves with a vain hope, as though the state and
condition of the Church should be quiet (prosperous) and flourishing here upon
earth. Let us, therefore, address ourselves to suffer the like things. And that
is added as no small comfort for us, that as God hath marvelously delivered his
Church in times past, being afflicted and oppressed so many ways, so he will at
this day be present with us also. For, surely, seeing that in this book is
declared how that God, by his mighty hand and outstretched arm alone, doth
continually defend his Church, being amidst continual deaths: God himself, by
this means, setteth before our eyes his continual providence in procuring the
safety thereof.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, here are set down certain sermons of the
apostles which intreat in such sort of the great mercies of God, of the grace of
Christ, of the hope of blessed immortality, of the calling upon God, of
repentance and the fear of God, and also of other principal points of Christian
doctrine, that we need not seek the whole sum of godliness anywhere else.: But
that I may now omit the declaration of sound and pure doctrine, &#8212; if that
be a thing most needful to be known, namely, to understand how the Church of
Christ first began; how the apostles began to preach the gospel; what success
they had in the same; what cruel combats they suffered; how manfully they passed
through so many lets and impediments; how courageously they triumphed over all
the pride of the world under the reproach of the cross; how wonderfully God was
present with them: then must we highly esteem of this book, which, unless it
were extant, the knowledge of so great things should either be quite buried, or
greatly obscured, or wrapped in divers doubts. For we see that Satan used all
his engines, that he might so bring to pass, that never any of the acts of the
apostles might come to light, but such only as were mixed with lies; to the end
he might bring into suspicion what thing soever was spoken of them, and so by
that means might pluck out of the minds of the godly all the remembrance of that
age. For he always raised up, either doting fools or crafty flouters,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F14</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they might spread abroad a sort of filthy fables under the names of other
men; the blockishness whereof did much discredit even the true
histories.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So in those books of Peter and Paul, which are
reigned to be of Linus his doing, are contained such a sort of stinking trifles,
that they cause the wicked to laugh at them, and the godly to loathe them. So
that reigned disputation of Peter with Simon Magus is so ridiculous, that it
doth discredit the name of a Christian. The same opinion must we have of all
that mingle-mangle, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F15</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which is set before the Recognitions and Councils of Clement, and recited of
Gratianus in his Fragments. They beguile the unskillful under color of ancient
names; the wicked boast of those as of oracles, no less boldly than impudently,
when as, indeed, they are filthy toys. Satan did use such liberty to lie, that
we might have no certain thing left us after Christ&#8217;s ascension. So that
unless this work
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F16</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of Luke were extant, it might seem that Christ being taken up into heaven, left
no fruit of his death or resurrection upon earth. For all should have vanished
away with his body. We should not know that Christ was so received into his
celestial glory, that, nevertheless, he beareth rule in all the world; we should
not know that the gospel was published by the apostles, and so came from them
unto us, though by the means of others; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F17</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
we should not know that they were inspired by the Holy Ghost, lest they should
teach anything but that which was divine, to the end our faith might be grounded
only upon the infallible verity of God. Last of all, we should not know that
that prophecy of Esaias was fulfilled, wherein he foretold that the law should
come out of Sion, and the Word of the Lord out of Jerusalem.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Seeing this book proceeding, no doubt, from the
Spirit of God, taketh from us all doubting of these things, we must count the
same as a great treasure, as I have said before not without cause, and now again
confirm the same.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THAT he may pass over unto those things which
followed the ascension of Christ, he briefly gathereth the sum of all those
which before he had handled in the former book, that he may annex this
thereunto. And he briefly setteth down this description of the history of the
gospel, that it is a narration of those things which Christ did and said so long
as he was conversant upon earth. Furthermore, whereas they interpret this
commonly, that there was first in Christ purity of life, before such time as he
began to preach, it maketh nothing unto Luke&#8217;s mind. Truth it is, that the
manners of a good and godly teacher ought so to be framed, that he speak first
with his life, then with his tongue, otherwise he should differ nothing from a
stage-player. But Luke hath respect rather unto that which he had said about the
end of his gospel,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422419&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
24:19,) namely, that Christ was a prophet mighty in deed and word, that is, such
a one as did excel no less in deeds than in words; although there be but small
difference betwixt these two places. For the mightiness of works which is
commended there doth belong unto his miracles, but this, <i>to do, </i>doth
reach further in my opinion, namely, that under the same are comprehended all
the famous acts which were proper unto his ministry, wherein his death and
resurrection are the chiefest. For the office of the Messias did not only
consist in doctrine, but it was also behoveful that he should make peace between
God and man, that he should be a Redeemer of the people, a restorer of the
kingdom, and an author of everlasting felicity. All these things, I say, as they
were promised of the Messias, so were they looked for at his
hands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we see that the sum of the gospel consisteth of
these two parts, namely, of the doctrine of Christ, and of his acts; forasmuch
as he did not only bring unto men that embassage which was given him in charge
of his Father, but also performed all things that could be required of the
Messias. He began his kingdom, he pacified God with his sacrifice, he purged
man&#8217;s sins with his own precious blood, he subdued death and the devil, he
restored us unto true liberty, he purchased righteousness and life for us. And
to the end that whatsoever he either did or said might be certain, he proved
himself by miracles to be the Son of God. So that this word, <i>to do, </i>is
extended unto his miracles also; but it must not be restrained only unto the
same. Here must we note, that those which have only the bare knowledge of the
history have not the gospel; unless the knowledge of the doctrine which maketh
manifest the fruits of the acts of Christ be adjoined thereunto. For this is a
holy knot which no man may dissolve. Therefore, whensoever mention is made of
the doctrine of Christ, let us learn to adjoin thereunto his works, as seals
whereby the truth thereof is established and confirmed, and the effect declared.
Furthermore, that we may reap commodity by his death and resurrection, and also
that miracles may have their use, we must always have respect unto him that
speaketh. For this is the true rule of Christianity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of all things which he
began</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I do not greatly mislike the
interpretation which some give of this place that Luke said rather of <i>all
</i>than <i>all; </i>because it is possible in some measure to intreat of the
works and doctrine of Christ, but to set down the whole course, that the
narration may be perfect, were a matter of great
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F18</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
weight. Like as John doth declare that the world could not contain the books,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;432125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
21:25.) That is also to be noted that Luke saith, that he began his history at
the beginning of the works of Christ. But so soon as he hath declared the
nativity of Christ, he passeth over unto the twelfth year of his age
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420242&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
2:42;) and after he had briefly spoken of his disputation had in the temple with
the doctors, passing over eighteen years without speaking any thing of them, he
entereth [on] the just narration of the works of Christ. It is, therefore,
manifest that those works and sayings only which make any thing unto the sum of
our salvation are noted in this place. For, after that Christ came abroad into
the world clothed with our flesh, he lived privately at home until he was thirty
years of age, at which time his Father put upon him another manner of person.
God would have him to lead the former part of his life obscurely, to this end,
that the knowledge of these things might be more excellent which do edify our
faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The former
speech.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It seemed good to me to
translate this on this wise, because
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">logon
poieisqa&lt;i</font><font face="Palatino">, is the same with the Grecians, which
<i>verba facere, </i>or to speak, is with the Latins, as Budaeus doth note. And
we must understand the contrariety of the second part, which he taketh in hand,
that we may know that the evangelist determined with himself afresh to write,
having new matter whereupon to write.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><b><i>.</i></b><i>
Even until that day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Therefore, the
ascension of Christ is the end of the history of the gospel. For he hath
ascended, saith Paul, that he might fulfill all things,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:10.) Our faith gathereth other fruit thereby; but it shall be sufficient to
note in this place, that our redemption was fully complete and finished then
when Christ did ascend unto his Father; and, therefore, that Luke did fully
perform his duty in this narration, as touching the doctrine and works of
Christ. And he is said to be taken up, that we may know that he is truly
departed out of this world, lest we should consent unto their dotings who think
that in his ascension there was no alteration of place made.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Commandment by the Holy
Ghost</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Luke showeth in these words, that
Christ did not so depart out of the world that he did no longer care for us; for
in that he hath ordained a perpetual government in his Church, he thereby
declareth that he had a care to provide for our salvation; yea, he hath promised
that he will be present with his to the end,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402820&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
28:20,) like as, indeed, he is always present by his ministers. Luke, therefore,
doth show unto us, that Christ did no sooner depart hence, but straightway he
provided for the government of his Church; whence we may gather that he is
careful for our salvation. And this his providence hath Paul plainly noted in
the place lately cited, when he saith, That he hath fulfilled all things, making
some apostles, some evangelists, some pastors, etc. But these commandments,
which the evangelist saith Christ gave unto his disciples, do I interpret of the
preaching of the gospel; like as ambassadors use to be instructed with certain
precepts before they go of their embassage, lest they should rashly attempt any
thing contrary to his will and mind that sendeth them. And all this is spoken in
commendation of that doctrine which the apostles taught. The which that it may
appear more manifestly, every thing is to be marked in order as it lieth. First
of all, he saith they were elect and chosen of Christ, that we may be certain of
their calling unto that function. Neither doth he in this place set God&#8217;s
election against man&#8217;s merits, but only affirmeth that they were raised up
by God, and that they did not rashly take upon them this function. That is true,
indeed, that they were freely chosen; but now have we to inquire what is
Luke&#8217;s drift in this place. I say that he hath respect unto nothing else,
but that we may be certain of the calling of the apostles, that we may learn not
to have respect unto men, but unto the Son of God, the author thereof, because
this must always be a maxim in the Church, that no man usurp any honor.
Secondly, he saith, that they were instructed of Christ what they should do. As
if he should say, that they uttered not their own inventions, but they delivered
that sincerely and faithfully which was enjoined them by their heavenly Master.
And to the end that that which Christ taught them might be the more reverenced,
he addeth this, that this was done by the direction of the Holy Ghost. Not
because the Son of God had any need to be guided by any other, who is eternal
wisdom, but because he was also man, lest any man should think that he did
deliver those things unto his disciples which he delivered by man&#8217;s wit
and reason, he calleth us back expressly unto the divine authority. Like as the
Lord himself doth so often affirm, that he taught nothing but that which he had
received of his Father; and therefore he saith, that his doctrine was not his
own. Therefore, he signifieth that in the preaching of the gospel there is
nothing which issueth from man&#8217;s brain, but that it is the divine
ordinance of the Spirit, whereunto the whole world must be
subject.</font><br></div>

the resurrection to be believed, as a thing most necessary to be known, and
without the which the whole gospel falleth fiat to the ground, neither remaineth
there any more faith. And that I may omit to speak of other discommodities that
come by being ignorant of the resurrection of Christ, the gospel loseth his
whole authority, unless we know and be also fully persuaded that Christ being
alive, speaketh unto us from the heavens. Whereunto Luke hath chiefest respect
in this place. Therefore, that the truth hereof might not be called in question,
he saith that it was proved by many signs and tokens. Those which Erasmus,
following an old interpreter, doth call arguments, I have translated proofs. For
Aristotle doth call that
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tekmhrion</font><font face="Palatino">,
in the first book of his <i>Rhetorics, </i>which is necessary in signs. This is,
therefore, that which I said before, that Christ did make manifest his
resurrection unto his apostles by evident tokens, which did serve instead of
necessary proofs, lest they should doubt of the same. Furthermore, he doth not
reckon up those tokens and signs, saving only that he saith, that Christ did
appear unto them about the space of a month and one-half oftentimes. If he had
but once appeared unto them, it might have been somewhat suspicious, but in
showing himself so often unto them, he dissolveth all doubts which might arise
in their minds, and by this means, also, he putteth away the reproach of the
ignorance which he said was in the apostles, lest it discredit their
preaching.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He intreateth of the kingdom of

before such time as they took upon them to teach others; therefore, whatsoever
things they uttered and brought to light, either by word or by writing, touching
the kingdom of God, they are those speeches which Christ himself uttered. And
hereby doth he briefly set down the end of the doctrine of the gospel; namely,
that God may reign in us. Regeneration is the beginning of this kingdom, and the
end thereof is blessed immortality; the middle proceedings are in a more ample
going forward and increase of regeneration. But that this thing may appear more
evidently, we must first note, that we are born, and that we live aliens and
strangers from the kingdom of God, until such time as God doth fashion us again
unto a new life. Therefore, we may properly set the world, the flesh, and
whatsoever is in man&#8217;s nature against the kingdom of God, as contrary to
it. For the natural man is wholly occupied about the things of this world, and

in the mean season, we are as it were banished from God, and he likewise from
us; but Christ, by the preaching of the gospel, doth lift us up unto the
meditation of the life to come. And to the end he may the better bring this to
pass, he reformeth all our earthly affections, and so having striped us out of
the vices of our flesh, he separateth us from the world. And, like as eternal
death is prepared for all those which live after the flesh, so in as much as the
inward man is renewed in us, that we may go forward in the spiritual life, we
draw nearer unto the perfection of the kingdom of God; which is the society of
the glory of God. Therefore, God will reign in and amongst us now, that he may
at length make us partakers of his kingdom. Hereby we gather that Christ did
principally intreat of the corruption of mankind; of the tyranny of sin, whose
bond-slaves we are; of the curse and guiltiness of eternal death, whereunto we
all are subject, and also of the means to obtain salvation; of the remission of
sins; of the denying of the flesh; of spiritual righteousness; of hope of
eternal life, and of like such things. And if we will be rightly instructed in
Christianity, we must apply our studies to these things.</font><br></div>

Gathering them together, he commanded, etc</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>They had before done the duty of Apostles; but that lasted but a while; and,
secondly, so far forth that they might with their preaching awake the Jews to
hear their Master. And so that commandment to teach, which Christ had given
them,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:7,) whilst he lived with them upon earth, was, as it were, a certain entrance
into their apostleship which was to come, for which they were not yet ripe.
Therefore, their ordinary function was not laid upon them, until such time as
Christ was risen again; but they stirred up their nation (as I have said) like
criers, that they might give ear to Christ. And then at length, after the
resurrection, they were made Apostles, to publish abroad throughout the whole
world that doctrine which was committed to them. And whereas after they were
made Apostles, Christ commandeth them as yet to abstain from their office, that
is done not without just cause; yea, many causes may be alleged why it should be
so. That filthy forsaking of their Master was yet fresh; many notes and tokens
of unbelief were yet fresh. Whereas, they had been so thoroughly taught, and had
so suddenly forgotten all, they showed a manifest token of their great dullness
of wit. Neither were they free from sluggishness, which could not otherwise
fitly be purged, than by deferring the promised grace, that he might the more
sharpen their desire. But this cause is chiefly to be noted, that the Lord did
appoint a certain time for the sending of the Spirit, that the miracle might be
the more apparent. Again, he suffered them to rest a while, that he might the
better set forth the greatness of that business which he was about to commit
unto them. And thereby is the truth of the gospel confirmed, because the
Apostles were forbidden to address themselves to preach the same, until they
should be well prepared in succession of time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And they were commanded to stay together, because
they should all have one spirit given them. If they had been dispersed, the
unity should not have been so well known. Though they were scattered abroad
afterwards in divers places, yet because they brought that which they had from
one and the same fountain, it was all one, as if they always had had all one
mouth. Furthermore, it was expedient that they should begin to preach the gospel
at Jerusalem, that the prophecy might be fulfilled,</font><br></div>

be accustomed to obey first, who should shortly after lay Christ&#8217;s yoke
upon the neck of the world. And surely they have taught us by their example,
that we must work and rest at the Lord&#8217;s pleasure alone. For if, during
our life, we go on warfare under his banner and conduct, surely he ought to have
no less authority over us than any earthly captain hath in his army. Therefore,
as warlike discipline requireth this, that no man wage unless he be commanded by
the captain, so it is not lawful for us either to go out, or to attempt any
thing, until the Lord give the watchword; and so soon as he bloweth the retreat,
we must stay, [halt.] Moreover, we are taught that we are made partakers of the
gifts of God through hope. But we must mark the nature of hope as it is
described in this place. For that is not hope which every man feigneth to
himself unadvisedly, but that which is grounded on the promise of God. Therefore
Christ cloth not suffer his apostles to look for whatsoever they will, but he
addeth expressly the promise of the Father. Furthermore, he maketh himself a
witness thereof; because we ought to be so sure and certain, that although all
the engines of hell gainstand us, yet this may remain surely fixed in our minds,
that we have believed God. I know, saith Paul, whom I have believed,

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because John
truly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Christ repeateth this unto his
apostles out of John&#8217;s own words. For some part of them had heard that at
John&#8217;s mouth, which the Evangelists report, &#8220;I truly baptize you
with water, but he that cometh after me shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost,
and with fire.&#8221; Now Christ pronounceth that they shall well perceive that
that is true indeed which he said. Furthermore, this serveth greatly to confirm
the sentence next going before, for it is an argument drawn from the office of
Christ. And that thus: John was sent to baptize with water, he fulfilled his
function as it became the servant of God. The Son of God is sent to baptize with
the Holy Ghost; it remained, therefore, that he do his duty. Neither can it be
otherwise but he must do that which his Father hath commanded him to do, and for
which also he came down into the earth. But it seemeth a very absurd thing to
restrain that unto the visible sending of the Holy Ghost, which was spoken
universally of regeneration.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F21</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I answer, that Christ did not then only baptize with the Holy Ghost, when as he
sent him under the form of fiery tongues; for he had baptized his apostles
before this; and he baptizeth all the elect thus daily. But because the sending
of the Holy Ghost after so glorious a sort was a token of the hidden grace
wherewith he doth daily inspire his elect, he doth fitly apply thereunto the
testimony of John. And truly this was as though it had been the common baptism
of the Church. For besides that the apostles did not receive the Spirit for
themselves only, but for the use of all the faithful, there was also declared
the universal favor of Christ towards his Church, while that he poured out
thereupon the gifts of his Spirit in great abundance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Although, therefore, he doth daily baptize the elect
of his Father, yet was this no let why he might not show forth this token to be
remembered above all others, that the apostles might know that they were only
entered by John; and that not in vain, seeing their perfection was hard at hand.
And that is frivolous which some gather out of this place most commonly,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F22</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
namely, that the baptism of John and the baptism of Christ were diverse. For
here doth not he dispute in this place of baptism, but maketh only a comparison
betwixt the person of John and the person of Christ. When as John did say that
he did baptize with water only, he did not reason of what sort his baptism was;
but what he himself was; lest he should arrogate that unto himself which was
proper to Christ. As also, the ministers in these days ought not to speak
otherwise of themselves; but they must acknowledge Christ to be the author of
all those things which they do prefigure in the outward baptism, and leave
nothing to themselves save only the outward administration. For when as these
titles are attributed unto baptism, namely, that it is the laver of
regeneration,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;560305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
3:5,) a washing away of sins, the fellowship of death, and burying with Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:4,) and a grafting into the body of Christ, it is not declared what man, being
the minister of the outward sign, doth; but rather what Christ doth, who only
giveth force and efficacy unto the signs. We must always hold fast this
distinction, lest, whilst we deck man too much, we take from Christ.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F23</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here may a question be moved, why he doth rather
name John here than any other; first, It is manifest enough that John did
profess himself to be the minister of the outward sign, namely, of water, and
that Christ was the author of the spiritual baptism; secondly, Because it was
meet that John should decrease and Christ increase; and, thirdly, Because the
apostles did so much esteem of John,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430330&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:30,) it might have been that thereby the glory of Christ might have been
obscured. Therefore, Christ, to the end he might reclaim them to himself,
telleth them that John did only minister unto them the external baptism;
notwithstanding, he confirmeth them also, lest they should doubt of the promise;
for they did attribute very much unto John, and therefore were they persuaded
that the baptism which they had received by him was not in vain. Now, if that
the verity and force thereof must be looked for at Christ&#8217;s hands, then
ought the apostles to hope that that shall surely be fulfilled which John
prefigured.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So must we, in like manner, think that we are not in
vain baptized with water by men, because Christ, who commanded the same to be
done, will fulfill his office, and baptize us with the Spirit. So faith draweth
a consequent from the outward sign unto the inward effect; yet doth it not
attribute any more than is meet, either to the sign or to the minister thereof,
because in the sign it only looketh unto the promise, which is Christ&#8217;s,
and doth acknowledge him to be the only author of grace. Let us, therefore, use
such a mean that we do in no part diminish Christ&#8217;s honor; and yet,
nevertheless, let us hope for that fruit by our baptism which is noted in this
place. By assigning so short a time our Savior maketh them more joyful to hope
well. Whereupon it followeth, that that death was not to be lamented which
brought with it presently so precious fruit. And let us note this also, that
this word baptism is used improperly in this place, that the contrariety may be
full. After the same sort, Paul, in his Epistle unto the Romans,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450326&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:26,) after he hath set down the law of works, to the end that the contrary may
answer on the other side, he useth the law of faith for faith
itself.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b> He showeth that the apostles were gathered
together when as this question was moved, that we may know that it came not of
the foolishness of one or two that it was moved, but it was moved by the common
consent of them all; but marvelous is their rudeness, that when as they had been
diligently instructed by the space of three whole years, they betray no less
ignorance than if they had heard never a word. There are as many errors in this
question as words. They ask him as concerning a kingdom; but they dream of an
earthly kingdom, which should flow with riches, with dainties, with external
peace, and with such like good things; and while they assign the present time to
the restoring of the same. they desire to triumph before the battle; for before
such time as they begin to work they will have their wages. They are also
greatly deceived herein, in that they restrain Christ&#8217;s kingdom unto the
carnal Israel, which was to be spread abroad, even unto the uttermost parts of
the world. Furthermore, there is this fault in all their whole question, namely,
that they desire to know those things which are not meet for them to know. No
doubt they were not ignorant what the prophets did prophesy concerning the
restoring of David&#8217;s kingdom, they had oftentimes heard their Master
preach concerning this matter. Lastly, It was a saying common in every
man&#8217;s mouth, that, in the most miserable captivity of the people, they
should all be comforted, with the expectation of the kingdom that should be.
Now, they hoped for the restoring hereof at the coming of the Messias, and
hereupon was it that so soon as the apostles saw their Master Christ risen from
the dead, they straightway began to think thereupon; but, in the meantime, they
declared thereby how bad scholars they were under so good a Master. Therefore
doth Christ briefly comprehend
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F24</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in this short answer all the errors whereinto they fell in this their question,
as I shall straightway declare. To restore, in this place, doth signify to set
up again that which was fallen, and through many ruins grown out of fashion; for
out of the dry stock of Isai [Jesse] should spring a Branch, and the tabernacle
of David, which was laid waste,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F25</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
should be erected and set on foot again.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
It is not for you to know, etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is
a general reprehension of the whole question. For it was too curious for them to
desire to know that whereof their Master would have them ignorant; but this is
the true means to become wise, namely, to go as far forward in learning as our
Master Christ goeth in teaching, anal willingly to be ignorant of those things
which he doth conceal from us. But forasmuch as there is naturally engendered in
us a certain foolish and vain curiosity, and also a certain rash kind of
boldness, we must diligently observe this admonition of Christ, whereby he
correcteth both these vices. But to the end we may know what his meaning is
hereby, we must mark the two members which he joineth together. &#8220;It is not
for you&#8221; (saith he) &#8220;to know those things which the Father hath
placed in his own power.&#8221; He speaketh, indeed, of the times and seasons;
but seeing there is the like reason in other things, we must think this to be a
universal precept, That being contented with the revelation of God, we think it
an heinous crime to inquire any further. This is the true mean between the two
extremes. The Papists, that they may have somewhat wherewith to cloak their
gross ignorance, say for themselves, that they omit the hidden mysteries of God,
as though our whole faith and religion did consist upon any thing else than upon
the hidden mysteries of God; then may we take our leave of Christ and his
gospel, if we must abstain utterly from the hidden mysteries of God. But we must
keep, as I said before a mean herein; for we must be desirous to learn so far as
our heavenly Master doth teach us; but as for such things as he will have us
ignorant of, let mine be so bold as to inquire after them that we may be wise
with sobriety. Therefore, so often as we are vexed with this foolish desire of
knowing more than we ought, let us call to mind this saying of Christ, &#8220;It
is not for you to know.&#8221; For unless we will burst in against his will and
commandment, this shall have force and strength enough to restrain the
outrageousness of our wits.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, as touching the foreknowledge of times, Christ
condemneth only the searching out thereof which reacheth beyond the measure of
God&#8217;s revelation; and that is to be noted out of the second member, as
before I have said, &#8220;which the Father hath placed in his own power.&#8221;
Truth it is, that God hath in his own power winter and summer, and the rest of
the seasons of the year, cold and heat, fair weather and foul. But because he
hath testified that the course of the years shall be perpetual,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
1:41,) he is said not to have placed that in his own power which he hath
revealed unto men. What thing soever the philosophers or husbandmen do
comprehend or understand by art, by learning, by judgment, or experience, all
that doth God not retain unto himself, because he hath after a certain sort
revealed it unto them,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
8:22.) The same opinion must we have of the prophets; for it was their office to
know those things which God did reveal. But we must be ignorant of the secret
events of things, as touching the time to come; for there is nothing which may
make us more slack in doing our duties, than too careful an inquisition herein,
for we will always take counsel according to the future event of things; but the
Lord, by hiding the same from us, doth prescribe unto us what we ought to do.
Here ariseth a conflict, because we will not willingly suffer God to have that
which is his own, namely, the sole government and direction of things which are
to come; but we cast ourselves into a strange and inordinate carefulness. To
conclude, Christ forbiddeth us to apply those things unto ourselves, which God
doth challenge as proper to himself alone. Of this sort is the foreknowledge of
those things which God hath taken to himself to govern and direct, according to
his own pleasure, far contrary to our opinion, and otherwise than we could
invent.

well unto the promise of God as also unto his commandment, which was the
readiest way to bridle their curiosity. Curiosity doth rise almost always either
of idleness or else of distrust; distrust is cured by meditating upon the
promises of God. And his commandments do tell us how we ought to occupy
ourselves and employ our studies. Therefore, he commandeth his disciples to wait
for the promise of God, and to be diligent in executing their office whereunto
God had called them. And in the mean season he noteth
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F27</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
their great hastiness, in that they did preposterously catch at those gifts
which were proper unto the Holy Spirit, when as they were not as yet endued with
the same. Neither did they take the right way herein, in that being called to go

of their imbecility, lest they follow before the time those things whereunto
they cannot attain. It may be read very well either way, You shall receive the
power of the Spirit; or, The Spirit coming upon you; yet the latter way seemeth
to be the better, because it doth more fully declare their defect trod want,

theirs in this one sentence. For, first, he showeth that they must fight before
they can triumph; and, secondly, that the nature of Christ&#8217;s kingdom was
of another sort than they judged it to have been. Therefore, saith he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>You shall be my
witnesses;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, the husbandman must
first work before he can reap his fruits. Hence, nay we learn that we must first
study how we may come unto the kingdom of God, before we begin to dispute
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F29</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
about the state of the life to come. Many there be which do curiously inquire
what manner [of] blessedness that shall be which they shall enjoy after they
shall be received into the everlasting kingdom of heaven, not having any care
how they may come to enjoy the same. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F30</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
They reason concerning the quality of the life to come, which they shall have

they may live together with him,

in our vocation, and God will give fruit in due time (and tide.) There followeth
another correction, when he saith, that they must be his <i>witnesses. </i>For
hereby he meant to drive out of his disciples&#8217; minds that fond and false
imagination which they had conceived of the terrestrial kingdom, because he
showeth unto them briefly, that his kingdom consisteth in the preaching of the
gospel. There was no cause, therefore, why they should dream of riches, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F32</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of external principality, or any other earthly thing, whilst they heard that
Christ did then reign when as he subdueth unto himself (all the whole) world by
the preaching of the gospel. Whereupon it followeth that he doth reign
spiritually, and not after any worldly manner. And that which the apostles had
conceived of the carnal kingdom proceeded from the common error of their nation;
neither was it marvel if they were deceived herein. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F33</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For when we measure the same with our understanding, what else can we conceive
but that which is gross and terrestrial? Hereupon it cometh, that, like brute
beasts, we only desire that which is commodious for our flesh, and therefore we
rather catch that which is present. Wherefore, we see that those which held
opinion, that Christ should reign as a king in this world a thousand years

did describe the kingdom of Christ figuratively by the similitude of earthly
kingdoms unto the commodity of their flesh; whereas, notwithstanding, it was
God&#8217;s purpose to lift up their minds higher. As for us, let us learn to

the opinion which they had conceived of Israel. They supposed those to be
Israelites only which were of the seed of Abraham according to the flesh. Christ
testifieth that they must gather thereunto all Samaria; which, although they
were nigh in situation, yet were they far distant in mind and heart. He showeth
that all other regions far distant, and also profane, must be united unto the
holy people, that they may be all partakers of one and the same grace. It is
evident
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:9) how greatly the Jews did detest the Samaritans. Christ commanded that (the
wall of separation being broken down) they be both made one body,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:14,) that his kingdom may be erected everywhere. By naming Judea and
Jerusalem, which the apostles had tried
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F37</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to be full of most deadly enemies, he foretelleth them of the great business and
trouble which was prepared for them, that he may cause them to cease to think
upon this triumph which they hoped to have been so nigh at hand.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F38</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Neither could they be a little afraid to come before so cruel enemies, more to
inflame their rage and fury. And here we see how he giveth the former place unto
the Jews, because they are, as it were, the first-begotten,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;020422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus

Institutions what profit we reap by the ascension of Christ. Notwithstanding,
because it is one of the chiefest points of our faith, therefore doth Luke
endeavor more diligently to prove the same; yea, rather, the Lord himself meant
to put the same out of all doubt, when as he hath ascended so manifestly, and
hath confirmed the certainty of the same by other circumstances. For, if so be
it he had vanished away secretly, then might the disciples have doubted what was
become of
him;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F39</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but now, sith that they, being in so plain a place, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F40</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
saw him taken up with whom they had been conversant, whom also they heard speak
even now, whom they beheld with their eyes, whom also they see taken out of
their sight by a cloud, there is no cause why they should doubt whither he was
gone. Furthermore, the angels are there also to bear witness of the same. And it
was needful that the history should have been set down so diligently for our
cause, that we may know assuredly, that although the Son of God appear nowhere
upon earth, yet doth he live in the heavens. And this seemeth to be the reason
why the cloud did overshadow him, before such time as he did enter into his
celestial glory; that his disciples being content with their measure
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F41</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
might cease to inquire any further. And we are taught by them that our mind is
not able to ascend so high as to take a full view of the glory of Christ;
therefore, let this cloud be a mean to restrain our boldness, as was the smoke
which was continually before the door of the tabernacle in the time of the
law.</font><br></div>

concerning which thing I will not greatly stand in defense of either part, yet
certain it is they were not men; but because this <i>metonymia </i>is commonly
used in the Scriptures, especially in the First Book of Moses, I will not
greatly stand thereupon. Their <i>white garments </i>were a token of rare and
excellent dignity. For God meant by this, as by an evident token to distinguish
them from the common sort of people, that the disciples might give better ear
unto them;

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye men of Galilee,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I am not of their opinion who think that
this name was given the apostles after an opprobrious sort, as if the angels
meant to reprehend the slowness and dullness of the apostles. In my opinion, it
was rather to make them more attentive, in that men, whom they did never see
before, did name them as though they had perfectly known them. But they seem to
reprehend without cause, for looking up into heaven. For where should they
rather seek for Christ than in heaven? Doth not the Scriptures also oftentimes
exhort us thereunto? I answer, that they were not reprehended because they
looked up towards heaven; but because they coveted to see Christ, when as the
cloud which was put between them and him did keep them from seeing him with
their bodily senses: Secondly, because they hoped that he would return again
straightway, that they might enjoy the sight of him again, when as lie did
ascend to stay in the heavens until such time as he should come
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F43</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to judge the world. Wherefore, let us first learn out of this place that we must
not seek Christ either in heaven, either upon earth, otherwise than by faith;
and also, that we must not desire to have him present with us bodily in the
world; for he that doth
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F44</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
either of those two shall oftentimes go farther from him. So this their
admiration is reprehended, not simply, but inasmuch as they were astonied by the
strangeness of this matter; like as we are oftentimes carried unadvisedly into a
wonderful great wondering at God&#8217;s works; but we never apply ourselves to
consider for what end and purpose they were done.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus, which is taken up into
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There are two members in this
one sentence. The first is, that Christ was taken up into heaven, that they may
not henceforth foolishly desire to have him any longer conversant with them upon
earth. The other is straightway added as a consolation concerning his second
coming. Out of these two jointly, and also severally, is gathered a firm,
stable, and strong argument, to refute the Papists, and all other which imagine
that Christ is really present in the signs of bread and wine. For when it is
said that Christ is taken up into heaven; here is plainly noted the distance of
place. I grant that this word <i>heaven </i>is interpreted divers ways,
sometimes for the air, sometimes for the whole connection
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F45</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the spheres, sometimes for the glorious kingdom of God, where the majesty of
God hath his [its] proper scat, howsoever it doth fill the whole world. After
which sort Paul doth place Christ above all heavens,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:22,) because he is above all the world, and hath the chiefest room in that
place of blessed immortality, because he is more excellent than all the angels,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:15.) But this is no let why he may not be absent from us bodily, and that by
this word <i>heavens, </i>there may not be signified a separation from the
world. Let them cavil as much as they will, it is evident that the heaven
whereinto Christ was received is opposite to the frame of the world; therefore
it doth necessarily follow, that if he be in heaven, he is without [beyond] the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, first, we must mark what the purpose of the
angels was, for thereby we shall more perfectly know what the words mean. The
angels&#8217; intent was to call back the apostles from desiring the carnal
presence of Christ. For this purpose was it that they said that he should not
come again until he came to judge the world. And to this end serveth the
assigning of the time, that they might not look for him in vain before that same
time. Who seeth not that in these words is manifestly showed that he was bodily
absent out of the world? Who seeth not that we are forbidden to desire to have
him upon the earth? But, they think they escape safe with that crafty answer,
when as they say that then he shall come visibly; but he cometh now invisibly
daily. But we are not here to dispute of his form; only the apostles are taught
that Christ must abide in heaven until such time as he appear at the latter day.
For the desiring of his corporeal presence is here condemned as absurd and
perverse. The Papists deny that he is present in the sacrament carnally, while
that his glorious body is present with us after a supernatural sort, and by a
miracle; but we may well enough reject their inventions concerning his glorious
body, as childish and frivolous toys. They feign unto themselves a miracle not
confirmed with any testimony of Scripture. The body of Christ was then glorious,
when as he was conversant with his disciples after his resurrection. This was
done by the extraordinary and secret power of God; yet, notwithstanding, the
angels do forbid to desire him afterward after that sort, and they say that he
shall not come unto men in that sort (before the latter day.) Therefore,
according to their commandment, let us not go about to pull him out of the
heavens with our own inventions; neither let us think that we call handle him
with our hands, or perceive him with our other senses, more than we can see him
with our eyes. I speak always of his body. For in that they say it is infinite,
as it is all absurd dream, so is it safely to be rejected. Nevertheless, I
willingly confess that Christ is ascended that he may fulfill [fill] all things;
but I say that he is spread abroad everywhere by the power of his Spirit, not by
the substance of his flesh. I grant, furthermore, that he is present With us
both in his word and in the sacraments. Neither is it to be doubted, but that
all those which do with faith receive the signs of his flesh and blood, are made
truly partakers of his flesh and blood. But this partaking doth nothing agree
with the dotings of the Papists; for they feign that Christ is present in such
sort upon the altar as Numa Pompilius did call down his Jupiter Elicitus, or as
those witches did fetch down the moon from heaven with their enchantments. But
Christ, by reaching us the bread in his Supper, doth will us to lift up our
hearts into heaven, that we may have life by his flesh and blood. So that we do
not eat his flesh grossly, that we may live thereby, but he poureth into us, by
the secret power of his Spirit, his force and strength.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall so
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have said before, that by this
consolation all sorrow which we might conceive, because of Christ&#8217;s
absence, is mitigated, yea, utterly taken away, when as we hear that lie shall
return again. And also the end for which he shall come again is to be noted;
namely, that he shall come as a Redeemer, and shall gather us with him into
blessed immortality. For as lie doth not now sit idle in heaven, (as Homer
signifieth, that his gods be busied only about their bellies;) so shall not he
appear again without profit. Therefore, the only looking for Christ&#8217;s
coming must both restrain the importunate desires of our flesh, and support our
patience in all our adversities; and, lastly, it must refresh our weariness. But
it worketh this only in the faithful, which believe that Christ is their
Redeemer; for it bringeth unto the wicked nothing but dread, horror, and great
fearfulness. And howsoever they do now scoff&#8217; and jest when as they hear
of his coming, yet shall they be compelled to behold him sitting upon his
tribunal-seat, whom now they will not vouchsafe to hear speak. Furthermore, it
were but frivolous to move any question about his apparel wherewith he was then
clothed, whether he shall come again being clothed with the same or no. Neither
am I now determined to refute that which Augustine, in his Epistle unto
Consentius, doth touch, <i>(August. ad Con. </i>Epist. 146;) notwithstanding, it
is better for me to omit that thing which I cannot unfold.</font><br></div>

part asunder. They might have been more commodiously asunder, yet might they not
part company before they had received the Spirit. In that he noteth here the
distance of place, it bringeth credit unto the history. Unless, peradventure, he
meant hereby to declare that they were not terrified with any fear of danger,
but that they did all return and kept company together in one house, which was
not so large, but that the company being greater than the place could well
contain, it might breed some rumor (or noise.) A Sabbath-day&#8217;s journey was
two miles, and that account doth well agree with the place of

them simply to rest upon the Sabbath-day in the law.

about their business upon the Sabbath-day, (as the Lord himself doth complain,
&#8220;that they did bear burdens out at the gates,&#8221;)
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;241724&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah

(to the end they might restrain such enormities,) that no man should travel upon

there. But I am of that opinion, that they did then first of all use that hired
room to dwell together in, until such time as the Holy Spirit was come upon
them. Too, too ridiculous are the Papists, which go about to prove Peter his
supremacy
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F50</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
hereby, because he is reckoned up first of all the apostles. Although we do
grant that he was the chiefest of the apostles, yet it doth not follow hereupon
that he was the chiefest ruler of all the world. But if he be, therefore, the
chief of all the apostles, because his name is first in the catalogue of the
apostles&#8217; names, I will again conclude, that the mother of Christ was
inferior unto all the rest of the women, because she is [here] reckoned the
last; which they will in no case admit, as indeed it were a thing too absurd.
Wherefore, unless they will set their Papacy to be laughed at of all men, as
hitherto they have done, they must leave off to adorn it with such foolish toys.
But what is their intent? Forsooth, they will prove out of the Scriptures that
there was a secondary head of the Church, inferior to Christ; whereas there is
no syllable in the Scripture which is consenting unto this their foolish
invention. No marvel is it, therefore, if they do snatch here and there certain
places, which, although no man smite them out of their hands, they will let fall
of their own accord. But omitting them, let us mark what is Luke&#8217;s purpose
in this place. Because the disciples had fallen away, and filthily fled from
their Master Christ, every man whither fear did drive him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402656&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
26:56,) they did deserve, like forsakers of their masters, or run-agates, to be
deprived of honor. Therefore, that we may know that by the appointment of the
Lord they were gathered together again, and restored to their former degree,
Luke reckoneth up all their names.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With their
wives</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some translate it <i>women;
</i>and they think that he speaketh of those which accompanied Christ. As I will
not contend with any man concerning this matter, so have I not doubted to prefer
that which I thought was more probable. I grant that the word which Luke useth
may be interpreted both ways. But this is my reason, why I do think that he
speaketh rather of wives, because, seeing that they used afterward to carry
their wives about with them, as Paul doth testify,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460905&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 9:5,) it is not likely that they were then asunder. For they might
more easily rest together in one place, than by wandering to and fro oftentimes
to change their abiding; and, secondly, seeing that they did look for the coming
of the Holy Ghost, which was even then at hand, what reason was there why they
should deprive their wives of so great goodness? Peter&#8217;s wife was about to
be a helper unto him shortly after, which we must also think of the rest of the
wives. These women had need of heroical fortitude and constancy, lest they
should faint. Who would, therefore, think that they were excluded from their
husbands whilst they look for the coming of the Spirit? But if they will stick
to the general word, it standeth with reason that there were married women in
the company. Howsoever it be, it is Luke&#8217;s mind to tell us by the way how
greatly they had changed their
minds.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F51</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For whereas before the men, being afraid, had fled away, the women are gathered
together with them now, neither do they fear any danger. He doth reckon up the
mother of Jesus with the other women, whom, notwithstanding, John is said to
have kept at his own house. But, as I have said before, they met altogether now
only for a short season; for it is not to be doubted but that they departed one
from another afterwards. It is well known that amongst the Hebrews all kinsfolk
are comprehended under this word <i>brethren.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All these did
continue.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Here he showeth that they did
diligently look for the coming of the Holy Spirit.; For this was the cause of
their prayer, that Christ would send his Spirit, as he had promised. Whereupon
we may gather that this is the true faith which stirreth us up to call upon God.
For the security of faith doth much differ from sluggishness. Neither doth God,
therefore, assure us of this grace, that our minds may straightway become
careless, but that he may rather sharpen our desire to pray. Neither is prayer
any sign of doubting, but rather a testimony of our (sure hope and) confidence,
because we ask those things at the Lord&#8217;s hands which we know he hath
promised. So it becometh us also (after their example) to be instant in prayer,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F52</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and to beg at God&#8217;s hands that he will increase in us his Holy Spirit:
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F53</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
increase, (I say,) because before we can conceive any prayer we must needs have
the first-fruits of the Spirit. For as much as he is the only Master which
teacheth us to pray aright, who doth not only give us utterance,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450225&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:25,) but also governs our inward affections.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, Luke doth express two things which are
proper to true prayer, namely, that they did persist, and that they were all of
one mind. This was art exercise of their patience, in that Christ did make them
stay a
while,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F54</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when as he could straightway have sent the Holy Spirit; so God doth oftentimes
drive off,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F55</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and, as it were, suffer us to languish, that he may accustom us to persevere.
The hastiness of our petitions is a corrupt, yea a hurtful plague; wherefore it
is no marvel if God do sometimes correct the same. In the mean season (as I have
said) he doth exercise us to be constant in prayer. Therefore, if we will not
pray in vain, let us not be wearied with the delay of time. As touching the
unity of their minds, it is set against that scattering abroad, which fear had
caused before. Yet, notwithstanding, we may easily gather, even by this, how
needful a thing it is to pray generally, in that Christ commandeth every one to
pray for the whole body, and generally for all men, as it were, in the person of
all men: Our Father, Give us this day, etc.,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
6:9.) Whence cometh this unity of their tongues but from one Spirit? Wherefore,
when Paul would prescribe unto the Jews and Gentiles a right form of prayer, he
removeth far away all division and dissension. That we <i>may, </i>(saith he,)
being all of one mind, with one mouth glorify God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:6.) And truly it is needful that we be brethren, and agree together like
brethren, that we rightly call God Father.</font><br></div>

not unadvisedly choose the twelve in the beginning, as principal preachers of
his gospel. For when he said that they should be judges of twelve tribes of
Israel,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
6:13,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430670&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
6:70; he showeth here that it was done of set purpose, that they might gather
together the tribes of Israel unto one faith. But after that the Jews had
refused the grace offered unto them, it was behoveful that the Israel of God
should be gathered together out of all countries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, therefore, was, as it were, a holy number,
which, if it should have been diminished through the wickedness of Judas, then
should the preaching of the gospel both have had, and also have, less credit at
this day, if the beginning thereof had been imperfect.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F56</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Although, therefore, Judas would (as much as in him lay) have disappointed the
purpose of Christ, yet. nevertheless it stood firm and stable. He perished as he
was worthy, yet did the order of the apostles remain whole and
sound.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The company of
names</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is uncertain whether he
meaneth the men who only have the name properly, seeing the women are
comprehended under the name of the men; or whether he taketh names simply for
all the heads, as the Hebrews call them souls. This may also be called in
question, whether they were wont daily to frequent that parlor in which the
apostles did dwell, or they did continually dwell there with them. For the place
was scarce able to contain so great a multitude, to serve them for all necessary
uses. Surely it seemeth to me a thing more like to be true, that Luke doth in
this place express the number of them, that we may know that they were all
gathered together when Peter made this sermon. Whereby we may guess that they
were not always present there. Although I dare not affirm any certain thing
concerning this matter, yet being moved with a probable conjecture, I do rather
lean unto this part, that the church was gathered together them because they had
to intreat of a serious matter, and to this end also tendeth this word
<i>rising</i>, [standing up.]</font><br></div>

It was meet that the Scripture should be
fulfilled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Because Peter doth speak in
this their assembly, therefore the Papists will have him to be the head of the
church.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F57</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As though no man might speak in any assembly of the godly but he should
straightway be Pope. We do grant, that as in every assembly there must be some
which must be chief, so in this assembly the apostles did ascribe this honor
unto Peter. But what maketh this unto (the proving of) their Papacy? Wherefore,
bidding them adieu,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F58</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
let us consider what the Spirit doth speak by the month of Peter. He saith That
the Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, lest any man&#8217;s mind should
be troubled with that horrible fall of Judas. For it seemed a strange thing that
he which was chosen by Christ unto so excellent a function, should so filthily
fall in the beginning of his course. Peter removeth this stone of stumbling,
when he saith that it was foretold by the Scripture. Whence we may gather an
admonition very necessary for daily practice; namely, that we ought to attribute
this honor unto the prophecies of the Scriptures, that they are able to appease
all such fear as we conceive of the sudden event of things. For there is nothing
which doth more trouble us than when we stay still in our own sense and
understanding, and procure unto ourselves lets and doubts,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F59</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which the Lord would be ready to cure, if so be that we would hold fast this one
thing, that nothing is absurd which he hath foreseen, appointed, and foretold,
that he might make us more strong. Neither was Judas therefore excusable,
because that which befell him was foretold, seeing that he fell away, not being
compelled by the prophecy, but only by the malice of his own heart. The oration
of Peter hath two parts. For, in the first place, he putteth away the offense
which godly minds might have conceived by reason of the fall of Judas; whence
also he gathereth an exhortation that the rest may learn to fear God. Secondly,
he telleth them that it remaineth that they choose another into his place, both
which he proveth by testimony of Scripture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which the Holy Ghost
foretold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Such manner of speeches bring
greater reverence to the Scriptures, whilst we are taught by them that David and
all the rest of the prophets did speak only as they were directed by the Holy
Ghost; so that they themselves were not the authors of their prophecies, but the
Spirit which used their tongues as an instrument. Wherefore, seeing that our
dullness is so great, that we ascribe less authority unto the Scriptures than we
ought, we must diligently note such manner of speeches, and acquaint ourselves
with them, that we may oftentimes remember the authority of God to confirm our
faith withal.</font><br></div>

</i>It is word for word <i>reckoned. </i>And he saith that he was one of the
number, that he might signify unto them that it was needful that the empty place
should be filled, to the end that the number might continue whole. And to this
propose serveth that which followeth, that he had obtained a part in the
ministry. For thereupon it doth follow that the body should be, as it were,
lame, if that part should be wanting. Surely it was a thing which might make
them greatly amazed, that he whom Christ had extolled unto so high dignity
should fall headlong into such destruction. Which circumstance doth increase the
cruelty of the fact,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F60</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F61</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Neither is it to be doubted but that the disciples did remember Judas with great
grief and sorrow. But Peter doth here express by name the excellency of his
function, that he might make them more attentive and more careful to provide a
remedy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he
truly</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It seemeth unto me a thing like
to be true, that this narration of the death of Judas was put in by Luke;
therefore, it seemeth good to me to include it within a parenthesis, that it may
be separated from Peter&#8217;s sermon. For to what end should Peter here reckon
up unto the disciples those things which they already knew well enough?
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Secondly, it should have been an absurd thing to have
spoken after this among them, that the field which was bought with the money
that was given to betray Christ was called of the Hebrews, in their own mother
tongue, <i>Aceldama. </i>But whereas some do answer, that Peter spoke this unto
the Galileans, whose speech did disagree with the Jewish tongue, it is but vain
and frivolous. In very deed they did somewhat disagree in pronunciation; yet not
so much but that they did well understand one another; like as do these of Paris
and the men of Rouen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, how could this be a fit word for
Jerusalem, where Peter made his sermon? To what end should he interpret in Greek
among the Hebrews their own mother tongue? Therefore doth Luke of himself put in
this sentence concerning the death of Judas, lest Peter&#8217;s words might seem
strange
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F62</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
through ignorance of that history.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He possessed a
field</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This word hath a double
signification, which, in my opinion, doth rather signify in this place to
possess than to get; yet because it skilleth little whether way we read it, I
leave it indifferent. And he speaketh after this sort, not because Judas had the
use of the field, or that he himself did buy it, seeing it was bought after his
death. But Luke&#8217;s meaning was, that his burial was the perpetual note of
ignominy; was the reward which he had for his falsehood and wicked act. Neither
did he so much sell Christ for thirty pieces as his apostleship. He enjoyed not
the money;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F63</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he only possessed the field. Furthermore, it came to pass through the marvelous
providence of God, that the very common name of the field should be a note of
infamy for the priests, which had bought (the) innocent blood of [from] the
traitor. He saith that the Hebrews did call it by that name in their tongue,
because he himself was a Grecian born; and he calleth that the Hebrew tongue
which the Jews did use after the captivity of Babylon, namely, such as was mixed
of the Assyrian tongue and of the Chaldean tongue.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is written in the book of
Psalms</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He taketh away, by authority of
Scriptures, all offense which might have happened by reason of the falling away
of Judas. Yet might this place seem to be greatly wrested: First, in that David
did not wish that these things might befall any particular person, but (in the
plural number) he wisheth them unto his enemies. Secondly, it seemeth that Peter
doth apply these things amiss unto Judas, which were spoken of the enemies of
David. I answer, that David doth there speak after this [afterwards] of himself,
that he may describe the condition and state of Christ&#8217;s
kingdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In that Psalm (I say) is contained the common image
of the whole Church, which is the body of the Son of God. Therefore, the things
which are there set down must needs have been fulfilled in the head, which are
indeed fulfilled, as the evangelists do testify, know, if any man object that
those things which there were spoken against the enemies of David do not fitly
agree unto Judas, we may easily gather that they do so much the rather agree
with him, because David doth not respect himself as being separated from the
body of the Church; but rather as he was one of the members of Christ, and so
taking upon him his image, he steppeth forth in his name.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whosoever shall mark that this singular person was
attributed to David, that he should be a figure of Christ, will not marvel if
all these things be applied unto him which were prefigured in David. Although,
therefore, he doth comprehend the whole Church, yet he beginneth at the head
thereof, and doth especially describe what things Christ should suffer by the
hands of the wicked. For we learn out of Paul&#8217;s doctrine, that whatsoever
afflictions the godly suffer, they are part of the afflictions of Christ, and
serve to the fulfilling of the same,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:14.) This order and connection did David observe, or rather the Spirit of God,
who meant by the mouth of David to instruct the whole Church. But as touching
the persecutors of Christ, all that which is commonly spoken of them is by good
right referred unto their standard-bearer; whose impiety and wickedness, as it
is most famous, so his punishment ought to be made known unto all men. If any
man do object again, that that which is recited in the Psalm is only certain
cursings, and not prophecies; and that, therefore, Peter doth gather improperly
that it was of necessity that it should be fulfilled, it is soon answered. For
David was not moved with any perverse or corrupt affection of the flesh to crave
vengeance; but he had the Holy Spirit to be his guide and director. Therefore,
what things soever he prayed for there, being inspired with the Holy Ghost, they
have the same strength which prophecies have, because the Spirit doth require no
other thing than that which God</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">hath determined with himself to perform, and will
also promise unto us. But whereas Peter doth cite out of the Scriptures two
diverse testimonies; by the first is meant, that Judas, together with his name
and family, should quite be extinguished, that his place might be empty; the
other, which he fetcheth out of the 109th Psalm, tendeth to this end, that there
should be another chosen to supply his place. These seem at first to be
contrary; namely, a waste habitation and succession. Yet, because the Spirit
saith only, in the former place, that the adversaries of the Church should be
taken away, that their place might be empty, and without one to dwell therein,
in respect of themselves, this is no let why another may not afterward supply
their empty place. Yea, this doth also augment their punishment, in that the
honor, after it was taken from him that was unworthy thereof, is given to
another.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And his

made a widow. Therefore, after that he had wished that the wicked may be
deprived of his life, he addeth, moreover, that he may be spoiled of his honor;
neither doth he stay here, but also he desireth that another may succeed him,
whereby, as I have said before, his punishment is doubled. In the meanwhile, he
noteth by the way,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F65</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that this false, treacherous, and wicked person, whereof he speaketh, should not
be some one of the common sort, but such an one as should be indued with honor
and dignity; from which, nevertheless, he shall fall. And out of this place must
we learn, that the wicked shall not escape scott free, which have persecuted the
Church of God; for this miserable and wretched end is prepared for them
all.</font><br></div>

Judas&#8217;s bishopric, it did not thereupon straightway follow that the
disciples should choose another to be his successor; yet, because they knew that
they had this charge given them to order the Church, so soon as Peter had told
them that it did please the Lord that it should be so, he gathereth thereupon
that they ought to do it. For whensoever God will use as means,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F67</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to maintain the government of his Church, so soon as we know what his will is,
we must not linger, but stoutly perform whatsoever is required in our ministry
(and function.) That was, without all controversy, what was the duty of the
Church; like as, at this day, when we hear that those must be put from their
office which behave themselves ungodly and wickedly, and that others must be
chosen in their rooms, the Church must take this charge in hand. Wherefore, it
was superfluous to move any question about a thing that was not to be doubted
of. Therefore, let us always remember to consider what we have to do, that we
may be ready to obey the Lord. Furthermore, when as he intreateth of the making
of an apostle, he saith, He must be a witness of the resurrection; which
signifieth that the apostleship is not without the preaching of the gospel.
Whence it may appear how vain and frivolous the Popish bishops are, which having
on only dumb visors, brag that they are the successors of the apostles; but
wherein are they like unto them? I grant that Peter doth here require such a
witness as saw the Lord after his resurrection, of which sort John professeth
himself to be one, when he saith, &#8220;He which saw it beareth witness,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431935&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
19:35.) For this did serve for the confirmation of faith; yet, nevertheless,
Peter maketh it a thing necessary in him and the rest of his fellows in office,
that they should teach, whilst he maketh them and himself preachers or witnesses
of the resurrection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He nameth the resurrection, not because they must
bear witness thereof alone; but because, first, under this is comprehended the
preaching of the death of Christ; secondly, because we have the end of our
redemption therein, and the accomplishment thereof, and also it bringeth with it
the celestial government of Christ, and the power of the Spirit in defending
his, in establishing justice and equity, in restoring order, in abolishing the
tyranny of sin, and in putting to flight all the enemies of the Church. Let us
know, therefore, that those things are not excluded by this word which are
necessarily knit together. ,Nevertheless, let us note that the resurrection is
here named before other things, as being the chief point of the gospel, as also
Paul teacheth,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But were the apostles alone witnesses of the
resurrection? Was not this also common to the rest of the disciples? For Peter
seemeth to challenge this as proper only to the apostles. I answer, that this
title is therefore attributed unto them, because they were chosen peculiarly
unto that function, and because they had the chief room amongst those which did
bring this embassage; therefore, though they were the chief of those which were
assigned, yet were not they only appointed thereunto.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All that

Jesus began to show himself unto the world, which is diligently to be observed,
as before I have said; for he lived privately until such time as he was almost
thirty years of age. For he would not make himself known further than was
needful for our salvation. Therefore, when the time was come wherein he must go
about that business which his Father had appointed him, he came abroad like a
new man, and one that was but lately born. Every man may easily perceive what
great force this hath to bridle our curiosity. The whole life of Christ might
have been a mirror most marvelous,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F68</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of more than absolute perfection; and yet, notwithstanding, that he might keep
us occupied in the study and meditation of those things which were most needful
to be known, he would lead the better part of his life obscurely and in secret.

contented with one only? Was it because they were so like, that they could not
discern whether was more fit? This truly had been no sufficient reason why they
should suffer it to be decided by lots. And also it seemeth that Joseph was of
greater estimation otherwise; or was it because they were diversely affectioned?
But this seemeth scarce probable, neither is this to be admitted as true,
because of that most excellent testimony which Luke did give a little before of
their unity and agreement. Lastly, It had been very absurd for them to have
polluted the election of the apostle with such strife and
contention.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F70</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But for this cause did they use the casting of lots, that it might be known that
Matthias was not only chosen by the voices of men, but also that he was made by
the determination and judgment of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For there was this difference between the apostles
and the pastors, that the pastors were chosen simply by the Church, the apostles
were called of God. In which respect Paul, in the preface of his Epistle to the
Galatians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
1:2,) doth profess himself to be an apostle, &#8220;neither of men, neither made
by man.&#8221; Therefore, like as the dignity of this function was excellent, so
was it meet that in the choosing of Matthias, the chief judgment should be left
unto God, howsoever men did their duty. Christ by his own mouth did appoint the
rest; therefore, if Matthias had been chosen only by man to be one of them, he
should have had less authority than they. This was very orderly done,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F71</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that the disciples should present unto God those whom they thought to be the
best; and he should choose to himself whom he knew to be most fit, so that God,
by the fall of the lot, doth pronounce that he did allow of the apostleship of
Matthias. But the apostles might seem to have dealt very rashly and disorderly,
which laid so great and weighty a matter upon a lot; for what certainty could
they gather thereby? I answer, that they did it only as they were moved
thereunto by the Holy Spirit; for although Luke doth not express this, yet,
because he will not accuse the disciples of rashness, but rather doth show that
this election was lawful and approved of God; I say, therefore, that they went
this way to work, being moved by the Spirit, like as they were directed in all
the action by the same Spirit. But why do they not pray that God would choose
whom he would out of the whole multitude? Why do they restrain his judgment unto
two? Is not this to rob God of his liberty, when as they tie him, and, as it
were, make him subject unto their voices and consents?
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F72</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But whosoever shall quietly ponder the matter shall plainly perceive, by the
drift of Luke, that the disciples durst do nothing but that which they knew was
their duty to do, and was commanded them by the Lord. As for the contentious,
let them go shake their ears.

both of honest conversation, yea, although they did excel in holiness and other
virtues, yet because the integrity of the heart, whereof God is the alone knower
and judge, is the chief, the disciples pray that God would bring that to light
which was hidden from men. The same ought to be required even at this day in
choosing pastors; for howsoever we are not to appoint two for one, yet because
we may oftentimes be deceived, and the discerning of spirits cometh of the Lord,
we must always pray unto God, that he will show unto us what men he will have to
be ministers, that he may direct and govern our purposes. Here we may also
gather what great regard we must have of integrity and innocency in choosing
pastors, without which both learning and eloquence, and what excellency soever

depraved by corruption, than the corrupt vanity of the Chaldeans doth corrupt
true and natural astrology. Whilst the Chaldeans go about, with the name of
astrology, to cloak and color their wicked curiosity, they defame a science both
profitable and praiseworthy. The same do those which tell men their destinies
(as they call them) by casting lots; but it is our duty to discern the lawful
use from the corruption. He saith the lots were given, that being put into a
pot, or one of their laps, they might afterwards be drawn out. And here we must
also note that this word <i>lot is </i>diversely taken in this place; for when
he said before that Judas had obtained a lot of the ministry, his meaning was,
(according to the common custom of the Scripture,) that he had a portion given
him of the Lord. He speaketh afterwards properly, and without any figure of a
lot, yet is it likely, forasmuch as the word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">larg</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>(goral) </i>is commonly used by the Hebrews for both things, that Peter meant
to allude unto that which they were about to do, and that Luke had respect unto
the self-same thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The lot fell upon
Matthias.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It came to pass as no man
would have looked for; for we may gather by that which goeth before, that there
was not so great account made of Matthias as of the other; for, besides that
Luke gave him the former place, the two sirnames which Barsabas had do show that
he was in great estimation. He was called Barsabas, (that is, <i>the son of an
oath, </i>or <i>of rest,) </i>of the thing itself, as if he were some mirror,
either of faithfulness and innocency, or of a quiet and modest nature. The other
sirname did import singular honesty. This man, therefore, in men&#8217;s
judgment, was the former, [superior;] but God did prefer Matthias before him.
Whereby we are taught that we must not glory if we be extolled unto the skies in
the opinion of men, and if by their voices and consents 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f76</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
we be judged to be most excellent men; but we must rather have regard of this,
to approve ourselves unto God, who alone is the most lawful and just judge, by
whose sentence and judgment we stand or fall. And we may oftentimes mark this
also, that God passeth over him which is the chiefest in the sight of men, that
he may throw down all pride which is in man. In that he addeth, that <i>he was
reckoned amongst the rest, </i>he wipeth away all sinister note of rashness from
the casting of lots, because the Church did embrace him as chosen by God on whom
the lot fell.</font><br></div>

declared why the Lord did defer the sending of his Spirit a whole month and a
half. But the question is, why he sent him upon that day chiefly. I will not
refute that high and subtle interpretation of Augustine, that like as the law
was given to the old people fifty days after Easter, being written in tables of
stone by the hand of God, so the Spirit, whose office it is to write the same in
our hearts, did fulfill that which was figured in the giving of the law as many
days after the resurrection of Christ, who is the true Passover.
Notwithstanding, whereas he urgeth this his subtle interpretation as necessary,
in his book of Questions upon Exodus, and in his Second Epistle unto Januarius,
I would wish him to be more sober and modest therein. Notwithstanding, let him
keep his own interpretation to himself. In the mean season, I will embrace that
which is more sound.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Upon the feast day, wherein a great multitude was
wont to resort to Jerusalem, was this miracle wrought, that it might be more
famous. And truly by means hereof was it spread abroad, even unto the uttermost
parts and borders of the earth.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F77</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For the same purpose did Christ oftentimes go up to Jerusalem upon the holy
days, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F78</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(John 2, 5, 7, 10, 12,) to the end those miracles which he wrought might be
known to many, and that in the greater assembly of people there might be the
greater fruit of his doctrine. For so will Luke afterward declare, that Paul
made haste that he might come to Jerusalem before the day of Pentecost, not for
any religion&#8217;s sake, but because of the greater assembly, that he might
profit the more,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;442016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
20:16.) Therefore, in making choice of the day, the profit of the miracle was
respected: First, that it might be the more extolled at Jerusalem, because the
Jews were then more bent to consider the works of God; and, secondly, that it
might be bruited abroad, even in far countries. They called it the fiftieth day,
beginning to reckon at the first-fruits.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there was
made</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was requisite that the gift
should be visible, that the bodily sense might the more stir up the disciples.
For such is our slothfulness to consider the gifts of God, that unless he awake
all our senses, his power shall pass away unknown. This was, therefore, a
preparation that they might the better know that the Spirit was now come which
Christ had promised. Although it was not so much for their sake as for ours,
even as in that the cloven and fiery tongues appeared, there was rather respect
had of us, and of all the whole Church in that, than of them. For God was able
to have furnished them with necessary ability to preach the gospel, although he
should use no sign. They themselves might have known that it came to pass
neither by chance, neither yet through their own industry, that they were so
suddenly changed; but those signs which are here set down were about to be
profitable for all ages; as we perceive at this day that they profit us. And we
must briefly note the proportion of the signs. The violence of the wind did
serve to make them afraid; for we are never rightly prepared to receive the
grace of God, unless the confidence (and boldness) of the flesh be tamed. For as
we have access unto him by faith, so humility and fear setteth open the gate,
that he may come in unto us. He hath nothing to do with proud and careless men.
It is a common thing for the Spirit to be signified by wind, (or a blast,)
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;432022&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
20:22.) For both Christ himself, when he was about to give the Spirit to his
apostles, did breathe upon them; and in Ezekiel&#8217;s vision there was a
whirlwind and wind,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;260104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
1:4.) Yea, the word Spirit itself is a translated word; for, because that
<i>hypostasis, </i>or person of the Divine essence, which is called the Spirit,
is of itself incomprehensible, the Scripture doth borrow the word of the wind or
blast, because it is the power of God which God doth pour into all creatures as
it were by breathing. The shape of tongues is restrained unto the present
circumstance. For as the figure and shape of a dove which came down upon Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430132&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:32,) had a signification agreeable to the office and nature of Christ, so God
did now make choice of a sign which might be agreeable to the thing signified,
namely, that it might show such effect and working of the Holy Ghost in the
apostles as followed afterward.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The diversity of tongues did hinder the gospel from
being spread abroad any farther; so that, if the preachers of the gospel had
spoken one language only, all men would have thought that Christ had been shut
up in the small corner of Jewry. But God invented a way whereby it might break
out, when he divided and clove the tongues of the apostles, that they might
spread that abroad amongst all people which was delivered to them. Wherein
appeareth the manifold goodness of God, because a plague and punishment of
man&#8217;s pride was turned into matter of blessing. For whence came the
diversity of tongues, save only that the wicked and ungodly counsels of men
might be brought to naught?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;011107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
11:7.) But God doth furnish the apostles with the diversity of tongues now, that
he may bring and call home, into a blessed unity, men which wander here and
there. These cloven tongues made all men to speak the language of Canaan, as
Isaiah foretold,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;231918&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
19:18.) For what language soever they speak, yet do they call upon one Father,
which is in heaven, with one mouth and one spirit,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:6.) I said that that was done for our sake, not only because the fruit came
unto us, but because we know that the gospel came unto us not by chance, but by
the appointment of God, who to this end gave the apostles cloven tongues, lest
any nation should want that doctrine which was committed unto them; whereby is
proved the calling of the Gentiles; and, secondly, hereby their doctrine doth
purchase credit, which we know was not forged by man, seeing that we hear that
the Spirit did dwell in their tongues.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, it remaineth that we declare what the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fire
</i></font><font face="Palatino">meaneth. Without all doubt, it was a token of
the (force and) efficacy which should be exercised in the voice of the apostles.
Otherwise, although their sound had gone out into the uttermost parts of the
world, they should only have beat the air, without doing any good at all.
Therefore, the Lord doth show that their voice shall be fiery, that it may
inflame the hearts of men; that the vanity of the world being burnt and
consumed, it may purge and renew all things. Otherwise they durst never have
taken upon them so hard a function, unless the Lord had assured them of the
power of their preaching. Hereby it came to pass that the doctrine of the gospel
did not only sound in the air, but pierce into the minds of men, and did fill
them with an heavenly heat (and burning.) Neither was this force showed only in
the mouth of the apostles, but it appeareth daily. And, therefore, we must
beware lest, when the fire burneth, we be as stubble. Furthermore, the Lord did
once give the Holy Ghost under a visible shape, that we may assure ourselves
that his invisible and hidden grace shall never be wanting to the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it
sat.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Because the number is suddenly
changed, it is to be doubted whether he speaketh of the fire. He said that there
appeared tongues as it had been of fire. It followeth by and by, <i>and it sat
upon them. </i>Notwithstanding, I refer it unto the Spirit. For the Hebrews use
commonly to express the substantive of the verb in the second member, which they
did omit in the former. Wherefore we have an example in this place: <i>It sat
</i>upon them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. And we know that
although Luke did write in Greek, yet is he full of those phrases which the
Hebrews use.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F79</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now, whereas he calleth the tongues the Holy Ghost, it is according to the
custom of the Scripture. For John calleth the dove by the same name,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430132&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:32,) because the Lord would testify and declare the presence of his Spirit by
some such sign. If it were a vain sign, it should be an absurd naming (to call
the sign by the name of the thing signified;) but where the thing is annexed,
the name of the thing is fitly given to the sign which offereth the same unto
our senses to be perceived. The fullness of the Spirit, wherewith he saith every
one was replenished, doth not express the [an] equal measure of gifts in every
one, but that excellence which should be meet for such a
calling.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F80</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They began to
speak</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He showeth that the effect did
appear presently, and also to what use their tongues were to be framed and
applied, But because Luke setteth down shortly after, that strangers out of
divers countries did marvel, because that every one of them did hear the
apostles speaking in their own tongue, some think that they spoke not in divers
tongues, but that they did all understand that which was spoken in one tongue,
as well as if they should hear their natural tongue. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F81</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore, they think that one and the same sound of the voice was diversely
distributed amongst the hearers. Another conjecture they have, because Peter
made one sermon in the audience of many gathered together out of divers
countries, who could not understand his speech (and language,) unless another
voice should come unto their ears than that which proceeded out of his mouth.
But we must first note that the disciples spoke indeed with strange tongues;
otherwise the miracle had not been wrought in them, but in the hearers. So that
the similitude should have been false whereof he made mention before; neither
should the Spirit have been given so much to them as to others. Again, we hear
how Paul giveth thanks to God, that he speaketh with divers tongues,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:18.) Truly he challengeth to himself both the understanding, and
also the use thereof. Neither did he attain to this skill by his own study and
industry, but he had it by the gift of the Spirit. In the same place he
affirmeth that it is an especial gift, wherewith all men are not endued. I
suppose that it doth manifestly appear hereby that the apostles had the variety
and understanding of tongues given them, that they might speak unto the Greeks
in Greek, unto the Italians in the Italian tongue,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F82</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and that they might have true communication (and conference) with their hearers.
Notwithstanding, I leave it indifference whether there was any second miracle
wrought or no, so that the Egyptians and Elamites did understand Peter speaking
in the Chaldean tongue, as if he did utter divers voices. For there be some
conjectures which persuade me thus to think, and yet not so firm but that they
may be refuted. For it may be that they spoke with divers tongues, as they light
upon this man or that, and as occasion was offered, and as their languages were
diverse. Therefore, it was a manifest miracle, when they saw them ready to speak
divers languages. As touching Peter&#8217;s sermon, it might be understood of
the greater part of men wheresoever they were born; for it is to be thought that
many of those which came to Jerusalem were skillful in the Chaldean tongue.
Again, it shall be nothing inconvenient if we say that he spoke also in other
tongues. Although I will not much stand about this matter; so that this be out
of doubt, that the apostles changed their speech.

that they might worship God; like as God, in all ages, after the scattering
abroad, did gather together into that city some seed which remained, having, as
it were, set up his banner, because as yet the temple did serve to some use.
Yet, nevertheless, he showeth, by the way, who those be which profit by those
miracles, whereby God doth declare his power. For wicked and profane men do
either laugh at them, or else pass [care] not for them, as we shall see by and

up those lands whereof one was far distant from another, of which sort are Libya

increase the greatness of the thing. For the Cretians and men of Asia, dwelling
so near together, might have some likelihood and agreement in speech;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f85</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but the same could not be betwixt the Italians and the men of Cappadocia,
betwixt the Arabians and those of Pontus. Yea, this was also a work of God
worthy to be remembered and wondered at, that in so huge and horrible a
scattering abroad of the people, he did always reserve some relics, yea, he
caused certain strangers to adjoin themselves unto a people which was in such
misery, and, as it were, quite destroyed. For although they lived here and there
in exile in far countries, and being one far from another, did, as it were,
inhabit divers worlds, yet did they hold among themselves the unity of faith.

abroad, whereby it came to pass that a great multitude came together. For if one
after another in divers places, and at divers times, had heard the apostles
speaking in divers tongues, the miracle had not been so famous; therefore they
come altogether into one place, that the diversity of tongues may the better
appear by the present comparison. There is a further circumstance also here to
be noted, that the country (and native soil) of the apostles was commonly known,
and this was also commonly known, that they never went out of their country to
learn
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F86</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
strange tongues. Therefore, forasmuch as one speaketh Latin, another Greek,
another the Arabian tongue, as occasion was offered, and that indifferently, and
every one doth also change his tongue, the work of God appeareth more plainly
hereby.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The wonderful works of

private persons,

born in a base corner, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F88</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
did, notwithstanding, intreat profoundly of divine matters, and of heavenly
wisdom. The other is, because they have new tongues given them suddenly. Both
things are worth the noting, because to huddle out [utter] words unadvisedly and
foolishly, should not so much have served to move their minds; and the majesty
of the things ought the more to have moved them to consider the miracle.
Although they give due honor to God, in that they are astonished and amazed, yet
the principal and of the miracle is expressed in this, that they inquire, and
thereby declare that they are prepared to learn; for otherwise their amazedness
and wondering should not have done them any great good. And certainly we must so
wonder at the works of God, that there must be also a consideration, and a
desire to understand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Others
mocking</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hereby it appeareth how
monstrous as well the sluggishness, as also the ungodliness of men is, when
Satan hath taken away their mind. If God should openly (and visibly) descend
from heaven, his majesty could scarce more manifestly appear than in this
miracle. Whosoever hath any drop of sound understanding in him must needs be
stricken with the only hearing of it. How beastly, then, are those men who see
it with their eyes, and yet scoff, and go about with their jests to mock the
power of God? But the matter is so. There is nothing so wonderful which those
men do not turn to a jest who are touched with no care of God; because they do,
even upon set purposes, harden themselves in their ignorance in things most
plain. And it is a just punishment of God, which he bringeth upon such pride, to
deliver them to Satan, to be driven headlong into blind fury. Wherefore, there
is no cause why we should marvel that there be so many at this day so blind in
so great light, if they be so deaf when such manifest doctrine is delivered,
yea, if they wantonly refuse salvation when it is offered unto them. For if the
wonderful and strange works of God, wherein he doth wonderfully set forth his
power, be subject to the mockery of men, what shall become of doctrine, which
they think tasteth of nothing but of that which is common? Although Luke doth
signify unto us that they were not of the worst sort, or altogether past hope,
which did laugh (and mock;) but he meant rather to declare how the common sort
was affected when they saw this miracle. And truly it hath been always so in the
world, for very few have been touched with the true feeling of God as often as
he hath revealed himself. Neither is it any marvel; for religion is a rare
virtue, and a virtue which few men have; which is, indeed, the beginning of
understanding. Nevertheless, howsoever the more part of men, through a certain
hard stiff-neckedness, doth reject the consideration of the works of God, yet
are they never without fruit, as we may see in this history.</font><br></div>

drunk betimes in the morning. For, as Paul saith,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Those which are
drunk are drunk in the
night,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;520507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Thessalonians 5:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For they flee the light for shame. And surely so
great is the filthiness of this vice, that for good causes it hateth the light.
And yet this argument were not always good; for Esaias doth inveigh in his time
against those which did rise early to follow drunkenness. And at this day there
be many who, like hogs, so soon as they awake, run to quaffing. But because this
is
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F89</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
a common custom amongst men, Peter saith, that it is no likely thing. Those
which have but even small skill in antiquity do know that the civil day, from
the rising of the sun until the going down thereof, was divided into twelve
hours; so that the hours were longer in summer, and shorter in winter.
Therefore, that which should now be the ninth before noon in winter, and in
summer the eighth, was the third hour amongst the old people. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F90</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore, whereas Peter doth only lightly remove the opinion of drunkenness, he
doth it for this cause, because it had been superfluous to have stood about any
long excuse. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F91</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore, as in a matter which was certain and out of doubt, he doth rather
pacify those which mocked, than labor to teach them. And he doth not so much
refute them by the circumstance of time, as by the testimony of Joel. For when
he saith that that is now come to pass which was foretold, he toucheth briefly
their unthankfulness, because they do not acknowledge such an excellent benefit
promised unto them in times past which they now see with their eyes. And whereas
he upbraideth the fault of a few unto all, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F92</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he doth it not to this end, that he may make them all guilty of the same fault;
but because a fit occasion was offered by their mocking to teach them
altogether, he doth not foreslow the same. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F93</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall be in the last
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this effect he proveth that the
Messiah is already revealed. Joel, indeed, doth not express the last days,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;290229&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joel
2:29;) but for as much as he intreateth of the perfect restoring of the Church,
it is not to be doubted but that that prophecy belongeth unto the last age
alone. Wherefore, that which Peter bringeth doth no whit dissent from
Joel&#8217;s meaning; but he doth only add this word for exposition sake, that
the Jews might know that the Church could by no other means be restored, which
was then decayed, but by being renewed by the Spirit of God. Again, because the
repairing of the Church should be like unto a new world, therefore Peter saith
that it shall be in the last days. And surely this was a common and familiar
thing among the Jews, that all those great promises concerning the blessed and
well-ordered state of the Church should not be fulfilled until Christ, by his
coming, should restore all things. Wherefore, it was out of all doubt amongst
them, that that which is cited out of Joel doth appertain unto the last time.
Now, by the last days, or fullness of time, is meant the stable and firm
condition of the Church, in the manifestation or revealing of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will pour out my
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He intendeth to prove, (as we
have already said,) that the Church can be repaired by no other means, saving
only by the giving of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, forasmuch as they did all hope
that the restoring drew near, he accuseth them of sluggishness, because they do
not once think upon the way and means thereof. And when the prophet saith,
&#8220;I will pour out,&#8221; it is, without all question, that he meant by
this word to note the great abundance of the Spirit. And we must take
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will pour out of my
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in the same sense, as if he had
said simply, I will pour out my Spirit. For these latter words are the words of
the prophet. But Peter followed the Grecians, who translate the Hebrew word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">j</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>(cheth,)
</i></font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">apo</font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Therefore, some men do in vain more subtlely play the philosophers; because,
howsoever the words be changed, yet must we still retain and keep the
prophet&#8217;s meaning. Nevertheless, when God is said to pour out his Spirit,
I confess it must be thus understood, that he maketh manifold variety and change
of gifts to flow unto men from his Spirit, as it were out of the only fountain,
the fountain which can never be drawn dry. For, as Paul doth testify, there be
divers gifts, and yet but one Spirit,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 12:4.) And hence do we gather a profitable doctrine, that we can
have no more excellent thing given us of God than the grace of the Spirit; yea,
that all other things are nothing worth if this be wanting. For, when God will
briefly promise salvation to his people, he affirmeth that he will give them his
Spirit. Hereupon it followeth that we can obtain no good things until we have
the Spirit given us. And truly it is, as it were, the key which openeth unto us
the door, that we may enter into all the treasures of spiritual good things; and
that we may also have entrance into the kingdom of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Upon all
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It appeareth, by that which
followeth, of what force this generality is; for, first, it is set down
generally, <i>all flesh; </i>after that the partition is added, whereby the
prophet doth signify that there shall be no difference of age or kind, but that
God admitteth all, one with another, unto the partaking of his grace. It is
said, therefore, <i>all flesh, </i>because both young and old, men and women,
are thereby signified; yet here may a question be moved, why Clod doth promise
that unto his people, as some new and unwonted good thing, which he was wont to
do for them from the beginning throughout all ages; for there was no age void of
the grace of the Spirit. The answer of this question is set down in these two
sentences: &#8220;I will pour out,&#8221; and, &#8220;Upon all flesh;&#8221; for
we must here note a double contrariety,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F94</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
between the time of the Old and New Testament; for the pouring out (as I have
said) doth signify great plenty, when as there was under the law a more scarce
distribution; for which cause John also doth say that the Holy Ghost was not
given until Christ ascended into heaven. <i>All flesh </i>cloth signify an
infinite multitude, whereas God in times past did vouchsafe to bestow such
plenty of his Spirit only upon a few.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, in both comparisons we do not deny but
that the fathers under the law were partakers of the self, same grace whereof we
are partakers; but the Lord doth show that we are above them, as we are indeed.
I say, that all godly men since the beginning of the world were endued with the
same spirit of understanding, of righteousness, and sanctification, wherewith
the Lord doth at this day illuminate and regenerate us; but there were but a few
which had the light of knowledge given them then, if they be compared with the
great multitude of the faithful, which Christ did suddenly gather together by
his coming. Again, their knowledge was but obscure and slender, and, as it were,
covered with a veil, if it be compared with that which we have at this day out
of the gospel, where Christ, the Sun of righteousness, doth shine with perfect
brightness, as it were at noon day. Neither doth that any whit hurt or hinder
that a few had such an excellent faith, that peradventure they have no equal at
this day. For their understanding did nevertheless smell or savor of the
instruction and
schoolmastership</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F95</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the law. For that is always true, that godly kings and prophets have not seen
nor heard those things which Christ hath revealed by his coming. Therefore, to
the end the prophet Joel may commend the excellency of the New Testament, he
affirmeth and foretelleth that the grace of the Spirit shall be more plentiful
in time thereof; and, again, that it shall come unto more men,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:17;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421024&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
10:24.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And your sons shall
prophesy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By the word <i>prophesy </i>he
meant to note the rare and singular gift of understanding. And to the same
purpose tendeth that partition which followeth afterwards,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>&#8220;your young men shall see
visions, and your old men shall dream
dreams;&#8221;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for we gather out of the
twelfth chapter of Numbers, that these were the two ordinary ways whereby God
did reveal himself to the prophets. For in that place, when the Lord exempteth
Moses from the common sort of prophets, he saith,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I appear unto my
servants by a vision, or by a dream; but I speak unto Moses face to face,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;041206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Numbers
12:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, we see that two kinds are put after the
general word for a confirmation; yet this is the sum, that they shall all be
prophets so soon as the Holy Ghost shall be poured out from heaven. But here it
is objected, that there was no such thing, even in the apostles themselves,
neither yet in the whole multitude of the faithful. I answer, that the prophets
did commonly use to shadow under tropes most fit for their time,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F96</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the kingdom of Christ. When they speak of the worship of God, they name the
altar, the sacrifices, the offering of gold, silver, and frankincense.
Notwithstanding, we know that the altars do cease, the sacrifices are abolished,
whereof there was some use in time of the law; and that the Lord requireth some
higher thing at our hands than earthly riches. That is true, indeed; but the
prophets, whilst they apply their style unto the capacity of their time,
comprehend under figures (wherewith the people were then well acquainted) those
things which we see otherwise revealed and showed now, like as when he promiseth
elsewhere that he will make priests of Levites, and Levites of the common sort
of men,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;236621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
66:21,) this is his meaning, that under the kingdom of Christ every base person
shall be extolled unto an honorable estate; therefore, if we desire to ]lave the
true and natural meaning of this place, we must not urge the words which are
taken out of the old
order</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F97</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the law; but we must only seek the truth without figures, and this is it,
that the apostles, through the sudden inspiration of the Spirit, did intreat of
the heavenly mysteries prophetically, that is to say, divinely, and above the
common order.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, this word <i>prophesy </i>doth signify
nothing else save only the rare and excellent gift of understanding, as if Joel
should say, Under the kingdom of Christ there shall not be a few prophets only,
unto whom God may reveal his secrets; but all men shall be endued with spiritual
wisdom, even to the prophetical excellency. As it is also in
Jeremiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Every man shall no
longer teach his neighbor; because they shall all know me, from the least unto
the
greatest,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;243134&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
31:34.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And in these words Peter inviteth the Jews, unto whom
he speaketh, to be partakers of the same grace. As if he should say, the Lord is
ready to pour out that Spirit far and wide which he hath poured upon us.
Therefore, unless you yourselves be the cause of let, ye shall receive with us
of this fullness. And as for us, let us know that the same is spoken to us at
this day which was then spoken to the Jews. For although those visible graces of
the Spirit be ceased, yet God hath not withdrawn his Spirit from his Church.
Wherefore he offereth him daily unto us all, by this same promise, without
putting any difference. Wherefore we are poor and needy only through our own
sluggishness; and also it appeareth manifestly, that those are wicked and
sacrilegious enemies of the Spirit which keep back the Christian common people
from the knowledge of God; and forasmuch as he himself doth not only admit, but
also call by name unto himself, women and men, young and old.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Upon my servants.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">In these words the promise is restrained unto
the worshippers of God. For God doth not profane his Spirit; which he should do,
if he should make the stone common to the unbelieving and despisers. It is
certain that we are made the servants of God by the Spirit; and that, therefore,
we are not, until such time as we have received the same; but, first, whom God
hath adopted to be of his family, and whom he hath framed by his Spirit to obey
him, those doth he furnish with new gifts afterward. Again, the prophet did not
respect that order of thee, but his meaning was to make this grace proper to the
Church alone. And forasmuch as the Church was only among the Jews, he calleth
them honorably the servants and handmaids of God. But after that God did gather
unto himself on every side a Church, the wall of separation being pulled down,
so many as are received into the society of the covenant are called by the same
name. Only let us remember, that the Spirit is appointed for the Church
properly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I will show
wonders</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We<i> </i>must first see what
is meant by this great day of the Lord. Some do expound it of the former coming
of Christ in the flesh; and others refer it unto the last day of the
resurrection, I do allow neither opinion. For, in my judgment, the prophet
comprehendeth the whole kingdom of Christ. And so he calleth it the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great
day,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>after that the Son of God began to
be revealed in the flesh, that he may lead us into the fulfilling of his
kingdom. Therefore, he appointeth no certain day, but he beginneth this day at
the first preaching of the gospel, and he extendeth the same unto the last
resurrection. Those which restrain it unto the time of the apostles are moved
with this reason, because the prophet joineth this member and that which goeth
next before together. But in that there is no absurdity at all, because the
prophet doth assign the time when these things began to come to pass, howsoever
they have a continual going forward even until the end of the world.
Furthermore, whereas he saith that the sun shall be turned to darkness, and the
moon into blood, they are figurative speeches, whereby he doth give us to
understand thus much, that the Lord will show tokens of his wrath through the
whole frame of the world, which shall bring men even to their wit&#8217;s end,
as if there should be some horrible and fearful change of nature wrought. For as
the sun and moon are unto us witnesses of God&#8217;s fatherly favor towards us,
whilst that by course they give light to the earth; so, on the other side, the
prophet saith, that they shall be messengers to foreshow God&#8217;s wrath and
displeasure. And this is the second member of the prophecy. For after that he
had intreated of the spiritual grace which should be abundantly poured out upon
all flesh, lest any man should imagine that all things should be quiet and
prosperous together, therewithal he addeth that the estate of the world shall be
troublesome, and full of great fear under Christ; as Christ himself doth more
fully declare, Matthew 24 and Luke 21.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this serveth greatly to the setting forth of
grace, that whereas all things do threaten destruction, yet whosoever doth call
upon the name of the Lord is sure to be saved. By the darkness of the sun, by
the bloody streaming of the moon, by the black vapor of smoke, the prophet meant
to declare, that whithersoever men turn their eyes, there shall many things
appear, both upward and downward, which may make them amazed and afraid, as he
hath already said. Therefore, this is as much as if he should have said, that
the world was never in a more miserable case, that there were never so many and
such cruel tokens of God&#8217;s wrath. Hence may we gather how inestimable the
goodness of God is, who offereth a present remedy for so great evils; and again,
how unthankful they are towards God, and how froward, which do not flee unto the
sanctuary of salvation, which is nigh unto them, and doth meet them. Again, it
is out of all doubt, that God meaneth by this so doleful a description, to stir
up all godly men, that they may with a more fervent desire seek for salvation.
And Peter citeth it to the same end, that the Jews may know that they shall be
more miserable unless they receive that grace of the Spirit which is offered
unto them. Yet here may a question be asked, how this can hang together, that
when Christ is revealed, there should such a sea of miseries overflow and break
out therewithal? For it may seem to be a thing very
inconvenient,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F98</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that he should be the only pledge of God&#8217;s love toward mankind, in whom
the heavenly Father doth lay open all the treasure of his goodness, yea, he
poureth out the bowels of his mercy upon us, and that yet, by the coming of the
same, his Son, his wrath should be more hot than it was wont, so that it should,
as it were, quite consume both heaven and earth at once.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must first mark, that because men are too slow
to receive Christ, they must be constrained by divers afflictions, as it were
with whips. Secondly, forasmuch as Christ doth call unto himself all those which
are heavy laden and labor,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
11:28,)we must first be tamed by many miseries, that we may learn humility. For
through great prosperity men do set up the horns of pride. And he cannot but
despise Christ fiercely, whosoever he be, that seemeth to himself to be happy.
Thirdly, because we are, more than we ought, set upon the seeking of the peace
of the flesh, whereby it cometh to pass that many tie the grace of Christ unto
the present life, it is expedient for us to be accustomed to think otherwise,
that we may know that the kingdom of Christ is spiritual. Therefore, to the end
God may teach us that the good things of Christ are heavenly, he doth exercise
us, according to the flesh, with many miseries; whereby it cometh to pass that
we do seek our felicity without the world. Moreover, men do bring miseries upon
themselves through their unthankfulness; for the servant which knoweth his
master&#8217;s will, and doth not obey, is worthy of greater and more stripes,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421247&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
12:47.) The more familiarly that God doth communicate with us in Christ, the
more doth our ungodliness grow and break out into open contumacy, so that it is
no marvel if, when Christ is revealed, there appear many tokens of God&#8217;s
vengeance on the other side, forasmuch as men do hereby more grievously provoke
God against them, and kindle his wrath through wicked contempt. Surely, in that
the day of Christ is fearful, it is an accidental thing; whether God will
correct our slothfulness, to bring us under, which [who] are yet inapt to be
taught, or whether he will punish our unthankfulness. For it bringeth with it of
itself nothing but that which is pleasant; but the contempt of God&#8217;s grace
doth provoke him to horrible anger not without cause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Whosoever shall call upon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>An excellent
place. For as God doth prick us forward like sluggish asses, with threatenings
and terrors to seek salvation, se, after that he hath brought darkness upon the
face of heaven and earth, yet doth he show a means whereby salvation may shine
before our eyes, to wit, if we shall call upon him. For we must diligently note
this circumstance. If God should promise salvation simply, it were a great
matter; but it is a far greater when as he promiseth the same amidst manifold
dungeons of death. Whilst that (saith he) all things shall be out of order, and
the fear of destruction shall possess all things, only call upon me, and ye
shall be saved. Therefore, howsoever man be swallowed up ill the gulf of
miseries, yet is there set before him a way to escape. We must also note the
universal word,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whosoever</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>For God admitteth all men unto himself without exception, and by this means
doth he invite them to salvation, as Paul gathereth in the tenth chapter to the
Romans, and as the prophet had set it down before,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thou, Lord, which
hearest the prayer,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">unto thee shall
all flesh

65:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, forasmuch as no man is excluded from
calling upon God, the gate of salvation is set open unto all men; neither is
there any other thing which keepeth us back from entering in, save only our own
unbelief. I speak of all unto whom God doth make himself manifest by the gospel.
But like as those which call upon the name of the Lord are sure of salvation, so
we must think that, without the same, we are thrice miserable and undone. And
when as our salvation is placed in calling upon God, there is nothing in the
mean season taken from faith, forasmuch as this invocation is grounded on faith
alone. There is also another circumstance no less worthy the noting; in that the
prophet doth signify, that the calling upon God doth properly appertain and
agree unto the last days. For although he would be called upon in all ages,
notwithstanding, since that he showed himself to be a Father in Christ, we have
the more easy access unto him. Which thing ought both the more to embolden us,
and to take from us all sluggishness. As he himself doth also reason, that by
this privilege our forwardness to pray is doubled to us: &#8220;Hitherto have ye
asked nothing in nay name; ask, and ye shall receive;&#8221; as if he should
say, theretofore, although I did not yet appear to be a mediator and advocate in
the faith, yet did ye pray; but now, when you shall have me to be your patron,
with how much more courage ought ye to do that? </font><br></div>

purpose the prophecy of Joel; namely, that the Jews may thereby know that the
time of restoring was present; and that Christ was given them for this purpose.
For this promise was no otherwise to be fulfilled, save only by the coming of
the Mediator. And this is the right use of all those gifts which we have by
Christ, whilst that they bring us unto Christ, as unto a fountain. But he cometh
hither by little and little. For he doth not by and by in the beginning affirm
that Jesus was Christ; but he saith only that he was a man sent of God; and that
doth he prove by his miracles. Afterward he addeth, that he rose from death when
he was slain. Whereby it appeareth more certainly and more fully that he was not
one of the prophets, but the very Son of God, who was promised to be the
repairer of all things. Let this, therefore, be the first member, that Jesus of
Nazareth was a man approved of God by manifest testimonies, so that he could not

accounted excellent and great among them; as if he should say, that miracles
were not appointed for other nations, but for the Jews, that they might know
that Jesus was sent unto them of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By great
works.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He calleth miracles by these
three names. And because God doth show forth his power in them after a new and
unwonted sort, or doth, at least, procure greater admiration, they are, for good
causes, called <i>great works.
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F101</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>For we are commonly more moved when any extraordinary thing doth happen. In
which respect they are also called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wonders,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F102</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>because they make us astonished. And for this cause are they called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>signs</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because the Lord will not have men&#8217;s minds to stay there, but to be
lifted up higher; as they are referred unto another end. He put in three words,
to the end he might the more extol Christ&#8217;s miracles, and enforce the
people, by his heaping and laying of words together, to consider the same.
Furthermore, he maketh not Christ the chief author, but only the minister;
because, as we have already said, he determined to go forward by degrees.
Notwithstanding, here may a question be asked, whether miracles do suffice to be
a sufficient and just approbation [proof] or no? Because by this means
inchanters might cause their legerdemain
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F103</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to be believed. I answer, that the juggling casts of Satan do much differ from
the power of God. Christ saith elsewhere, that the kingdom of Antichrist shall
be in wonders, but he addeth by and by, <i>in lying wonders,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;530209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 2:9.) if any man object, that we cannot easily discern, because he
saith that they shall have so great color that they shall deceive (if it could
be) the very elect; I answer again, that this error proceedeth only from our own
want of wit, because we are so dull; for God doth show his power manifestly
enough. Therefore, there is sufficient approbation of the doctrine and of the
ministry in the miracles which God doth work, so that we be not blind. And
whereas it is not of sufficient force among the wicked, because they may now and
then be deceived with the false miracles of Satan, this must be imputed unto
their own blindness; but whosoever hath a pure heart, he doth also know God with
the pure eyes of his mind, so often as he doth show himself. Neither can Satan
otherwise delude us, save only when, through the wickedness of our heart, our
judgment is corrupt and our eyes blinded, or at least bleared through our own
slothfulness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Him have ye slain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He maketh mention of
the death of Christ for this cause chiefly, that the resurrection might the more
assuredly be believed. It was a thing full well known among the Jews that Christ
was crucified. Therefore, in that he rose again, it is a great and wonderful
token of his Divine power. In the mean season, to the end he may prick their
consciences with the feeling of sin, he saith that they slew him; not that they
crucified him with their own hands, but because the people, with one voice,
desired to have him put to death. And although many of the hearers unto whom he
speaketh did not consent unto that wicked and ungodly cruelty, yet doth he
justly impute the same to the nation; because all of them had defiled themselves
either with their silence, or else through their carelessness. Neither hath the
cloak and color
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F104</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of ignorance any place, forasmuch as he was showed before of God. This
guiltiness, therefore, under which he bringeth them, is a preparation unto
repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the determinate
counsel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He removeth a stumbling-block;
because it seemeth, at the first blush, to be a thing very inconvenient,
[unaccountable,] that that man whom God had so greatly adorned, being afterward
laid open to all manner of mocking, doth suffer so reproachful a death.
Therefore, because the cross of Christ doth commonly use to trouble us at the
first sight, for this cause Peter declareth that he suffered nothing by chance,
or because he wanted power to deliver himself, but because it was so determined
(and appointed) by God. For this knowledge alone, that the death of Christ was
ordained by the eternal counsel of God, did cut off all occasion of foolish and
wicked cogitation&#8217;s, and did prevent all offenses which might otherwise be
conceived. For we must know this, that God doth decree nothing in vain or
rashly; whereupon it followeth that there was just cause for which he would have
Christ to suffer. The same knowledge of God&#8217;s providence is a step to
consider the end and fruit of Christ&#8217;s death. For this meeteth us by and
by in the counsel of God, that the just was delivered
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F105</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for our sins, and that his blood was the price of our death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And here is a notable place touching the providence
of God, that we may know that as well our life as our death is governed by it.
Luke intreateth, indeed, of Christ; but in his person we have a mirror, which
doth represent unto us the universal providence of God, which doth stretch
itself throughout the whole world; yet doth it specially shine unto us who are
the members of Christ. Luke setteth down two things in this place, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foreknowledge</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and the <i>decree </i>of God. And although the foreknowledge of God is
former in order, (because God doth first see what he will determine, before he
doth indeed determine the same,) yet doth he put the same after the counsel and
decree of God, to the end we may know that God would nothing, neither appointed
anything, save that which he had long before directed to his [its] end. For men
do oftentimes rashly decree many things, because they decree them suddenly.
Therefore, to the end Peter may teach that the counsel of God is not without
reason, he coupleth also therewithal his foreknowledge. Now, we must distinguish
these two, and so much the more diligently, because many are deceived in this
point. For passing over the counsel of God, wherewith he doth (guide and) govern
the whole world, they catch at his bare foreknowledge. Thence cometh that common
distinction, that although God doth foresee all things, yet doth he lay no
necessity upon his creatures. And, indeed, it is true that God doth know this
thing or that thing before, for this cause, because it shall come to pass; but
as we see that Peter doth teach that God did not only foresee that which befell
Christ, but it was decreed by him. And hence must be gathered a general
doctrine; because God doth no less show his providence in governing the whole
world, than in ordaining and appointing the death of Christ. Therefore, it
belongeth to God not only to know before things to come, but of his own will to
determine what he will have done. This second thing did Peter declare when he
said, that he was delivered by the certain and determinate counsel of God.
Therefore, the foreknowledge of God is another thing than the will of God,
whereby he governeth and ordereth all things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some, which are of quicker sight, confess that God
doth not only foreknow, but also govern with his beck what things soever are
done in this world. Nevertheless, they imagine a confused government, as if God
did give liberty to his creatures to follow their own nature. They say that the
sun is ruled by the will of God, because, in giving light to us, he doth his
duty, which was once enjoined him by God. They think that man hath free-will
after this sort left him, because his nature is disposed or inclined unto the
free choice of good and evil. But they which think so do feign that God sitteth
idle in heaven. The Scripture teacheth us far otherwise, which ascribeth unto
God a special government in all things, and in man&#8217;s actions.
Notwithstanding, it is our duty to ponder and consider to what end it teacheth
this; for we must beware of doting speculations, wherewith we see many carried
away. The Scripture will exercise our faith, that we may know that we are
defended by the hand of God, lest we be subject to the injuries of Satan and the
wicked. It is good for us to embrace this one thing; neither did Peter mean
anything else in this place. Yea, we have an example set before us in Christ,
whereby we may learn to be wise with sobriety. For it is out of question, that
his flesh was subject to corruption, according to nature. But the providence of
God did set the same free. If any man ask, whether the bones of Christ could be
broken or no? it is not to be denied, that they were subject to breaking
naturally, yet could there no bone be broken, because God had so appointed and
determined,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431936&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
19:36.) By this example (I say) we are taught so to give the chiefest room to
God&#8217;s providence, that we keep ourselves within our bounds, and that we
thrust not ourselves rashly and indiscreetly into the secrets of God, whither
our eyesight doth not pierce.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the hands of the
wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Because Peter seemeth to grant
that the wicked did obey God, hereupon followeth two absurdities;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F106</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the one, either that God is the author of evil, or that men do not sin, what
wickedness soever they commit. I answer, concerning the second, that the wicked
do nothing less than obey God, howsoever they do execute that which God hath
determined with himself. For obedience springeth from a voluntary affection; and
we know that the wicked have a far other purpose. Again, no man obeyeth God save
he which knoweth his will. Therefore, obedience dependeth upon the knowledge of
God&#8217;s will. Furthermore, God hath revealed unto us his will in the law;
wherefore, those men
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F107</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
do obey God, who do that alone which is agreeable to the law of God; and, again,
which submit themselves willingly to his government. We see no such thing in all
the wicked, whom God doth drive hither and thither, they themselves being
ignorant. No man, therefore, will say that they are excusable under this color,
because they obey God; forasmuch as both the will of God must be sought in his
law, and they, so much as in them lieth, do
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F108</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to resist God. As touching the other point, I deny that God is the author of
evil; because there is a certain noting of a wicked affection in this word. For
the wicked deed is esteemed according to the end whereat a man aimeth. When men
commit theft or murder, they offend
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F109</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for this cause, because they are thieves or murderers; and in theft and murder
there is a wicked purpose. God, who useth their wickedness, is to be placed in
the higher degree. For he hath respect unto a far other thing, because he will
chastise the one, and exercise the patience of the other; and so he doth never
decline from his nature, that is, from perfect righteousness. So that, whereas
Christ was delivered by the hands of wicked men, whereas he was crucified, it
came to pass by the appointment and ordinance of God. But treason, which is of
itself wicked, and murder, which hath in it so great wickedness, must not be
thought to be the works of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having loosed the sorrows of
death.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By the sorrows of death I
understand some farther thing than the bodily sense or feeling. For those which
duly consider the nature of death, because they hear that it is the curse of
God, must needs conceive that God is angry in death. Hence cometh marvelous
horror, wherein there is greater misery than in death itself. Furthermore,
Christ died upon this occasion that he might take upon him our guiltiness. That
inward fear of conscience, which made him so afraid that he sweat blood when he
presented himself before the throne and tribunal seat of God, did more vex him,
and brought upon him greater horror, than all the torments of the flesh. And
whereas Peter saith, that Christ did wrestle with such sorrows, and doth also
declare that he had the victory, by this it cometh to pass that the faithful
ought not now to be afraid of death; for death hath not the like quality now
which was in Adam; because by the victory of Christ the curse is swallowed up,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461554&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:54.) We feel, indeed, yet the pricking of sorrows, but such as do
not wholly wound us, whilst that we hold up the buckler of faith against them.
He added a reason, because it was impossible that Christ should be oppressed by
death, who is the author of life.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F110</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which was both declared and witnessed by certain and evident testimonies, and
which might also have been gathered out of the continual doctrine of the
prophets, was to be proved to the Jews as some new and strange thing. And no
marvel. For we see that although Christ had oftentimes beat
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F111</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the same into his disciples&#8217; heads, yet did they profit but a little. And
yet did they retain certain principles of true doctrine, which might have made a
way for them unto the knowledge of Christ, as we shall see by and by. Therefore,
because the gift of the Spirit was a fruit of the resurrection of Christ, he
proveth by the testimony of David that Christ must needs have risen again, that
the Jews may thereby know that he was the author of the gift. For he taketh it
as a thing which all men grant, that he was raised up from death, that he may
live not for himself, but for his. Now we see Peter&#8217;s drift; that that
ought to seem no strange thing which was foretold so long before; and that Jesus
is also Christ, because David did prophecy of him, as of the tied of the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First of all, we must see whether this place ought
altogether to be understood of Christ, as Peter affirmeth; that done, if there
be any thing in the words worth noting, we will in order discuss it. Peter
denieth that that agreeth with David which is said in this
place:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thou shalt not
suffer thine Holy One to see corruption,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;191610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
16:10,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">because David&#8217;s carcass was corrupt in the
grave. It seemeth at the first blush to be but a light argument. For a man might
easily object, that the word is not to be urged, forasmuch as David meant
nothing else, save only to exempt himself from destruction. Therefore, howsoever
corruption did touch him, yet doth that no whit hinder but that he may easily
say that he was safe from the danger thereof, because he knew that the Lord
would deliver him. Yea, it seemeth to be a repetition of the former sentence,
according to the common custom of the Hebrew tongue. Which if it be so, the
sense shall be plain, that God will not suffer him to be oppressed with death,
or that death should consume him. And this interpretation is confirmed by that
where we read <i>hell, </i>it is in Hebrew
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ls</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
(seol;) </i>where we read <i>corruption, </i>there it is
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tj&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
(shachat;) </i>both these words do signify the grave. By<i> </i>this means David
should say twice, that he shall be delivered from death by the grace of God.
Finally, he saith the same thing in this place, which he saith,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;194915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
49:15,) &#8220;God shall redeem my soul from the hand of hell.&#8221; Like as,
on the other side, when he speaketh of the reprobates, he is wont to take
<i>&#8220;going </i>down into the grave&#8221; for destruction. I answer
briefly, that there is some greater thing expressed in this place than the
common redemption or deliverance of the godly. David, indeed, doth promise that
God will be his eternal deliverer, as well in life as in death. Neither had he
been much better for this, to have been once delivered from one danger, unless
he had hoped that he should be safe even unto the end through God&#8217;s
protection; but he speaketh of such safety as is not common.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F112</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And surely the words do sound that he speaketh of some new and singular
privilege. Admit I grant that it is a repetition, and that there is all one
thing uttered in these two members, &#8220;Thou shalt not leave my soul in
hell;&#8221; and, &#8220;Thou shalt not suffer me to see corruption;&#8221; yet
do I deny that it is simply to be understood that God will deliver his Holy One
from eternal destruction; for freedom from corruption is promised by name.
Neither do I pass for this, that
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tj&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(shachat) </i>doth signify the grave, as
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ls</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
(seol,) </i>which is put in the former member. For although I do not stand nor
contend about the words, yet must we respect the etymology. Therefore, forasmuch
as the grave is called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tj&ccedil;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>(shachat) </i>because it doth corrupt man&#8217;s body with rottenness, it is
not to be doubted but that David meant to note that quality. Therefore, the
place is not so much expressed by this word, as the condition of rotting. So
that the sense is, that God will not suffer him of whom the Psalm speaketh
&#8220;to rot or corrupt in the grave.&#8221; And forasmuch as David was not
free from this necessity, it followeth that the prophecy was neither truly nor
perfectly fulfilled in him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And that the Psalm ought altogether to be expounded
of Christ, the thing itself doth prove. For seeing that David was one of the
sons of Adam, he could not escape that universal condition and estate of
mankind,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Dust thou art, and
unto dust thou shalt
return,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010319&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
3:19;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">the grave standeth open (I say) for all the children
of Adam, that it may swallow them up, and consume them; so that no man can
exempt himself from corruption. So that, beholding ourselves apart from Christ,
we see the grave prepared for us, which threateneth to us corruption. Wherefore,
if David be separated from Christ, that shall not belong to him which is here
said, that he shall be preserved from the grave. Therefore, when he boasteth
that he shall be free from the grave, as touching corruption, without all doubt
he placeth himself in the body of Christ, wherein death was overcome, and the
kingdom thereof abolished. But and if David do promise himself exempting from
the grave in another respect, save only so far forth as he is a member of
Christ, hereby it appeareth that this freedom must begin at Christ as at the
head. What man soever shall be of sound judgment shall easily know that this is
a good argument. God did put all mankind under corruption; therefore, David,
inasmuch as he was of the number of men, could not be free from the same.
Neither is it to be doubted, but that the Jews, before whom this sermon was
made, forasmuch as without question that maxim was of force amongst them, that
they were to hope for the restoring of things at the hands of Christ alone, did
the more readily stay themselves upon
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F113</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the words of Peter; because they saw that that could no otherwise be which the
words do import, unless they should apply it to the Messias. For they were not
come to that point of impudence, at least those of whom mention is made here,
that they durst cavil in matters which were evident; for God had then offered
unto his disciples those which were godly hearers, and apt to be taught. They
sought the Messias in the Old Testament. They knew that David was a figure of
him. There was amongst them some religion and reverence of the Scriptures then;
but now the impudency of all the whole nation almost is desperate. Howsoever
they be urged, they wrench themselves out one way or other.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F114</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Where there is no way to escape, yet they break through; although they be
overcome, yet will they not yield; neither is it to be doubted but that this
their shameless forwardness is a punishment for their ungodliness. But let us
return unto Peter&#8217;s sermon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Seeing that David doth not only affirm that God also
shall be his deliverer, but doth express a singular way and means; namely, that
he shall not be subject to the corruption of the grave, Peter doth for good
causes gather, that that doth not properly appertain unto him, for that his body
was corrupt in the grave. And now, because this had been somewhat hard to be
spoken among the Jews, he mollifieth the hardness with a circumlocution. For he
doth not flatly deny in one word that that was fulfilled indeed in David, but
doth only by the way
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F115</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
signify so much unto them, because he lieth consumed in the grave after the
common custom of other men. And David did so prophesy of Christ, that he did
both apply this consolation unto himself privately, and&#8217; also extend the
same unto the whole body of the Church. For that which is sound and perfect in
the head is spread abroad, being afterward poured out into all the members.
Neither is it to be denied but that David spoke of himself in this place; yet
only so far forth as he beheld himself in Christ, as in the mirror of life.
First, he hath respect unto Christ; after that he turneth his eyes toward
himself, and others the faithful. So that we have a general doctrine prescribed
unto us in this plate, concerning the nature of faith, the spiritual joy of
conscience: and the hope of eternal deliverance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I
saw</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We must hold this principle. If we
will have God present with us, we must set him before our eyes; and that before
he do appear; for the prospect of faith pierceth far further than unto the
present experience. Therefore faith hath this property, to set God always before
it as a guide in all dangers and confused matters. For there is nothing that
doth so much hold us up, as when we know that God is present with us; as the
opinion of his absence doth often cast us down, and at length quite discourage
us. David addeth, That he took not heed in vain unto the direction of God.
&#8220;He is (saith he) at my right hand;&#8221; whereby he doth signify that we
need not to fear lest we be deceived, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F116</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when as we set him before us at present; for we shall always feel his help most
ready. Faith, in hoping for the help of God, ought to prevent and overgo
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F117</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
all experience, and whatsoever is perceived by the sense; but so soon as it
shall give this glory to God, that it doth behold him in his Word, although he
be absent, and so, consequently, invisible, it shall be overcome with the effect
of the thing. For the measure of faith is not able to comprehend the infinite
greatness of the power and goodness of God. He draweth a similitude from those
which, when they will underprop the weak, or strengthen the fearful, do join
themselves unto their side. Not to be moved, is not to be thrown down from their
degree, but to remain firm in their estate; like as also
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;194605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
46:5, God is in the midst of it, therefore shall it not be moved. For although
it come to pass sometimes that the godly be sore shaken, yet because they come
to themselves again, they are said to continue firm. Therefore, there is no
cause why they should be afraid of falling, who are upholden by the help of God.
Like as, on the other side, those which place their strength anywhere else save
only in God, they shall be like to fall at every blast of wind, but at any mean
wind of temptation they shall fall to the ground.</font><br></div>

the joy which Christ promised to his disciples should be full in them, and which
he testified could not be taken from them,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431622&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John

whole man, which we have through the protection of God. Neither is this any let,
because the faithful are continually out of quiet and tremble; for as in the
midst of sorrows they do nevertheless rejoice; so there are no troubles so great
that can break them of their rest. If any man object, that the peace of the
faithful doth consist in the spirit, and that it is not in the flesh: I answer,
that the faithful do rest in body; not that they are free from troubles, but
because they believe that God careth for them wholly, and that not only their
soul shall be safe through his protection, but their body also.</font><br></div>

is derived and set for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>corruption</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

note the same. Those things which are disputed in this place by divers,
concerning the descending of Christ into hell, are in my judgment superfluous;
because they are far from the intent and purpose of the prophet. For the word
<i>anima, </i>or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>soul,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>doth not so much signify the spirit being of an immortal essence as the life
itself. For when a man is dead, and lieth in the grave, the grave is said to
rule over his life. Whereas the Grecians translate it <i>holy, </i>it is in
Hebrew
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">tsj</font><font face="Palatino">,
which doth properly signify <i>meek, </i>or <i>gentle, </i>but Luke did not much
regard this, because it doth not much appertain unto the present purpose.
Furthermore, gentleness and meekness is so often commended in the faithful,
because it behoveth them to imitate and resemble the nature of their
Father.</font><br></div>

raised from death to life, he acknowledgeth that it was a great good gift of
God. This was in such sort fulfilled in Christ, that there wanted nothing unto
perfection. As for the members they have their measure. Therefore Christ was far
from corruption, that he may be the first-fruits of those which rise from death,

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore, seeing he was a
prophet</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He showeth, by two reasons,
that it is no marvel if David do speak of things that should come to pass long
after his time; the former is, because he was a prophet. And we know that things
to come, and such as are removed far from the knowledge of men, are revealed
unto the prophets. Therefore, it were wickedness to measure their speeches
according to the common manner and order which we use in measuring the speeches
of other men, forasmuch as they go beyond the long courses of years, having the
Spirit for their director. Whereupon they are also called seers; because being
placed, as it were, upon an high tower,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">f121</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they see those things which, by reason of great distance, are hidden from other
men. Another reason is, because Christ was promised to him peculiarly. This
maxim was so common amongst the Jews, that they had ever now and then the son of
David in their mouth, so often as there was any mention made of Christ. They be
no such arguments, I confess, as do necessarily prove that this prophecy is to
be expounded of Christ; neither was that Peter&#8217;s intent and purpose; but
first he meant to prevent the contrary objection, whence David had such skill to
foretell a thing which was unknown. Therefore he saith, That he knew Christ,
both by prophetical revelation, and also by singular promise. Furthermore, this
principle was of great
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:4) force amongst the better-minded sort which Paul setteth down, that Christ
is the end of the law.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F122</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
No man, therefore, did doubt of this, but that this was the mark whereat all the
prophets did aim, to lead the godly unto Christ as it were by the hand.
Therefore, what notable or extraordinary thing soever they did utter, the Jews
were commonly persuaded that it did agree with Christ. Furthermore, we must
note, that Peter doth reason soundly, when he gathered that David was not
ignorant of that which was the chiefest point of all
revelations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He had sworn with an
oath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God swore not only to the end he
might make David believe his promise, but also that the thing promised might be
had in greater estimation. And to this end, in my judgment, it is here repeated,
that the Jews may think with themselves of what great weight the promise was,
which God did make so notable (and so famous.) The same admonition is profitable
for us also. For we need not to doubt of this, but that the Lord meant to set
forth the excellency of the covenant by putting in a solemn oath. In the mean
season, this is also a fit remedy for the infirmity of our faith, that the
sacred name of God is set forth unto us,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F123</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that his words may carry the greater credit. These words, &#8220;according to
the flesh,&#8221; do declare that there was some more noble thing in Christ than
the flesh. Therefore Christ did so come of the seed of David as he was man, that
he doth nevertheless, retain his divinity; and so the distinction between the
two natures is plainly expressed; when as Christ is called the Son of God,
according to his eternal essence, in like sort as he is called the seed of David
according to the flesh.</font><br></div>

Whereupon it followeth that that was fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth which David
did foreshow concerning Christ. After that he intreateth of the fruit or effect.
For it was requisite for him to declare that first, that Christ is alive.
Otherwise it had been an absurd and incredible thing that he should be the
author of so great a miracle. Notwithstanding he doth therewithal teach us, that
he did not rise for his own sake alone, but that he might make the whole Church
partaker of his life, having poured out the Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>33.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He being therefore exalted by the
right hand of God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The right hand is
taken in this place for the hand or power, in like sort as it is taken
everywhere in the Scripture. For this is his drift, to declare that it was a
wonderful work of God, in that he had exalted his Christ (whom men thought to be
quite destroyed by death) unto so great glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
promise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of the Spirit for the Spirit
which was promised. For he had oftentimes before promised the Spirit to his
apostles. Therefore Peter doth signify, that Christ. had obtained power of God
the Father to fulfill the same. And he maketh mention of the promise in plain
words, to the end the <i>Jews </i>may know that this came not to pass suddenly,
but that the words of the prophet were now verified, which went long time before
the thing itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, whereas it is said that he obtained it
of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is to be applied to the
person of the Mediator. For both these are truly said, that Christ sent the
Spirit from himself and from the Father. He sent him from himself, because he is
eternal God; from the Father, because in as much as he is man, he receiveth that
of the Father which he giveth us. And Peter speaketh wisely according to the
capacity of the ignorant, lest any man should move a question out of season
concerning the power of Christ. And surely forasmuch as it is the office of
Christ to direct us unto his Father, this is a most apt form of speaking for the
use of godliness, that Christ being placed, as it were, in the midst between God
and us, doth deliver unto us with his own hand those gifts which he hath
received at the hands of his Father. Furthermore, we must note this order that
he saith, that the Spirit was sent by Christ after that he was exalted. This
agreeth with those sentences:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The Spirit was not
yet given,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">because Christ was not
yet glorified,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430739&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
7:39.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And again,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Unless I go hence,
the Spirit will not come,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
16:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Not because the Spirit began then first to be given,
wherewith the holy fathers were endued since the beginning of the world; but
because God did defer this more plentiful abundance of grace, until such time as
he had placed Christ in his princely seat; which is signified by this word
<i>poured out, </i>as we saw a little before. For by this means the force and
fruit of Christ his death and resurrection is sealed; and we do also thereby
know, that we have lost nothing by Christ his departing out of the world;
because, though he be absent in body, yet is he present with us after a better
sort, to wit, by the grace of his Holy Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For doubtless
David</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Although they might easily gather
by the very effect which they saw with their eyes, that the principality was
granted and given to Christ, yet to the end his glory may carry the greater
credit, he proveth, by David his testimony, that it was so appointed in times
past by God, that Christ should be lifted up unto the highest degree of honor.
For these words, to &#8220;sit at the right hand of God,&#8221; import as much
as to bear the chief rule, as we shall afterward more at large declare. Yet
before he reciteth the prophecy, he saith that it agreeth only to Christ.
Therefore, to the end the sense may be more manifest, the sentence must thus
run. David pronounceth that it was decreed by God that a king should sit at his
right hand. But this doth not appertain unto David, who was never extolled unto
so great dignity. Therefore lie speaketh this of Christ. Furthermore, that ought
to have seemed no strange thing unto the Jews which was foretold by the oracle
of the Holy Ghost. Hereby it appeareth in what sense Peter denieth that David
ascended into heaven. He intreateth not in this place of the soul of David,
whether it were received into blessed rest, and the heavenly dwelling or no; but
the ascending into heaven comprehendeth under it those things which Paul
teacheth in the Epistle to the Ephesians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490409&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:9), where he placeth Christ above all heavens, that he may fulfill all things.
Wherefore the disputation concerning the estate of the dead is altogether
superfluous in this place. For Peter goeth about to prove no other thing but
this, that the prophecy concerning the sitting at the right hand of God was not
fulfilled in David, and that, therefore, the truth thereof must be sought
elsewhere. And forasmuch as it can be found nowhere else save only in Jesus
Christ, it resteth that the Jews
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F125</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
do know that that is showed to them in Christ which was foretold them so long
before. That is true, indeed, that David reigned, God being the author hereof,
and, in some respect, he was God&#8217;s vicegerent; yet not so that he might be
above all creatures. Wherefore, this sitting agreeth to none, unless he excel
and be above all the whole world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord said unto my
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the most lawful manner of
ruling, when as the king (or by what other title soever he be called) doth know
that he is ordained of God, therefore David pronounceth that the commandment to
reign was given unto Christ by name,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
110:1.) As if he should say, He took not the honor to himself rashly, but did
only obey God when he commanded him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
5:5.) ]Now must we see whether Peter&#8217;s reason be sound enough or no. He
gathereth that the words concern Christ, because the sitting at the right hand
of God doth not agree to David. It seemeth that this may be refuted, because
David did reign by the peculiar commandment, name, and help of God; which is to
sit at the right hand of God. But Peter taketh that for a thing which all men
grant, which is true, and which I have already touched, that a greater and more
royal government is here spoken of than that which David did enjoy. For
howsoever he was God&#8217;s vicegerent and did, as it. were, represent his
person in reigning, yet is this power far inferior to that, to sit even at the
right side of God. For this is attributed to Christ, because he is placed above
all principality, and above every name that is named, both in this world, and in
the world to come,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:21.) Seeing that David is far inferior to the angels, he doth possess no such
place that he should be counted next to God. For he must ascend far above all
heavens, that he may come to the right hand of God. Wherefore no man is said to
sit at it, rightly and properly, save only he which doth surpass all creatures
in the degree of honor. As for him which is resident amongst the creatures,
although he be reckoned in the order of angels, yet is he far from that
highness. Again, we must not seek the right hand of God amongst the creatures;
but it doth also surpass all heavenly principalities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, there is great weight even in the
sentence itself. The king is commanded to bear the chiefest rule, until God have
put all his enemies under his feet. Surely, although I grant that; he name of
such an honorable sitting may be applied unto earthly lordship: yet do I deny
that David did reign until such time as all his enemies were subdued. For we do
hereby gather that the kingdom of Christ is eternal. But the kingdom of David
was not only temporal, but also frail, and of a small
continuance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, when David died, he left many enemies alive
here and there. he got many notable victories, but he was far from subduing all
his enemies. He made many of those people which were round about him tributaries
to him; some did he put to flight and destroyed; but what is all this unto all?
Finally, we may prove by the whole text of the Psalm, that there can nothing
else be understood save only the kingdom of Christ. That I may pass over other
things: that which is here spoken touching the eternal priesthood is too far
disagreeing from David&#8217;s person. I know that the Jews do prattle, that
kings&#8217; sons are called elsewhere <i>cohenim. </i>But he intreateth here of
the priesthood as it is ascribed by Moses to the king Melchizedek. And there is
established by a solemn oath a certain new kind of priesthood. And, therefore,
we must not here imagine any common or ordinary thing. But it had been
wickedness for David to thrust himself into any part of the priest&#8217;s
office. How should he then be called <i>cohen, </i>greater than Aaron, and
consecrated of God for ever? But because I do not intend at this present to
expound the whole Psalm, let this reason suffice which Peter bringeth: That he
is made Lord of heaven and earth, which sitteth at the right hand of God. As
touching the second member of the verse, read those things which I have noted
upon the fifteenth chapter
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461525&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:25) of the former Epistle to the Corinthians, concerning the
putting of his enemies under his feet.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>36.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore, let all the house of
Israel know</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The house of Israel did
confess that that Christ should come which was promised; yet did they not know
Who it was. Therefore, Peter concludeth, that Jesus: whom they had so spitefully
handled, yea, whose name they did so greatly detest: is he whom they ought to
acknowledge to be their Lord, and whom they ought to reverence. For, (saith he,)
God hath made him Lord and Christ; that is, you must look for none other than
him whom God hath made and given. Furthermore, he saith, That he was made,
because God the Father gave him this honor. He joineth the title Lord with the
word Christ, because it was a common thing among the Jews, that the Redeemer
should be anointed upon this condition, that he might be the Head of the Church,
and that the chiefest power over all things might be given him. He speaketh unto
the whole house of Israel; as if he should say, Whosoever will be reckoned among
the sons of Jacob, and do also look for the promise, let them know for a surety,
that this is he and none other. He useth the
word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because God had separated that
name and family from all other people. And he saith
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">asfalwv</font><font face="Palatino">,
or for a surety, not only that they may repose their sure confidence and trust
in Christ, but that he may take away all occasion of doubting from those which
do oftentimes willingly doubt even of matters which are certain and sure. In the
end of his oration he upbraideth unto them again, that they did crucify him,
that being touched with greater grief of conscience, they may desire
remedy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And now, forasmuch as they know that Jesus is the
Anointed of the Lord, the governor of the Church, and the giver of the Holy
Ghost, the accusation hath so much the more force. For the putting of him to
death was not only full of cruelty and wickedness, but also a testimony of
outrageous disloyalty against God, of sacrilege and unthankfulness, and,
finally, of apostasy. But it was requisite that they should be so wounded, lest
they should have been slow to seek for medicine. And yet, notwithstanding, they
did not crucify him with their own hands; but this is more than sufficient to
make them guilty, in that they desired to have him put to death. And we also are
accused by this same voice, if we crucify him in ourselves, being already
glorified in heaven, making a mock of him, as saith the Apostle,

heard. And he noteth a double fruit; first, that they were touched with the
feeling of sorrow; and, secondly, that they were obedient to Peter&#8217;s
counsel. This is the beginning of repentance, this is the entrance unto
godliness, to be sorry for our sins, and to be wounded with the feeling of our
miseries. For so long as men are careless, they cannot take such heed unto
doctrine as they ought. And for this cause the word of God is compared to a
sword,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
4:12,) because it doth mortify our flesh, that we may be offered to God for a
sacrifice. But there must be added unto this pricking in heart readiness to
obey. Cain and Judas were pricked in heart, but despair did keep them back from
submitting themselves unto God,

from God. And surely when David affirmeth that a contrite spirit and an humble
heart is a sacrifice acceptable to God, he speaketh of voluntary pricking;
forasmuch as there is fretting and fuming mixed with the prickings of the
wicked. Therefore, we must take a good heart to us, and lift up our mind with
this hope of salvation, that we may be ready to addict and give over ourselves
unto God, and to follow whatsoever he shall command. We see many oftentimes
pricked, who, notwithstanding, do fret and murmur, or else forwardly strive and
struggle, and so, consequently, go furiously mad. Yea, this is the cause why

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peter
said</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hereby we see that those do never
go away empty which ask at the mouth of the Lord, and do offer themselves unto
him to be ruled and taught; for that promise must needs be true, Knock, and it
shall be opened unto you,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
7:7.) Therefore, whosoever shall be rightly prepared to learn, the Lord will not
suffer his godly desire to be in vain; for he is a most faithful master, so that
he hath scholars which are apt to be taught and studious. Wherefore, there is no
cause why he should fear, lest he suffer us to be destitute of sound counsel, if
we be attentive and ready to hear him, and do not refuse to embrace whatsoever
he shall teach us. And let us suffer ourselves to be governed by the counsel and
authority of those men whom he offereth unto us to teach us. for this ready
obedience cometh thence so suddenly in those which addict themselves unto the
apostles, because they are persuaded that they are sent of God, to show them the
way of salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Repent.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>There is greater force in the Greek word, for it doth signify the conversion
of the mind, that the whole man may be renewed and made another man, which thing
must be diligently noted, because this doctrine was miserably corrupted in the
time of Popery; for they translated the name of repentance almost unto certain
external rites. They babble somewhat, indeed, about the reigned contrition of
the heart; but they touch that part very slightly, and they stand principally
upon the external <i>exercises </i>of the body, which were little worth; yea,
though there were in them no corruption; but they urge nothing else in a manner
but reigned trifles, wherewith men are wearied in vain. Wherefore, let us know
that this is the true repentance, when a man is renewed in the spirit of his
mind, as Paul teacheth,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:2.) Neither need we to doubt of this; but that Peter did preach plainly of
the force and nature of repentance; but Luke doth only touch the chief points,
and doth not reckon up the words of the oration which he made. We must,
therefore, know thus much, that Peter did at the first exhort the Jews unto
repentance; and that done, he lifted them up with hope of pardon; for he
promised them forgiveness of sins, which two things are the two parts of the
gospel, as we know full well; and, therefore, when Christ will briefly teach
what the doctrine of the gospel doth contain, he saith, that repentance and
remission of sins
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422447&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
24:47) must be preached in his name. Furthermore, because we are reconciled unto
God only by the intercession of Christ&#8217;s death, neither are our sins
otherwise purged,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F126</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and done away, save only by his blood, therefore, Peter calleth us back unto him
by name. He putteth baptism in the fourth place, as the seal whereby the promise
of grace is confirmed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Wherefore, we have in these few words almost the
whole sum of Christianity, namely, how a man renouncing himself and taking his
farewell of the world, may addict himself wholly to God; secondly, How he may be
delivered by free forgiveness of sins, and so adopted into the number of the
children of God. And forasmuch as we can obtain none of all these things without
Christ, the name of Christ is therewithal set forth unto us, as the only
foundation of faith and repentance. And we must also note this, that we do so
begin repentance when we are turned unto God, that we must prosecute the same
during our life; therefore, this sermon must continually sound in the Church,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;410115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
1:15;) not that those men may begin the same, who will be counted faithful, and
have a place already in the Church; but that they may go forward in the same;
although many do usurp the name of faithful men, which had never any beginning
of repentance. Wherefore, we must observe this order in teaching, that those
which do yet live unto the world and the flesh may begin to crucify the old man,
that they may rise unto newness of life, and that those who are already entered
the course of repentance may continually go forward towards the mark.
Furthermore, because the inward conversion of the heart ought to bring forth
fruits in the life, repentance cannot be rightly taught unless works be
required, not those frivolous works which are only in estimation amongst the
Papists, but such as are sound testimonies of innocence and
holiness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be baptized every one of
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Although in the text and order of the
words, baptism doth here go before remission of sins, yet doth it follow it in
order, because it is nothing else but a sealing of those good things which we
have by Christ that they may be established in our consciences; therefore, after
that Peter had intreated of repentance, he calleth the Jews unto the hope of
grace and salvation; and, therefore, Luke well afterwards, in Paul&#8217;s
sermon, joineth faith and repentance together in the same sense, wherein he
putteth forgiveness of sins in this place, and that for good considerations; for
the hope of salvation consisteth in the free imputation of righteousness; and we
are counted just, freely before God, when he forgiveth us our sins. And as I
said before, that the doctrine of repentance hath a daily use in the Church so
must we think of the forgiveness of sins, that the same is continually offered
unto us; and surely it is no less necessary for us during the whole course of
our life, than<i> </i>at our first entrance into the Church, so that it should
profit us nothing to be once received into favor by God, unless this embassage
should have a continual course; be-reconciled unto God, because</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;he which knew no
sin was made sin for us, that we might be the righteousness of God in
him,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 5:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, the Papists do so corrupt this other part
of the gospel, that they quite exclude the remission of sins, which was to be
obtained by Christ. They confess their sins are freely forgiven in baptism, but
they will have them redeemed with satisfactions after baptism; and although they
mix the grace of Christ together therewithal, yet because they inwrap the same
in men&#8217;s merits, they do by this means overthrow the whole doctrine of the
gospel; for, first, they take from men&#8217;s consciences the certainty of
faith; that done, forasmuch as they part the forgiveness of sins between the
death of Christ and our satisfactions, they do altogether deprive us of
Christ&#8217;s benefit. For Christ doth not reconcile us unto God in part, but
wholly, neither can we obtain remission of sins by him, unless it be whole and
perfect. But the Papists are much deceived therein, who restrain baptism unto
the nativity and former life, as if the signification and force thereof did not
reach even unto death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us know, therefore, that forgiveness of sins is
grounded in Christ alone, and that we must not think upon any other satisfaction
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F127</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
save only that which he hath performed by the sacrifice of his death. And for
this cause, as we have already said, doth Peter express his name, whereby he
doth signify unto us, that none of all these things can be rightly taught,
unless Christ be set in the midst, to the end the effect of this doctrine may be
sought in him. That needeth no long exposition where he commandeth them to be
baptized for the remission of sins; for although God hath once reconciled men
unto himself in Christ&#8221; by not imputing unto them their sins,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:19,) and doth now imprint in our hearts the faith thereof by his
Spirit; yet, notwithstanding, because baptism is the seal whereby he doth
confirm unto us this benefit, and so, consequently, the earnest and pledge of
our adoption, it is worthily said to be given us for the remission of sins. For
because we receive Christ&#8217;s gifts by faith, and baptism is a help to
confirm and increase our faith, remission of sins, which is an effect of faith,
is annexed unto it as unto the inferior mean. Furthermore, we must not fetch the
definition of baptism from this place, because Peter doth only touch a part
thereof. Our old man is crucified by baptism, as Paul teacheth, that we may rise
unto newness of life,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:4, 6.) And, again, we put on Christ himself, (1 Corinthians 12.) and the
Scripture teacheth every where, that it is also a sign and token of repentance,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480327&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:27.) But because Peter doth not intreat in thin place openly of the whole
nature of baptism, but speaking of the forgiveness of sins, doth, by the way,
declare that the confirmation thereof is in baptism, there doth no inconvenience
follow, if ye do omit the other part.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F128</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the name of
Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although baptism be no vain
figure, but a true and effectual testimony; notwithstanding, lest any man
attribute that unto the element of water which is there offered, the name of
Christ is plainly expressed, to the end we may know that it shall be a
profitable sign for us then, if we seek the force and effect thereof in Christ,
and know that we are, therefore, washed in baptism, because the blood of Christ
is our washing; and we do also hereby gather, that Christ is, the mark and end
whereunto baptism directeth us; wherefore, every one profiteth so much in
baptism as he learneth to look unto Christ. But here ariseth a question, Whether
it were lawful for Peter to change the form prescribed by Christ? The Papists do
think, at least feign so, and thence do they take a color of liberty to change
or abrogate the institutions of Christ. They confess that nothing ought to be
changed, as touching the substance, but they will have the Church to have
liberty to change whatsoever it will in the form. But this argument may easily
be answered. For we must first know that Christ did not indite and rehearse unto
his apostles magical words for enchanting, as the Papists do dream, but he did,
in few words, comprehend the sum of the mystery. Again, I deny that Peter doth
speak in this place of the form of baptism; but he doth simply declare that the
whole strength
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F129</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of baptism is contained in Christ; although Christ cannot be laid hold on by
faith without the Father by whom he was given us, and the Spirit by the which he
reneweth and sanctifieth us. The answer consisteth wholly in this, that he
intreateth not in this place of the certain form of baptizing, but the faithful
are called back unto Christ, in whom alone we have whatsoever baptism doth
prefigure unto us; for we are both made clean by his blood, and also we enter
into a new life by the benefit of his death and resurrection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall receive the gift of the
Spirit. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Because they were touched with
wondering when they saw the apostles suddenly begin to speak with strange
tongues, Peter saith that they shall be partakers of the same gift if they will
pass over unto Christ. Remission of sins and newness of life were the principal
things, and this was, as it were, an addition, that Christ should show forth
unto them his power by some visible gift. Neither ought this place to be
understood of the grace of sanctification, which is given generally to all the
godly. Therefore he promiseth them the gift of the Spirit, whereof they saw a
pattern in the diversity of tongues. Therefore this doth not properly appertain
unto us. For because Christ meant to set forth the beginning of his kingdom with
those miracles, they lasted but for a time; yet because the visible graces which
the Lord did distribute to his did shoe, as it were in a glass, that Christ was
the giver of the Spirit, therefore, that which Peter saith doth in some respect
appertain unto all the whole Church: ye shall receive the gift of the Spirit.
For although we do not receive it, that we may speak with tongues, that we may
be prophets, that we may cure the sick, that we may work miracles; yet is it
given us for a better use, that we may believe with the heart unto
righteousness, that our tongues may be framed unto true confession,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451010&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:10,) that we may pass from death to life,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430524&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
5:24) that we, which are poor and empty, may be made rich, that we may withstand
Satan and the world stoutly. Therefore, the grace of the Spirit shall always be
annexed unto baptism, unless the let be in ourselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>39.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the promise appertaineth
unto you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was requisite that this
should be expressly added, that the Jews might certainly think and persuade
themselves that the grace of Christ did belong as well to them as to the
apostles. And Peter proveth it thus, because the promise of God was made unto
them. For we must always look unto this, because [that] we cannot otherwise know
the will of God save only by his word. But it is not sufficient to have the
general word, unless we know that the same is appointed for us. Therefore Peter
saith, that those benefits which they see in him and his fellows in office were
in times past promised to the Jews; because this is required necessarily for the
certainty of faith, that every one be fully persuaded of this, that he is
comprehended in the number of those unto whom God speaketh. Finally, this is the
rule of a true faith, when I am thus persuaded that salvation is mine, because
that promise appertaineth unto me which offereth the same. And hereby we have
also a greater confirmation, when as the promise is extended unto those who were
before afar off. For God had made the covenant with the Jews,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;020422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
4:22.) If the force and fruit thereof come also unto the Gentiles, there is no
cause why the Jews should doubt of themselves, but that they shall find the
promise of God firm and stable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we must note these three degrees, that the
promise was first made to the Jews, and then to their children, and last of all,
that it is also to be imparted to the Gentiles. We know the reason why the Jews
are preferred before other people; for they are, as it were, the first begotten
in God&#8217;s family, yea, they were then separated from other people by a
singular privilege. Therefore Peter observeth a good order, when he giveth the
Jews the pre-eminence. Whereas he adjoineth their children unto them, it
dependeth upon the words of the promise: I will be thy God, and the God of thy
seed after thee,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;011707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:7,) where God doth reckon the children with the fathers in the grace of
adoption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This place, therefore, doth abundantly refute the
manifest error of the Anabaptists, which will not have infants, which are the
children of the faithful, to be baptized, as if they were not members of the
Church. They espy a starting hole in the allegorical
sense,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F130</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and they expound it thus, that by children are meant those which are spiritually
begotten. But this gross impudency doth nothing help them. It is plain and
evident that Peter spoke thus because God did adopt one nation peculiarly. And
circumcision did declare that the right of adoption was common even unto
infants. Therefore, even as God made his covenant with Isaac, being as yet
unborn, because he was the seed of Abraham, so Peter teacheth, that all the
children of the Jews are contained in the same covenant, because this promise is
always in force, I will be the God of your seed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to those which are afar
off.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Gentiles are named in the last
place, which were before strangers. For those which refer it unto those Jews
which were exiled afar off, (and driven) into far countries, they are greatly
deceived. For he speaketh not in this place of the distance of place; but he
noteth a difference between the <i>Jews </i>and the Gentiles, that they were
first joined to God by reason of the covenant, and so, consequently, became of
his family or household; but the Gentiles were banished from his kingdom. Paul
useth the same speech in the second chapter to Ephesians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:11,) that the Gentiles, which were strangers from the promises, are now drawn
near, through Jesus Christ, unto God. Because that Christ (the wall of
separation being taken away)hath reconciled both (the Jews and Gentiles) unto
the Father, and coming, he hath preached peace unto those which were nigh at
hand, and which were afar off. Now we understand Peter&#8217;s meaning. For to
the end he may amplify the grace of Christ, he doth so offer the same unto the
Jews, that he saith the Gentiles are also partakers thereof. And therefore he
useth this word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>call,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as if he should say: Like as God hath gathered you together into one
peculiar people heretofore by his voice, so the same voice shall sound
everywhere, that those which are afar off may come and join themselves unto you,
when as they shall be called by a new proclamation.</font><br></div>

have had hitherto, Luke did not recite the words of St Peter, but did only
briefly touch the chief points; notwithstanding he telleth us again in this
place, that Peter did not use doctrine only, but did add the pricks of
exhortations. And he expresseth plainly that tie stood much
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F131</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
hereupon. Whereas he saith, that he did exhort and beseech, he noteth therein
his earnestness. For it was not so easy a matter for them by and by
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F132</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to take their leave of those errors wherewith they were of late infected, and to
shake off the government of the priests whereunto they were accustomed.
Therefore it stood him upon to pull them violently out of this mire. The sum was
this, that they should beware of that froward generation. For they could not be
Christ&#8217;s unless they would depart from his professed enemies. The priests
and scribes were then in great authority, and forasmuch as they did cover
themselves under the visor [mask] of the Church, they did deceive the simple,
This did hinder and keep back a great many from coming to Christ. Also some
might waver, and other some might fall away from the right faith. Therefore
Peter plainly declareth that they are a froward generation, howsoever they may
boast of the title of the Church. For which cause he commandeth his hearers to
separate themselves from them, lest they entangle themselves in their wicked and
pestiferous fellowship. Whereas he saith, Be ye saved, he signifieth unto them
that they shall surely perish if they couple themselves with such a plague. And
surely experience doth teach us, how miserably those men are tossed to and fro
who cannot discern the voice of their pastor from the voice of other men; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F133</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

whilst they desire to stand in a doubt.

Therefore he commandeth them to depart from the wicked if they will be saved.
And this point of doctrine is not to be neglected. For it were not sufficient to
have Christ set before us, unless we were also taught to flee those things which
do lead us away from him. And it is the duty of a good shepherd to defend his
sheep from the wolves. So at this day, to the end we may keep the people in the
sincere doctrine of the gospel, we are ever now and then enforced to show and
testify how much Papistry differeth from Christianity, and what a hurtful plague
it is to be yoked with the unfaithful enemies of Christ. Neither ought Peter to
be accused of railing, because he calleth the reverend 6tthers, who had the
government of the Church
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F135</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in their hands at that day, a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>froward

draw the soul unto destruction are to be showed by their names. For men will not
beware of poison, unless they know that it is poison.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>41.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They, therefore, which
willingly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke showeth more plainly how
fruitful this one sermon which Peter made was: to wit, that it gained unto
Christ about three thousand men. And therewithal he declareth the nature and
force of faith when he saith, that with a prompt and ready
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F136</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
mind they embraced his word. Therefore, faith must begin with this readiness and
willing desire to obey. And because many do show themselves at the first very
willing, who afterward have in themselves no constancy or continuance, lest we
should think that it was some sudden pang
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F137</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which by and by fell away, Luke doth also afterward commend their constancy, who
(as he said) did willingly embrace this word of the apostles, showing that they
were joined unto the disciples, or that they were engrafted into the same body,
and that they continued in their doctrine. Therefore we must neither be slow to
obey, nor yet swift to leap back; but we must stick fast, and stand stoutly to
that doctrine which we did forthwith (without any tarriance [delay]) embrace.
Furthermore, this example ought to make us not a little ashamed. For whereas
there was a great multitude converted unto Christ with one sermon, an hundred
sermons can scarce move a few of us; and whereas Luke saith that they continued,
there is scarce one amongst ten that doth show even a mean desire to profit and
go forward, yea, rather, the more part doth soon loathe our doctrine. Woe be,
therefore, to the sluggishness and lightness of the world! </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>42.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In their
doctrine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Luke doth not only commend in
them the constancy of faith or of godliness, but he saith, also, that they did
constantly give themselves to those exercises which serve to the confirmation of
faith; to wit, that they studied continually to profit by hearing the apostles;
that they gave themselves much to prayer; that they did use fellowship and
breaking of bread very much.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As touching prayer and doctrine the sense is plain.
Communication or fellowship, and breaking of bread, may be taken diversely. Some
think that breaking of bread doth signify the Lord&#8217;s Supper; other some do
think that it signifieth alms; other some that the faithful did banquet together
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F138</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
among themselves. Some do think that
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">koinwnia</font><font face="Palatino">,
doth signify the celebrating of the Holy Supper; but I do rather agree to those
others who think that the same is meant by the breaking of bread. For
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">koinwnia</font><font face="Palatino">,
unless it have somewhat added unto it, is never found in this sense; therefore,
I do rather refer it unto mutual society and fellowship, unto alms, and unto
other duties of brotherly fellowship. And my reason why I would rather have
breaking of bread to be understood of the Lord&#8217;s Supper in this place is
this, because Luke doth reckon up those things wherein the public estate of the
Church is contained. Yea, he expresseth in this place four marks whereby the
true and natural face of the Church may be judged. Do we then seek the true
Church of Christ? The image thereof is lively depainted and set forth
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F139</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
unto us in this place. And he beginneth with doctrine which is, as it were, the
soul of the Church. Neither doth he name all manner of doctrine, but the
doctrine of the apostles, that is, that which the Son of God had delivered by
their hands. Therefore, wheresoever the pure voice of the gospel doth sound,
where men continue in the profession thereof, where they exercise themselves in
hearing the same ordinarily that they may profit, without all doubt there is the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hereby we may easily gather how frivolous the
boasting of the Papists is, whilst that they
carelessly</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F140</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
thunder out with fall mouth the name of the Church; whereas, notwithstanding,
they have most filthily corrupted the doctrine of the apostles. For if it be
duly examined, we shall find no sound part at all; and in most points they do as
much dissent from the same, and have as little agreement therewith as light with
darkness. The rule of worshipping God, which ought to be fetched out of the pure
Word of God alone, is only made and patched together
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F141</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
amongst the Papists, of the superstitious inventions of men. They have
translated unto the merits of works the hope of salvation, which ought to have
rested in Christ alone. The invocation of God is altogether polluted with
innumerable profane dotings of men. Finally, whatsoever is heard amongst them,
it is either a deforming of the apostles&#8217; doctrine, or else a clear

the foolish arrogancy of the Papists, as they can cloak their dealings with the
title of the Church. For this shall be the state,

whether they have retained the purity of doctrine, from which they are as far as
hell is from heaven. But they are wise enough in that point, because they will
have no controversy moved about doctrine. But we, as I have said, may freely
contemn that vain visor, [mask,] forasmuch as the Spirit of God doth pronounce
that the Church is principally to be (esteemed and) discerned by this mark, if
the simplicity or purity of the doctrine delivered by the apostles do flourish
(and be of force) in the same.</font><br></div>

flow from the first, as fruits or effects. For doctrine is the bond of brotherly
fellowship amongst us, and doth also set open unto us the gate unto God, that we
may call upon him. And the Supper is added unto doctrine instead of a
confirmation. Wherefore, Luke doth not in vain reckon up these four things, when
as he will describe unto us the well-ordered state of the Church. And we must
endeavor to keep and observe this order, if we will be truly judged to be the

themselves, unless they meet altogether to pray; wherein consisteth also the

show and sight of the Church was such, that it made others afraid which did not
consent unto [its] doctrine; and that was done for the preserving and furthering
of the Church. When there ariseth any seen all men set themselves stoutly
against the same; and as novelty is odious, the Jews would never have suffered
the Church of Christ to stand one minute of an hour,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F144</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
unless the Lord had restrained them with fear as with a bridle. Furthermore,
Luke noteth the manner of fear, that it was no such fear as bringeth men unto
the obedience of Christ, but such as causeth men to stand in a doubt, and so,
consequently, doth, as it were, so bind them hand and foot,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F145</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they dare not hinder the Lord&#8217;s work. Like as there be some at this
day who will willingly be ignorant of the gospel; or, at least, are so holden
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F146</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
with the cares of this world, that they cannot thoroughly join themselves unto
Christ; and yet they are not so hard-hearted but that they confess that the
truth is on our side; and, therefore, they rest, as it were, in the middle way,
neither do they favor the cruelty of the wicked, because they are afraid to
strive against God. And whereas he saith,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Every
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he speaketh thus by <i>synecdoche.
</i>For it is certain that many did contemn the hand of God, and that other some
were stricken with no great fear, but that they did furiously rage together
against the Church.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F147</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But Luke&#8217;s meaning was this, that there appeared such power of God in the
Church, that the people for the most part had not one word to say.

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And many
wonders.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This member serveth also to the
showing of the cause. For the miracles served to make them afraid, together with
other works of God, although this was not the only reason, but one of many, why
they were afraid to set themselves against God, who was on that side, as they
did gather by the miracles; whence we gather that they are not only profitable
for this to bring men to God, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F149</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but also to make the wicked somewhat more gentle, and that they may tame their
furiousness. Pharaoh was a man of desperate stubbornness,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;020808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
8:8, etc. 19,) and yet we see how miracles do sometimes pierce his obstinate
heart. He forgetteth them by and by; but when the hand of God is heavy upon him,
he is compelled through fear to yield. To be brief, Luke teacheth that the Jews
were by this means kept back, that the Church, which might easily have been
destroyed, might have got up her head. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F150</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Which thing we have oftentimes tried
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F151</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
even in our time. And he doth not only declare that they were bridled with fear,
lest they should be so bold as to attempt so much as they lusted to do hurt to
the Church, but that they were also humbled with reverence to the glory of the
gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>44.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Whereas I have translated it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>joined
together</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is word for word in St
Luke, <i>Into the same, or into one, </i>which may be expounded of the place; as
if he should have said that they were wont to dwell together in one place.
Notwithstanding, I had rather understand it of their consent (and agreement;) as
he will say in the fourth chapter, &#8220;That they had one heart,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440432&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
4:32.) And so he goeth forward orderly, when, as he beginneth with their mind,
he addeth afterward their bountifulness, as a fruit proceeding thence.
Therefore, he giveth us to understand that they were rightly joined together
with brotherly love amongst themselves, and that they did indeed declare the
same, because the rich men did sell their goods that they might help the poor.
And this is a singular example of love, and therefore doth Luke record the same,
to the end we may know that we must relieve the poverty of our brethren with our
plenty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this place hath need of a sound exposition,
because of fantastical [fanatical] spirits, which do feign a commonalty or
participation together of goods, whereby all policy or civil government is taken
away; as in this age the Anabaptists have raged, because they thought there was
no Church unless all men&#8217;s goods were put and gathered together, as it
were, in one heap, that they might all one with another take thereof. Wherefore,
we must in this point beware of two extremes. For many, under color of policy,
do keep close and conceal whatsoever they have; they defraud the poor, and they
think that they are twice righteous, so they take away no other men&#8217;s
goods. Other some are carried into the contrary error, because they would have
all things confused. But what doth Luke? Surely he noteth another order, when he
saith that there was choice made in the distribution. If any man object that no
man had any thing which was his own, seeing all things were common, we may
easily answer. For this community or participation together must be restrained
unto the circumstance which ensueth immediately; to wit, that the poor might be
relieved as every man had need. We know the old proverb, &#8220;All things are
common amongst friends.&#8221; When as the scholars of Pythagoras said thus,
they did not deny but that every man might govern his own house privately,
neither did they intend to make their own wives common; so this having of things
common, whereof Luke speaketh, and which he commendeth, doth not take away
household government; which thing shall better appear by the fourth chapter,
whereas he nameth two alone which sold their possessions of so many thousands.
Whence we gather that which I said even now, that they brought forth and made
common their goods in no other respect, save only that they might relieve the
present necessity. And the impudency of the monks was ridiculous, who did
profess that they did observe the apostles&#8217; rule, because they call
nothing their own; and yet, nevertheless, they neither sell any thing, neither
yet do they pass for any man&#8217;s
poverty;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F152</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but they stuff their idle bellies with the blood of the poor, neither do they
regard any other thing in their having of things common, save only that they may
be well filled and daintily, although all the whole world be hungry. Wherein,
then, are they like to the first disciples, with whom they will be thought to be
able to compare?

frequent the temple for this cause, because there was more opportunity and
occasion offered there to further the gospel. Neither were they drawn with the
holiness of the place, seeing they knew that the shadows of the law were ceased;
neither meant they to draw others by their example to have the temple in any
such reverence;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F154</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

their private cares, wherewith they had been drawn away elsewhere, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F155</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
did seek the Lord; they were continually in the temple, that they might gain
such unto Christ. There might be another reason which might induce them
hereunto, that they might have a mutual conference and imparting of doctrine
amongst themselves, which they could not have done so conveniently in a private
house, especially seeing they were so, many.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Breaking bread from house to
house.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke signifieth unto us, that
they did not only show some token of true godliness publicly, but that the
course and tenor of their private life was alone in that respect. For whereas
some do think that in this place, by breaking of bread is meant the Holy Supper,
it seemeth to me that Luke meant no such thing. He signifieth, therefore, unto
us, that they used to eat together, and that thriftily. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F156</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For those which make sumptuous banquets do not eat their meat together so
familiarly. Again, Luke addeth,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in singleness of
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>which is also a token of
temperance. In sum, his meaning is to declare, that their manner of living was
brotherly and sober. Some do join simplicity and gladness with the praise of
God; and both texts may well be allowed. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F157</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But because there can be no singleness of heart in praising God, unless the
stone be also in all parts of the life, therefore it is certain, that there is
mention made thereof in this sense, that the faithful did always use the same in
all places. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F158</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And we must also note the circumstance of time, that, being environed and beset
with many dangers, they were merry and joyful. The knowledge of God&#8217;s love
toward us, and the hope of his protection, do bring us this goodness with them,
that we praise God with quiet minds, whatsoever the world doth threaten. And as
Luke spoke a little before of the public estate of the Church, so he declareth
now what form and manner of life the faithful did use; that we may learn by
their example a thrifty fellowship in our manner of living, and in all our whole
life to embrace singleness, to enjoy the spiritual joy, and to exercise
ourselves in the praises of God. Furthermore, the singleness of heart reacheth
far; but if you join it in this place with breaking of bread, it shall signify
as much as sincere love, where one man dealeth plainly with another, neither
doth any man craftily hunt after his own profit. Yet had I rather set the same
against that carefulness, wherewith worldly men
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F159</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
do too much torment themselves. For when as we do not cast our care upon the
Lord, this reward hangeth over our heads, that we tremble and quake even when we
take our rest.</font><br></div>

favor.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the fruit of an innocent
life, to find favor even amongst strangers. And yet we need not to doubt of
this, but that they were hated of many. But although he speak generally of the
people, yet he meaneth that part alone which was sound, neither yet infected
with any poison of hatred; he signifieth briefly, that the faithful did so
behave themselves, that the people did full well like of them for their
innocency of life.

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord added

their diligence was not without profit; they studied so much as in them lay to
gather into the Lord&#8217;s sheepfold those which wandered and went astray. He
saith that their labor bestowed herein was not lost; because the Lord did
increase his Church daily. And surely, whereas the Church is rather diminished
than increased, that is to be imputed to our slothfulness, or rather
forwardness.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F161</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And although they did all of them stoutly labor to increase the kingdom of
Christ, yet Luke ascribeth
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F162</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
this honor to God alone, that he brought strangers into the Church. And surely
this is his own proper work. For the ministers do no good by planting or
watering, unless he make their labor effectual by the power of his Spirit, (1
Corinthians 3.) Furthermore, we must note that he saith, that those were
gathered unto the Church which should be saved. For he teacheth that this is the
means to attain salvation, if we be incorporate into the Church. For like as
there is no remission of sins, so neither is there any hope of salvation. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F163</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

grace is restrained unto election, that it may be the first cause of our
salvation.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> We saw before that many signs were showed

sake, after his common custom; namely, that a lame man, which was lame of his
feet from his mother&#8217;s womb, was perfectly restored to his limbs. And he
doth diligently gather all the circumstances which serve to set forth the
miracle. If it had been that his legs had been out of joint, or if it had been
some disease coming by some casualty, it might have been the more easily cured.
But the default of nature
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F164</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
could not have been so easily redressed. When as he saith that he was carried,
we gather thereby that it was no light halting, but that this man did lie as if
his legs had been dead. Forasmuch as he was wont daily to ask alms, hereby all
the people might the better know him. In that being healed, he walked in the
temple at the time of prayer, this served to spread abroad the fame of the
miracle. Furthermore, this doth not a little set forth the same, that being
lifted up and set upon his feet, he leapeth up therewithal, and walketh
joyfully.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Went up

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">epi to
auto</font><font face="Palatino">, doth no more signify place than time, this
latter sense seemeth better to agree with the text of Peter, yet, because it is
of no great importance, I leave it indifferent. That it is called the ninth hour
of prayer, when as the day began to draw towards night.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F165</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For seeing the day from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof had
twelve hours, as I have said elsewhere, all that time was divided into four
parts. So that by the ninth is meant the last portion of the day; as the first
hour did continue unto the third, the third unto the sixth, the sixth unto the
ninth. Hence may we gather, by a probable conjecture, that that hour was
appointed for the evening sacrifice. Furthermore, if any man ask, whether the
apostles went up into the temple that they might pray according to the rite of
the law, I do not think that that is a thing so likely to be true, as that they
might have better opportunity to spread abroad the gospel. And if any man will
abuse this place, as if it were lawful for us to use and take up superstitious
worshippings, whilst that we are conversant amongst the ignorant and weak, his
reason shall be frivolous. The Lord appointed that the Jews should offer
sacrifice morning and evening,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;022941&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
29:41.) By this exercise were they taught to begin and end the day with calling
upon the name of God, and with worshipping him,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F166</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;042802&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
28:2.) Therefore Peter and John might freely come into the temple, which was
consecrated to God; neither did they pollute themselves, seeing they called upon
the God of Israel, that they might thereby declare their godliness. First, in
that the Lord would have the older people to observe the appointed hours,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F167</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
we gather thereby that the Church cannot be without certain discipline. And even
at this day, were it profitable for us to have such meetings daily, unless our
too [too] much sluggishness did let us. And whereas the apostles go up at that
hour, hereby we gather that we must foreslow [neglect] no opportunity that is
offered us for the furtherance of the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
He asketh an alms.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We see how God
restored this lame man to his limbs contrary to his expectation. Because he
thought that his disease was incurable, he was only careful for maintenance.
That is given him which he durst never have asked. In like sort God doth
oftentimes prevent us, neither doth he stay until he be provoked.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F168</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And hence can we not gather any occasion of slothfulness, as if the Lord did
therefore meet us of his own accord, that being idle and slothful we may suffer
the Lord to do good unto us. For we are commanded to pray, and therefore let us
not foreslow [neglect] our duty.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F169</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But, first of all, under the person of the lame man, we have set before us an
example of a man that is not yet illuminated by faith, that he may know how to
pray aright. Such doth God prevent, as it is needful, even of his own accord.
Therefore, when as he restoreth our souls not only to health, but also to life,
he himself is to himself the cause hereof. For this is the beginning of our
calling, that he may make those things to be which are not; that he may show
himself unto those who seek not after him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:17.) Furthermore, howsoever we be already taught by faith to pray unto God,
yet, because we do not always feel our miseries, it cometh not into our mind to
seek for remedy; therefore the Lord bringeth the same freely and unlooked for.
Finally, howsoever we be bent to pray, yet doth he exceed our hope and petitions
with his goodness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Look upon
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Peter doth not thus speak before he
be certain of the purpose and intent of God. And surely in these words he
commandeth him to hope for some singular and unwonted benefit; yet here may a
question be moved, whether they had power to work miracles so often as they
would? I answer, that they were ministers of God&#8217;s power in such sort,
that they did attempt nothing of their own will or proper motion, but the Lord
wrought by them, when he knew that it was expedient it should be so. Hereby it
came to pass that they healed one and not all. Therefore, as in other things,
they had the Spirit of God to be their guide and director, so also in this
point. Therefore, before such time as Peter commandeth the lame man to arise, he
did east and fasten his eyes upon him; this steadfast looking upon him was not
without some peculiar motion of the Spirit. Hereby it cometh to pass that he
speaketh so surely (and safely, without all fear) of the miracle. Furthermore,
he meant by this word to provoke the lame man to receive the grace of God; yet
doth he look for nothing but for an alms.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Silver and

that he doth want that help which the lame man did require. And therefore doth
he declare, that if he were able to relieve his poverty he would willingly do
it; like as every man ought to consider with himself what the Lord hath given
him, that he may therewith help his neighbors. For what store soever God giveth
to every man, he will have the same to be an instrument and help to exercise
love. Therefore he saith, that he giveth that which he hath. This was at the
first a trick of mockage,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F170</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in that Peter beginneth to speak of his poverty, after that he had brought the
lame man into a rare hope, as if he meant to mock a gaping crow; but he
comforteth him immediately, to the end the miracle might be had in greater
estimation by the comparison. That is horrible wickedness, in that the Pope,
when as he is created, doth most unshamefastly [shamelessly] abuse this place,
making thereof a comical, or rather a scoffing play. There be two cells, or
places made of stone, in the one whereof when he sitteth, and the people ask an
alms, using these words of Peter, he casteth abroad crosses in the air with his
fingers. When he is brought into the next tell, or place, he hath bags full of
money. Then his angels cry unto him,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He hath dispersed,

poor,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
112:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have made mention hereof, to the end all men may
see that Satan doth questionless reign there, where they do so manifestly mock
the sacred Word of God. And to the end I may return unto the former sentence, it
is evident enough that Peter was instructed by a certain and sure revelation,
when as he saith that he hath the gift of healing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the name of

</i></font><font face="Palatino">is taken for power and empire, or government.
Neither must we dream that there is any magical force in the sounding or
pronouncing of the word, as the Jews do dote about the word Jehovah. To be
short, Peter meant to declare that he was nothing but a minister, and that
Christ was the author of the miracle. For this ought to have been, and was his
care, that Christ might be made known unto the world, and that his name might be
sanctified. But why doth he give Christ this epithet, or title, <i>of Nazareth?
</i>I leave to other men their own judgment; but I think thus: Forasmuch as
Christ was thus called in contempt, Peter meant of set purpose to express that
that Jesus of Nazareth whom they had crucified, and whose name was despised and
without glory amongst the Jews, and was to the most of them detestable, was
nevertheless the Messias promised of God, and that all power was given unto him
of the rather; as Paul saith, that he preacheth Christ and him crucified,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise and
walk.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This might seem to be a very
ridiculous thing. For the cripple might have readily objected, Why hast thou not
first given me legs and feet? For this is a plain mock, when as thou biddest a
man without feet to go. But he believed Peter&#8217;s words; and he, which was
at the first so slow, doth now with a ready and joyful mind embrace God&#8217;s
benefit. Whereby appeareth both the force of the word, and also the fruit of
faith. The force of the word is double, both in that the cripple is so touched
that he doth forthwith obey without delay; and in that it giveth strength to his
dead members, and doth, after a sort, renew the man. And faith also hath her
reward, in that the cripple obeyeth him which commandeth him to rise not in
vain. Therefore we see how God worketh by his Word, to wit, when he giveth
success to the preaching thereof, that it may pierce into the minds of men;
secondly, when he giveth those things with his hand which are promised there.
Moreover, he suffereth not faith to be void, but she doth indeed truly enjoy all
those good things which she looketh for, and which are offered unto her in the
same Word. And we must remember that which I have already said, that we have in
this history a type
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F171</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or figure of our spiritual restoring; namely, that as the Word, laid hold on by
faith, did restore the cripple to his limbs, so the Lord pierceth into our souls
by the Word, that he may restore the same. And, first of all, he speaketh by
man&#8217;s mouth, and pricketh us forward by the obedience of faith; that done,
he moveth our hearts inwardly by his Spirit, that the Word may take lively root
in us; finally, he reacheth out his hand, and by all means he finisheth his work
in us. We gather out of Matthew that miracles must be thus
handled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And all the people saw.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He beginneth now
to declare the fruit of the miracle, to wit, that the cripple began to show his
thankfulness by praising God, and that all the people were brought into great
wondering. And here is a double fruit. For he which was healed doth acknowledge
and set forth the benefit of God; on the other side, the people is moved, and
the fame is spread abroad, many come to see it. And whereas Luke saith that they
were filled with wondering, it doth only declare a preparation, which a more
full proceeding
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F172</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(and going forward) did at length follow. For it was necessary that they should
go forward, because this their wondering had served to no end of itself, but did
rather make them astonied and amazed, than bring them (from their own
proceedings) unto God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore it was, as it were, the foundation of the
building which was to come, in that the people was touched with amazedness. For
if we pass over the works of God contemptibly or carelessly, we shall never be
able to profit by them. Furthermore, this place cloth teach us what miracles do
work of themselves in men; to wit, that they breed a confused amazedness. For
although the Lord doth call us straightway unto himself, by showing plainly his
goodness and power there, yet such is the weakness of our nature, that we
stumble or faint in the midway, until such time as we be holpen by
doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us, therefore, learn reverently to consider the
works of God, that the wondering at them may make an entrance for doctrine. For
when doctrine is cold and unprofitable with us, God doth justly punish our
unthankfulness by this means, because we have despised the glory of his works.
Again, because we are not so quick of sight, that we can see so much in the
works of God alone, as is sufficient, let us learn to join therewithal the help
of doctrine.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F173</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
To be brief, the one ought not to be separated from the other. Which thing
experience doth sufficiently teach us. For hereby it came to pass that the world
did so wickedly abuse miracles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Papists do object unto us miracles again and
again. Let us suppose that they be true, whereof they make such boast, yet do
they greatly err in this, that they wrest them to a wrong end; to wit, that they
may darken the name of God, and infect the pure truth of the gospel with their
inventions. For whence come so many superstitious worshippings of saints, save
only from the abuse of miracles? For when any miracle is wrought, men must needs
be moved. And because they are deaf when they should hear the Word, and do not
mark what God cloth mean, Satan doth craftily take an occasion of superstition
by our amazedness.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F174</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As, for example, I will acknowledge the power of God in a miracle. If it were
wrought by Peter, Satan will by and by put this in my head, and will say thus: 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F175</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Dost thou not see that this is a man of God? 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F176</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
therefore thou dost owe unto him divine honor. The same thing had befallen the
Jews when they were amazed, unless Peter&#8217;s sermon had called them back
into the right way. But in Popery, where none did call them back or reprove
them, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F177</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the preposterous wondering of men did easily get the upper hand. Wherefore, we
must so much the more
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F178</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
seek for medicine out of the Word, that doctrine may direct us unto the right
end, being lifted up

reproving of the people. And yet doth he not simply reprove them because they
wonder; for that was altogether profitable and worthy praise; but because they
do wickedly ascribe unto men that praise which is due to the work of God. As if
he should say, Ye do amiss, in that you stay in us, and stand gazing upon us,
whereas you ought rather to look upon God and Christ. Therefore, this is to be
amazed evilly, when as our minds do stay in men. And we must note that he
condemneth the respect of men; as if, saith he, we by our own power and virtue
had done this. Therefore there is an error and corruption in this, if we
attribute that unto the godliness and power of men which is proper to God and
Christ. And, as concerning power, no man will deny that it cometh of God; yet
when they have confessed this in one word, they do not cease to take from God
his right, to the end they may adorn the creatures with that which they take
from him; as we see the Papists place the power of God in the saints; yea, they
include his power in a stone or stock of wood, so soon as the image is
consecrated to Barbara or Chrysogonus. But, notwithstanding, let us suppose that
they do not offend in that former member; yet do they foolishly think that they
have done their duty toward God, when as they leave him the power, and assign
the miracles unto the godliness of saints. For why do they run unto them, when
they will obtain either rain or fair weather, or be delivered from diseases,
unless they do imagine that they have by their godliness deserved that God
should grant them this right and privilege? This is, therefore, but a childish
starting-hole,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F180</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when they confess that God is the author of the power; but they thank the
godliness of saints for those benefits which they have received. Howsoever they
color the matter, we must always know this, that Peter doth generally condemn
those which do so look unto men in miracles, that they think that their holiness
is the cause thereof. This is the first part of the sermon, wherein he reproveth
superstition. And we must note his manner and order of teaching. For because men
are inclined to nothing more than to fall from God unto the creatures, it is
very expedient to prevent this vice in time. And if the people were forbidden to
look unto the apostles, much more doth the Spirit draw us away from calling upon
every petty saint.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The God of

calling them back unto Christ. And the sum is this, That this is God&#8217;s
purpose in those miracles which he worketh by the apostles to set forth the
glory of his Christ; whereupon it followeth that all those do deal disorderly
who set up Peter, or any other, whatsoever he be, forasmuch as all men must
decrease, and Christ alone must be excellent,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430330&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:30.) Here appeareth a manifest difference between Christ and the apostles.
First of all, he is the author, they are only the ministers; secondly, this is
the lawful end, that he alone may have the glory; and as for them there is no
respect to be had of them as concerning glory; for certainly they which do
glorify any in miracles besides Christ, they set themselves flatly against the
counsel of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He maketh mention of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, to the end he may declare unto the people that he meaneth nothing less
than to lead them away from the old and ancient worship of the true God, which
they had received of the fathers. Furthermore, God hath given himself this
title, that he might (dissever and) distinguish himself by some mark from idols;
for we do not comprehend God in his essence, which cannot be seen, and which is
infinite; therefore, he useth such means as agree best with us, to bring us to
the knowledge of him. The Turks do boast that they do worship God, which is the
creator of heaven and earth; but before they come at heaven they vanish away.
Therefore, to the end God might keep his people from vain and erroneous
inventions, he kept them in his covenant; therefore, when he calleth himself the
God of Abraham, he did briefly teach that which Moses declareth more at large,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;053012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
30:12,)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Say not, Who shall
ascend into heaven? Who shall go down into the depth? Or who shall sail over the
seas? The word is nigh,&#8221; etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, as amongst the Jews the name of the holy
fathers was in high estimation, so Peter doth closely
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F181</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
tell them, that they were no better than other men, without the only begotten
Son of God. And at this day God will be known by a more evident mark yet, when
as he calleth himself the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now return unto Peter; he saith that he
bringeth in no new religion, that. he may draw away the people from the law and
the prophets; for if he should attempt this, God had forbidden them to hear him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;051303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
13:3.) Like as Paul teacheth, that we must retain one foundation in the

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:11,) because, so soon as we depart even but a little from Christ,
there can nothing ensue but ruin. And hereby also we may easily discern in what
sense he calleth God the God of the fathers; for neither doth he take this for a
general maxim, that what manner of worship soever the fathers had, we must
continue the same, as the Papists do foolishly vaunt that they do follow the
manner of worshipping which was used amongst the fathers; for Peter doth
expressly reckon up Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from whom true religion did
proceed, and by whom it was divinely delivered; whereby he doth signify unto us,
that we must not follow all fathers, whereof many did grow out of kind, and
became altogether unlike to the first fathers; that this honor is due to the
children of God alone, and that others are to be refused; which thing the
prophets do also beat in

20:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom ye have
delivered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He mingleth with doctrine a
most sharp chiding, according as the matter did require; for it was impossible
to bring them truly unto God, unless they were first brought to the knowledge of
their sins; neither doth he only lightly touch them, but he doth very gravely
show them the horribleness of that offense which they had committed. To this end
tendeth that comparison, that they delivered him to be put to death, whom Pilate
would have loosed; and again, that, pardoning a murderer, they put the Prince of
life to death; that they did reject the just and holy. Men must be so stricken,
that being brought to know their guiltiness, they may earnestly fly unto the
remedy of pardon. Such vehemence and earnestness did Peter also use in his first
sermon; he saith afterward that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
God raised him up,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>whereby they ought to
know that, in putting Christ to death, they did strive against God; although
Peter had respect unto an higher thing, to wit, that their cruelty did no whit
impair the glory of Christ, because God had nevertheless restored him to life.
When as he saith, that he and his fellows in office were witnesses of the
resurrection, his meaning is, that they saw it with their eyes,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422448&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
24:48.) Therefore, this is referred not only unto the apostolical function, but
because they saw Christ with their eyes after that he was risen from the dead;
although I do also grant that this second thing is comprehended under these
words, because it is likely that Peter doth make mention of that function which
was committed unto him, to the end he may purchase the greater
authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.

name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and again, the <i>faith which is
by him; </i>this repetition is a token of a fervent affection, for because he
was wholly given to set forth the glory of Christ, he beateth in [inculcateth]
the same thing oftentimes. Moreover, we see that when Paul is occupied about the
showing and setting forth of the grace of Christ, he thinketh that he hath never
spoken enough touching the same; and surely such is the wicked nature of men,
that Christ cannot be so highly extolled, and so preached, that his honor can
remain sound unto him. Let us, therefore, remember that Peter did use such
variety and plenty of words, to the end he might stay us in Christ. As touching
the phrase, when as he saith, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
name in the faith of his name hath
strengthened</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he showeth both the cause
and the manner; the power of Christ had healed the cripple but by faith. When as
he saith, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the faith which is by
him,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> by </i>this word he signifieth unto us
that our faith cannot arise up unto God unless it be grounded in Christ, and se,
consequently, that this our faith doth look unto Christ and stay itself upon
him, and so he showeth that there cat be no right faith in God when we pass over
this mean.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, as he said before, that he and the other
apostles were witnesses of Christ&#8217;s life, so he doth now declare that this
life was manifestly proved unto the Jews by a sign or effect, because they see
the cripple healed, in whom they had an excellent and evident token of the
Divine power of Christ. And when as in this last member he maketh faith the
cause of this soundness, he layeth unthankfulness to their charge by the way,
unless they give faith her due praise; and although faith may be referred as
well unto the man that was healed as unto the apostles, yet we need not to stand
much about this manner, because the power of the gospel is set forth by

unless there be some hope of pardon left, the terror and fear of punishment doth
harden men&#8217;s hearts with stubbornness; for that of David is true, That we
fear the Lord when we perceive that he is unto us favorable, and easy to be
pacified,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

ignorance; for it had been impossible for them to have suffered and endured this
conscience, if they had denied the Son of God, and delivered him to be slain,
wittingly and willingly; and yet will he not flatter them, when as he saith that
they did it through ignorance; but he doth only somewhat mitigate his speech,
lest they should be overwhelmed and swallowed up of despair. Again, we must not
so take the words as if the people did sin simply of ignorance, for under this
there did lie hid hypocrisy; but as wickedness or ignorance doth abound, the
action is named of the one or the other. This is, therefore, Peter&#8217;s
meaning, that they did it rather through error and a blind zeal, than through
any determined wickedness; but a question may be moved here, if ally man have
offended wittingly and willingly, whether he shall surely fall into despair or
not? I answer, that he doth not make mention in this place of all manner of sin;
but only of the denying of Christ, and of the extinguishing of the grace of God,
so much as in them did lie. If any man be desirous to know more concerning this,
he may read the first chapter of the First Epistle to Timothy,

but the perverse study and zeal of the law did prick forward the people. Again,
the people were incensed against Christ, inasmuch as their rulers did provoke
them thereunto. I answer, that they were not all of one mind, for without doubt
many of them were like unto Paul, unto whom that doth truly appertain, which he
writeth elsewhere of the princes and rulers of this world, if they had known the
wisdom of God they would never have crucified the Lord of glory; therefore, he
speaketh not generally of all the rulers; but if any of them be curable, them
doth he invite to repentance.</font><br></div>

what end he made mention of ignorance; for when he telleth them that God hath
accomplished those things which he had foretold, he doth so touch their offense
in the death of Christ, that it turneth to their salvation. Ignorance, saith he,
hath made you guilty, yet God hath brought that to pass which he had determined,
that Christ should redeem you by his death. This is a most notable
consideration, when as we ponder and consider with ourselves, that through the
wonderful counsel of God our evils are turned to another end to us, yet this
doth no whir excuse us, for so much as in us lieth we cast away
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F184</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
ourselves by sinning; but that conversion whereof I have spoken is a notable
work of God&#8217;s mercy, whereof we must speak, and which we must extol with
humility. The Jews did what they could to extinguish all hope of life in the
person of Christ; and yet, nevertheless, that death gave life as well to them as
to the whole world. We must also remember that which we saw elsewhere, lest
there should any false and absurd opinion creep in, that Christ was laid open to
the lust of the wicked, that God is made the chief author by whose will his only
Son did suffer.</font><br></div>

</i>We must note, that when he exhorteth unto repentance, he doth also declare
that there is remission of sins prepared for them before the face of God. For,
as I said of late, no man can be stirred up to repentance, unless he have
salvation set before him; but he which doth despair of pardon, being, as it
were, given over unto destruction already, doth not &#8216;fear to run headlong
against God obstinately. Hereby it cometh to pass that the Papists cannot
deliver the doctrine of repentance. They babble, indeed, very much concerning
the same; but because they overthrow the hope of grace, it cannot be that they
should persuade their disciples unto the study of repentance. Moreover, I
confess that they babble a little touching forgiveness of sins; but because they
leave men&#8217;s souls in doubt and in fearfulness, and, furthermore, do cast
them as it were into a labyrinth, (or place out of which they know not how to
come,) this part of the doctrine being corrupt, they confound the other
also.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F185</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which may be made perfect, thus:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the time of refreshing shall
come, you may also enjoy this refreshing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>when Christ shall come to judge the world, you may find him a redeemer and
not a Judge. But because Beza doth fitly translate it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After that they shall
come</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it is better to retain that which
is not so racked;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F186</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so you resolve it thus: That sins are so forgiven against the day of the last
judgment; because, unless we be cited to appear before God&#8217;s judgment-seat
we are not greatly careful to pacify God. First of all, we must note, that he
setteth before them the day of judgment, to the end the former exhortation may
take the greater effect. For there is nothing which doth more prick us, than
when we are taught that we must once give an account. For so long as our senses
are holden and kept in this world, they are drowned, as it were, in a certain
drowsiness,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F187</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that I may so call it. Wherefore the message of the last judgment must sound as
a trumpet to <i>cite </i>us to appear before the judgment-seat of God. For then
at last being truly awaked, we begin to think of a new life. In like sort, when
Paul preached at Athens, God saith, that he doth now will all men to repent;
because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441730&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
17:30, 31.) The sum is this, that Christ, who is now unto us a Master, when as
he teacheth us by the gospel, is appointed of the Father to be a Judge, and
shall come in his due time; and that, therefore, we must obey his doctrine
betimes, that we may gather the fruit of our faith then.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But some man may object, that Peter speaketh
otherwise of the last day. For this doth not serve to make them afraid, when he
saith, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the time of
refreshing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I answer, that there is a
double prick, wherewith the faithful are pricked forward when as they are told
of the last judgment. For the profit of faith doth not appear in this world, yea
rather it seemeth to go well with the despisers of God; but the life of the
godly is full of miseries. Therefore our hearts should oftentimes faint and
quail, unless we should remember that the day of rest shall come, which shall
quench all the heat of our trouble, and make an end of our miseries. The other
prick whereof I spoke is this, when as the fearful judgment of God causeth us to
shake off delicacy and drowsiness. So Peter mixeth in this place threatenings
with promises, partly to the end he may allure the Jews unto Christ, and partly
that he may prick them forward with fear. Furthermore, this is a thing much used
in the Scripture, as it speaketh either unto the reprobate, or unto the elect,
sometimes to make the day of the Lord doleful and fearful, sometimes to make the
same pleasant and to be wished for. Peter therefore doth very well, who, whilst
that he putteth the Jews in good hope of pardon, doth make the day of Christ
pleasant to them, to the end they may desire the same.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall send
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He saith expressly that Christ
shall be Judge, to the end they may know that the contempt of the gospel shall
not be unpunished. For how should not Christ punish the same? In the meanwhile,
this doth greatly comfort the faithful, when as they know that it shall be in
his hand to give. salvation, who doth now promise and offer the same. He addeth,
moreover, that he shall come who is now preached unto them. Whereby he taketh
away all excuse of ignorance. As if he should say, Christ is preached unto you
now before he come to judge the world; to the end that those who will embrace
him may receive the fruit of their faith at that day; and to the end that
others, who shall refuse him, may be punished for their unbelief. Although the
Grecians do read this two ways; for some books
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F188</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
have
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">prokekhrugmenon</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>that is, <i>preached before; </i>and other some
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">prokeceirismenon</font><font face="Palatino">,
that is, <i>showed, or set before their eyes. </i>But both have one sense, to
wit, that Christ is not offered unto them in vain now by the doctrine of the
gospel; because he shall be sent the second time by his Father to be a Judge,
armed and prepared to render vengeance, unless they embrace him now for their
Redeemer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom the heaven must
contain.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Because men&#8217;s senses are
always bent and inclined towards the gross and earthly beholding of God and
Christ, the Jews might think with themselves that Christ was preached, indeed,
to be raised up from the dead, yet could they not tell where he was; for no man
did show them where he was. Therefore Peter preventeth them, when he saith that
he is in heaven. Whereupon it followeth that they must lift up their minds on
high, to the end they may seek Christ with the eyes of faith, although he be far
from them, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F189</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
although he dwell without the world in the heavenly glory. But this is a
doubtful
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F190</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
speech; because we may as well understand it that Christ is contained or
comprehended in the heavens, as that he doth comprehend the heavens. Let us not
therefore urge the word, being of a doubtful signification; but let us content
ourselves with that which is certain, that we must seek for Christ nowhere else
save only in heaven, whilst that we hope for the last restoring of all things;
because he shall be far from us, until our minds ascend high above the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Until the time of
restoring</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As touching the force and
cause, Christ hath already restored all things by his death; but the effect doth
not yet fully appear; because that restoring is yet in the course, and se,
consequently, our redemption, forasmuch as we do yet groan under the burden of
servitude. For as the kingdom of Christ is only begun, and the perfection
thereof is deferred until the last day, so those things which are annexed
thereunto do now appear only in part. Therefore, if at this day we see many
things confused in the world, let this hope set us upon foot and refresh us,
that Christ shall once come that he may restore tall things. In the mean season,
if we see the relics of sin hang on us, if we be environed on every side with
divers miseries, if the world be full of wasting and scattering abroad, let us
bewail these miseries, yet so that we uphold with the hope of restoring. And
this is the reason why Christ doth not appear by and by,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F191</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because the warfare of the Church is not yet full, 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F192</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
whose time, seeing it is appointed by God, it is not for us to prevent the same.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F193</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which he
spoke.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I do not expound this of the
times alone, but I refer it unto the whole period; so that the sense is this:
That whatsoever he had spoken before of the kingdom of Christ is witnessed by
all the prophets. Certes, the gospel doth win no small credit hereby, that so
soon as God began to show himself to the world, he did always set Christ before
them; after that he began to speak unto the fathers, he did always lay this
foundation of doctrine. By the same argument Paul commendeth the gospel, both in
the beginning of his Epistle to the Romans,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:1,) and also in the end,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451625&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
16:25,) to wit, that it is no new thing, but promised even from the beginning. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F194</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This is true antiquity, which is able to purchase credit to doctrine: when as
God himself is the author, the holy prophets the witnesses, and the continual
course of times confirmeth the testimony. This confirmation was especially
necessary for the Jews, who being brought up in the doctrine of the law, ought
to admit nothing but that which agreeth therewith. Therefore Peter doth command
them only to mind those things which the prophets have testified of
Christ.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22. </b>By this argument he proveth that he goeth
not about to cause them to revolt from Moses, because it is a part of the law to
take heed to and obey this chief teacher. Here might a doubt arise, why Peter
thought it more convenient to cite this testimony of Moses than others, seeing
there were many others in readiness far more plain; but he did this for this
cause, because he intreateth in this place of the authority of doctrine; and
this was the best way to bring the Jews to be Christ&#8217;s disciples. For he
should have preached in vain of all other things, unless they had been persuaded
that his doctrine was reverently to be received. This is therefore the thing
which Peter aimeth at, to bring them to hear Christ willingly, as the master
whom God hath appointed to teach them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here ariseth a question, which hath in it great
difficulty; to wit, in that Peter applieth that unto the person of Christ which
Moses spoke generally of the prophets. For although he make mention of a prophet
in the singular number, yet the text [context] doth plainly declare, that he
speaketh not of one alone; but that this word is put indefinitely. For after
that Moses had forbidden the people to give themselves unto the superstitions of
the Gentiles, by turning aside unto enchanters and soothsayers, he showeth them
therewithal a remedy, whereby they may avoid all vanity; to wit, if they depend
wholly upon the Word of God alone. By this means he promiseth that God will be
careful at all times to send them prophets, that they may teach them aright. As
if he should say, God will never suffer you to be destitute of prophets, of whom
you may learn whatsoever shall be profitable for you to know. And Moses saith
expressly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of thy
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to the end the Jews may know
that the oracles of God are to be sought and set no where else, seeing that God
had appointed unto them teachers of the kindred of Abraham. He addeth
further,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> like unto
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that they may know that they were not
to hear God only at one time, or by the mouth of one man; but as God proceedeth
to teach us by divers ministers throughout the continual course of time, so must
we hold on in the obedience of the word. Now, the Jews were wont to reverence
Moses; therefore, he will have them to give like honor to the prophets. I know
that many would fain restrain it unto Christ. They catch at this word, whereas
Moses doth testify that the prophet shall be like unto him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;051815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
18:15,) whereas, notwithstanding, it is written, that there arose none like unto
Moses. I confess that there is in both places the same note of likeness, yet in
a diverse sense. For, in the second place, the likeness or equality is
expressed, as it doth plainly appear. They catch also at another thing, that the
prophet shall far excel Moses, of whom he beareth witness as a crier or herald.
But this is never a whit stronger, because Moses goeth about to bring to pass
that the word of God may be believed by whomsoever it be
brought.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, there is no cause why we should set
ourselves to be laughed to scorn by the Jews, by wresting the words of Moses
violently, as if he spoke of Christ alone in this place. Yet we must see whether
Peter doth cite the testimony fitly, whose authority ought to serve for a sound
reason. I say; that in Peter&#8217;s speech there is nothing which is not most
convenient. For he saw that which all men ought to grant, that this testimony
doth so appertain unto the other prophets, that yet notwithstanding it doth
chiefly commend Christ, not only because that he is the prince and chief of all
the prophets, but because all other former prophecies were directed toward him,
and because God did at length speak absolutely by his mouth, For God spoke in
divers manners, and at sundry times in times past3 unto our fathers by the
prophets, he addeth the conclusion at length, in the last days in his only
begotten Son,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:1, 2.) Therefore, it came to pass, that they wanted prophets for a certain
years
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F195</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
before his coming; which thing is plainly gathered out of the words of Malachi,
who, after he hath commanded the people to be mindful of the law, he passeth
over by and by unto John Baptist and unto Christ, as if he should say, that the
prophecies are now ended until the last revelation come,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;390404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Malachi

people all the prophets ceased, to the end they might be made more attentive to

doctrine which all men had received for a principle; that God had promised to
teach his people at the first by his prophets as by means,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F196</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but at length principally by Christ, at whose hands they were to hope for the
perfect manifestation and laying open of all things. And to this purpose serveth
that excellent testimony or commendation wherewith his Father setteth him forth,

of all of Christ, is established; and that for good causes. For seeing there is
nothing that God doth account more precious than his word, it cannot be that he
should suffer the same to be freely contemned. Therefore, if any man despised
the law of Moses, he was adjudged to die the death. And hereunto Moses had
respect when he said, &#8220;He shall be put away from among the people.&#8221;
For God had adopted the stock and kindred of Abraham unto himself, upon this
condition, that this might be sufficient for them unto the chiefest felicity to
be <i>reckoned </i>in that number, as it is said in the Psalm, &#8220;Blessed is
the people whose God is the Lord.&#8221; And in another place, &#8220;Blessed is
the nation whom the Lord hath chosen to be his inheritance.&#8221; Wherefore it
is not to be doubted, but that he pronounceth that he shall be blotted out of
the book of life whosoever shall refuse to hear Christ. For he is not worthy to
be accounted one of the Church, whosoever he be that refuseth to have him to be

certainty of the gospel, that all the prophets, for a long time, [series of

consent, that they do testify altogether that men ought to hope for a certain,
better, and more perfect thing. Therefore, whosoever will believe Moses and the

terrifying them with the terror of punishment, so he allureth them now again to
receive the grace which is offered them in Christ; so that we see how that God
omitteth nothing whereby he may bring us unto himself. And it is the duty of a
wise minister so to prick forward the sluggish and slow bellies, that he do lead
those gently which are apt to be taught; we must also note diligently this
course of teaching, where Peter showeth that the gospel is assigned and
appointed unto the Jews. For it is not sufficient to have the mercy of God
preached unto us generally, unless we also know that the same is offered unto us
by the certain ordinance of God. For this cause is it that Paul standeth so much
upon the avouching of the calling of the Gentiles,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451518&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

chance, when as it was scattered here and there, faith should quail;

yea, there should be a doubtful opinion instead of faith. Therefore, to the end
we may steadfastly believe the promise of salvation, this application (that I
may so term it) is necessary, that God doth not cast forth uncertain voices,
that they may hang in the air, but that he doth direct the same unto us by his
certain and determinate counsel. Peter telleth the Jews, that Christ is promised
unto them after this sort, to the end they may more willingly embrace him. And
how proveth he this? because they are the children of the prophets and of the
covenant. He calleth them the children of the prophets, which were of the same
nation, and therefore were heirs of the covenant, which did belong unto the
whole body of the people. For he argueth thus: God made his covenant with our
fathers; therefore we, which are their posterity, are comprehended in the
covenant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whereby the doubting [doting] subtlety of the
Anabaptists is refuted, who do expound the children of Abraham only
allegorically; as if God had had no respect to his stock, when he said, &#8220;I
will be the God of thy seed,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;011707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
17:7.) Certainly Peter doth not speak in this place of the shadows of the law;
but he affirmeth that this is of force under the kingdom of Christ, that God
doth adopt the children together with the fathers; and so, consequently, the
grace of salvation may be extended unto those which are as yet unborn,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:7.) I grant, indeed, that many which are the children of the faithful,
according to the flesh, are counted bastards, and not legitimate, because they
thrust themselves out of the holy progeny through their unbelief. But this doth
no whit hinder the Lord from calling and admitting the seed of the godly into
fellowship of grace. And so, although the common election be not effectual in
all, yet may it set open a gate for the special elect. As Paul intreateth in the
11th to the Romans,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:23,) whence we must set [seek] an answer for this question.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And in thy
seed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He proveth that the covenant was
made with the fathers, because God said unto Abraham,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;In thy seed shall
all nations be blessed,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;012218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
22:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if we admit Paul&#8217;s interpretation, this
testimony shall make nothing for the present cause. Paul teacheth that Christ is
this seed,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:16.) If the blessing be promised to all mankind by Christ, what is this to the
especial or particular privilege of one nation? Secondly, Peter himself seemeth
shortly after to subscribe to this exposition of Paul, when as he saith that
Christ was sent, that in him the <i>Jews </i>may be blessed. For this could not
<i>be, </i>unless Christ were that blessed seed. I answer, When Paul referreth
it unto Christ, he standeth not upon the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>but he hath respect to an higher tiling; to wit, that it cannot be one seed,
unless it be united and knit together in Christ, as in the Head. For Ismael and
Isaac, although both of them be the sons of Abraham, yet do they not make one
seed, because they be divided into two people. Therefore, though many be
estranged from the family of Abraham, which came of hint according to the flesh,
yet Moses noteth one certain body, when he promiseth the blessing unto the seed
of Abraham. And whence cometh the unity, save only from the Head, which is
Christ? In this sense doth Paul understand this word <i>seed </i>of Christ,
although it be a noun collective; because, if you depart from hint, the
posterity of Abraham shall be as torn members, neither shall there be any thing
else in them, save only mere wasteless and scattering abroad. Peter agreeth with
that doctrine, because he doth so extend the blessing unto all the people, that
he doth, nevertheless, seek the fountain in Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Secondly, forasmuch as the Jews do what they can to
wring [wrest] from us this testimony, the godly readers must arm themselves
against their cavils; and so much the rather, because Christian writers have
been too slack in this point, as I have said in the Epistle to the Galatians.
First, as touching the word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
seed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>there is no cause wily they should
prattle that Paul doth not rightly restrain it unto Christ; for he cloth not
this simply, but in that respect whereof I have spoken. In which point, I
confess, both our Latin and Greek interpreters have erred. Now, we must see what
this manner of speech doth import. The Gentiles shall be blessed in the seed of
Abraham. Our men think that there is some cause noted; to wit, that through that
seed the Gentiles shall be blessed. The Jews toss this to and fro, because this
phrase signifieth every where in the Scriptures, an example or similitude; as,
on the other side,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F198</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to be cursed in Sodom, in Israel, or in another people, is to take them for a
notable example of a curse. I answer, that it is a doubtful speech, and taken
diversely, according to the circumstance of the places, which the Jews do
craftily dissemble. For they gather many places, out of which they prove that
there is a comparison made; as if it should be said, The Gentiles shall desire
to be blessed, like to the seed of Abraham. But when as the Scripture saith
elsewhere, &#8220;They shall bless themselves in the living God,&#8221; as
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
4:2;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;236516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
65:16; and again, &#8220;Do bless in the name of the Lord,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;051008&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
10:8,) and in other such like places; who doth not see that there is a cause
expressed? Therefore, I say that this form of speech ought to be understood
according to the circumstances of the places.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And now, forasmuch as I have declared that the seed
of Abraham can be found nowhere else save only in Christ, it remaineth that we
consider of what sort the office of Christ is. So shall it appear, undoubtedly,
that he is not made a bare example or pattern, but that the blessing is truly
promised to him; because without him we be all accursed. Yet there remaineth one
doubt; for certain both these are spoken in one sense, They shall be blessed in
thee, and in thy seed; but Abraham was nothing else but a type or mirror of the
blessing. I answer, that in the person of Abraham, that body is also noted out,
which dependeth upon one head, and is knit together in the
same.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the
families</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Jews do grossly expound
this, That all nations shall desire to be blessed, as the seed of Abraham. But
we say otherwise, That they shall be engrafted into the society. For the name of
Abraham tendeth to this end, because it should come to pass that God should
gather all people
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F199</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
unto him. Also, when the prophets will declare the force hereof, they foretell
everywhere that the inheritance of salvation shall be common to the Gentiles.
And hereby it appeareth that the covenant of God, which was then proper to the
Jews alone, is not only common to all men, but is made with us expressly;
otherwise, we could not conceive that hope of salvation which is firm enough out
of the gospel. Therefore, let us not suffer this promise to be wrung from us,
which is, as it were, a solemn declaration, whereby the Lord maketh us his heirs
together with the fathers. Whereunto Peter also had respect, when as he saith
shortly after, that Christ was first sent unto the Jews; for he doth signify
that the Gentiles also have their order, though it be
secondary.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath raised up his
Son.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He gathereth out of the words of
Moses that Christ is now revealed. But the words do seem to import no such
thing; yet doth he reason fitly thus, because the blessing could no otherwise
be, unless the beginning thereof did flow from the Messias. For we must always
remember this, that all mankind is accursed, and, therefore, there is a singular
remedy promised us, which is performed by Christ alone. Wherefore, he is the
only fountain and beginning of the blessing. And if so be that Christ came to
this end, that he may bless the Jews first, and, secondly, us, he hath
undoubtedly done that which was his duty to do; and we shall feel the force and
effect of this duty in ourselves, unless our unbelief do hinder
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This was a part of the priest&#8217;s office under
the law, to bless the people; and, lest this should be only a vain ceremony,
there was a promise added; as it is,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;040627&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Numbers
6:27.) And that which was shadowed in the old priesthood was truly performed in
Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
7:1, 6.) Concerning which matter we have spoken more at large in the seventh
chapter to the Hebrews. I like not Erasmus&#8217;s translation; for he saith,
<i>when he had raised him up, </i>as if he spoke of a thing which was done long
ago. But Peter meaneth rather, that Christ was raised up, when he was declared
to be the author of the blessing; which thing, since it was done of late and
suddenly, it ought to move their minds the more. For the Scripture useth to
speak thus, as in the last place, of Moses, whereunto Peter alludeth. To raise
up a prophet, is to furnish him with necessary gifts to fulfill his function,
and, as it were, to prefer him to the degree of prophetical honor. And Christ
was raised up then, when he fulfilled the function enjoined him by his Father,
but the same thing is done daily when he is offered by the gospel, that he may
excel amongst us. We have said that in the adverb of order, first, is noted the
right of the first-be-gotten, because it was expedient that Christ should begin
with the Jews, that he might afterward pass over unto the
Gentiles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whilst that he
turneth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He doth again commend the
doctrine of repentance, to the end we may learn to conclude under the blessing
of Christ newness of life, as when Esaias promiseth that a &#8220;Redeemer
should come to Zion,&#8221; he addeth a restraint;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F200</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;Those which in Jacob shall be turned from their iniquities.&#8221; For
Christ doth not do away the sins of the faithful, to the end they may grant
liberty to themselves to sin under this color; but he maketh them therewith all
new men. Although we must diligently distinguish these two benefits which are
linked together, that this ground-work may continue, that we are reconciled to
God by free pardon, I know that other men turn it otherwise; but this is the
true meaning of Luke; for he speaketh thus word for word, &#8220;In turning
every one from his wickedness.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER 4</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this narration we must consider three things
chiefly. That so soon as the truth of the gospel doth once appear, Satan setteth
himself against the same on the other side, so much as he is able, and
attempteth all things that he may smolder the same in the very first beginnings.
Secondly, That God doth furnish his children with invincible force and strength,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F210</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they may stand steadfast and unmovable against all assaults of Satan, and
not yield unto the violence of the wicked. And, last of all, we must note the
event and end, that howsoever the adversaries seem to bear the chiefest swing,
and they themselves do omit nothing which may serve to blot out the name of
Christ; and, on the other side, howsoever the ministers of sound doctrine be as
sheep in the mouths of wolves, yet doth God spread abroad the kingdom of his
Son; he fostereth the light of the gospel which is lighted; and he is the
protector of his children. Therefore, so often as the doctrine of the gospel
ariseth, and divers motions do rise on the other side, and the course thereof is
letted divers ways, there is no cause why godly minds should faint or quail, as
at some unwonted thing; but they ought rather to remember, that these are
ordinary endeavors of Satan, so that we must think upon this well before it come
to pass, that it cannot otherwise be but that Satan will spew out all his might
and main, so often as Christ doth come abroad with his doctrine. And therewithal
let us consider that the constancy of the apostles is set forth unto us for an
example, lest, being overcome either with any perils, or threatenings, or
terrors, we leap back from that profession of faith which the Lord requireth at
our hands. And, moreover, let us comfort ourselves with this, that we need not
to doubt but that the Lord will give prosperous success when we have done our
duty faithfully.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And as they
spoke</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hereby it appeareth how watchful
the wicked be, because they are always ready at an inch to stop the mouth of the
servants of Christ. And, undoubt edly, they came together, as it were, to quench
some great fire; which thing Luke signifieth, when as he saith that the ruler or
captain of the temple came also; and he addeth, moreover, that they took it
grievously that the apostles did teach. Therefore, they came not upon them by
chance, but of set purpose, that, according to their authority, they might
restrain the apostles, and put them to silence. And yet they have some show of
law and equity; for if any man did rashly intrude himself, it was the office of
the high priest to repress him; and also in like sort, to keep the people in the
obedience of the law and the prophets, and to prevent all new doctrines.
Therefore, when they hear unknown men, and such as had no public authority,
preaching unto the people in the temple, they seem, according as their office
did require, and they were commanded by God, to address themselves to remedy
this. And surely, at the first blush, it seemeth that there was nothing in this
action worthy of reprehension, but the end doth at length declare that their
counsel was wicked, and their affection ungodly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again, it was a hard matter for the apostles to
escape infamy and reproach, because they, being private and despised persons,
did take upon them public authority; to wit, because, when things are out of
order, many things must be essayed to [against] the common custom, and
especially, when we are to avouch and defend religion and the worship of God,
and the ringleaders themselves do stop all ways, and do abuse that office
against God, which was committed unto them by God. The faithful champions of
Christ must swallow up and pass through this ignominy in [under] Popery. For a
thousand summers will go over their heads before any reformation or amendment
will wax ripe amongst them for the better. Therefore, Luke standeth upon this
point, when as he saith that they were grieved because the resurrection was
preached in the name of Christ. For hereupon it followeth that they did hate the
doctrine before they knew the same. He expresseth the Sadducees by name, as
those which were more courageous
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F211</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in this cause. For they were almost [usually] a part of the priests; but because
the question is about the resurrection, they set themselves against the apostles
more than the rest. Furthermore, this was most monstrous confusion amongst the
Jews, in that this sect, which was profane, was of such authority. For what
godliness could remain, when as the immortality of the soul was counted as a
fable, and that freely? But men must needs run headlong after this sort, when
they have once suffered pure doctrine to fall to the ground amongst them.
Wherefore, we must so much the more diligently beware of every wicked turning
aside, lest such a step do follow immediately.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some men think that the ruler of the temple was
chosen from among the priests, but I do rather think that he was some chief
captain of the Roman army; for it was a place which was fortified both naturally
and artificially. Again, Herod had built a tower there, which was called
Antonia; so that it is to be thought that he had placed there a band of
soldiers, and that the Roman captain had the government of the temple, lest it
should be a place of refuge for the Jews, if they had stirred up any tumult,
which we may likewise gather out of Josephus. And this agreeth very well, that
the enemies of Christ did crave the help of the secular power, under color of
appeasing some tumult. In the mean season, they seek favor at the hands of the
Romans, as if they were careful to maintain the right of their
empire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And many of them which
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The apostles are put in prison,
but the force of their preaching is spread far and wide, and the course thereof
is at liberty. Of which thing Paul boasteth very much, that the Word of God is
not bound with him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;550209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:9.) And here we see that Satan and the wicked have liberty granted
them to rage against the children of God; yet can they not (maugre their heads 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F212</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)
prevail, but that God doth further and promote the kingdom of his Son; Christ
doth gather together his sheep; and that a few men unarmed, furnished with no
garrisons, do show forth more power in their voice alone, than all the world, by
raging against them. This is, indeed, no common work of God, that one sermon
brought forth such plentiful fruit; but this is the more to be wondered at, that
the faithful are not terrified with the present danger, and discouraged from
taking up the cross of Christ together with the faith. For this was a hard
beginning for novices. Christ did more evidently declare by this efficacy and
force of doctrine that he was alive, than if he should have offered his body to
be handled with hand, and to be seen with the eyes. And whereas it is said that
the number of those which believed did grow to be about five thousand, I do not
understand it of those which were newly added, but of the whole
church.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> It is a thing worthy to be noted in this
place, that the wicked do omit no subtilty that they may blot out the gospel and
the name of Christ, and yet do they not obtain that which they hoped for;
because God doth make their counsels frustrate. For they make an assembly,
wherein they do all things so tyrannously, that yet, notwithstanding, lust
beareth a show of right, and liberty is driven far away, and at length the truth
may seem to be condemned by good right. But the Lord bringeth upon them a sudden
fear, so that they dare not do that which they can, and which they do most of
all desire. Whatsoever the apostles shall bring in defense of their cause, that
shall remain buried and shut up with the walls, where there is none which doth
bear them any favor. And therefore there is no place left for the truth. Yet we
see how the Lord bringeth their counsel to nought, whilst that being kept back
with fear of the people, they stay themselves and bridle their fury, to the end
they may avoid envy. But I marvel much why Luke doth make Annas the highest
priest in this place, seeing that it appeareth by Josephus, that this honor was
not taken from Caiaphas until Vitellius had entered Jerusalem to bear rule,
after that Pilate was commanded to depart unto Rome. All men grant that the Lord
was crucified in the eighteenth year of Tiberius. And that empire [the reign of
Tiberius] did continue four years longer. And it must needs be, that there were
three years complete, after the death of Christ, before Pilate was put from the
office of the pro-consul. For when Tiberius was dead he came to Rome; so that
Caiaphas was high priest yet three years after the death of Christ. Wherefore it
is to be thought, that that whereof Luke speaketh in this place did not happen
immediately after the resurrection of Christ; although the doubt cannot thus be
answered.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F213</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For Josephus reporteth, that Jonathas was chosen into the place of Caiaphas; but
because this Jonathas was the son of Annas, it is a thing not unlike to be true,
that the son was called by the name of the father; as Caiaphas also had two
names; for they did also call him Joseph.</font><br></div>

may not be given to any other.

</i>is taken in this place for authority. In sum, they deal as if they were most
earnest defenders and maintainers of God&#8217;s glory. In the mean season,
their importunateness is wonderful, in that they go about to drive the apostles
to make denial, by asking many questions concerning a manifest matter, and to
wring out by fear some other thing than they had confessed. But God doth bring
their crafty wiliness to nought, and maketh them hear that which they would
not.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peter, being filled with the Holy
Ghost</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is not without great cause
that Luke addeth this, to the end we may know that Peter spake not with such a
majesty of himself. And surely, seeing he had denied his Master, Christ, being
afraid at the voice of a silly woman,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402670&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

He excelleth in both these so much, that his answer is indeed divine. He is
another manner of man here than he was before. Furthermore, this profiteth us
two manner of ways. For this title, or commendation, is of no small force to set
forth the doctrine which shall follow immediately, when it is said that it came
from the Holy God, [Spirit.] And we are taught to crave at the hands of the Lord
the Spirit of wisdom and strength, when we make profession of our faith, to
direct our hearts and minds. The<i> </i>fullness of the Spirit is taken for a

examine them unjustly concerning a benefit which deserveth praise, as if he and
his fellow had committed some heinous offense. If, saith he, we be accused for
this cause, because we have made a sick man whole. Peter hath in this place more
respect unto the wicked affection of the mind than unto the very order of the
question. For if, under color of a miracle, the apostles would have drawn away
the people from the true and sincere worship of God, they should have been
worthily called to answer for themselves; because religion doth far excel all
the good things of this present life. But seeing they (having no cause at all)
did wickedly make an offense of that which they ought to have honored, Peter,
being supported with this confidence, doth at the first gird them wittily with a
taunting preface, because they sit as judges to condemn good deeds. Yet he
toucheth this point but lightly, that he may pass over unto the
matter.</font><br></div>

but because the miracle was wrought, to this end, that the name of Christ might
be glorified, he descendeth by and by unto this. For he knew that he was the
minister of such excellent power of God, that he might have a seal to confirm
his doctrine. In the meanwhile, the wicked, will they, nil they, are enforced to
hear that which they would have had buried full deep. When they have done what
they can, this is all; they cause Peter to avouch and object to their faces,
that wherewith they were so grieved, when it was spoken to others. And, first he
maketh Christ the author of the miracle. Secondly, because it seemed to be an
absurd and incredible thing, that a dead man should be endued with divine power,
he testifieth that Christ is alive, because God hath raised him up from the
dead, howsoever they had crucified him. So that the miracle giveth him occasion
to preach the resurrection of Christ. And by this testimony Peter meant to prove
that he was the true Messias. He saith that they had crucified him, not only to
the end he may upbraid this unto them, that they may acknowledge their fault;
but also that they may understand that they have in vain striven against God;
and so, consequently, cease to rage so unluckily and with such deadly
success.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the
stone.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He confirmeth by testimony of
Scripture that it is no new thing that the ringleaders
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F217</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the Church, which have glorious titles given them, and have the chief room in
the temple of God, have, notwithstanding, wickedly rejected Christ. Therefore he
citeth a place out of the 118th Psalm,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
118:22,) where David complaineth that he is rejected of the captains [leaders]
of the people, and yet, notwithstanding, he boasteth that he was chosen of God
to have the chief room. Moreover, he compareth the Church, or the state of the
kingdom, by an usual metaphor to a building, he calleth those which have the
government the masters of the work,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F218</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and he maketh himself the principal stone, whereon the whole building is stayed
and grounded. For that is meant by the head of the corner. Therefore, this is
David&#8217;s comfort, that howsoever the captains have rejected him, so that
they would not grant him even the basest place, yet did not their wicked and
ungodly endeavors hinder him from being extolled by God unto the highest degree
of honor. But that was shadowed in David which God would have perfectly
expressed in the Messias. Therefore Peter dealeth very aptly when as he citeth
this testimony, as being spoken before of Christ, as they knew full well that it
did agree properly to him. Now we know to what end Peter did cite the Psalm; to
wit, lest the elders and priests being unadvisedly puffed up with their honor,
should take to themselves authority and liberty to allow or disallow whatsoever
they would. For it is evident that the stone refused by the chief builders is
placed by God&#8217;s own hand in the chief place, that it may support the whole
house.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, this happeneth not once only, but it
must be fulfilled daily; at least it must seem no new thing if the chief
builders do even now reject Christ. Whereby the vain boasting of the Pope is
plainly refuted, who maketh his boast of the bare title, that he may usurp
whatsoever is Christ&#8217;s. Admit we grant to the Pope and his horned beasts
that which they desire, to wit, that they are appointed to be ordinary pastors
of the Church, they can go no farther at length than to be called chief builders
with Annas and Caiaphas. And it is evident what account ought to be made of this
title, which they think is sufficient to mix heaven and earth together. Now let
us gather out of this place some things which are worth the noting. Forasmuch as
they are called master-builders who have government of the Church, the name
itself putteth them in mind of their duty. Therefore, let them give themselves
wholly to the building of the temple of God. And because all men do not their
duty faithfully as they ought, let them see what is the best manner of building
aright, to wit, let them retain Christ for the foundation; that done, let them
not mix straw and stubble in this building, but let them make the whole building
of pure doctrine; as Paul teacheth in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:12. Whereas God is said to have extolled Christ, who was rejected
of the builders, this ought to comfort us, when as we see even the pastors of
the Church, or, at least, those which are in great honor, wickedly rebel against
Christ, that they may banish him. For we may safely set light by those visors
which they object against us; so that we need not fear to give Christ that humor
which God doth give to him. But if he wink for a time, yet doth he laugh at the
boldness of his enemies from on high, whilst they rage and fret upon earth.
Furthermore, though their conspiracies be strong and well guarded with all aids,
yet must we always assure ourselves of this, that Christ&#8217;s honor shall
remain safe and sound. And let the fruit of this confidence ensue also, that we
be valiant and without fear in maintaining the kingdom of Christ, whereof God
will be an invincible defender, as he himself affirmeth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have already spoken of Peter&#8217;s constancy, in
that one simple man, having such envious judges, and yet having but one partner
in the present danger, showeth no token at all of fear, but doth freely confess
in that raging and furious company, that thing which he knew would be received
with most contrary minds. And whereas he sharply upbraideth unto them that
wickedness which they had committed, we must let [seek] from hence a rule of
speech when we have to deal with the open enemies of the truth. For we must
beware of two faults on this behalf, that we seem not to flatter by keeping
silence or winking; for that were treacherous silence, whereby the truth should
be betrayed. Again, that we be not puffed up with wantonness, or immoderate heat
as men&#8217;s minds do oftentimes break out more than they ought in contention.
Therefore, let us use gravity in this point, yet such as is moderate; let us
chide freely, yet without all heat of railing. We see that Peter did observe
this order. For at the first he giveth an honorable title; when he is once come
to the matter he inveigheth sharply against them; neither could such ungodliness
as theirs was be concealed. Those which shall follow this example shall not only
have Peter to be their guide, but also the Spirit of God.</font><br></div>

Neither is there salvation in any other.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>He passeth from the <i>species </i>[salvation] unto the <i>genus, </i>[or
more particular,] and he goeth from the corporal benefit unto perfect health,
[or general.] And assuredly Christ had showed this one token of his grace, to
the end he might be known to be the only author of life. We must consider this
in all the benefits of God, to wit, that he is the fountain of salvation. And he
meant to prick and sting the priests with this sentence, when as he saith that
there is salvation in none other save only in Christ, whom they went about to
put quite out of remembrance.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F219</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As if he should say, that they are twice damned who did not only refuse the
salvation offered them by God, but endeavor to bring the same to nought, and did
take from all the people the fruit and use thereof. And although he seemeth to
speak unto deaf men, yet doth he preach of the grace of Christ, if peradventure
some can abide to hear; if not, that they may at least be deprived of all excuse
by this testimony.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither is there any other
name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He expoundeth the sentence next
going before. Salvation (saith he) is in Christ alone, because God hath decreed
that it should be so. For by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>name</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he meaneth the cause or mean, as if he should have said, forasmuch as
salvation is in God&#8217;s power only, he will not have the same to be common
to us by any other means than if we ask it of Christ alone. Whereas he saith
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>under
heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>they do commonly refer it unto
creatures, as if he should say, that the force and power to save is given to
Christ alone. Notwithstanding, I do rather think that this was added, because
men cannot ascend into heaven, that they may come unto God. Therefore, seeing we
are so far from the kingdom of God, it is needful that God do not only invite us
unto himself, but that reaching out his hand he offer salvation unto us, that we
may enjoy the same. Peter teacheth in this place, that he hath done that in
Christ, because he came down into the earth for this cause, that he might bring
salvation with him, Neither is that contrary to this doctrine, that Christ is
ascended above all heavens,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:10.) For he took upon him our flesh once for this cause, that he might be a
continual pledge of our adoption. He hath reconciled the Father to us for ever
by the sacrifice of his death: by his resurrection he hath purchased for us
eternal life. And he is present with us now also, that he may make us partakers
of the fruit of eternal redemption; but the revealing of salvation is handled in
this place, and we know that the same was so revealed in Christ, that we need
not any longer to say, &#8220;Who shall ascend into heaven?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:6.) And if so be this doctrine were deeply imprinted in the minds of all men,
then should so many controversies concerning the causes of salvation be soon at
an end, wherewith the Church is so much troubled. The Papists confess with us,
that salvation is in God alone, but by and by they forge to themselves infinite
ways to attain unto the same. But Peter calleth us back unto Christ alone. They
dare not altogether deny that we have salvation given us by Christ; but whilst
they feign so many helps, they leave him scarce the hundredth part of salvation.
But they were to seek for salvation at the hands of Christ wholly; for when
Peter excludeth plainly all other means, he placeth perfect salvation in Christ
alone, and not some part thereof only. So that they are far from understanding
this doctrine.</font><br></div>

this answer. for this council did undoubtedly represent the Church; but because
they do abuse their authority, the apostles say flatly that they are not to be
obeyed. And (as men use to do in an evident matter) they refer over the judgment
unto their adversaries for a reproach unto them. Furthermore it is worth the
noting, that they set the authority of God against their decrees; which thing
should be done out of season, unless they were the enemies of God, who
notwithstanding, were otherwise the ordinary pastors of the Church. Moreover,
the apostles express a farther thing also to wit, that the obedience which men
use toward evil and unfaithful pastors, howsoever they hold the lawful
government of the Church, is contrary to God. This question doth the Pope answer
pleasantly,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F222</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because he saith that all those things are divine oracles whatsoever it hath
pleased him to blunder out un-advisedly.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F223</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By this means the danger of contrariety is taken away. But the bishops can
challenge no more at this day than God had given then to the order of the
priests. Therefore, this is a toy too childish, [viz.] that they can command
nothing but that which is agreeable to the commandment of God.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F224</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Yea, rather the thing itself declareth evidently that there shall be no conflict
then if they suffer their vain and unbridled lust to range freely, having
vanquished and renounced the doctrine of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, by what title soever men be called, yet
must we hear them only upon this condition, if they lead us not away from
obeying God. So that we must examine all their traditions by the rule of the
Word of God. We must obey princes and others which are in authority, yet so that
they rob not God (who is the chief King, Father, and Lord) of his right and
authority. If we must observe such modesty in politic [civil] government, it
ought to be of far more force in the spiritual government of the Church. And
lest, according to their wonted pride, they think that their authority is
abated, when God is extolled above them, Peter draweth them away from such
pleasant flattering of themselves, telling them that this matter must be
determined before the judgment-seat of God; for he saith plainly <i>before
</i>[in the sight of] God; because, howsoever men be blinded, yet will God never
suffer any man to be preferred before him. And surely the Spirit did put this
answer in the mouth of the apostles, not only to the end he might repress the
furiousness of the enemies, but that he might also teach us what we ought to do,
so often as men become so proud, that having shaken off the yoke of God, they
will lay their own yoke upon us. Therefore, let us then remember this holy
authority of God, which is able to drive away the vain smoke of all man&#8217;s
excellency.</font><br></div>

by hearing and seeing may, yea, ought to be concealed, when as the question is
concerning the redeeming of peace. For this is a point of discourtesy and of
wicked stubbornness to move and raise a tumult about unnecessary matters; but
the apostles do not speak generally, when as they say they cannot but speak. For
the gospel of Christ is now in hand, wherein consisteth both the glory of God
and the salvation of men. It is an unmeet thing, and sacrilegious wickedness,
that the same should be suppressed by prohibitions and menacings
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F225</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of men; for God commandeth that his gospel be preached, especially since they
did know that they were chosen to be witnesses and preachers of Christ, and that
God had opened their mouth. Therefore, whosoever putteth them to silence, he
endeavoreth so much as he is able to abolish the grace of God, and fordo
[destroy] the salvation of men. And if so be that a prohibition so wicked do
stop our mouths, woe be to our sluggishness. Now, let all men see what
confession God requireth at their hands, lest, when they keep silence because of
men, they hear a fearful voice proceed out of the mouth of Christ, whereby their
unfaithfulness shall be condemned. And as for those which are called unto the
office of teaching, let them be terrified with no threatenings of men, with no
color of authority, but let them execute
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F226</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that office which they know is enjoined them by God. Woe be unto me, saith Paul,
if I preach not the gospel, because the function is committed unto me,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 9:10.) Neither ought we only to set this commandment of God against
the tyrannous commandments of men, but also against all lets which Satan doth
oftentimes thrust in to break off and hinder the course of the gospel. For we
have need of a strong buckler to bear off such sore assaults, which all the
ministers of Christ do feel; but howsoever we speed, this is a brazen wall, that
the preaching of the gospel doth please God, and therefore that it can for no
cause be suppressed.</font><br></div>

bridled by the secret power of God, so that they cannot tell how to do any hurt.

How is it that being content with threatenings, they do not also rage against
their bodies, save only because the power of God doth bind them as a chain? Not
that the fear of God doth prevail with them, for it is the regard of the people
alone which hindereth them; but the Lord doth bind them with his bonds, though
they be ignorant thereof. Luke commendeth unto us the providence of God in
preserving his children; and though it be hidden from the wicked, yet we may
behold the same with the eyes of faith, Furthermore, the wonderful counsel of
God doth show itself here, in that the glory of Christ is furthered by those
which are his most deadly enemies. For whereas the priests do assemble
themselves together, it is not done without great rumor. All men wait for some
rare and singular event; the apostles depart, being let loose and acquitted.
Therefore, the adversaries are not only vanquished, but they confirm the gospel
against their will. Notwithstanding, it is expedient for us to mark again, that
the faithful do so get the victory, that they are always humbled under the
cross. For they are threatened again, and straitly charged, that they teach not
henceforth in the name of Christ. Therefore, they do not so get the upper hand
that they do not triumph, save only under the reproach of the cross. Whereas
Luke saith that they did </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
glorified God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he noteth the fruit of
the miracle now the second time, although it may be that they were not all
brought unto the perfect end. For that man which is touched with the feeling of
the power of God, and doth not come unto Christ, neither hath his faith
confirmed by the miracle he stayeth, as it were, in the midway. Yet this was
some thing, though not all, that the power of God was acknowledged in the
healing of the man, so that the adversaries being ashamed, did cease off from
their fury, or at least give back a little.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Furthermore when they were let go.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It
shall appear by and by to what end they declared to the other disciples what
things had befallen them, to wit, that they might be the more emboldened and
encouraged by the grace of God hereafter; secondly, that they might arm
themselves with prayer against the furious threatenings of their enemies; and
thus must the children of God do, one must prick forward another, and they must
join hand in hand, that they may vanquish the common adversary fighting under
Christ&#8217;s banner. They consider
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F228</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
with themselves what dangers hang over their heads, to the end they may be the
more ready to enter

the same, although they see their enemies press sore upon them; yet lest it
should grieve them

themselves that they shall be invincible

through the same power of God whereby they got the victory before. And it is to
be thought (although Luke makes no mention thereof) that the apostles being
contented with their former answer, did not contend with those furies, [furious
men;] and yet we must persuade ourselves that they were not so forgetful of
their former constancy that they did submit themselves unto their ungodly decree
like slaves.

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F236</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because his enemies withstood him on every side. We know how the rulers and
people conspired together with Saul and his family; after that the Philistines,
and other strange enemies, despising him when he came newly to the crown, made
war against him, striving who should begin first, wherefore it is not without
cause that he complaineth that the kings rage and take counsel together, and
that the people do go about divers things; nevertheless, because he knew that
God was the supporter of his kingdom, he derideth their foolish enterprises, and
affirmeth that they are vain; but because his kingdom was established, that it
might be a figure or image of the kingdom of Christ, David doth not stay still
in the shadow itself; but he apprehendeth the body, yea, the Holy Ghost, as the
apostles do truly repeat the same, doth sharply reprove the foolish and
ridiculous madness of the world, in that they dare invade the kingdom of Christ
which God had esta-blished, as well in the person of David as of Christ himself.
And this is a singular comfort, in that we hear that God is on our side, so long
as we go on warfare under the kingdom of Christ. Hereby we may persuade
ourselves, that howsoever all men, both high and low do wickedly conspire
together against this kingdom, yet shall they not prevail, for what is all the
whole world compared with God? But we must first of all know and assure
ourselves of this, that God will continually maintain the kingdom of his Son,
whereof he himself is the author, so that we may set his decree (which shall not
be broken) against the rashness of men, that trusting to the help of his hand,
we may not doubt to despise all the preparation and furniture of men, though
they be terrible; and he doth diligently express how great the bands of the
adversaries are; he saith, that they attempt all things, he doth also reckon up
their counsels, lest any of these do terrify us. Furthermore, when as the Psalm
teacheth, that the kingdom of Christ shall endure, maugre the heads of the
adversaries, it doth also show that there shall be many adversaries, which shall
endeavor to overthrow the same. On the one side, he bringeth in the kings
raging, on the other, the people all out of quiet,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F237</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
whereby he signifieth that all estates shall be offended at it;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F238</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and no marvel, because nothing is more contrary to the flesh than the spiritual
sword of the gospel wherewith Christ killeth us, that he may make us obey him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:16.) Therefore, we must know this for a surety, that the kingdom of Christ
shall never be quiet in the world, lest when we are to fight, we be afraid as at
some strange thing.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Against the Lord, and his
Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Spirit teacheth by this
word, that all those do make war against God which refuse to submit themselves
to Christ; they do full little think this oftentimes, notwithstanding it is so
that because God will reign in the person of his Son alone, we refuse to obey
him so often as we rebel against Christ, as the Lord himself saith in John,
&#8220;He which honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father.&#8221; Wherefore
let the hypocrites profess a thousand times that they mean nothing less than to
make war against God, yet shall they find this true, that God is their open
enemy, unless they embrace Christ with his gospel. The use of this doctrine is
double, for it armeth us against all the terrors of the flesh, because we must
not fear, lest they get the victory of God which withstand the gospel. Again, we
must beware, lest, through the contempt of godly doctrine, we advance ourselves
against God to our own destruction.</font><br></div>

declare that this prophecy was proved to be true by the event, to the end they
may believe the same more assuredly, for the sense is, Lord, thou hast spoken it
and we have in truth tried [experienced] the same to be true; and they call to
mind that which was done four years before, or thereabout. In like sort, it is
expedient for us to apply the events of things which are foretold to the
confirmation of our faith; but because it might seem that the matter fell out
far otherwise then than the Psalm pronounceth, forasmuch as they raged not in
vain, neither were the assaults of the enemies frustrate when they had put
Christ to death; and their violence went further afterwards after a fearful
manner. The faithful remove this offense, and say that the enemies could do no
more than God had appointed; therefore, howsoever the wicked did suppose that
Christ was quite taken away by death, and did now vainly triumph, yet the
faithful confess that their rage was all but vain. But here may a question be
moved, why he calleth them the Gentiles and people of Israel, seeing there was
but one body? I think that the diversity of countries is noted in this place,
out of which the Jews came together to the feast, as if they should have said,
that the Jews which were born in divers places, having made, as it were, a
concourse, did assault the kingdom of Christ, yet was their fury frustrate and
of none effect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy holy Son

David, for they call

sometimes a servant sometimes a son; and David is so called, because he was the
minister of God, as well in ruling the people as in the office of a prophet; but
this word, <i>son, </i>agreeth better with the person of Christ, unless some man
had liefer take it thus, that Luke meant to allude unto that likelihood
[resemblance] which David had with Christ when he setteth down a word of a
double signification. It is expressly said, that God hath anointed his Son, that
that may truly agree to him which is in the Psalm, for in anointing him God made
him a King, and yet we must note therewithal what anointing this was, for we
know that he was not anointed with visible oil, but with the Holy
Ghost.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they might
do.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have already declared to what end
this is spoken; that the kingdom of Christ was so far from being overrun by that
conspiracy, that in truth it did then flourish. Notwithstanding herein is
contained a singular doctrine, that God doth so govern and guide all things by
his secret counsel, that, he doth bring to pass those things which he hath
determined, even by the wicked. Not that they are ready willingly to do him such
service, but because he turneth their counsels and attempts backward; so that on
the one side appeareth great equity and most great righteousness; on the other
appeareth nought but wickedness and iniquity. Which matter we have handled more
at large in the second chapter. Let us learn here, by the way, that we must so
consider the providence of God, that we know that it is the chief and only
guider of all things which are done in the world, that the devil and all the
wicked are kept back with God&#8217;s bridle, lest they should do us any harm;
that when they rage fastest, yet are they not at liberty to do what they list,
but have the bridle given them, yet so far forth as is expedient to exercise us.
Those men which do acknowledge the foreknowledge of God alone, and yet confess
not that all things are done as it pleaseth him, are easily convict by these
words, That God hath appointed before that thing to be done which was done. Yea,
Luke being not contented with the
word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

of things are not only governed by the counsel of God, but that they are also
ordered by his power and hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And now O
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They do very well extend that unto
themselves which they cited concerning Christ; because he will not, be separated
from the gospel; yea, what trouble so ever befalleth his members, he applieth
that to his own person. And they crave at God&#8217;s hands that he will beat
down the cruelty of the adversaries; yet not so much for their own sake that
they may live quietly and without vexation, as that they may have liberty to
preach the gospel in all places. Neither was it for them to desire a life which
they might spend idly, having forsaken their calling. For they add, &#8220;Grant
unto thy servants, O Lord, that they may speak boldly.&#8221; And by the way we
must note this speech, that the Lord would behold their threatenings. For seeing
it belongeth properly to him to resist the proud, and to throw down their lofty
looks; the more proudly they brag and boast, the more do they undoubtedly
provoke God to be displeased with them, and it is not to be doubted but that
God, being offended with such indignity and cruelty, will redress the same. So
Ezechias, to the end he may obtain help in extremity, declareth before the Lord
the arrogancy of Sennacherib and his cruel threatenings,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;233714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
37:14 and 17.) Wherefore let the cruelty and reproaches of our enemies rather
stir up in us a desire to pray, than any whit discourage us from going forward
in the course of our office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Grant unto thy
servants.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Seeing that one miracle had
stinged the enemy so sore how is it that these holy men do desire to have new
miracles done daily? Therefore we gather that hence which I have already
touched, that they make so great account of the glory of God, that in comparison
of this, they set light by all other things. They have respect unto this one
thing only, that the power of God may be declared by miracles, which the godly
ought always to desire, although the adversaries burst, and all the whole hell
do rage. The same must we also think of boldness to speak. They knew that the
wicked could abide nothing worse than the free course of the gospel; but because
they know that that is the doctrine of life which God will have published
whatsoever befall; they do undoubtedly prefer the preaching thereof before all
other things, because it is acceptable to God. And we are taught that we do then
rightly acknowledge the benefits of God as we ought, if by this occasion we be
pricked forward to pray, that he will confirm that which he hath began. The
apostles had showed a token of heroic fortitude; now again they pray that they
may be furnished with boldness. So Paul desireth the faithful to pray unto the
Lord that his mouth may be opened, whereas, notwithstanding, his voice did sound
everywhere
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490619&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:19.) Therefore, the more we perceive ourselves to be holpen by the Lord, let
us learn to crave at the hands of God that we may go forward hereafter; and
especially seeing the free confession of the gospel is a singular gift of God,
we must continually beseech him to keep us in the same.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when they had
prayed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke declareth now that God did
not only hear this prayer, but did also testify the same by a visible sign from
heaven. For the shaking of the place should, of itself, have done them small
good; but it tendeth to another end, that the faithful may know that God is
present with them. Finally, it is nothing else but a token of the presence of
God. But the fruit followeth, for they are all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
endowed with greater boldness. We ought rather to stand upon this second member.
For whereas God did declare his power then by shaking the place it was a rare
and extraordinary thing; and whereas it appeared by the effect, that the
apostles did obtain that which they desired, this is a perpetual profit of
prayer, which is also set before us for an example.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
multitude.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>In this place there are three
things commended; that the faithful were all of one mind; that there was a
mutual partaking of goods amongst them; that the apostles behaved themselves
stoutly in announcing the resurrection of Christ. He saith that the
multitude</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> had one
heart;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>because this is far more
excellent than if a few men should have a mutual consent. And heretofore he hath
declared, that the Church did grow to be about five thousand. And now he saith
that there was wonderful concord in so great a multitude, which is a very hard
matter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And surely where faith beareth the chief sway, it
doth so knit the hearts of men together, that all of them do both will and nill
one thing. For discord springeth hence because we are not all governed with the
same Spirit of Christ. It is well known that by these two words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>soul,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>he meaneth the will. And because the wicked do oftentimes conspire together
to do evil, this concord was laudable and holy therefore because it was amongst
the faithful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And no man did
say.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the second member; that
they coupled this love with external benefits. But we shall see anon, after what
sort they had their goods common. This is now worth the noting in the text of
Luke that the inward unity of minds goeth before as the root, and then the fruit
followeth after. And surely even we ought to observe the same order, we must
love one another,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F239</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and then this love of ours must show itself by external effects.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F240</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And in vain do we boast of a right affection, unless there appear some testimony
thereof in external offices. Moreover, Luke declareth therewithal, that they
were not of one mind for any respect of their own commodity, forasmuch as the
rich men, when they did liberally bestow their goods, sought nothing less than
their own gain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>33.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And with great
power.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This third member appertaineth to
doctrine. For Luke doth signify that the zeal which the apostles had to preach
the gospel was so far from being diminished, that they were rather endowed with
new power. Whereas he doth only name the resurrection of Christ, it is
<i>synecdoche; </i>for this part is put for the whole gospel. But Luke maketh
mention of the resurrection alone, because it is, as it were, the furnishing or
fulfilling of the gospel; and, secondly, because they had endured a sore combat
for the same, and the Sadducees were sore grieved at it, who aid then bear the
chief swinge, [sway.]</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And great grace
was</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He signifieth that this served not
a little to the spreading abroad of doctrine, in that, by helping the poor so
bountifully, they found favor at the hands of strangers. For he saith that they
were beloved, because they were beneficial.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F241</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore, there is a showing of a reason in these words, No man amongst them
did lack. Although we need not doubt of this, but that their honesty, and
temperance, and modesty, and patience, and other virtues, did provoke many to
bear them good-will. He declareth
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F242</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
afterward, after what sort they had their goods common, which he had touched
before, to wit, that the rich men sold their lands and houses, that they might
relieve the poverty of the poor,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For so many as
were.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although this be an universal
speech, yet is it all one as if it were indefinite. And assuredly it is to be
thought that there were many which did not diminish their possessions, and that
may be gathered out of the text, [context.] For when he speaketh of Joses anon,
undoubtedly he meant to note a notable example, passing all others. Therefore he
saith, that all did that which many did every where; neither doth this disagree
with the common use of the Scripture. Again, he meaneth not that the faithful
sold all that they had, but only so much as need required. For this is spoken
for amplification&#8217;s sake, that the rich men did not only relieve the
poverty of their brethren of the yearly revenue of their lands, but they were so
liberal, that they spared not their lands. And this might be, though they did
not rob themselves of all, but only a little diminish their revenues; which we
may gather again out of the words of Luke, for he saith that this was the end,
that no man might lack. He showeth further, that they used great wisdom,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F243</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because it was distributed as every man had need. Therefore the goods were not
equally divided, but there was a discreet distribution made, lest any should be
out of measure oppressed with poverty. And, peradventure, Joses hath this
commendation given him by name, because he sold his only possession. For by this
means he passed all the rest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hereby it appeareth what that meaneth, that no man
counted anything his own, but they had all things common. For no man had his own
privately to himself, that he alone might enjoy the same, neglecting others; but
as need required, they were ready to bestow upon all men. And now we must needs
have more than iron bowels, seeing that we are no more moved with the reading of
this history. The faithful did at that day give abundantly even of that which
was their own, but we are not only content at this day wickedly to suppress that
which we have in our hands, but do also rob others. They did and faithfully
bring forth their own; we invent a thousand subtile shifts to draw all things
unto us by hook or by crook. They laid it down at the apostles&#8217; feet, we
fear not with sacrilegious boldness to convert that to our own use which was
offered to God. They sold in times past their possessions, there reigneth at
this day an insatiable desire to buy. Love made that common to the poor and
needy which was proper to every man; such is the unnaturalness of some men now,
that they cannot abide that the poor should dwell upon the earth, that they
should have the use of water, air, and heaven.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F244</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Wherefore, these things are written for our shame and
reproach. Although even the poor themselves are to blame for some part of this
evil. For seeing goods cannot be common after this sort, save only where there
is a godly agreement, and where there reigneth one heart and one soul; many men
are either so proud or unthankful, or slothful, or greedy, or such hypocrites,
that they do not only so much as in them lieth quite put out the desire to do
well, but also hinder ability. And yet must we remember that admonition of Paul,
that we be not weary of well-doing,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:9.) And whereas, under color of this, the Anabaptists and fantastical
[fanatical] men have made much ado, as if there ought to be no civil property of
goods amongst Christians, I have already refuted this folly
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F245</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of theirs in the second chapter. For neither doth Luke in this place prescribe a
law to all men which they must of necessity follow, while that he reckoneth up
what they did in whom a certain singular efficacy and power of the Holy Spirit
of God did show itself; neither doth he speak generally of all men, that it can
be gathered that they were not counted Christians which did not sell all that
they had.</font><br></div>

hitherto did show that that company, which was gathered together under the name
of Christ, was rather a company of angels than of men, Moreover, that was
incredible virtue, that the rich men did despoil themselves of their own accord,
not only of their money, but also of their land, that they might relieve the
poor. But now he showeth that Satan had invented a shift to get into that holy
company, and that under color of such excellent virtue; for he hath wonderful
wiles of hypocrisy to insinuate himself. This way doth Satan assault the Church,
when as he cannot prevail by open war. But we must specially in this place have
respect unto the drift of the Holy Ghost. For in this history he meant to
declare, first, how acceptable singleness of heart is to God, and what an
abomination hypocrisy is in his sight; secondly, how greatly he alloweth
[approves] the holy and pure policy and govermnent of his Church. For this is
the principal point, the punishment wherewith punished Ananias and his wife. As
the greatness thereof did at that time terrify them all, so it is unto us a
testimony that God cannot abide this unfaithfulness, when as bearing a show of
holiness where there is none, we do mock him contemptibly. For if, having
weighed all the circumstances, we be desirous to know the sum, Luke condemneth
no other fault in Ananias than this, that he meant to deceive God and the Church
with a reigned offering. Yet there were more evils packed under this
dissimulation: the contempt of God, whom he feareth not, though he knew his
wickedness; sacrilegious defrauding, because he keepeth back part of that which
he professeth to be holy to God; perverse vanity and ambition, because he
vaunteth himself in the presence of men, without having any respect unto
God&#8217;s judgment; want of faith, because he would never have gone this way
to work, unless he had mistrusted God; the corrupting of a godly and holy order;
furthermore, the hypocrisy itself was a great offense of
itself.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F246</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The fact of Ananias did bear a goodly
show,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F247</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
although he had given only the half of his land. Neither is this a small virtue,
for a rich man to bestow the half of his goods upon the poor; but the sacrifices
of the ungodly are an abomination to God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;201508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
15:8;) neither can any thing please him where the singleness of heart is
wanting. For this cause is it that Christ maketh more account of the two mites
offered by the widow, than of the great sums of others, who of their great heaps
gave some part,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
21:2.) This is the cause why God doth show an example of such sharp punishment
in Ananias. Now, let us note every point by
itself.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> He laid it at the feet of
the apostles.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Lo, what ambition doth!
Ananias is ashamed not to be accounted one of the best; therefore, although he
be greedy of money, yet to the end he may purchase a name amongst men, he
depriveth himself of some part of his riches. In the meanwhile, he doth not
consider that he lieth and deceiveth in the sight of God, and that God will
punish this lie. So it is, that he honoreth the apostles&#8217; feet more than
God&#8217;s eyes. Wherefore, we must take good heed, that when we do well, we do
not seek to be praised of the bystanders;

And Peter said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>How did Peter know
Ananias&#8217; fraud (and purloining?) Undoubtedly by the revelation of the
Spirit. Therefore, Luke signifieth unto us, that the apostles did after a sort
represent God&#8217;s person, and supply his room. If the Spirit of God, by the
mouth of a mortal man, do so sore urge an hypocrite, being otherwise painted
with the beautiful color of virtues, how shall the reprobate abide the voice of
God himself, with the sound of the trumpet, when they shall appear before his
judgment-seat? Furthermore, Peter pointeth out the cruelness and horribleness of
the offense
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F249</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
by his question, when he saith, that Satan had filled the heart of Ananias. For
there is no man whose heart is not pricked with the pricks of Satan, and all men
are also many ways tempted, yea, these temptations pierce into their minds; but
where Satan possesseth the heart, he reigneth in the whole man, having, as it
were, expelled God. This is a sign of a reprobate, to be so addicted and given
over to Satan, that the Spirit of God hath no place. That which followeth
afterward concerning lying may have a double sense; either that he did falsely
bear a show of the Spirit, or that he lied against the Spirit. And, indeed, it
is word for word <i>mentiri Spiritum; </i>but forasmuch as the Greek word
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">yeudesqai</font><font face="Palatino">]
is joined with a double accusative case and that doth better agree with the text
[context,] I am rather of this mind, that Ananias is reprehended, because he did
lie falsely to the Holy Ghost. Which he confirmeth shortly after, when he
upbraideth this unto him, that he hath lied unto God, and not unto men.
Wherefore we must take great heed, that hypocrisy reign not in us, which hath
this wickedness proper to it, to go about to deceive God, and, as it were
<i>cornicum oculos configere. </i>To go about to make blind those which are most
wise;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F250</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which cannot be without a disloyal and unseemly mock. Wherefore it is not
without cause that Peter saith, that where this cometh to pass the heart is
possessed of Satan. For who durst (unless he were void of reason) so blaspheme
God? Therefore Peter asketh him as of some wonder, because such blindness is
horrible.</font><br></div>

Did it not remaining.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This amplifieth
the offense because he sinned, being enforced by no necessity. For seeing it is
no just or lawful excuse to have been provoked by some other means, how much
worse is it to run headlong unto wickedness willingly, and, as it were of set
purpose to pull down God&#8217;s vengeance? We gather out of this, that no man
was enforced to sell his goods or lands. For Peter saith, that Ananias had free
liberty to keep both his land and his money; because in the second member, the
field which was sold is taken for the price itself. Therefore he should
nevertheless have been counted faithful, though he had kept that which was his
own. Whereby it appeareth that they are men destitute of their right wits, who
say that it is not lawful for the faithful to have anything of their
own.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast not lied to men, but to
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although the words be diversely
construed, yet do I not doubt but that this confirmeth the former sentence. For
hypocrites do so enwrap themselves in so many shifts, that they think they have
nothing to do with God. And Peter speaketh thus expressly, because Ananias had
deceived the Church. But he ought to have considered, that</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">yea, he ought to have behaved himself no otherwise in
that assembly, than if he should have seen God with his eyes. For seeing that
God will reign in the Church, if we give him any reverence, we must reverence
that rule and government religiously which he exerciseth by his Word. The
apostles were indeed men, but not private men, because God had put them in his
stead. Furthermore, we must note, that he saith that he lieth to God who doth
lie to the Holy Ghost. For the divinity of the Holy Ghost is manifestly proved
by this form of speech. In like sort Paul saith, &#8220;Ye are the temples of
God, because his Spirit dwelleth in you,&#8221;

Ananias doth, indeed, declare and prove the force of the word, which Paul cloth
highly extol; to wit, that it is the savor of death unto death to those which
perish,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 2:16.) He speaketh, indeed, of the spiritual death of the soul, but
there was a visible sign in the body of Ananias of that punishment which cannot
be seen with the eyes of men. He was not slain with sword, by force, nor hand,
but was stricken dead with the only hearing of the voice. When we hear this, let
the threatenings of the gospel terrify us, and humble us in time, lest we also
feel the like effect. For that which is spoken of Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He shall slay the
wicked with the breath of his mouth.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">doth not only appertain to the head of the wicked,
but also to every member. For those which refuse the salvation offered in his
word, it must needs be deadly to them, which was naturally wholesome. But and if
any man do think it an absurd thing that the apostle did punish Ananias bodily,
first, I answer, that this was an extraordinary thing; secondly, that this was
one of the gifts of the Spirit, as it appeareth by the 19th chapter of the First
to the Corinthians, (verse 10.) After which sort we shall afterward see Elymas,
the sorcerer, stricken with blindness by Paul,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:8.) Therefore, Peter did nothing which was impertinent to his function, when
he did in time shoot that dart which the Holy Ghost had given him. And whereas
some think that this was too cruel a punishment, this cometh to pass, because,
weighing Ananias&#8217; sin in their own and not in God&#8217;s balance, they
count that but a light offense which was a most great and grievous crime, being
full of such heinous offenses as I have already declared. Other some do think
that this was nothing so, because they see many hypocrites escape scot free
daily, which do no less mock God than did Ananias; yea, because they themselves
being most gross contemners of God, are yet notwithstanding unpunished for their
wickedness. But as God hath poured out visible graces upon his Church in the
beginning, to the end we may know that he will be present with us by the secret
power of his Spirit, yea, he showed that openly by external signs, which we feel
inwardly by the experiment of faith; so he declared by the visible punishment of
two, how horrible a judgment remaineth for all hypocrites, which shall mock God
and his Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there came great
fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This was the Lord&#8217;s purpose,

all hypocrisy. And that which Luke saith,
that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> they
feared,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>doth appertain unto us also. For
God meant to give all ages a lesson at that time, that they may learn to deal
sincerely and uprightly with him. In the mean season, the punishment of this
wicked person ought to have encouraged the godly hereafter to consecrate their
goods more freely to God and the poor; because they might gather how precious
alms was in the sight of God, seeing the profaning thereof was so punished.

Sapphira containeth no new thing, save only that the example was the more
confirmed thereby. And it came to pass by the certain providence of God, that
the Church should see apart the obstinate wickedness and treacherous mind of
them both. Seeing their faults were alike, they might have been known together;
but this was more fit and profitable for the Church, that they might severally
bewray their own wickedness. Neither was Sapphira provoked by the sight of her
husband to dissemble, (as it falleth out oftentimes,) that the fault could be
ascribed to shamefacedness, but of her own accord, and being pricked forward by
no other means, she seemeth to be no better than her husband. Moreover, their
wickedness in lying was like, forasmuch as she may see by Peter&#8217;s
interrogation that their guile was found out.</font><br></div>

vengeance upon any save the obstinate, and those which will not be pardoned.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F253</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For although Sapphira did know that the matter was hidden, she ought to have
been stricken with this question of Peter, no otherwise than if she had been
cited to appear before the judgment-seat of God. She hath a time granted her to
repent; yea, this is, as it were, a pleasant
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F254</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
inviting unto repentance. But she, in holding on so carelessly,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F255</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
doth declare that she was incurable, because she is touched with no fear of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hereby are we taught to labor diligently to bring
sinners into the way. For the Spirit of God keepeth this moderation; but when as
stubbornness and the stubborn contempt of God is added unto the offense, it is
now high time to punish. Therefore, those men are too arrogant who are
displeased with the immoderate rigor of God. It is rather our duty to consider
how we shall in time to come
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F256</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
stand before the judgment-seat of God; although this is too much to despise his
holy power and majesty, if we will have him mocked freely without any
punishment. Moreover, so many circumstances, which before I have gathered, do
sufficiently prove that Ananias and Sapphira were not worthy of one death only.
For, first of all, hypocrisy is of itself very abominable to God. Secondly,
whereas they are determined to lie unto God, this ariseth of great contempt, in
that they do not reverence and fear Christ, being the Chief Governor of those
amongst whom they were. It is ungodliness joined with impudency; because, so
they can escape shame and reproach amongst men, before whom they were determined
to vaunt and brag, they pass not to deny their manifest wickedness unto God.
Whereas they do stubbornly deny their offense, this doth, as it were, make up
the heap and measure. And whereas innumerable hypocrites do no less mock God and
the Church daily, who, notwithstanding, are not punished with death, I have
already showed why this ought to seem to be no inconvenient thing.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F257</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Forasmuch as God is the only Judge of the world, it belongeth to him to punish
every man at his pleasure, when and how it seemeth good to him. Wherefore we
must not prescribe unto him a certain mean and manner of punishment. But the
greatness of the spiritual judgment, which is as yet hid, hath been set before
us in the bodily punishment of two, as in a mirror. For if we consider what it
is to be cast into eternal fire, we shall not judge that this is the greatest
evil and punishment of all, to fall down dead before men. Look the 10th chapter
of the First to the Corinthians, verse 5.</font><br></div>

</i>the Spirit, because they had cunningly packed their fraud, as if the Spirit
of God were not the knower of the hearts. For it was a point of too great
carelessness, seeing the one made the other privy to their wickedness, to make
their match between themselves, having, as it were, excluded God. For the
Scripture saith, that God is tempted either when his power is taken from him, or
the knowledge of all things is denied him. Furthermore, he meaneth that Spirit
which governed the Church by the apostles. For when Christ saith, When the
Spirit cometh, he shall judge the world, he noteth no other kind of authority
than that which he exerciseth by the ministry of the Church.</font><br></div>

do never so perfectly fear God, but that they profit yet more, being admonished
by his judgments. Therefore, by all those punishments which we read have been
laid upon men in times past, and do daily see to be laid upon them, doth God
call us back from the enticements and liberty of sinning. For our flesh must be
bridled every now and then after this sort, because one bridle will scarce serve
the turn. There was another manner [of] fear in the strangers, yet no such fear

the word. Luke showeth the multitude of miracles by this, in that the sick were
brought forth everywhere, that they might be healed. For God meant thus to set
forth the gospel of his Son, especially at the beginning; that he, might for a
certainty testify to the Jews, that that restoring of all things was present,
which was so often promised, and in which all their hope was reposed, as they
themselves did pretend, (and make semblance.) It is well known that couches were
certain little beds in which the men of old were wont to rest at noon. Because

meetings there, as assuredly no body of the Church can otherwise continue. For
if every man will be his own teacher, and pray apart by himself, and if there be
no meetings and assemblies, how excellently soever the Church be ordered and
appointed, yet must it needs decay and come to nought. He saith that they were

miracles, in that these which believed not, being convict with the excellent
power of God, dare not despise the apostles, but are rather enforced to
reverence the Church. Yet that might seem an absurd thing, that being terrified
with miracles, they flee from God and his people. I answer, that they were
letted through their own fault from coming; and it is not to be doubted but that
God doth call us unto himself by miracles. Therefore, whosoever they be that go
not so far, as willingly to embrace the grace of God which shineth in them, they
are letted and hindered by their own perverse and evil conscience. Yet this is
some fruit, in that God wringeth some fear out of them; although Luke doth
ascribe this not only to the miracle, but rather comprehendeth all together
which might serve to the increasing of the dignity of the Church. For all things
were so ordered, that there shined there a certain divine majesty; for they did
no less differ from the other than angels from men.</font><br></div>

our profane liberty of evil living. Furthermore, the punishment of Ananias and
his wife did not a little terrify the wicked, and keep them from breaking in
unadvisedly into the company of those men, where God had showed himself so sharp
a Judge. Yet we must note that he speaketh of men which were indifferent in this
place, and of those which were not of the worst sort; for there were at that
time many at Jerusalem, whom neither the reverence of signs, neither yet of the
angelic holiness of the godly, could move. Therefore Luke meaneth moderate men,
in whom there are some seed of the fear of God; like as we see at this day
certain, whom the vanity of the world keepeth back from submitting their necks

Peter, have power to heal, as well as his shadow had this power? I answer, we
must not by and by think that that is right which Luke saith was done by
ignorant men, and those which knew not the pure faith. Yet we have a more
certain answer in readiness than this. For the apostles were endued with such
power for this cause, because they were ministers of the gospel. Therefore they
used this gift, inasmuch as it served to further the credit of the gospel; yea,
God did no less show forth his power in their shadow than in their mouth. Those

the gifts of God, whereby he testifieth that he is present with us, ought to
encourage us, lest the fury and boldness of the wicked do terrify and dismay us.
For this is no small comfort, when we know that God is present with
us.</font><br></div>

him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He meaneth those which were most
familiar, and the highest linked in friendship with the chief priest, whose
counsel he was wont to use, and whom he had, being, as it were, gathered and
culled out of the whole order, not for judgment, or discretion, but for the love
of his faction; as they did then contend among themselves shamelessly, like
mortal enemies. Furthermore, Luke saith again, that the Sadducees did bear the
greatest swing at that day; to the end we may know that the government was then
confused with horrible wasteness;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F265</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when as such a sect could bear rule. But God suffered the synagogue to be
drowned in such extreme reproach, after that he had separated his Church from
it, to the end they might have the less excuse, who despising the gospel, did
continue in such a sink of filthiness. In the mean season, what did enforce and
drive forward those swine, who were touched with no care of the life to come,
save only mere ambition, and desire to keep that lordship and pre-eminence which
they had gotten? </font><br></div>

zeal.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I had liefer keep the Greek word
still (especially seeing it is common enough otherwise) than to translate it
<i>emulation </i>(or <i>indignation;) </i>for he speaketh generally of the
perverse and violent force wherewith hypocrites are carried and inflamed to
maintain their superstitions; whereby it appeareth what account God maketh of
zeal, and what praise it deserveth, when as it is not governed by reason and
wisdom, that is, when it is not led and guided by the Spirit of God. We see at
this day those men moved and stirred with devilish fury, who will be counted the
most devout of all men, who rage horribly to shed innocent blood. Nevertheless,
let us note that he speaketh not in this place of an unadvised or blind zeal,
which was in many of the Jews, as Paul affirmeth, but we understand rather a hot
and unbridled violence; for although the wicked be accused of their own
consciences, because they wittingly resist godliness, yet do they deceive
themselves with a false show of zeal, because it is lawful to prevent new
things.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F266</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
So at this day almost in all Popery they boast only of zeal, whereas
notwithstanding they are zealous for their belly. But admit we grant that that
is true which they pretend, how can this excuse the heat of their cruelty
whereunto they are enforced by their blindness? as if this were a chief virtue
to grant liberty to their wrath,

Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The Lord brought the apostles out
of prison, not because he would rid them quite out of the hands of their
enemies, for he suffered them afterwards to be brought back again, and to be
beaten with rods; but he meant to declare, by this miracle, that they were in
his hand and tuition, to the end he might maintain the credit of the gospel;
partly that the Church might have another confirmation thereby, partly that the
wicked might be left without excuse wherefore we must not hope always, nay, we
must not always desire that God will deliver us from death; but we must be
content with this one thing, that our life is defended by his hand, so far as is
expedient. In that he useth the ministry of an angel, in this he doth according
to his common custom; for he testifieth every where in the Scriptures, that the
angels are ministers of his goodness towards us. Neither is that a vain
speculation, for this is a profitable help for our infirmity, that we know that
not only God doth care for us, but also that the heavenly spirits do watch for
our safety. Again, this was no small pledge of God&#8217;s love towards us, that
the creatures of all other most noble are appointed to have regard of our
safety. The angel openeth the prison in the night, because he would not work the
miracle when the wicked might see him, although he would have the same being
wrought known by the event itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak in the
temple.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the end of their
deliverance, that they employ themselves stoutly in preaching the gospel, and
provoke their enemies courageously, until they die valiantly. For they were put
to death at length when the hand of God ceased, after that they had finished
their course; but now the Lord openeth the prison for them, that they may be at
liberty to fulfill their function. That is worth the marking, because we see
many men, who, after they have escaped out of persecution, do afterwards keep
silence, as if they had done their duty towards God, (and were no more to be
troubled;) other some, also, do escape away by denying Christ; but the Lord doth
deliver his children, not to the end they may cease off from the course which
they have begun, but rather that they may be the more zealous afterward. The
apostles might have objected, It is better to keep silence for a time, forasmuch
as we cannot speak one word without danger; we are now apprehended for one only
sermon, how much more shall the fury of our enemies be inflamed hereafter, if
they shall see us make no end of speaking? But because they knew that they were
to live and to die to the Lord, they do not refuse to do that which the Lord
commanded; so we must always mark what function the Lord enjoineth us. There
will many things meet us oftentimes, which may discourage us, unless being
content with the commandment of God alone, we do our duty, committing the
success to him.</font><br></div>

1:17;) and in it Christ offereth himself unto us with the sacrifice of his
death, with the Spirit of regeneration, with the earnest of our adoption. And
this is spoken expressly to the apostles, to the end they may the more
courageously enter all manner of combats for the gospel, forasmuch as they hear
that they are ministers of eternal salvation. The demonstrative is added for the
more certainty, as if the angel did point out life with his finger, as assuredly
we need not to seek the same far, when we have the word in our mouth and in our

council together now, lest, if giving the honor to his own sect, he omit others,
and be not able to bear the burden; therefore, he is enforced by fear to call
the multitude together, notwithstanding they observe diligently and straitly the
form of law. The elders are called who did govern, that nothing may be done but
according to the sentence and authority of the council. Who would not have hoped
for a moderate end, seeing they began thus? and surely they pretend what color
they can, lest they seem to oppress the truth violently and tyrannously; but
when they hear that the apostles teach in the temple, howsoever they know that
they came not out by deceit of man, but miraculously, yet they hold on still in
their purpose; where appeareth, together with the ungodliness of behavior and
contempt of God, horrible fury and want of reason. Therefore, the beautiful
colors of right and equity

wickedness. They must need certainly gather by all circumstances, that it is the
work of God that the prison was opened, yet they do not doubt openly to rage
against God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These things are also meet for our time. We know how
proudly the Papists boast of that maxim of theirs, that lawful councils must be
obeyed, because they represent the Church. Moreover, they call those lawful
councils, and they will have them so accounted, wherein nothing is wanting
touching the external form, and such a council was this whereof Luke speaketh in
this place; and yet, notwithstanding, we know that it was gathered to put out
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F270</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

subtlety, or by inordinate suit,

yet the dignity of the priesthood did continue as yet until Christ was revealed.
There was in the assembly of the elders a representing of the Church; but where
the truth of God is not sought, all outward appearance is nothing else but a
mere visor. Therefore, it is in vain for the Papists to cover their abominations
with the shadow of this buckler, because it is not sufficient for those to be
gathered together who are rulers of the Church, unless they do this in the name
of Christ, otherwise forasmuch as it is an usual policy of Satan to transform
himself into an angel of light,

that, whereas they neither fear nor <i>reverence </i>God, they are afraid of

Behold, therefore, what that is which nettleth them, because they fear the

thing which all men, for the most part, did grant,

that Christ was put to death justly. Notwithstanding this is the principal point
of the accusation, that they did not obey the commandment of the priests. It was
an heinous offense not to obey the chief priest; how much more heinous was it,
then, to despise the whole order? But the chief priest doth not consider what is
his duty towards God and the Church;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F276</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he abuseth his authority tyrannously, as if the same were not under any laws, as
the Pope dealeth with us at this day; for seeing that he taketh to himself an
unbridled authority and government, he feareth not to condemn us for
schismatics, so soon as he seeth us refuse his decrees; for he catcheth at these

subject to the word of God, dare grant liberty to themselves to attempt

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29. </b>This is the sum of their answer, It is
lawful for them, nay, they ought to prefer God before men. God commandeth us to
bear witness of Christ; therefore it is in vain for you to command us to keep
silence. But I have declared before in the third chapter, when this sentence
taketh place, that we ought rather to obey God than men. God doth set men over
us in such sort with power, that he keepeth still his own authority safe and
sound. Therefore, we must obey rulers so far, that the commandment of God be not
broken. Whereas power and authority is lawfully used, then it is out of season
to make comparison between God and man. If a faithful pastor do command or
forbid out of the Word of God, it shall be in vain for men which are stubborn to
object that we ought to obey God; for God will be heard by man. Yea, man is
nothing else but an instrument of God. If a magistrate do his duty as he ought,
a man shall in vain say that he is contrary to God, seeing that he dissenteth in
nothing; yea, rather the contrary rule is then in force. We must obey
God&#8217;s ministers and officers if we will obey him. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F278</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But so soon as rulers do lead us away from the obedience of God, because they
strive against God with sacrilegious boldness, their pride must be abated, that
God may be above all in authority. Then all smokes of honor vanish away. For God
doth not vouchsafe to bestow honorable titles upon men, to the end they may
darken his glory. Therefore, if a father, being not content with his own estate,
do essay to take from God the chief honor of a father, he is nothing else but a
man. If a king, or ruler, or magistrate, do become so lofty that he diminisheth
the honor and authority of God, he is but a man. We must thus think also of
pastors. For he which goeth beyond his bounds in his office, (because he setteth
himself against God:) must be despoiled of his honor, lest, under a color or
visor, he deceive. The office of a pastor is very excellent, the authority of
the Church is great, yet so that no part of God&#8217;s power and Christ&#8217;s
mastership be diminished. Whence we may easily gather that the pride of the Pope
is ridiculous, who, when as he treadeth under foot the whole kingdom of Christ,
and doth set himself openly against God, will yet, nevertheless, lie hid under
the name of Christ.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The God of our
fathers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They descend unto the matter
whereof they are to speak, that they may declare that they made small account of
the commandment of the priests, not without cause, nor yet unadvisedly. For (as
I have already said) the comparison between God and man taketh no place save
only when there is some contrariety. Therefore they prove by this, that they are
enforced by the fear of God to refuse the commandment of the priests; because
God commandeth that which they forbid. Therefore, first of all, they say that
God had raised up Christ, after the common custom of the Scriptures. For this
speech is common, that God raised up prophets or judges, or rather ministers,
whom he determined to use into some great work; which importeth as much as that
all excellency of nature is weak, unless God do furnish those with singular
gifts whom he preferreth unto any excellent office. Peradventure, also they
allude unto that famous place of Moses, which Peter cited in his first sermon,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;051815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
18:15, above 3:22.) They cite the <i>God of the fathers </i>by name, as the
author, that they may declare that they bring in no new form of religion,
neither yet will they enforce upon the people any new god. For they were to make
answer to that false slander, that they went about to lead away the people from
the law and the prophets. Not that they allow all that worship which was used by
the fathers, as profane men are content with this only argument, that the
fathers taught thus, that they do all things according to the custom and decree
of their ancestors; but the apostles speak in this place of those fathers with
whom God hath made his covenant, who followeth right and pure doctrine, who
embraceth the promise of salvation with true faith; finally, who had their
beginning of the heavenly Father, and who, through the only begotten Son of God,
were the children of God together with their posterity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom
ye.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this member the apostles declare unto
them plainly that they were the enemies of God who would have the chief honor
given them as unto the governors and prelates of the Church. Whereupon it
followeth that they are unworthy even of the smallest authority. Although there
is also a prevention, being a token of boldness, when as he speaketh of that
thing boldly and freely which they did account a shameful thing, to wit, lest
any part of Christ&#8217;s glory should seem to be diminished because he
suffered a slanderous
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F280</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
death upon the cross; as if it had been said, You have slain him. Neither was
your cruelty satisfied with a plain and common death; for he was hanged upon a
tree. But neither could death extinguish his power; neither could that shame and
reproach which he suffered amongst you take away his honor. Therefore the
calling of God continueth firm and stable. Therefore, as the apostles hit the
priests in the teeth with that wickedness and heinous offense which they had
committed, so they prevent, by a granting, to express the manner of the
reproachful death which Christ suffered, lest the authors of the wickedness
triumph as having gotten the victory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Him has God lifted
up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Therefore the apostles do signify
that whatsoever the wicked do go about, it did not hinder and keep back Christ
from fulfilling his function which was enjoined him by his Father.
The</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> right hand of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is taken for his power. Neither is
the same metaphor used in this place, which we had before, chapter 2, and which
is common elsewhere, when Christ is said to be lift up unto the right hand of
the Father; but the meaning of this place is, that Christ, which was slain by
the hand of men, was lifted up on high by the power of God, that he might bear
rule over angels and men. And this seemeth secretly to be set against all the
enterprises of Satan and the world; as if he should say that they shall have no
good success, because they shall never climb so high as to hinder the hand of
God, whereby he hath both wrought mightily already in his only begotten Son,
neither will he ever cease to work. Yet the end is added also, that he may be a
captain and Savior. For so often as God did put his people in hope of salvation,
he was wont to promise a prince or a king, by whose hand he would restore all
things. The apostles do testify that this principality was granted to Christ.
Notwithstanding they do more plainly express his office by the other adjunct.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F281</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The sum is this, that Christ is placed in the highest degree of honor, that he
may govern the people of God, and not that only, but that he may show himself to
be a saving captain, or the author of salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To give
repentance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They show in this place how
Christ reigneth to save the people, to wit, when he bringeth his own to
repentance, and doth reconcile them unto God through the remission of sins.
Furthermore, we know that the sum of the gospel is contained in these two
things. Wherefore the apostles do not only stand upon the defense of their
cause, but they preach the office of Christ plentifully,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F282</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they may win even some of the mortal enemies of Christ,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F283</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
if it may be. Furthermore, we have declared before what the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repentance
</i></font><font face="Palatino">doth signify, to wit, that it is an inward
turning of man unto God, which showeth itself afterwards by external works. For
Christ giveth us the Spirit of regeneration for this cause, that he may renew us
inwardly; to the end that a new life may afterward follow the newness of the
mind and heart. And if it belong to Christ to give repentance, then it followeth
that it is not a thing which is in man&#8217;s power. And surely, seeing that it
is a certain wonderful reformation, (or fashioning again,) which maketh us new
creatures, repaireth in us the image of God, bringeth us out of the bondage of
sin unto the obedience of righteousness; it is a thing as impossible for men to
convert themselves as to create themselves. Repentance is, I grant, a voluntary
conversion, but whence have we this will, save only because God changeth our
heart, that it may be made fleshy of a stony heart; flexible, of hard and
stubborn; and, finally, righteous of wicked,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;261119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
11:19.) And this cometh to pass when Christ regenerateth thus by his Spirit.
Neither is this given in a moment, but it must be increased daily during our
whole life, until we be fully joined to God; which shall be then when we have
put off our flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is, indeed, the beginning of repentance, when a
man, who before was turned away from God, renounceth the world and himself, and
doth purpose to lead a new life. But because when we have entered the way, we
are far from the mark, we must needs go forward continually. We have
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F284</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
a both through the benefit of Christ. For as he beginneth repentance in us, so
doth he also give us perseverance. This is an inestimable grace; but it should
do us but a little good, unless it were coupled with forgiveness of sins. For
Christ doth both find us the enemies of God at the first, and also there are
always vices remaining in us, which cause disagreement between him and us; so
that he may justly be offended with us, rather than merciful unto us. And
therein doth our righteousness consist, if God do not impute our sins unto us.
Therefore, this latter grace must never be separated from them. Yea, rather the
gospel shall be lame
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F285</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and corrupt, unless it consist upon [of] these two members, that is, unless men
be taught that they are reconciled to God by Christ by the free imputation of
righteousness, and that they are fashioned again unto newness of life by the
Spirit of regeneration. So that we understand briefly how we must obtain
salvation in Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And we are his witnesses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After that
they have declared that their doctrine came from God, they descend now unto the
other part that they speak as they were commanded by God, lest they seem to
attempt anything unadvisedly. For this also was a necessary defense, as it is
for all the ministers of the gospel, to wit, that they make this openly known to
all men that they teach nothing but that which they have received of God.
Secondly, that they are called hereunto, so that they cannot avoid the necessity
of teaching, unless they will resist God. Luke putteth
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>words</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in this place, instead of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>things,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>according to the Hebrew phrase. Although if any man had rather understand it
of the speech itself, I do not deny but that it may be so. The sum is, seeing
they are brought forth by God to be witnesses, they may not give back,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F286</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but they must publish things which he hath commanded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And also the
Spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They confirm their calling by
the effect; for this was a seal to approve their doctrine, seeing that God gave
the Holy Spirit to those which believed. Forasmuch, as it appeared manifestly by
this, that he allowed the faith of the gospel, and it was acceptable to him. In
that they say </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to those which obey
him,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I refer it unto Christ, as if they
should have said, those which believe in Christ are plentifully rewarded for
their obedience. Therefore God will have Christ obeyed. Wherefore even our
ministry doth please him in that thing. Yet here may a question be moved, Seeing
that we have saith by the revelation of the Spirit, how is it said in this
place, that the same is given after faith? I answer, that the gift of tongues,
of prophecy, of interpretation, of healing, and such like, are spoken of in this
place, wherewith God did beautiful his Church. As Paul saith, where he asketh
the Galatians, whether they received the Spirit by the law, or by the hearing of
faith,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:2.) Therefore the illumin-ation of the Spirit goeth before faith, because it
is the cause thereof; but there follow other graces afterward, that we may go
forward, according to that, &#8220;To him that hath shall be given,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:12.) And if we will be enriched <i>every </i>now and then with new gifts of
the Spirit, let us hold out unto God the lap of faith.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F287</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But the reward wherewith our want of faith is rewarded at this day is far
unlike; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F288</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for the most part being destitute of the Spirit of God doth neither see nor
understand anything.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>33.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
They were cut in sunder.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The priests
ought to have been thoroughly moved, though they had had hearts of iron, but
they burst.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F289</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Whence we gather that no reasons can prevail with the reprobate, to bring them
unto the obedience of Christ; for unless God speak within, the outward doctrine
shall be able to do nothing else but to beat the cars. The apostles were able so
to overcome their enemies, that they should not have had one word to say; but
their fury was so untamed, and unbridled that they do rather go mad. Yet we must
therewithal note the force of the word, because although the reprobate are not
thereby changed, that they may become better, yet it pierceth into their hearts,
so that it urgeth their consciences; for thence springeth their fury, because
they saw themselves
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F290</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
urged by their judge. They would gladly mock all the gospel, as they attempt
whatsoever they can, that they may count it as nothing; but there is in the same
a certain hidden majesty, which driveth away mightily all their delicacy.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F291</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And chiefly when they are cited by the sound of the trumpet to appear before the
judgment-seat of God, then appeareth their madness and fury.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>34. </b>Luke showeth now after what manner God
brought to nought the fury of the wicked. They were purposed to put the apostles
to death; Gamaliel standeth up amidst them, to break off that mad consultation.
Furthermore, he noteth the circumstances, to the end we may know how it could
be, that one man could prevail so much against so many. He saith he was a
Pharisee which sect was in great estimation, as we know. He saith that he was in
price, or honored amongst the people; And they feared the people. Hereby it
cometh to pass that they are the more afraid to do any thing contrary to his
mind. So God doth oftentimes set sudden terrors against his enemies, (when they
look not for them,)to stay their violence. Furthermore, Gamaliel commandeth the
apostles to go aside, lest they should be the more emboldened by his words. For
we must not think that he spake thus, because he did allow
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F292</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the doctrine of the gospel, or that he meant to defend the same; but because he
saw all the rest inflamed with fury, he being a man moderate and courteous, doth
with sober speech temper that excess.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if we consider all things well, this judgment and
opinion is unmeet for a wise man. I know that many count it as an oracle, but it
appeareth sufficiently hereby that they judge amiss, because by this means men
should abstain from all punishments, neither were any wicked fact any longer to
be corrected. Yea, all helps of life were to be refused, which we cannot prolong
one moment.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F293</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Both things are true, that no endeavor of men can destroy that which is of God;
and that that which is of men is not so strong that it can stand. But he
gathereth amiss hence, that men must sit still and say nothing in the mean
season. We must rather mark what God commandeth us to do, and he will have us to
restrain wickedness. To this end hath he appointed magistrates, and armed them
with the sword; to this end hath he set elders over his Church, to bring the
froward in order, and that they may not suffer sin licentiously to rage without
punishment. Therefore it is gathered amiss that we must refrain from punishing,
because God is sufficient of himself to take away evils. Although his whole
counsel is such, Gamaliel willeth the scribes and elders to take heed that they
make not open war against God. And he speaketh as it were touching a doubtful
matter; whereby it appeareth that he hath no certainty from the foundation, when
as he doubteth in the quality of the cause, neither dare set down whether it be
good or evil, but doth only command to defer it for a time, until the cause
appear more plainly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In sum, Gamaliel setteth an evil consequent from true
grounds;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F294</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because he applieth that amiss unto the external office and manner of doing
which ought to serve for faith only. On the other side, let this be our logic,
That which is of God must needs stand, though all the world say nay; therefore
faith must stand without all fear, against all the assaults of Satan and men,
seeing faith is under-propped and supported with the eternal truth of God;
although heaven fail, our salvation is safe, which hath God to be the author and
keeper thereof; because God doth defend the kingdom of Christ, it can never be
overthrown with any violence; because the doctrine of the gospel is grounded in
God, howsoever men resist or shake the same, yet shall it nevertheless continue
firm. Again, although the wicked attempt whatsoever they can, and seek all means
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F295</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to destroy the Church, although they furiously strive against Christ and his
Church so much as they are able, yet they shall not prevail, because it is the
property of God to bring the counsels of men to nought; and by this means doth
he punish their rashness. We see that both members are well applied to faith.
But, in the mean season, there is no cause why the servants of Christ should be
less diligent in maintaining the truth; why they should suffer the Church to
decay through their fault;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F296</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
why they should carelessly wink at their wickedness who endeavor to turn all
things topsy-turvy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>36.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There arose one
Theudas.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If we credit Josephus, Gamaliel
altereth in this place the true course of the history. For he reporteth that
Judas Gaulanites, who was born in Gamala, at such time as Quirinius, or
Cyrenius, was proconsul, did raise a tumult with his adherents, because they
would not have their goods taxed;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F297</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and that Theudas, at such time as Cuspius Fadus was procurator, did boast that
he was a prophet of God. And Fadus was sent into Judea by Claudius Caesar. The
former history is recorded in the Eighteenth Book of Antiquities; and the other
in the Twentieth. But I think that when Luke saith,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After him was there one
Judas,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he meant not to note the course
of time, as if he were the latter; but forasmuch as Gamaliel brought in two like
examples, he might put the one in place of the other,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F298</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
without having respect of time. Therefore the word <i>post </i>is as much as
<i>moreover, </i>or <i>besides.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, even these examples wherewith Gamaliel
confirmeth his opinion do not sufficiently agree with the present cause. For,
because they did not by and by resist Judas, that sedition which he had raised
was the occasion of many murders, and at length he was vanquished with hand and
weapon. Theudas also had done far more hurt, unless he had been put to flight in
time by Cuspius Fadus. But Gamaliel hath respect unto this alone, that men have
unlucky success when as they advance themselves un-advisedly; and that cometh to
pass by the just judgment of God. But because the priests refuse to hearken when
God giveth them good counsel, they are worthy to be made amazed by man with
frivolous reasons, wavering hither and thither through foolish perplexity.
Furthermore, if we cast the time, we shall find that it was twelve years at
least after the death of Christ before the apostles were beaten. For unto the
five years which remained of the government of Tiberius, we must add three and a
half which Caligula reigned. Fadus was not sent by Claudius into Judea before
the second or third year of his reign. Gamaliel rehearsed not the act within a
day or two after. Therefore that space of time is complete whereof I spake.
Wherefore the constancy of the apostles was the more excellent, who, though they
be so evil rewarded for those long pains which they had endured, yet are they
not discouraged, neither do they cease to hold on as they had
begun.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he was some great

have, Saying that he was somebody; yet both carry one sense. For he boasted that
he was such a prophet that he could dry up Jordan, that those which were with
him might go over dry foot. Nevertheless, we see how far Gamaliel is from true
knowledge, who compareth the holy ministers of Christ unto seducers and robbers;
although he mitigateth his words afterward, and, inclining toward the better
part, leaveth it indifferent whether they have taken this matter in hand, having
God for their author or no. Yet he speaketh doubtfully, because he provideth
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F300</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
only for quietness, all inquiry being set apart. This is only to be allowed
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F301</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in his speech, that he feareth [deterreth] the wicked from wicked boldness,
because there is nothing more to be feared than to strive against
God.</font><br></div>

yet that counsel ceaseth not to be evil. Which we must note for this cause,
because most men at this day do think, that they do not a little obey God, if

gospel, or somewhat appease
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F305</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the enemies who are otherwise bloody. In the mean season, they are not afraid to
drive them unto the wicked denial of Christ, the confessing of whom is far more
precious in the sight of God than the life of all men. But what could they do
who, casting away all care of godliness, go about to redeem God&#8217;s favor

but when they considered the cause, then joy got the upperhand. So the faithful
must be two manner of ways affectioned so often as they suffer persecution for
the gospel; they must be touched with the bitterness of punishments,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F308</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet so that they overcome this sorrow with spiritual joy. For they should have
(changed their mind, and) stricken sail by and by, unless they had been
strengthened and encouraged by that joy.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F309</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And it is not to be doubted, but that even death was sweet, and pleasant to
Peter on this fashion, which, notwithstanding the Lord doth testify shall be
bitter unto him. Let us, therefore, learn that we must wrestle with sorrow and
care,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F310</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that we hold on courageously to suffer the cross, and that we bear the same when
it is laid upon us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they were counted
worthy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This might seem at the first
blush absurd, in that Luke placeth honor in reproach;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F311</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but the disagreement which is between God and the world causeth this, that that
which is counted amongst men most reproachful, excelleth in dignity and glory in
the sight of God and his angels. We know that the kind of death which Christ
suffered was of all other most shameful, and yet did he triumph most nobly upon
the cross; so, when we are made like unto him, we may worthily boast that it is
a point of singular excellency, that we suffer rebuke in the sight of the world.
Thus doth Paul boast of the marks of Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480617&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:17.) For we must here respect the cause which doth associate us unto Christ,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F312</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
who doth not only swallow up the shame of the world with his glory, but doth
also turn reproaches, slanders, and mocks of the world, into great honor.
Wherefore, it is no marvel that there be so few found which are strong and stout
to bear the cross, because we are almost all drowned and overwhelmed with the
sense of the flesh; and there is scarce one amongst an hundred which considereth
that the reproach of Christ doth far excel all the triumphs of the world, which
is the only matter of comfort. Wherefore, we must use the greater diligence in
thinking upon this sentence; that we are at this day made partakers
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F313</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the sufferings of Christ, that we may be partakers of his
glory.</font><br></div>

hold upon the fruit of victory, and so be pricked forward unto patience? But
that man which thinketh with himself that he is happy when he suffereth for
Christ&#8217;s sake, shall never faint, though he must suffer hard conflicts.
Therefore the apostles are, after a sort, armed with stripes, so that they
valiantly make haste unto death. Therefore, woe be to our daintiness, who,
having suffered a little persecution, do by and by resign up the light

to what end, and also with what rite, deacons were first made. He saith, When
there arose a murmuring amongst the disciples, it was appeased by this remedy,
as it is said in the common proverb, Good laws have taken their beginning of
evil manners. And it may seem to be a strange thing, seeing that this is a
function so excellent and so necessary in the Church, why it came not into the
apostles&#8217; minds at the first, (before there was any such occasion
ministered,) to appoint deacons, and why the Spirit of God did not give them
such counsel which they take now, being, as it were, enforced thereunto. But
that which happened was both better then, and is also more profitable for us at
this day, to be unto us an example. If the apostles had spoken of choosing
deacons before any necessity did require the same, they should not have had the
people so ready; they should have seemed to avoid labor and trouble; many would
not have offered so liberally into the hands of other men. Therefore, it was
requisite that the faithful should be convict [convinced] by experience that
they might choose deacons willingly, whom they saw they could not want; and that
through their own fault.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We learn in this history that the Church cannot be so
framed by and by, but that there remain somewhat to be amended; neither can so
great a building be so finished in one day, that there may not something be
added to make the same perfect. Furthermore, we learn that there is no ordinance
of God so holy and laudable, which is not either corrupt or made unprofitable
through the fault of men. We wonder that things are never so well ordered in the
world, but that there is always some evil mixed with the good; but it is the
wickedness and corruption of our nature which causeth this. That was, indeed, a
godly order, whereof Luke made mention before, when the goods of all men being
consecrated to God, were distributed to every man as he had need;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F315</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when as the apostles, being, as it were, the stewards of God and the poor, had
the chief government of the alms. But shortly after there ariseth a murmuring
which troubleth this order. Here appeareth that corruption of men whereof I have
spoken, which doth not suffer us to use our good things. We must also mark the
subtilty
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F316</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of Satan, who, to the end he may take from us the use of the gifts of God, goeth
about this continually, that it may not remain pure and sound; but that, being
mixed with other discommodities, it may, first, be suspected, secondly, loathed,
and, lastly, quite taken away. But the apostles have taught us, by their
example, that we must not yield unto such engines (and policies) of Satan. For
they do not think it meet (being offended with the murmuring) to take away that
ministry which they know pleaseth God; but rather invent a remedy whereby the
offense may be taken away, and that may be retained which is God&#8217;s. Thus
must we do. For what offenses soever Satan raise,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F317</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
we must take good heed that he take not from us those ordinances which are
otherwise wholesome.</font><br></div>

on every side unto his people; but the corruption of our nature hindereth us
from having any thing happy in all points. For there arise many discommodities
also, even of the increasings of the Church. For it is a hard matter to keep
many hypocrites from creeping into the multitude, whose wickedness is not by and
by discovered, until such time as they have infected some part of the flock with
their infection. Moreover, many wicked, froward, and dissolute persons do
insinuate themselves under a false color of repentance. And that I may pass over
innumerable things, there is never such agreement amongst many, but that,
according to the diversity of their manners, their opinions are also diverse, so
that one thing cannot please all alike. This offense causeth many to be desirous
to choose a few for a Church; it causeth them to loathe or else to hate a
multitude. But no trouble, no irksomeness, ought so much to prevail, but that we
must always be desirous to have the Church increased; but that we must study to
enlarge the same; but that we must cherish so much as in us lieth unity with the

Greeks.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hereby it appeareth that they
were not fully regenerate by the Spirit of God, to whom the diversity of nation
and country ministereth occasion of disagreement. For in Christ there is neither
Jew nor Grecian,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480328&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F319</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the flesh and the world. Wherefore we must take good heed that the like fault
be not found in us. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F320</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
There is another fault in that they declare their indignation by murmuring.
Furthermore it is uncertain whether the complaint were true or no. For when Luke
saith that the Greeks murmured, because their widows were not honored, he
showeth not what was done in deed, but what they thought was done. And it may be
that forasmuch as the apostles did prefer the Jews,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F321</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because they were better known, the Greeks did think (though falsely) that their
widows were despised as strangers. And this seemeth to be more like to be true.
Furthermore the word </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ministering
</i></font><font face="Palatino">may be expounded two manner of ways, actively
or passively. For we know that at the first there were widows chosen unto the
ministration.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F322</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Notwithstanding, I do rather think that the Greeks did complain, because their
widows were not so liberally relieved as they wished. So that the ministration
shall be that daily distribution which was wont to be made.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The twelve having the

point [proof] of patience and meekness that the apostles are no more moved.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F323</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is a point of prudence and godly carefulness, in that they prevent the evil
which began to arise,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F324</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
without deferring the remedy. For after that every dissension and division hath
gathered strength, it is a wound hard to be cured. By this assembly it appeareth
that the Church was governed by order and reason, so that the apostles had the
chiefest authority, and that they did impart their counsels and purposes unto
the people.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F325</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Again, we must note that the faithful, or Christians, are in this place called
disciples, in whom that of Isaiah must be fulfilled, &#8220;That they were all
taught of God.&#8221; And again, that of Jeremiah, &#8220;They shall all know
God, from the least to the greatest.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It pleaseth
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is in Greek
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ouk
areston</font><font face="Palatino">]<i>. </i>By which word, the Grecians do now
express every opinion or decree which is better than another, or which is to be
preferred as being better.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F326</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I do rather think that the apostles declare what is profitable, than simply what
they have decreed. But if it be not expedient for them to meddle with this
business,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F327</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they seem [now] to acknowledge some fault in that they ministered hitherto. And
surely that is true, that use is the father of wisdom.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F328</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Wherefore there shall be no absurdity if we shall say, that the apostles desire
of the Church to be unburdened of that function, after that they have tried
[experienced] that it is not meet for them. But if there were any fault, it
ought rather to be ascribed unto necessity than unto them; for they took not
this burthen upon them greedily, but seeing there was no other way as yet, they
had better burthen themselves out of measure than that the poor should be
forslowed.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F329</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And when as they say that it is not meet that they should be occupied in
providing for the poor, their meaning is, that are unable to endure both
burthens, so that they must needs let the one alone. For it is as if they should
say, If thou wilt enjoy our ministry in the preaching of the gospel, deliver us
from the charge of the poor, because we are not able to do both. But this
seemeth to be spoken out of season by them, because they had not left the charge
of teaching before, although they had the oversight of the alms. I answer,
forasmuch as the administration was confused, they were so enwrapped,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F330</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they could not wholly attend upon doctrine as was meet. Therefore, they
refuse that function which draweth them away from the free and perfect
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F331</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
charge of teaching. Notwithstanding, we may not think that they had quite cast
away all care of the poor, but that they did only seek somewhat to be lightened
and eased, that they might attend upon their office. And, in the mean season,
they declare that the ministry of the word is so painful
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F332</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that it requireth a whole man, neither will it suffer him to be occupied about
any other business; which, if it had been well considered, there had been a far
other order taken in the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Popish bishops did suck
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F333</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
up great riches under color of the ministration or deaconship; nevertheless,
they entangled themselves in divers businesses, which they were scarce able to
overcome,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F334</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
though every one of them had had ten heads. Notwithstanding, such is their
wickedness, that they say that there can be no church unless it be drowned in
this depth;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F335</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
neither do they cease to brag and boast that they are the successors of the
apostles, whereas there is nothing which appeareth to be more contrary. They
were careful for this, that they might not be occupied about serving of tables,
and so be compelled to leave their own banquets. For whosoever is careful for
his own table, he taketh leave to be vacant
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F336</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from other men&#8217;s tables.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But omitting these things, let us mark this sentence.
We know what a holy thing it is to be careful for the poor. Therefore, forasmuch
as the apostles prefer the preaching of the gospel before if we gather thereby
that no obedience is more acceptable to God. Notwithstanding, the hardness is
also declared,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F337</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when as they say that they cannot discharge both these duties. Surely we are not
better than they. Therefore, let every one of us that is called unto the
function of teaching addict himself wholly to order this his estate well.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F338</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For we are inclined to nothing more than to fall to slothfulness. Again, the
flesh ministereth goodly cloaks and colors, so that those men cannot see by and
by that they are led away from their calling which enwrap themselves in strange
business. Wherefore, to the end ministers may prick forward themselves to do
their duty, let them remember this saying of the apostles oftentimes, wherein
they declare that, forasmuch as they are called unto the function of teaching,
they must not any longer take charge of the poor. Therefore, what excuses have
profane affairs
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F339</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(taken in hand even for some private gain) where that is set aside, which is
otherwise accounted no small part of the worship of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore, brethren, look
out.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Now we see to what end deacons were
made. The word itself is indeed general, yet is it properly taken for those
which are stewards for the poor. Whereby it appeareth how licentiously the
Papists do mock God and men, who assign unto their deacons no other office but
this, to have the charge of
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F340</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the paten and chalice. Surely we need no disputation to prove that they agree in
no point with the apostles. But if the readers be desirous to see any more
concerning this point, they may repair unto our Institution, chapter 8. As
touching this present place, the Church is permitted to choose. For it is
tyrannous if any one man appoint or make ministers at his pleasure.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F341</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore, this is the (most) lawful way, that those be chosen by common voices
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F342</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
who are to take upon them
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F343</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
any public function in the Church. And the apostles prescribe what manner [of]
persons ought to be chosen, to wit, men of tried honesty and credit,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F344</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
men endued with wisdom
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F345</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and other gifts of the Spirit. And this is the mean between tyranny and confused
liberty,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F346</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that nothing be done without
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F347</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the consent and approbation of the people, yet so that the pastors moderate and
govern (this action,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F348</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)
that their authority may be as a bridle to keep under the people,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F349</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
lest they pass their bounds too much. In the mean season, this is worth the
noting, that the apostles prescribe an order unto the faithful, lest they
appoint any save those which are fit. For we do God no small injury if we take
all that come to hand
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F350</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to govern his house. Therefore, we must use great circumspection that we choose
none
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F351</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
unto the holy function of the Church unless we have some trial of him first. The
number of seven is applied
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F352</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
unto the present necessity, lest any man should think
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F353</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that there is some mystery comprehended under the same. Whereas Luke saith,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>full of the Spirit and
wisdom,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I do interpret it thus, that it
is requisite that they be furnished both with other gifts of the Spirit, and
also with wisdom,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F354</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
without which that function cannot be exercised well, both that they may beware
of the leger-demain
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F355</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of those men, who being too much given unto begging, require
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F356</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that which is necessary for the poverty of the brethren, and also of their
slanders, who cease not to backbite, though they have none occasion given them.
For that function is not only painful, but also subject to many ungodly
murmurings.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And we will give ourselves unto prayer.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>They show again that they have too much business otherwise, wherein they may
exercise themselves during their whole life. For the old proverb agreeth
hereunto very fitly, which was used sometimes in the solemn rites, <i>do this.
</i>Therefore, they use the word
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">proskarterhsai</font><font face="Palatino">]
which signifieth to be, as it were, fastened and tied to anything. Therefore,
pastors must not think that they have so done their duty that they need to do no
more when they have daily spent some time in teaching. There is another manner
of study, another manner of zeal, another manner of continuance
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F358</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
required, that they may
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F359</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
indeed boast that they are wholly given to that thing. They adjoin thereunto
prayer, not that they alone ought to pray, (for that is an exercise common to
all the godly,) but because they have peculiar causes to pray above all others.
There is no man which ought not to be careful for the common salvation of the
Church. How much more, then,<i> </i>ought the pastor, who hath that function
enjoined him by name to labor carefully [anxiously] for it? So Moses did indeed
exhort others unto prayer, but he went before them as the ringleader
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F360</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
17:11.) And it is not without cause that Paul doth so often make mention of his
prayers,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:10.) Again, we must always remember that, that we shall lose all our labor
bestowed upon plowing, sowing, and watering, unless the increase come from
heaven,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:7.) Therefore, it shall not suffice to take great pains in
teaching, unless we require the blessing at the hands of the Lord, that our
labor may not be in vain and unfruitful. Hereby it appeareth that the exercise
of prayer
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F361</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is not in vain commended unto the ministers of the word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Stephen, full of
faith.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke doth not, therefore,
separate faith from the Spirit, as if it also were not a gift of the Spirit; but
by Spirit he meaneth other gifts wherewith Stephen was endued, as zeal, wisdom,
uprightness, brotherly love, diligence, integrity of a good conscience;
secondly, he expresseth the principal kind. Therefore, he signifieth that
Stephen did excel first in faith, and, secondly, in other virtues; so that it
was evident that he had abundance of the grace of the Spirit. He doth not so
greatly commend the rest, because undoubtedly they were inferior to him.
Moreover, the ancient writers do, with great consent, affirm that this Nicholas,
which was one of the seven, is the same of whom John maketh mention in the
Revelation,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;660215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Revelation
2:15,) to wit, that he was an author of a filthy and wicked sect; forasmuch as
he would have women to be common. For which cause we must not be negligent in
choosing ministers of the Church. For if the hypocrisy of men do deceive even
those which are most vigilant and careful to fake heed, what shall befall the
careless and negligent? Notwithstanding, if when we have used such
circumspection as is meet, it so fall out that we be deceived, let us not be
troubled out of measure; forasmuch as Luke saith that even the apostles were
subject to this inconvenience. Some will ask this question, then, what good
shall exhortation do? to what use serveth prayer, seeing that the success itself
showeth that the election was not wholly governed by the Spirit of God? I
answer, that this is a great matter that the Spirit directed their judgments in
choosing six men; in that he suffereth the Church to go astray in the seventh,
it ought to seem no absurd thing. For it is requisite that we be thus humbled
divers ways, partly that the wicked and ungodly may exercise us; partly that,
being taught by their example, we may learn to examine ourselves thoroughly,
lest there be in us any hidden and privy starting-corners of guile;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F362</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
partly that we may be more circumspect to discern, and that we may, as it were,
keep watch continually, lest we be deceived by crafty and unfaithful men. Also
it may be that the ministry of Nicholas was for a time profitable, and that he
fell afterward into that monstrous error. And if so be it he fell in such sort
from such an honorable degree, the higher that every one of us shall be
extolled, let him submit himself unto God with modesty and
fear.</font><br></div>

Having prayed, they laid their hands upon
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Laying on of hands was a solemn
sign of consecration under the law. To this end do the apostles now lay their
hands upon the deacons, that they may know that they are offered to God.
Notwithstanding, because this ceremony should of itself be vain, they add
thereunto prayer, wherein the faithful commend unto God those ministers whom
they offer unto him. This is referred unto the apostles, for all the people did
not lay their hands upon the deacons; but when the apostles did make prayer in
the name of the Church, others also did add their petitions. Hence we gather
that the laying on of hands is a rite agreeing unto order and comeliness,
forasmuch as the apostles did use the same, and yet that it hath of itself no
force or power, but that the effect dependeth upon the Spirit of God alone;
which is generally to be thought of all ceremonies.</font><br></div>

Church, to the end he may the better declare the power of God and his grace in
the continual going forward thereof. This was an excellent work of God that the
Church should suddenly, and, as it were, in a moment, be raised up; but this is
worthy no less admiration, in that he furthereth that work which he had begun
amidst so many lets, in that the number of these is increased, whom to diminish,

labor. In that he saith that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

that it was spread further abroad. The Word of God is said to grow two manner of
ways; either when new disciples are brought to obey the same, or as every one of
us profiteth and goeth forward therein Luke speaketh in this place of the former
sort of increasing, for he expoundeth himself by and by, when he speaketh of the
number of the disciples. Notwithstanding, he restraineth this so great an
increasing of faith unto one city. For although it be to be thought that the

only at Jerusalem.</font><br></div>

Christianity. And he reckoneth up the priests by name, because they were for the
most part enemies; for which cause it was a wonderful work of God that some
should be converted, and much more wonderful that many. For at the first they
raged against Christ with this brag, &#8220;Hath any of the rulers believed in
him? But this multitude, which knoweth not the law, are

a new combat of the Church, whereby it appeareth that the glory of the gospel
was always joined with the cross and divers troubles. And this is the sum, that
the Church was assaulted in the person of one man. Whereby it came to pass that
the enemies were the more bold, and being imbrued with innocent blood, did rage
sorer than they had wont; for they had not gone as yet beyond the prison and
rods. But to the end we may know that the name of Christ was glorified as well
in the life as in the death of Stephen, Luke saith at the first, that he
was</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> full of faith and
power.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Whereby he signifieth that his
faith was excellent, and that he excelled in power to do miracles. Neither ought
we to imagine perfection of faith, because he is said to be full of faith; but
this manner of speaking is much used in the Scripture, to call those full of the
gifts of God who are abundantly endued with the same. I
take</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

do miracles. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Faith

understanding, but also the ferventness of zeal. Forasmuch as his name was

vain to set themselves against Christ by disputing, when they saw that that
former attempt did take none effect, they fly unto slanders, (caviling,) and
tumults, and at length they break out into violence and murder. Therefore, Luke
meaneth by the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rise,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>that those of whom he speaketh did assault the gospel with their tongue, and
did not, by and by, bring Stephen before the judgment-seat, but did first set
upon him, by disputing against him. Furthermore, he signifieth that they were
strangers, which lived in Judea, either that they might exercise merchandise, or
else get learning. Therefore he saith that some of them were Cyrenians, some of
Alexandria, some of Cilicia, some of Asia. He saith that they were all of the
synagogue of the Libertines. It is to be thought that the free men of the
citizens of Rome had caused a synagogue to be builded of their own charges, that
it might be proper to the Jews which came together out of the provinces.

<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, those which were brought thither by the
grace of God, and ought to have embraced Christ so much the more willingly,
assault him first, and inflame the fury of others, as it were with a trumpet.
Also Luke will in many other places afterward declare that the Jews, which were
scattered abroad in the provinces, were most deadly enemies to sound doctrine:
and most venomous
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F365</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in moving tumults. He reckoneth up many, to the end the victory of the truth may
be more famous, whilst that in any, gathered of divers countries, depart, being
vanquished by one man; and it is not to be doubted but that they were enforced
to hold their peace with shame. Stephen had already won great favor, and gotten
great dignity by miracles.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F366</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He answereth the disputers now in such sort that he getteth the upper hand much.
He putteth not that <i>wisdom and spirit </i>which he saith his adversaries
could not gainstand, as divers things. Therefore resolve these words thus: They
could not resist the wisdom which the Spirit of God gave him. For Luke meant to
express that they fought not on both sides as men; but that the enemies of the
gospel were therefore discouraged and overcome, because they did strive against
the Spirit of God, which spake by the mouth of Stephen. And forasmuch as Christ
hath promised the same Spirit to all his servants, let us only defend the truth
faithfully, and let us crave a mouth and wisdom of him, and we shall be
sufficiently furnished to speak, so that neither the wit, neither yet the
babbling of our adversaries, shall be able to make us ashamed. So the Spirit was
as effectual in our time in the mouth of the martyrs which were burnt, and it
uttereth the like force now daily, that though they were ignorant men, (never
trained up in any schools,) yet did they make the chief divines which maintained
Popery no less astonished with their voice only, than if it had thundered and
lightned.

But hypocrites, which shroud themselves under zeal, do carelessly grant
themselves leave to do that. We see how the Papists at this day corrupt manifest
places of Scripture, and that wittingly, whilst that they will falsely wrest
testimonies against us. I confess, indeed, that they offend for the most part
through ignorance; yet can we find none of them which doth not grant himself
liberty to corrupt both the sense and also the words of the Scripture, that they
may bring our doctrine into contempt;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F370</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yea, they slander us monstrously even in the pulpit. If you ask these Rabbins,
whether it be lawful to slander a man or no, they will deny that it is lawful
generally; but when they come unto us, good zeal doth excuse them, because they
think that nothing is unlawful which may burden us or our cause; therefore they
flatter themselves in lying, falsehood, and dogged impudence. Such hypocrisy did
also blind them of whom Luke speaketh in this place, which used false witness to
put Stephen to death; for when Satan reigneth, he doth not only prick forward
the reprobate unto cruelty, but also blind their eyes, so that they think that
they may do whatsoever they will. We are specially taught by this example, how
dangerous the color of good zeal is, unless it be governed by the Spirit of God;
for it breaketh out always into furious madness, and, in the mean season, it is
a marvelous visor to cover all manner of wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It shall full well appear by
Stephen&#8217;s defense, that he never spake anything touching Moses or the
temple without reverence; and yet, notwithstanding, this was not laid to his
charge for nothing, for he had taught the abrogating of the law. But they are
false witnesses in this, and suborned to lie, because they corrupt purposely
those things which were well and godly spoken. So Christ was enforced to clear
himself, that he came, not to destroy the law, but to fulfill the law; because,
when he had preached of abrogating the ceremonies, the wicked wrested this unto
another purpose, as if he meant to abolish and take away the whole law.
Furthermore, they wrested that wickedly unto the temple of Jerusalem, which he
spake of his body. What, was it not objected to Paul, that he taught,
&#8220;That evil is to be done, that good may come
thereof?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, there is no cause why we should wonder at
this day that that is so falsely misconstrued which we teach godly, well, and
profitably; yea, we must rather persuade ourselves thus, that the doctrine of
the gospel can never be handled so warily and moderately, but that it shall be
subject to false accusations; for Satan, who is the father of lying, doth always
bestir himself in his office. Again, because there be many things which are
contrary to the reason of the flesh, men are inclined to nothing more than to
admit false reports, which corrupt the true and sincere sense of doctrine. This
malice of Satan, and the sleights, ought to make us more wary and more
circumspect that no preposterous thing, or anything that is improperly spoken,
escape us, wherewith they may be armed to fight against us; for we must
carefully cut off from the wicked that occasion whereat they snatch. And if we
see that, doctrine, which is by us well and godly delivered, corrupted,
deformed, and torn in pieces with false reports, we must not repent that we have
begun, neither yet is there any cause why we should be more slack hereafter; for
it is not meet that we should be flee from the poisoned and venomous bitings of
Satan, which the Son of God himself could not escape. In the mean season, it is
our part and duty to dash and put away those lies wherewith the truth of God is
burdened, like as we see Christ free the doctrine of the gospel from unjust
infamy. Only let us so prepare ourselves that such indignity and dishonest
dealing may not hinder us in our course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Because we teach that men are so corrupt, that they
are altogether slaves unto sin and wicked lusts, the enemies do thereupon infer
this false accusation, that we deny that men sin willingly, but that they are
enforced thereunto by some other means, so that they are not in the fault,
neither bear any blame; yea, they say farther, that we quench altogether all
desire to do well. Because we deny that the works of holy men are for their own
worthiness meritorious, because they have always some fault or imperfection in
them, they cavil that we put no difference between the good and the evil.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F371</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Because we say that man&#8217;s righteousness consisteth in the grace of God
alone, and that godly souls can find rest nowhere else, save only in the death
of Christ; they object that by this means we grant liberty to the flesh, (to do
whatsoever it will,) that the use of the law may no longer remain. When as we
maintain the honor of Christ, which they bestow as it pleaseth them here and
there, after that they have rent it in a thousand pieces like a prey; they feign
that we are enemies to the saints, they falsely report that we seek the
licentiousness of the flesh instead of the liberty of the Spirit. Whilst that we
endeavor to restore the Supper of the Lord unto his pure and lawful use; they
cry out impudently that we overthrow and destroy the same. Others also which
take away all things, as did the Academics, because that doth not please them
which we teach concerning the secret predestination of God, and that out of the
Scriptures, lay to our charge despitefully, that we make God a tyrant which
taketh pleasure in putting innocent men to death, seeing that he hath already
adjudged those unto eternal death which are as yet unborn, and other such things
as can be said on this behalf; whereas, notwithstanding, they are sufficiently
convicted that we think reverently of God, and that we speak no otherwise than
he teacheth with his own mouth. It is a hard matter to endure such envy, yet
must we not therefore cease off to defend a good cause. For the truth of God is
precious in his sight, and it ought also to be precious unto us, although it be
unto the reprobate the savor of death unto death,

Corinthians 2:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But now I return unto Stephen&#8217;s accusation, the
principal point whereof is this, that he blasphemed God and Moses. They do, for
good considerations, make the injury common to God and to Moses, because Moses
had nothing in his doctrine which was his own or separated from God. They prove
this, because he spake blasphemously against the temple and the law;
furthermore, they make this the blasphemy, because he said that the coming of
Christ had made an end of the temple and the ceremonies. It is not credible that
Stephen spake thus as they report; but they maliciously wrest those things which
were spoken well and godly, that they may color their false accusation; but
although they had changed nothing in the words, yet Stephen was so far from
doing any injury to the law and the temple, that he could no way better and more
truly praise the same. The Jews did suppose that the temple was quite
dishonored, unless the shadowy estate thereof should endure for ever, that the
law of Moses was frustrate and nothing worth, unless the ceremonies should be
continually in force. But the excellency of the temple and the profit of the
ceremonies consist rather in this, whilst that they are referred unto Christ as
unto their principal pattern. Therefore, howsoever the accusation hath some
color, yet is it unjust and wicked. And although the fact come in question, that
is, whether the matter be so as the adversaries lay to his charge,
notwithstanding the state [of the question] is properly [one] of quality, for
they accuse Stephen, because he taught that the form of the worship of God which
was then used should be changed; and they interpret this to be blasphemy against
God and Moses; therefore the controversy is rather concerning right (as they
say) than the fact itself; for the question is, Whether he be injurious and
wicked against God and Moses, who saith, that the visible temple is an image of
a more excellent sanctuary, wherein dwelleth the fullness of the Godhead, and
who teacheth that the shadows of the law are temporal?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This Jesus of
Nazareth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They speak thus of Christ
disdainfully, as if the remembrance of him were detestable. Nevertheless, it may
be gathered out of their accusations, that Stephen did, in the abrogating of the
law, set the body against the shadows, and the substance against the figure; for
if ceremonies be abolished by Christ, their truth is spiritual. The Jews, which
would have them continue for ever, did consider nothing in them but that which
was gross, carnal, earthly, and which might be seen with the eyes. Briefly, if
the use of ceremonies were continual, they should be frail and should vanish
away, because they should have nothing but the only external show, so that they
should have no soundness. Therefore, this is their true perpetuity, when as they
are abrogated by the coming of Christ; because it followeth hereupon that the
force and effect thereof doth consist in Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall change the
ordinances.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is out of all doubt that
Stephen meant this of the ceremonial part only; but because men are wont to be
more addicted to external pomp, these men understand that which was spoken, as
if Stephen would bring the whole law to nothing. The principal <i>precepts
</i>of the law did indeed concern the spiritual worship of God, faith, justice,
and judgment; but because these men make more account of the external <i>rites,
</i>they call the rites which are commanded concerning the sacrifices,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ordinances of
Moses,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>by excellency. This was bred by
the bone from the beginning of the world, and it will never out of the flesh so
long as it lasteth.

visors; although they differ much from the Jews, because they follow nothing but
the frivolous invention of men for the ordinances of God.</font><br></div>

his natural face, but rather of his present countenance. For whereas the
countenance of those which are arraigned useth commonly to be pale, whereas they
stammer in their speech, and show other signs of fear, Luke teacheth that there

unjust prejudice in his words; for he asketh him not what cause he had to teach
thus, neither doth he admit him unto the defense of right, (which was,
notwithstanding, the chief;) but he demanded precisely whether Stephen uttered
these words, whatsoever they were; as the Papists at this day will not demand
what doctrine it is, and whether it can be proved out of the Scriptures; but
they inquire

him. Furthermore, Stephen&#8217;s answer may seem at the first blush absurd and
foolish. He beginneth first at the very first beginning; afterwards he maketh a
long narration, wherein there is no mention made, in a manner, of the matter in
hand; and there can be no greater fault than to utter many words which are
nothing appertinent unto the matter;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F375</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

very ap-pertinently,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F376</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as the matter requireth. He was accused as an apostate (or revolt,) which did
attempt the overthrow of religion and the worship of God; therefore, he beateth
in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F377</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
this diligently, that he retaineth that God which the fathers have always
worshipped, so that he turneth away the crime of wicked backsliding;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F378</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and declareth that his enemies were pricked forward with nothing less than with
the zeal of the law, for they bear a show that they were wholly determined
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F379</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to increase the glory of God; therefore, he wringeth from them this false
boasting, and because they had the fathers always in their mouths, because they
were puffed up with the glory of their nation, Stephen declareth also that they
have no cause to be proud of this, but rather that the corruptions of the
fathers were so great and so many, that they ought to be ashamed and
humbled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As concerning the principal state of the cause,
because the question was concerning the temple and the ceremonies, he affirmeth
plainly that their fathers were elected of God to be a peculiar people before
there was any temple, and before Moses was born; and to this end tendeth that
<i>exordium </i>or beginning which is so far fet, (fetched.) Secondly, he
telleth them that all external rites which God gave by the hand of Moses were
fashioned according to the heavenly pattern.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whereupon it followeth, that the ceremonial law is
referred unto another end, and that those deal foolishly and disorderly who omit
the truth, and stay only in the signs. If the readers shall refer the whole
oration of Stephen unto these points, they shall find nothing therein which
agreeth not very well with the cause, as I shall declare again briefly in the
end; nevertheless, that scope of the whole oration shall not hinder but that we
may discuss all things briefly which are worth the noting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Men, brethren, and fathers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Although
Stephen saw that those which sat in the council were, for the most part, the
sworn enemies of Christ, yet because the ordinary government of the people did
belong to them, and they had the oversight of the Church, which God had not as
yet cast off, therefore, he is not afraid, for modesty&#8217;s sake, to call
them fathers. Neither doth he flatteringly purchase favor hereby; but he giveth
this honor to the order and government appointed by God, until such time as the
authority should be taken from them, the order being altered. Nevertheless, the
reverence of the place which they had doth not hinder him nor stop his mouth;
but that he doth freely dissent from them, whereby it appeareth how ridiculous
the Papists are who will have us so tied unto bare and vain invented titles,
that they may enforce us to subscribe unto their decrees, though they be never
so wicked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The God of
glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this beginning, he declareth
that he doth not disagree or dissent from the fathers in true religion which
they followed; for all religion, the worship of God, the doctrine of the law,
all prophecies, did depend upon that covenant which God made with Abraham;
therefore, when Stephen confessed that God appeared to Abraham, he embraceth the
law and the prophets, which flow from that first revelation as from a fountain;
moreover, he calleth him the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God
of glory,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that he may distinguish him
from the false and reigned gods, who alone is worthy of glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When he was in
Mesopotamia.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is well known that that
is called by this name which lieth between the river Tigris and Euphrates; and
he saith before, he dwelt in Charran, because Abraham, being warned by an
oracle, fled
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F380</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from Chaldea to Charran, which is a city of Mesopotamia, famous by reason of the
slaughter of Crassus and the Roman army; although Pliny saith that it was a city
of Arabia; and it is no marvel that Chaldea is in this place comprehended under
the name of Mesopotamia, because, although that region, which is enclosed with
Tigris and Euphrates, [Mesopotamia,] be properly the country between two rivers,
yet those which set down any description of countries
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F381</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
do call both Assyria and Chaldea by this name.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum is this, that Abraham being commanded by God,
did forsake his country, and so he was prevented with the mere goodness of God
when as he sought that which was offered him at home of the [its] own accord.
Read the last chapter of Joshua; but it seemeth that Moses&#8217; narration doth
somewhat disagree with this, for after that, about the end of the 11th chapter
of Genesis, he had declared, that Abraham doth [did] go into another country to
dwell, having left his house, he addeth, in the beginning of the 12th, that
<i>God spake unto Abraham. </i>This is easily answered, for Moses reciteth not
in this latter place what happened after the departure of Abraham; but lest any
man should think that Abraham wandered into other countries, having unadvisedly
forsaken his own house, (as light and indiscreet men
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F382</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
used to do sometimes,) he showeth the cause of his departure, to wit, because he
was commanded by God to flit into another place. And thus much do the words of
the oracle import. For, if he had been a stranger in another country, God could
not have commanded him to depart out of his native soil, forsaking his kinsmen
and father&#8217;s house. Therefore, we see that this place agreeth wondrous
well with the words of Moses. For after that Moses hath said that Abraham went
to Charran, to the end he may show that this journey was taken in hand, not
through any lightness of man, but at the commandment of God, he addeth that
afterwards which he had before omitted, which manner of speaking is much used of
the Hebrews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Come out of thy country.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God useth many
words, to the end he may the more wound the mind of Abraham, as if it were not a
thing sharp enough of itself to be banished out of his own country. And that
served to try his faith; even as that other thing also, that God assigneth him
no land wherein he may dwell, but maketh him stand in doubt, and wait for a
time. Wherefore the obedience of Abraham was so much the more to be commended,
because the sweetness of his native soil keepeth him not back from going
willingly, as it were, into exile; and in that he doubteth not to follow God,
although there appear no certain resting-place, but is commanded to wander to
and fro for a time. Whereas, the showing of the land is deferred, it differeth
not much from deceiving of him.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F383</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, we learn continually by our own
experience how profitable it was for Abraham thus to be exercised, and, as it
were, trained by little and little. Many men are carried with a godly affection
to attempt great things, but by and by, so soon as their heat is waxen cold, it
repenteth them of their purpose, and they would gladly slip their necks out of
the collar.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F384</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore, lest Abraham should faint when he was in the midst of his course,
through the remembrance of those things which he had left behind him, God
sifteth and trieth his mind thoroughly, immediately after he had begun, lest he
take anything in hand lightly and unadvisedly. To this purpose serveth the
parable which Christ setteth before us concerning the building of the tower,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421428&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
14:28.) For he teacheth that we must first cast the charges, lest with shame we
be enforced to leave off building after we have begun. And though this were a
particular thing in Abraham in that he was commanded to go out of his own
country, and to go into a far country, in that God carried him from place to
place, yet, notwithstanding, there is in these words some figure of the calling
of us all. We are not all simply commanded to forsake our country, but we are
commanded to deny ourselves; we are not commanded to come out of our
father&#8217;s house, but to bid adieu to our own will, and to the desires of
our own flesh. Again, if father and mother, wife and children, hinder us from
following God, we must forsake them all. The commandment is given simply to
Abraham to flit; but we are commanded to do the stone upon condition. For if in
any place we cannot serve God, we must rather make choice of exile than to stay
in our nest, being slothful and sluggish. Therefore, let us have the example of
Abraham always before our eyes. He is the father of the faithful, he was tried
all manner of ways. Doth he forget his country, his friends, and himself, that
he may give over himself unto God?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:16,17.) If we will be counted the children of God, we must not degenerate from
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which I shall show
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We must note that which I touched
a little before, that Abraham is kept in doubt, to the end his patience may be
tried. And this must we also apply to our own use, that we may learn to depend
wholly upon God. And surely this is a principal exercise of our faith to put our
trust in God, even when we see nothing. God, indeed, will oftentimes show us a
land wherein he granteth us an abiding-place; yet, notwithstanding, because we
are strangers in the world, we have no certain and continual place of abode
anywhere. Again, our life, as Paul saith, is hid,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:3;) and being like unto dead men, we hope for salvation, which is hid in
heaven. Therefore, as touching our perpetual habitation, God doth cause us to
depend upon his providence alone, when he commandeth us, as it were, to wander
in a strange country. Lest such deferring discourage us, we must hold this
general rule of faith, that we must go whither God calleth us, howsoever he do
not show that which he promiseth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

willingness of faith is commended in these words. For when he is called he
maketh no delay, but maketh haste

and subdueth all his affections, that they may obey the holy commandment of God.
It is uncertain for what cause he stayed at Charran; yet it may be that the
weakness of his father caused him to tarry there, who, as we read, died there
shortly after; or else, because he durst go no further, until such time as the
Lord had told him whither he should go. It is more like to be true in mine
opinion, that he was stayed there a while with the wearisomeness and sickness of
his father, because Stephen saith plainly that he was brought thence after the
death of his father.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> We must note three firings in this place;
that God exercised the patience of his servant, because, after that he had
brought him out of his own country, he dwelt in the land of Canaan as a
stranger.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">[First,] For Abraham possessed not one
foot&#8217;s-breadth, save only that which he bought to bury in. And that is
counted no possession which serveth not for the uses of this life. Secondly,
forasmuch as that field was bought, Stephen doth for good causes say, that God
gave Abraham nothing. For that could not be gotten either with money, or by any
other means which man could invent, which Abraham did hope for of the
promise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Secondly, we must note, that though God did not show
Abraham the thing itself as yet, yet did he uphold him by his word. And this is
our stay, when God promiseth that that is laid up for us which as yet we possess
not. Therefore, when as the thing, that is, the possession of the land, was
wanting, Abraham had for his help and stay the promise of God; and being content
with the same alone, he desired nothing in the land of Canaan save only an
uncertain resting-place wherein he might sojourn.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For as much as
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">epaggellesqai</font><font face="Palatino">]
signifieth simply to promise, I thought there was no cause why, with Erasmus, I
should translate it in this place, to <i>promise again. </i>For I resolve it
adversatively, <i>although he had promised, </i>that by the way we may note as
it were, a show of deceiving,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F386</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
unless peradventure some man be disposed to apply it unto the promises which are
oftentimes repeated.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F387</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thirdly, we must note that the promise was such that
it did not much differ from a mere mock. God promised the land to the seed of
Abraham when he was fourscore years old, and had to wife one that was barren,
neither had he any hope to have any issue. This seemeth to be more than
frivolous. For why doth he not rather promise that he will give him seed? But
this was a notable trial of faith, in that Abraham, without asking any question,
or any curious disputation, did obediently and meekly embrace that which he had
heard proceed out of the mouth of the Lord. Therefore, let us remember that God
doth so lift up and comfort his servant with his word, that he doth not only
defer the giving of the thing,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F388</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but also he may seem after a sort to mock him; as he dealeth with us also in
some respect. For, although he call us the heirs of the world,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;590205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
2:5,) he suffereth us oftentimes to want even a competent living and necessary
helps. And this doth he of set purpose, that he may bring the wisdom of the
flesh to nought, seeing that we do not otherwise give due honor to his
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy seed shall be a
stranger.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Stephen putteth the Jews in
mind in how miserable and reproachful an estate their fathers were in Egypt; and
showeth that this their servitude, wherewith they were oppressed, came not by
chance; because it was foretold long before by the oracle of God. This history
ought to have been of great force, partly to tame their lofty courages,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F389</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and to teach them modesty; partly to set forth the grace of God, because God had
always had a care of that nation. For this is a singular benefit, in that the
people are restored wonderfully, as it were, from death to life. In the mean
season, the Jews are taught that the Church of God was elsewhere than in the
land wherein they dwelt; that the fathers were chosen to be a peculiar people,
and that they were kept safe under the tuition of God, before ever the temple
was built, or the external ceremonies of the law were
instituted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These things appertain unto the general scope or
drift of the sermon. But hence may we gather a profitable admonition. Bondage is
of itself hard and bitter; but when cruelty of masters is added thereunto, it
seemeth to be intolerable. Wherefore, it must needs be that the mind of the
godly man was sore wounded, when he heard that his seed should serve, and be
villanously and cruelly entreated, Moreover, this was no small trial; forasmuch
as these things were, to look to contrary&#8212;the inheritance of the land of
Canaan which was now promised, and bondage in a strange country. For who would
not have thought that God had, as it were, forgotten his former promise, when as
he telleth Abraham that his seed shall endure miserable bondage? He saith, at
the first, that he will give his seed the land. But he had as yet no seed; yea,
all hope of seed was now cut off. But when doth he promise that he will give it?
After his death. By and by he saith, that that seed should be carried away to
another place, that it may serve strangers. And how long? Four hundred years.
Doth he not seem, by this means, to pull back his hand, that he may not perform
that which he had promised? </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us know that this was done, (not once only,) for
God dealeth oftentimes with us thus, so that he may seem contrary to himself;
and he speaketh also in such sort as that he may seem to call back
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F390</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that which he had promised. Therefore, it cannot be but that flesh will judge
that he is contrary to himself; but faith doth know that his words do agree well
together amongst themselves, and with his works. And this is the purpose of God,
to the end he may extend the sight of our faith the farther, to show his
promises afar off, as it were, a long place [space] being put between. Therefore
it is our duty to go forward, and to strive to attain unto that salvation which
is set before us through many straits,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F391</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
through divers lets, through long distance, through the midst of deeps, and,
finally, through death itself. Furthermore, seeing that we see that the people
which God had chosen did serve the Egyptians, and was uncourteously
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F392</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
afflicted, we must not be discouraged if the like condition be prepared for us
at this day. For it is no new thing, neither any unwonted thing, for the Church
of God to lie oppressed under tyranny, and to be, as it were, trodden under foot
of the wicked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
The nation whom they shall serve.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This
judgment is joined with the deliverance of the people. For, whereas God doth
punish the cruelty and tyranny of the wicked Egyptians, he doth that for his
people&#8217;s sake, whom he took into his tuition, that it may be seen that he
is the deliverer of his Church. Therefore, so often as we are unjustly afflicted
by the wicked, let us remember that God is the Judge of the world, who will let
no injuries be unpunished. Let every man thus think with himself, Seeing that I
am under the tuition of God, who is the Judge of the world, and to whom it
belongeth to punish all injuries, those shall not escape his hand who trouble me
now. There is the like place in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;053243&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:43, where God saith that vengeance is his. Whence Paul gathereth that we must
give place to wrath,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:19;) as if he should say, that this ought to serve to reform impatience, and
to bridle our evil affections, in that God promiseth that he will revenge; for
he which revengeth himself doth take God&#8217;s office from him. And let us
still remember that which I have already said, that God is touched with an
especial care to revenge injuries done to his children, as it is in the Psalm,
&#8220;Hurt<i> </i>not mine anointed, and be not troublesome to my
prophets.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They shall come thence and serve
me. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Therefore their deliverance went before the
temple and the worship of the law; whereupon it followeth, that the grace of God
was not tied to ceremonies. Nevertheless, Stephen noteth the end of their
deliverance, that God chose both a peculiar people and a peculiar place for the
true worship of his name. Whence we gather again, that we must regard what he
commandeth and alloweth. Other nations also were determined to worship God; but
because their rites were corrupt and bastardly,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F393</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
God doth separate the Jews from the rest, and assigneth them a place where he
will have them to worship him sincerely and duly as they ought. This place
teacheth us, that God&#8217;s benefits must be referred to this end, that men
might be brought to addict and give over themselves wholly to him. Now, since
that God hath dispersed the treasures of his grace throughout the whole world,
we must endeavor to sanctify him, by worshipping him purely and holily, in what
country soever we dwell.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He gave him the
covenant.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>When as he confesseth that
circumcision is the covenant of God, he cleareth himself sufficiently of that
crime which was laid to his charge; but, in the mean season, he showeth that the
Jews deal amiss, if they place the beginning of their salvation in the external
sign. For if Abraham was called, and the land and redemption promised to his
seed before such time as he was circumcised, it appeareth that the glory of the
whole stock cloth not depend upon circumcision. Paul useth the same argument in
the 4th chapter to the Romans,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:11.) For, seeing that Abraham obtained righteousness, and pleased God before
he was circumcised, he gathereth thence that circumcision is not the cause of
righteousness. Therefore we see that Stephen frameth no vain and idle narration;
because this was very much appertinent unto the cause, that the Jews might
remember how God had adopted them with their fathers, and it is to be thought
that Stephen did plainly express both things; that although circumcision was
given by God, that it might be a sign of grace, yet was the adoption before it
both in order and in time. But we have no need to dispute any longer in this
place concerning the nature and force of circumcision. Only let us note this,
that God doth first promise those things to Abraham which he confirmeth
afterward by circumcision, that we may know that the signs are vain and nothing
worth, unless the word go before. Let us also note, that there is a profitable
doctrine contained in the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covenant,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to wit, that God maketh his covenant with us in the sacraments, that he may
declare his love toward us; which thing, if it be true, first, they are not only
works of external profession amongst men, but they gave great force inwardly
before God, to confirm the faith. Secondly, they are no vain figures; because
God, who is true figureth nothing there which he doth not
perform.</font><br></div>

for the infamy reacheth unto all the people. Forasmuch as all the patriarchs,
Benjamin excepted, had polluted themselves with that treachery; therefore in
that Stephen vouchsafeth to give them an honorable name that redoundeth to the
greater reproach of the nation. They boasted proudly of their fathers; he

him favor in the sight of Pharaoh. God could have delivered him by some other
means, but his counsel had respect unto a farther thing, that Joseph, being
ruler of the kingdom, might entertain his father and all his family. In these
two words,<i>

endued was the cause that he found favor; although I confess that they were two
distinct benefits. For, though Joseph were a faithful interpreter of dreams, and
did excel in divine wisdom, yet the proud tyrant would never have brought him to
so great honor, unless God had bent the mind of Pharaoh unto a certain unwonted
love; yet, notwithstanding, we must consider that order whereby God useth to
bring him into favor.

Joseph was sent before in due time to provide sustenance to feed the hungry; as
he himself doth acknowledge the wonderful counsel of God in that point.
Nevertheless, the free goodness of God appeareth plainly in the person of
Joseph, whilst that he is appointed to nourish and feed his brethren, who had
sold him, and by that means sent him far away, and thought that he was gone away
quite

and preserveth their life who were not afraid

to take from him his life. In the mean season, Stephen putteth the Jews in mind
of this, that the patriarchs were enforced to depart out of that land which was
given them for an heritage, and that they died in another place. Therefore,
forasmuch as they were sojourners in it, they are at length banished out of the
same.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F408</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14. </b>Whereas he saith that Jacob came into
Egypt with seventy-five souls, it agreeth not with the words of Moses; for Moses
maketh mention of seventy only. Jerome thinketh that Luke setteth not down, word
for word, those things which Stephen had spoken, or that he took this number out
of the Greek translation of Moses,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;014627&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
46:27,) either because he himself, being a proselyte, had not the knowledge of
the Hebrew tongue, or because he would grant the Gentiles this, who used to read
it thus.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F409</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Furthermore, it is uncertain whether the Greek interpreters set down this number
of set purpose, or whether it crop [crept] in afterward through negligence,
[mistake;] which (I mean the latter) might well be, forasmuch as the Grecians
used to set down their numbers in letters. Augustine, in his 26th book of City
of God, <i>[De Civitate Dei,] </i>thinketh that Joseph&#8217;s nephews and
kinsmen
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F410</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
are comprehended in this number; and so he thinketh that the words <i>went down
</i>doth signify all that time which Jacob lived. But that conjecture can by no
means be received. For, in the mean space, the other patriarchs also had many
children born to them. This seemeth to me a thing like to be true, that the
Seventy Interpreters did translate that truly which was in Moses. And we cannot
say that they were deceived; forasmuch as [in] Deuteronomy 10, where this number
is repeated, they agree with Moses, at least as that place was read without all
doubt in the time of Jerome; for those copies which are printed at this day have
it otherwise. Therefore, I think that this difference came through the error of
the writers which wrote out the books.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F411</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And it was a matter of no such weight, for which Luke ought to have troubled the
Gentiles which were accustomed with the Greek reading. And it may be that he
himself did put down the true number; and that some man did correct the same
amiss out of that place of Moses. For we know that those which had the New
Testament in hand were ignorant of the Hebrew tongue, yet skillful in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F412</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the Greek,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, to the end [that] the words of Stephen
might agree with the place of Moses, it is to be thought that that false number
which was found in the Greek translation of Genesis was by them put in also in
this place; concerning which, if any man contend more stubbornly, let us suffer
him to be wise without measure. Let us remember that it is not without cause
that Paul doth forbid us to be too curious about genealogies. This, so small a
number, is purposely expressed, to the end the power of God may the more plainly
appear, in so great an enlarging of that kindred, which was of no long
continuance. For such a small handful of men could not, by any human manner of
engendering, grow to such an infinite multitude as is recorded in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021237&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus

which the Spirit commendeth unto us in this place, than to stand long about one
letter, whereby the number is altered. There arise other questions (and those
which are more hard to be answered) out of the rest of the text,

honor&#8217;s sake, because he had given express commandment concerning his
bones, which we cannot read to have been done of the rest. And, surely, when
Jerome, in the pilgrimage of Paula, saith, that she came by Shechem, he saith
that she saw there the sepulchres of the twelve patriarchs; but in another place

the old fame; as the Jews had many things in times past from the fathers, which
were delivered, as it were, from hand to hand. And whereas he saith afterward,
they were laid in the sepulcher which Abraham had bought of the sons of Hemor,
it is manifest that there is a fault [mistake] in the word Abraham. For Abraham

hundred lambs. Wherefore this place must be amended.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F414</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
went that innumerable issue which had increased beyond the ordinary manner in no
long space of time. Therefore, he setteth down this as a singular gift of God,
that the people was increased, to the end we may know that that came not to pass
according to the common or wonted custom of nature. But, on the other side, God
seemeth to take from the Jews all hope, because Pharaoh doth tyrannously afflict
them, and their bondage groweth greater daily. And when as they are commanded to
cast out their male infants, it seemeth that the destruction of the whole nation
was present. There is another token of deliverance given, when Moses cometh
abroad; but because he is by and by refused and enforced to fly into exile,
there remaineth nothing but mere despair. The sum is this; that God, being
mindful of his promise, did increase the people in time, that he might perform
that which he had sworn to Abraham; but the Jews (as they were unthankful and
froward) did refuse the grace of God, so that they did what they could to shut
up the way before themselves. Furthermore, we must note the providence of God in
this place, whilst that he doth so order the course of times, that his works
have always their opportunity. But men who make haste disorderly in their
desires cannot hope patiently, and be at rest, until such time as God showeth
forth his hand; for this cause, because they take no heed to that moderation
whereof I have spoken. And to the end God may exercise the faith of his children
so often as he appeareth with joyful tokens of grace, he setteth other things
against those on the other side, which cut off suddenly the hope of salvation.
For who would not have said of the Hebrews, that they were utterly undone, when
as the king&#8217;s commandment appointed all the men children to be put to
death? For which cause the meditating upon that doctrine is the most [more]
necessary for us, that God doth kill and restore to life; he leadeth unto hell,
and bringeth back again.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F415</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For Stephen meaneth that the king of Egypt did craftily invent new shifts and
wicked pretenses, that he might every now and then lay heavier burdens upon the
people, like as almost all tyrants do; for how unjustly soever they vex their
subjects, they are [but] too witty to invent excuses. And it is not to be
doubted but that Pharaoh abused this honest color, that it was not meet that the
Jews, who were sojourners, should have a place of abode in his realm for nought,
and that they should be free from all burthens, seeing they did enjoy great
commodities. Therefore, he deceitfully made them vile bondslaves of free-men.
When Stephen saith that this tyrant knew not Joseph, hereby it appeareth how
soon the remembrance of benefits passeth away among men, For although we do all
with one consent detest unthankfulness, yet is there no vice more common amongst
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest they should be

fet [fetched] thence, because the people doth all always remain alive in the
offspring. And, furthermore Stephen doth not reckon up all the parts of their
evil-entreating, but putteth down one example of extreme cruelty. Whence we may
easily gather how near the whole seed of Abraham was to destruction. For Pharaoh
seemed to have murdered them all with that commandment as with one stroke of a
sword. But such violent barbarism did the more set forth the unlooked-for and
incredible power of God; because when Pharaoh hath, by all means possible,
striven against God, yet all is in vain.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b> It is not without cause that Stephen
noteth the circumstance of time. Moses was born at the very same time when the
king had commanded that all the men children should be cast out. Therefore, it
seemeth that the minister of deliverance is dead before he is born. But that
time is most fit for God to work in, when there is no hope or counsel to be
looked for at man&#8217;s hands. And it appeareth also most plainly how God doth
make<i> </i>perfect his power in man&#8217;s weakness, (2 Corinthians 41:9.)
Moses is kept three months, but at length his parents (that they may save their
own lives) are enforced to cast him out into the river. Only they put him into a
little coffer,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F416</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that he may not by and by [immediately] perish. When as Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter
taketh him up, he escaped death indeed, yet so that he goeth into another
nation, being cut off from the kindred of Israel. Yea, he was like to be a most
troublesome adversary to his nation, unless God had restrained his mind. It is
forty years before he showeth any token of brotherly good-will.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b> Whereas Luke reporteth that he was taught
in </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of the Egyptians, he putteth that
in his commendation as a point of excellency. Notwithstanding, it might have so
fallen out, as it doth oftentimes, that being puffed up with profane sciences,
he might have despised the base common people; yet because God had determined to
redeem his people, he doth, in the mean season, frame both the mind of Moses and
all other things to finish his work. The reason of man&#8217;s flesh
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F417</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
should murmur in this place, Why doth God wink at so long miseries of the
people? Why doth he suffer Pharaoh to rage more cruelly daily? Why doth he not
suffer Moses to grow up amongst his own people? Why doth he after a sort cut him
off from the kindred of Israel, being adopted by the king&#8217;s daughter? Why
will he suffer him to remain amidst courtly pleasures,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F418</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and doth not rather pull him thence? But the end itself is so wonderful, that we
are enforced to confess that all these things were governed by singular counsel
and order to set forth the glory of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whereas I said that Luke speaketh in this place of
the learning of the Egyptians for honor&#8217;s sake, I would not have it so
taken as if there were in the same no corruption. Forasmuch as astrology
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F419</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
doth consider the wonderful workmanship of God, not only in the placing of the
stars, and in such excellent variety, but also in their moving, force, and
secret offices, it is a science both profitable and worthy of praise. The
Egyptians bestowed great study in this, but being not content with the simple
order of nature, they wandered also into many foolish speculations, as did the
Chaldeans. It is uncertain whether Moses was infected with these superstitions
or no. Yet, howsoever it be, we see how sincerely and plainly he setteth that
before us to be considered in the frame of the world, which is appertinent unto
godliness. Surely this was excellent modesty, in that he which could reason with
learned and witty men of the secrets of nature, doth not only omit higher
subtleties, but doth also descend unto the common capacity of every most simple
man, and doth, in a common style, set forth unto men unlearned those things
which they perceive by experience. When Justinian [Justin] babbleth concerning
Moses, he maketh him a magician, which, with juggling and enchantments, made
passage for the people through the Red Sea; so that Satan did not only go about
to bury the power of God, but also to blaspheme the same. But we know that Moses
did not strive with the enchanters by magic, but did that only which God had
enjoined him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, the Egyptians had mystical divinity,
wherewith they colored their doting inventions and monstrous abominations, as if
they would prove that they went mad not without reason: as the Papists, whereas
they delude and mock men like stage-players, in their mass and other foolish
rites, yet they invent mysteries, that they may persuade men that there is
nothing there but that which is divine. The common sort of priests cannot climb
so high, but those which amongst them will be accounted more cunning
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F420</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
do omit no rite, how foolish and childish soever it be, affirming that there is
some spiritual mystery in every [one] of them. There is extant concerning this
matter a most foolish mingle-mangle, which they call the Rationall [Rationale]
of Divine Offices. But forasmuch as sacrificing priests alone did use such
dotings amongst themselves, it is not to be thought that Moses spent any time in
these, whose bringing up was princely, but that he was taught in liberal
arts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He was
mighty.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This phrase doth express among
the Hebrews a double excellency, when as he which doth excel in wit and
learning, is also apt to attempt and bring to pass great and weighty matters.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F421</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Stephen&#8217;s meaning is, therefore, that Moses was furnished with rare gifts,
so that they did all confess that he was a singular man. But seeing he was in
such estimation, the Israelites had the less hope that he should be the minister
which should work their deliverance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
When the time was fulfilled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Many gather
by this that Moses was never estranged in mind from his nation; but the words of
Stephen incline rather toward the contrary, to wit, that the Spirit of God did
at length awake his mind, as it were out of sleep, that he might at length go
visit his brethren, whom he had long time neglected. It is to be thought that he
was not ignorant of what stock he came, seeing he had some token thereof in his
flesh, and seeing the rumor thereof was spread abroad in the court, because the
king&#8217;s daughter could not adopt him to be her son without some suspicion
of wickedness, unless his kindred had been known; yet was it long before he was
of such courage that he durst make known the love which he bare toward his
kindred. And this serveth not a little to set forth the glory of God, that
Moses, being ignorant of his calling, doth remain a long time idle in the
king&#8217;s court, and is afterward called of the Lord contrary to the hope of
all men, and his own also. Therefore, this new care for his brethren which came
into his mind, proceeded from a new and unwonted motion of God&#8217;s
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
When he saw a certain man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Moses came
not to this spectacle by chance, but forasmuch as God had appointed him to be
the deliverer of his people, he would have him show forth this token, and, as it
were, make this beginning. For Stephen doth plainly express that he did attempt
nothing unadvisedly, but did that which became him that was appointed to be a
deliverer of the people, knowing that he was thereunto called. For unless God
had armed him, (and made him puissant,) it had been a thing altogether unlawful
for him to kill any man, how wicked soever he had been. It is a godly deed, and
praiseworthy, for a man to set himself against the wicked, to defend the good
against the injuries of the wicked, to bridle their violence; but it is not for
a private person to punish, (or take vengeance.) Therefore, it was unlawful for
Moses to slay the Egyptian, save only inasmuch as the Lord had put the sword in
his hand according to the right of his calling. But this heroical courage and
nobleness of heart
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F422</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
was a work of the Holy Ghost; because God doth mightily show forth his power in
those whom he appointeth unto great matters, that they may be able to fulfill
their function. In sum, Stephen meaneth that Moses was even then offered to be
the minister of deliverance when the day was at hand, according to the covenant
made with Abraham, yet did the people hope for nothing less.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The day following he
appeared.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Stephen declareth now that the
fathers did not only neglect, but maliciously reject the grace of God. For
although the evil which he mentioneth did proceed from one man only, yet doth he
by right assign the fault unto them all. For if they had been thankful to God,
they would all with one consent have repressed his forwardness.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F423</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But they are whisht,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F424</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and suffer that good turn which Moses had done to be upbraided unto him; and, so
much as in them lieth, they bring them into extreme danger whom they ought to
have defended by endangering themselves.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F425</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore, his drift is this, that the people themselves were in the fault, that
they were no sooner delivered and eased.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F426</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
So the wickedness of men doth oftentimes hinder God from doing that [which] he
would do. He is ready to help those that be his in due time, but we keep back
his hand from ourselves with divers lets, and afterwards we complain of his
slowness, but unjustly. Furthermore, this unthankfulness was too wicked against
God, and too cruel against Moses. They were to thank God for giving such a
faithful patron in the king&#8217;s court. They were to love and reverence
Moses; but they rewarded him full evil
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F427</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
with threatenings and reproaches. Furthermore, inasmuch as the fact was brought
to the king&#8217;s ears, we must needs impute that to the treachery of the
people. Therefore, as when afterward the people could see the land of Canaan,
they did through their own folly keep themselves from entering in; so now,
refusing the grace of God in the person of one man, they cause the time of their
deliverance to be deferred forty years. For although God had determined what he
would do, yet those are justly blamed for the delay which hinder
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F428</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moses in his office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Men ye are
brethren.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>There is, indeed, amongst men
a general conjunction, so that they ought to use great courtesy one toward
another, and to abstain from all injuries; but this is more unmeet and
intolerable, when those hurt one another who are nearer linked together.
Therefore, Moses doth not only use a general reason, that it may revoke
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F429</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
their minds which were desirous to do harm, but he mentioneth their kindred and
fellowship of blood to mollify their cruelty. Yet all in vain; for he which had
done injury to his neighbor doth forwardly thrust him from him, and addeth
thereunto threatening. And this is a common thing amongst men; for an evil
conscience doth drive men into fury, and the worse every man&#8217;s cause is,
the more boldly and cruelly doth he extol himself. But under what color doth he
which hath the worst cause set himself so stubbornly against Moses? He saith he
is no judge; but he did not reprove them according to authority, but did only
friendly admonish them. Is it the duty of a judge alone to admonish us when we
do amiss? But this is a common vice, used of all stubborn and unruly persons, to
give place to no admonitions, save only when they are enforced by violence and
authority; yea, they are like frantic [phrenzied] men who rail upon
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F430</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
their physicians. For which cause we must be the more careful to bridle our
lust, lest we run headlong with such blind fury against those which are desirous
to cure our vices. Furthermore, we are taught by this example, that the servants
of God cannot so do their duty in reproving such vices of men, but they shall
suffer many injuries, offend many, and incur dangers; and chiefly when they do
well, they shall surely hear evil. But they must swallow up the unworthiness of
these evils,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F431</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they may not therefore cease to do that which the Lord commanded them, and
which he alloweth.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F432</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moses is burdened here with a cruel false accusation that he usurpeth the
authority of a ruler, and by this means they lay treason to his charge.
Secondly, it is objected unto him reproachfully that he slew an Egyptian; both
these were very odious. Whereby we may gather with how dangerous a temptation
the mind of the holy man was stricken. And forasmuch as we see that he was
neither discouraged by exile, neither by any other evils, so that it did not
repent him of his well-doing, let us also learn by his example to bear a valiant
and strong mind and courage against all such assaults of Satan,</font><br></div>

every one of us may easily gather how many things might have come into his mind
which might have caused him to mistrust his calling. The shifts and sleights of
Satan are captious. We are more than bent naturally to distrustfulness;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F434</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
what doubts soever arise in our minds concerning the word of God we do easily
admit the same. It was a hard exchange to be thrust from earthly delights and a
sumptuous life unto the painful and base office of feeding sheep; and especially
forasmuch as Moses saw so much time spent, and being in the mean season sent
into the wilderness, what other thing could he imagine with himself but that
that was vain and a plain mock which the Lord had promised? Forasmuch as being
now fourscore years of age, he was occupied about the feeding of his
father-in-law&#8217;s sheep, when could he have hoped that there should have
been any use of him in delivering the people? It is good for us oftentimes to
call to mind these combats of the godly until they be thoroughly imprinted in
our memory, lest our minds faint, and our hearts fail us, if the Lord make us
stay longer than we could wish. Again, Moses giveth a notable example of
modesty, seeing that in all that time he attempteth nothing; he raiseth no
tumults, neither intrudeth himself any way to bear rule, as troublesome men use
to do; but employeth himself in his shepherd&#8217;s function as diligently as
if he should never have been called unto any greater charge. But whilst he
tarrieth the Lord&#8217;s<i> </i>leisure so patiently, he [the Lord] appeareth
unto him at length.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The angel of the Lord appeared unto
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is first demanded who this angel
was? and, secondly, why he appeared in such a form? For after that Luke had
called him an angel, he bringeth him in immediately speaking thus:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am the God of Abraham,
etc.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some answer, As God doth sometimes
attribute and impart unto his ministers those things which are most proper to
himself, so it is no absurd or inconvenient thing, if they have his name given
them; but seeing this angel affirmeth manifestly that he is the eternal God, who
alone is, and in whom all things have their being, we must needs restrain this
title unto the essence of God; for it can by no means agree to the angels. It
might be said more fitly, that because the angel speaketh in the name of the
Lord, he taketh upon him his person, as if he declared his commandments word for
word, as out of the mouth of God, which manner of speaking is usual in the
prophets; but when Luke shall say afterwards, that this was the same angel
through whose assistance and guiding Moses delivered the people: and Paul, in
the 10th chapter of the First to the Corinthians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:47) doth affirm that Christ was that guide, there is no cause why
we should now wonder that the angel taketh to himself that which is proper to
God alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, let us, first of all, set down this for a
surety, that there was never since the beginning any communication between God
and men, save only by Christ; for we have nothing to do with God, unless the
Mediator be present to purchase his favor for us. Therefore, this place doth
plentifully prove the divinity of Christ, and teacheth that he is of the same
essence with the Father. Furthermore, he is called an angel, not only because he
had the angels always to bear him company, and to be, as it were, his
apparitors:
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F435</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but because that deliverance of the people did shadow the redemption of us all,
for whose sake Christ was to be sent of his Father, that he might take upon him
the shape of a servant together with our flesh. It is certain, indeed, that God
did never appear unto men as he is, but under some shape agreeable to their
capacity; notwithstanding, there is another reason why Christ is called by this
name, because he being appointed by the eternal counsel of God to be unto men
the minister of salvation, doth appear unto Moses to this end. Neither is that
contrary to this doctrine, which is written in the 2nd chapter to the Hebrews,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
2:16) that Christ never took the angels, but the seed of Abraham; for although
he took upon him the shape of an angel for a time, yet did he never take the
nature of angels, as we know that he was made very man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It resteth that we speak somewhat of the burning
bush. That is common, that God doth apply the signs unto the things by a certain
likelihood, and this is almost the common order and way of the sacraments.
Furthermore, this was the fittest thing that could have been shown to Moses, to
confirm his faith in the present business. He knew in what state he had left his
nation. Although there were a greater
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F436</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
number of men, yet were they not unlike to a bush. For the thicker the bush is,
and the more store of shrubs it hath,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F437</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the more subject is it to take fire, that it may burn on every side; so the
people of Israel were but a weak band, and such as was laid open to all
injuries; and this unwarlike multitude being pressed down even with their own
weight, had incensed the cruelty of Pharaoh only with the prosperous success of
increasing. Therefore, the people being oppressed with cruel tyranny, is, as it
were, a pile of wood set on fire at every corner, neither is there any thing
which keepeth it from being consumed to ashes, save this, because the Lord
sitteth in the midst thereof; and although the [an] undoubted

fire of persecution did then burn, yet because the Church of God is never free
from afflictions in the world, the continual estate thereof is after a sort
painted out in this place. For what other thing are we but fuel for fire? And
there fly abroad innumerable fire-brands of Satan continually, which set on fire
both our bodies and also our minds; but the Lord delivereth and defendeth us, by
his wonderful and singular goodness, from being consumed. Therefore, the fire
must needs burn, that it may burn us in this life; but because the Lord dwelleth
in the midst of us, he shall so preserve us that afflictions shall do us no
harm, as it is also said in the 46th Psalm,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;194605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
46:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He wondered at the
vision.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Let us know that God did use
thus to deal with our fathers, that they might assuredly know his majesty; for
he meant to make a manifest distinction between the visions which he showed, and
the juggling casts of Satan. And this certainty is more necessary, for what
credit should the oracles of God otherwise carry, wherein the covenant of
eternal life is contained? Therefore, forasmuch as this alone is the true stay
of faith, to have God to be the author thereof, that he may [he must needs]
undoubtedly declare that it is he that speaketh. Again, forasmuch as Satan
walketh about continually, and doth by many and strange shifts insinuate
himself, and hath so many ways to deceive, and especially seeing he doth pretend
the name of God craftily, we must take great heed of his mocks. We see how in
times past he deluded all nations, and [how he deludes] the Papists also. For
all the monsters of superstitions, all the dotings of errors which were in times
past, and do as yet reign in Popery, did proceed from dreams, visions, and false
revelations; yea, furthermore, even the Anabaptists have their illusions thence.
Therefore, this is the only remedy that God do distinguish by certain marks
those visions which he showeth; for then are we without danger of erring, when
he hath revealed his majesty unto us. For this cause was the mind of Moses
stricken with admiration, and then afterwards he draweth near to consider; after
that he is come nearer, the Lord toucheth him with a more lively feeling of [I
confess indeed] his presence, so that he is afraid. For I confess that there are
none of all these things which Satan cannot imitate, yet falsely like an ape.
And the Lord doth not only show himself by such signs, but helping our dullness,
he doth also open our eyes that we may not be deceived. Again, the Holy Ghost
doth imprint in our minds certain marks and tokens of God&#8217;s presence, that
there may no doubt remain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
I am the God of thy fathers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Now, we see
to what end the vision was offered to Moses; to wit, that the word of God might
have his [its] authority. For bare visions should do but little good, unless
doctrine were joined therewithal; and it is joined with them not as an inferior
part, but as the cause of all visions and the end. And whereas he calleth
himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, there is a double reason why he
calleth himself so. As the majesty of God is infinite, if we will comprehend it,
it doth rather swallow up our senses; if we endeavor to ascend unto it we vanish
away; therefore, he adorneth himself with titles under which we may comprehend
him. But we must mark that God maketh choice of such titles, as that he may by
them call us back unto his word. For he is called the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, for this cause, because he committed unto them the doctrine of salvation,
that he might thereby be known to the world. But God had respect properly unto
the present circumstance when he spake to Moses on this wise; for both this
vision, and the hope of the delivery of the people, and the commandment which he
was about to give to Moses, did depend upon the covenant which he had made in
times past with the fathers. So that the suspicion of novelty is taken away, and
the mind of Moses is lifted up to hope for redemption, which was grounded in the
whole
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F439</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
promise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, this title is as much as if God had said,
I, which have promised in times past to your fathers, that I have a care of your
safety, which have taken the kindred of Abraham to my tuition by a free
covenant, yea, which have appointed this time for an end of your bondage, I
appear now unto thee, that I may perform that which I promised, like as at this
day all the promises of God must lean and be stayed upon this foundation, that
they may be sure and certain to us, that God hath adopted us in Christ, and hath
promised that he will be our God and our Father. And Christ gathereth out of
this place by good reason that the godly live after they be dead,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402232&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew

this is requisite in relation, that the members be answerable between
themselves.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F441</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
There is also another reason to be considered, that forasmuch as God hath in his
hand both life and death, without all doubt he preserveth those alive whose
father he will be, and whom he counteth his children; therefore, though Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob died, concerning the flesh, yet do they live in spirit with
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Moses being afraid.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">This might seem to be an absurd thing, that a
voice full of consolation doth rather terrify Moses than make him glad; but it
was good for Moses to be thus terrified with the presence of God, that he might
frame himself unto the greater reverence; neither doth the voice of God alone
strike his mind, but his majesty, whereof he saw a sign in the burning bush. And
what marvel is it, if man be afraid when he seeth God? and especially let us
remember that men&#8217;s minds are by this means prepared unto fear and
reverence as in

<div><font face="Palatino">But some will say, Why dare not Moses now for fear
consider, who was not afraid to draw near before? I answer, that the nearer we
draw unto God, the more his glory doth appear, so are we the more afraid, and
that by right. And God maketh Moses afraid for none other cause, save only that
he may make him obedient unto him. This fear was a preparation not unfit for
greater boldness; and to this end tendeth that which followeth,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Put off thy shoes from thy

meant by this commendation which he giveth to the place, to lift up the mind of
Moses into heaven, that he might not think upon any earthly thing. And if so be
that Moses was to be pricked forward with so many pricks, that having forgotten
the earth, he might hearken to God, must not we have our sides even, as it were,
digged through,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F442</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
seeing we are an hundred times more slow than he? Notwithstanding, here may a
question be asked, how this place became so holy? for it was no more holy than
other places before that day. I answer, that this honor is given to the presence
of God, and not to the place, and that the holiness of the place is spoken of
for man&#8217;s sake. For if the presence of God do make the earth holy, how
much more force thereof ought men to have?
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F443</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Notwithstanding, we must also note, that the place was thus beautified only for
a time, so that God did not fix his glory there, as Jacob erected an altar to
God in Bethel, after that God had showed some token of his presence there,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;013507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
35:7.) When as his posterity did imitate the same afterward, it was such worship
as was reproved.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F444</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Finally, the place is called holy for Moses&#8217; sake only, that he may the
better address himself to fear God and to obey him. Forasmuch as God doth now
show himself unto us everywhere in Christ, and that in no obscure figures, but
in the full light and perfect truth, we must not only put off our shoes from our
feet, but strip ourselves stark-naked of ourselves.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F445</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
In seeing I have seen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God promiseth now
that he will deliver his people, that he may appoint Moses to be his minister
afresh, because the former objection was taken away by so long space of time.
For God is said to see our miseries when he hath respect to us, and is careful
for our safety; as he is said again to shut his eyes, and turn his back, when as
he seemeth to set light by our cause. In like sort is he said to come down. He
needeth not to move out of his place to help us, for his hand reacheth
throughout the heaven and earth; but this is referred unto our understanding.
For, seeing that he did not deliver his people from their affliction, he might
seem that he was afar off, and was busied about some other thing in heaven. Now
he saith that the Israelites shall perceive that he is nigh unto them. The sum
tendeth to this end, that Moses knowing the will of God, may not doubt to follow
him as a guide, and the more boldly to employ himself about the delivery of the
people, which he knew was the work of God. For we must note that he saith that
he heard the mourning of the people. For although he hath respect unto those
which are in misery and unjustly oppressed, yet when we lay our mournings and
complaints in his lap, he is especially moved to have mercy; although this word
may be taken for those blind and confused complaints which are not directed unto
God, as it is taken oftentimes elsewhere.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>35. </b>Stephen passeth over many things, because
he maketh haste unto this stun, that the Jews may understand that the fathers
were not delivered therefore, because they had deserved that with their
godliness, but that this benefit <i>was </i>bestowed upon them, being altogether
unworthy; and, secondly, that there is some more perfect thing to be hoped for
of these beginnings. When Moses, being ordained of God to be their revenger and
deliverer, was now in a readiness, they stopped the way before him; therefore
God doth deliver them now, as it were against their will. That which is added
touching miracles and wonders, serveth as well to the setting forth of the grace
of God, as to make known the calling of Moses. It is surely a strange thing,
that God doth vouchsafe to declare his power by divers wonders, for such an
unthankful people&#8217;s sake. But in the mean season, he bringeth his servant
in credit. Therefore, whereas the Jews set less by him afterward, whereas they
essay sometimes to drive him away by railing, whereas they scold sometimes,
sometimes murmur, sometimes set upon him outrageously, they bewray thereby both
their wickedness, and also their contempt of the grace of God. Their
unthankfulness and ungodliness was so increased always, that God must needs have
striven with wonderful patience with such a froward and stubborn
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A ruler and a

contrarieties
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F446</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which augment the fault. They would have obeyed Moses if a tyrant had appointed
him to be a judge, but they contemn him proudly, and refuse him disdainfully,
being appointed of God, and that to be a deliverer. Therefore, in despising him,
they were wicked; and in rejecting grace, unthankful. And whereas Moses hath
such an honorable title given him, God doth not so give and resign unto man that
honor which is due to himself, that he loseth any whit of his authority thereby.
For doubtless Moses was not called a redeemer or deliverer in any other respect
save only because he was the minister of God. And by this means the glory of the
whole work remaineth in the power of God wholly. Therefore let us learn that so
often as men have the titles which belong to God given them, God himself is not
despoiled of his honor; but because the work is done by their hands, they are by
this means commended. To this end tendeth that which Stephen saith, that this
charge was committed to Moses in the hand of the angel. For by this means Moses
is made subject to Christ, that under his conduct and direction he may obey God.
For </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is taken in this place not for ministry, but
for principality. Wherefore, God did so use the service of Moses, that the power
of Christ did surpass him, as he is even at this day the chief governor, in
accomplishing the salvation of the Church; yea, he useth the ministry of men in
that sort, that the force and effect dependeth upon him alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>37.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A Prophet shall God raise
up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Stephen endeavoreth undoubtedly to
prove by these words that Christ is the end of the law; although he doth not
express the same in plain words. And assuredly, (as we have already said,) Luke
reciteth not word for word all those things which Stephen uttered; but it is
sufficient for him to note the principal points of matters. Furthermore, we have
said before in the third chapter, that this testimony is so applied to Christ,
that notwithstanding it agreeth to the other prophets also. For after that Moses
had forbidden the people to be carried to and fro with the wicked superstitions
of the Gentiles, he showeth what ought to follow. There is no cause (saith he)
why thou shouldst desire magicians and enchanters; for God will never suffer
thee to want prophets to teach thee faithfully. And now it is certain that the
ministry of the prophets was temporal, as was also the ministry of the law;
until Christ should bring the full perfection of wisdom into the world.
Therefore Stephen&#8217;s speech tendeth to this end, that Moses doth not keep
the people fast bound to himself alone when as he setteth before them and
commendeth unto them another teacher. The prophets were indeed, interpreters of
the law and all their doctrine was, as it were, an addition or appurtenance
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F447</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of those things which were uttered by Moses; but forasmuch as this was also
certain, that Christ should bring a more perfect kind of doctrine, because he
should make an end of all the prophecies, it followeth, that he is made the
chief; and that the principal mastership (that I may so call it) is his, lest
the faith of the gospel should be doubtful. Now we know to what end Stephen
intermingled Moses&#8217; testimony, to wit, that he may prove that the Jews did
no less contemn him, (of whom they made boast with open mouth to be their only
teachers)even now when he is dead, than they did in times past, whilst he lived,
wickedly and frowardly reject him. For whosoever believeth Moses, he will not
refuse to be the disciple of Christ, whose messenger and crier he was,

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F449</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the people, who though they were provoked [stirred up] with so many benefits
of God, yet did they never cease maliciously to reject him. If they had been
disobedient and unthankful to God before, yet this so wonderful a deliverance
ought to have brought them into a better mind; but he declareth that they were
always like themselves. It was meet that so many miracles should not only have
stuck fast in their minds, but also have continued still before their eyes. But
having forgotten all, they fly back suddenly unto the superstitions of Egypt.
The memorial of their cruel servitude was yet fresh, which they had escaped by
passing over the Red Sea; and yet they prefer those tyrants by whom they were
more than cruelly handled, before their deliverer, This was, therefore, a heap
of ungodliness most desperate, that their stubbornness could not be broken or
overcome with so many benefits of God, but that they did always return unto
their nature. This doth greatly augment the greatness of the offense, where
Stephen saith that Moses was then with them in the wilderness. For besides that
there appeareth here rare goodness and long-sufferance of the Lord, in bearing
with them, they make themselves to be without all excuse, whilst that being
beset on every side with so many straits, being brought into so great distress;
having Moses to be their guide in their journey, and the faithful keeper of
their life, they fall away nevertheless treacherously from God, Finally, it
appeareth that they were like untamed beasts, whom God could not keep in
obedience with so many bands. Therefore, inasmuch as Moses left not off to
govern them even through the wilderness, under the conduct and aid of the angel,
it is an easy matter to gather by this circumstance of time, how incurable and
obstinate their frowardness was; as it was a point of monstrous rebellion, not
to be humbled with miseries,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F450</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and even with the very sight of death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whereas he saith, that Moses was with the angel and

He was present with the fathers, that he might be their guide according to the
commandment of the Lord; he was with the angel as a minister. Whereupon it
followeth that he was no private person to whom this injury was done, but it was
done to the governance of God, when the people could be kept back, with the
reverence of neither, from running headlong into wicked rebellion. We have
already spoken of the angel. But the participle
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">lalountov</font><font face="Palatino">]
or <i>which spake, </i>hath a double meaning. For it may be understood either of
the first vision, whereby Moses was called to redeem the people, or of that
speech which God had with Moses, after they were come over the Red Sea. And
because Christ declared both ways, that he was the author of their deliverance,
it is no great matter whether we choose; yea, there is no let but that it may be
extended unto both. For he which began to speak to Moses from the beginning,
that he might send him into Egypt, did continue the tenor of his speech
afterward, until the work was finished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which received lively
oracles.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Erasmus translated it <i>lively
speech; </i>but those which are expert in the Greek tongue, they shall know that
I have more truly translated the words of Stephen. For there is greater majesty
in Oracles than in Speech, I speak only of the word; for I know that whatsoever
proceedeth out of the mouth of God, the same is an oracle. Moreover, he
purchaseth authority for the doctrine of Moses in these words, because he
uttereth nothing but that which proceeded from God, Whereupon it followeth, that
they did not so much rebel against Moses as against God; whereby their
stubbornness
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F452</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
is more discovered, And this is a general way to establish doctrine, when men
teach nothing but that which is commanded them by God. For what man dare make
Moses inferior to him, who (as the Spirit affirmeth) ought only to be believed
for this cause, because he faithfully unfolded and delivered the doctrine which
he had received of God? But some men may ask this question, Why he called the
law a living speech? For this title seemeth to disagree much with the words of
Paul, where he saith that the law is the ministry of death, and that it worketh
death, and that it is the strength of sin,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:7.) If you take lively speech for that which is effectual, and
cannot be made frustrate by the contempt of men, there shall be no contrariety;
but I interpret it as spoken actively, for that which maketh to live.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F453</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For seeing that the law is the perfect rule of godly and holy life, and it
showeth the righteousness of God, it is counted, for good causes, the doctrine
of life and salvation. And to this purpose serveth that solemn protestation of
Moses, when he calleth heaven and earth to witness, that he hath set before them
the way of death and life. In which sense the Lord himself complaineth, that his
good law is broken, and his good commandments, whereof he had said, &#8220;He
which shall do these things shall live in them,&#8221; (Ezekiel 20) Therefore
the law hath life in itself. Yet if any man had liefer take <i>living </i>for
that which is full of efficacy and strength, I will not greatly stand in
contention.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And whereas it is called the ministry of death, that
is accidental to it, because of the corrupt nature of man; for it doth not
engender sin, but it findeth it in us. It offered life, but we, which are
altogether corrupt, can have nothing but death by it. Therefore, it is deadly in
respect of men alone. Though Stephen had respect unto a farther thing in this
place; for he doth not only speak of the bare commandments, but comprehendeth
all Moses&#8217; doctrine, wherein the free promises are included, and so
consequently, Christ himself, who is the only life and health of men. We must
remember with what men Stephen had to do. They were such as were preposterously
zealous of the law, who stayed only in the dead and deadly letter of the law;
and, in the mean season, they raged against Stephen, because he sought Christ in
the law, who is, indeed, the soul thereof. Therefore, by touching their perverse
ignorance glancingly, he giveth them to understand that there is some greater
and some more excellent thing hidden in the law than they have hitherto known.
For as they were carnal, and content with an outward show, they sought no
spiritual thing in it, yea, they would not so much as suffer the same to be
showed them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he might give them to
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This serveth to refute the false
accusation wherewith he was falsely burthened. For seeing he submitteth his neck
to the yoke of the law, and professeth that he is one of Moses&#8217; scholars,
he is far from discrediting him amongst others. Yea, rather he turneth back the
fault which was laid to his charge upon those which were the authors of the
slander. That was, as it were, a common reproach for all the people, because the
fathers would not obey the law. And therewithal he telleth them that Moses was
appointed to be a prophet, not only for his time, but that his authority might
be in force with the posterity, even when he was dead. For it is not meet that
the doctrine of God should be extinguished together with ministers, or that it
should be taken away. For what is more unlikely
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F454</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
than that that should die whereby we have immortality? So must we think at this
day. As the prophets and apostles spake unto the men of their time, so did they
write unto us, and (that) the force of their doctrine is continual, because it
hath rather God to be the author thereof than men. In the mean season, he
teacheth that if any reject the word appointed for them, they reject the counsel
of God.</font><br></div>

away</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>into Egypt in their hearts; not
that they desired to return thither, (bodily,) but because they returned in mind
unto those corruptions, which they ought not so much as to have remembered
without great detestation and hatred. It is true, indeed, that the Jews did once
speak of returning; but Stephen toucheth not that history now. Furthermore, he
doth rather express their stubbornness, when he saith that they were turned
away. For after that they had taken the right way, having God for their guide
and governor, they start aside suddenly, as if a stubborn unbroken horse, not
obeying his rider, should frowardly run backward.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>40.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Make us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Though the Jews be turned back
divers ways, yet Stephen maketh <i>choice </i>of one notable example above all
the rest, of their filthy and detestable treachery, to wit, when they made
themselves a calf, that they might worship it instead of God. For there can no
more filthy thing be invented
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F455</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
than this their unthankfulness. They confess that they were delivered out of
Egypt; neither do they deny that this was done by the grace of God and the
ministry of Moses; yet, notwithstanding, they reject the author of so great
goodness, together with the minister. And under what color? They pretend they
cannot tell what is become of Moses. But they know full well that he is in the
mount. They saw him with their eyes when he went up thither, until such time as
the Lord took him unto himself, by compassing him about with a cloud. Again,
they know that Moses is absent for their health&#8217;s sake<i>, </i>who had
promised that he would return, and bring unto them the law which God should
give. He bade them only be quiet a while. They raise mad uproars suddenly within
a small time, and without any cause; yet to the end they may cover their madness
with the color of some reason, they will have gods present with them, as if God
had showed unto them no token of his presence hitherto; but his glory did appear
daily in the cloud and pillar of fire. Therefore we see what haste they make to
commit idolatry through wicked contempt of God, that I may, in the mean season,
omit to declare how filthy and wicked their unthankfulness was, in that they had
so soon forgotten those miracles which they ought to have remembered even until
the end of the world. Therefore, by this one backsliding, it appeareth
sufficiently what a stubborn and rebellious people they were.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, it was more expedient for the cause which
Stephen had in hand, to recite this history of their rebellion than the other.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F456</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For the people doth quite overthrow the worship of God; they refuse the doctrine
of the law; they bring in a strange and profane religion. And this is a notable
place, because it pointeth out the fountain from which all manner of
superstitions did flow since the beginning, and especially what was the first
beginning of making idols; to wit, because man, which is carnal, will,
notwithstanding, have God present with him, according to the capacity of his
flesh. This is the cause why men were so bold in all ages to make idols.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F457</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And God doth, indeed, apply
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F458</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
himself to our rudeness thus far, that he showeth himself visible, after a sort,
under figures; for there were many signs under the law to testify his presence,
And he cometh down unto us, even at this day, by baptism and the supper, and
also by the external preaching of the word. But men offend two manner of ways in
this; for, first, being not content with the means which God hath appointed,
they boldly get to themselves new means. This is no small fault, because their
fingers itch always to have new inventions without keeping any mean, and so they
are not afraid to pass the bounds which God hath appointed them. But there can
be no true image of God, save that which he appointed. Therefore, what images
soever are reigned and invented by man besides his word, they are false and
corrupt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is also another vice no less intolerable, that
as man&#8217;s mind conceiveth nothing of God but that which is gross and
earthly, so it translateth all tokens of God&#8217;s presence unto the same
grossness. Neither doth man delight in those idols only which he himself hath
made, but also doth corrupt whatsoever God hath ordained, by wresting it unto a
contrary end. God cometh down unto us, indeed, as I have already said, but to
this end, that he may lift us up into heaven with him. But we, because we are
wholly set upon the earth, will, in like sort, have him in the earth. By this
means is his heavenly glory deformed, and that fulfilled altogether which the
Israelites say here, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make us
gods.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For whosoever he be that doth not
worship God spiritually, he maketh unto himself a new god; and yet if ye
thoroughly weigh all things, the Israelites will not have a god made of set
purpose by them, but they think rather that they have the true and eternal God
under the shape of the golden calf. For they are ready to offer the appointed
sacrifice, and they approve that with their consent which Aaron saith, that
those are the gods by whom they were brought out of Egypt. But God pusseth not
for those frivolous imaginations; but he complaineth that men put strange gods
in his place, so soon as they depart even a very little from his
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>41.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And they made a calf.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We may easily
gather by that which goeth before, why they were more delighted in that figure
than in any other. For although Egypt did swarm with innumerable idols, yet it
is well known that they made the greatest account of an ox. And whence is it
that they are so desirous to have an idol, save only because they were turned
back into Egypt, as Stephen hath already said? We must note the speech when he
saith that they offered sacrifice to the idol. Aaron commandeth the people to
assemble themselves together to worship God; they come all together. Therefore
they testify that they mean nothing less [any thing rather] than to defraud God
of his worship, howsoever they translate the same unto the calf; yea, rather,
they are determined to worship God in the image of the calf. But because they
forsook the true God, by making an idol, whatsoever followeth afterward it is
judged to be given to the idol, because God refuseth all wicked worshipping. For
it is not meet to account that as bestowed upon him which he hath not commanded;
and because he forbids them expressly to erect any visible image unto him, that
is mere sacrilege whatsoever is done afterward in honor
thereof.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They rejoiced over the
works.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This speech is taken out of
Isaiah, yet, out of the prophets, who, in like sort, upbraid unto the Jews that
they were delighted in their own inventions. And surely it is wonderful madness,
when men arrogate unto themselves anything in God&#8217;s matters. I take this
rejoicing to be that solemn dancing whereof Moses speaketh, in the thirty-second
chapter of Exodus. Yet Stephen toucheth a common vice, wherewith idolaters are
infected. For although it be altogether unlawful for men to attempt anything in
religion which God hath not appointed, yet do they invent everything
unadvisedly, and setting light by the Word of God, they make choice of the works
of their own hands; but Stephen showeth that while they take such pleasure in
this liberty, they displease God so much the more. But if we will have God to
allow our worship, we must abstain from the works of our hands, that is, from
our own inventions; for all that which men invent of themselves is nothing else
but sacrilegious profanation. The idol is properly so called reproachfully, as
it were a thing nothing worth, because no reason doth suffer man to make God.

<div><font face="Palatino">Stephen will here declare that the Jews did never
make an end of sinning, but that they wandered farther in their froward errors;
so that that first fall of theirs was unto them as it were an entrance into a
labyrinth. And this doth he assign unto the just vengeance of God, that after
that time their madness grew so, that they gat for one idol infinity. This
example teacheth us to be careful to follow the rule which God hath set down;
because, so soon as we are turned even but a little aside from the same, we must
needs be carried to and fro with divers dotings, we must needs be entangled in
many superstitions, and be utterly drowned in the huge sink of errors; which
punishment God in justice layeth upon men which refuse to obey his word.
Therefore Stephen saith that God was turned away; which word imported as much as
if he should say, that he turned his back. For he had fastened his eyes after a
sort upon the people, when he showed his singular care which he took in
governing them; being offended with their falling away, now he turneth his face
another way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may also hereby gather that we can no otherwise
follow the right way, save only when the Lord watcheth over us to govern us; but
so soon as his face is turned away, we run by and by into errors. The Israelites
were forsaken of God even then when they made the calf; but Stephen meant to
express the greatness of the punishment, as if he should have said, that they
were altogether cast off into a reprobate sense then; as Paul also teacheth,
that those which gave not glory to God when he had showed himself unto them,
were, by the just judgment of God, given up unto blindness and blockishness, and
unto shameful lusts,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28.) Hereby it came to pass, that after that religion began to be corrupt,
innumerable abominations succeeded a few superstitions, and gross monsters of
idolatry came in place of light corruptions. For because men neglected the light
which was set before them, they became altogether blockish by the just judgment
of God, so that they had no more judgment than brute beasts. Idolatry surely is
very fertile, that of one reigned god there should by and by come an hundred,
that a thousand superstitions should flow from one. But this so great madness of
men springeth hence, because God revengeth himself by delivering them to Satan;
because, after he hath once in hand to govern us, there is no change in his
part, but he is plucked away

from us by our rash lightness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have ye offered unto me slain

taken out of the fifth chapter of Amos,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;300525&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Amos
5:25.) The speech which Stephen useth showeth that all the prophecies were
gathered into one body; and Amos addeth, (after that he had inveighed against
the idolatry and sundry sins of the people,) that this is no new evil, that the
Jews are rebellious against God, because their fathers had fallen away from true
godliness even in the wilderness. Furthermore, he denieth that they offered
slain beasts to him, not because there were there no sacrifices at all, but
because God refused their corrupt worship; like as he reproveth and chideth the
people in Isaiah, because they honored him with no sacrifice,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thou,&#8221; (saith he,) &#8220;O
Jacob, hast not called upon me, neither hast thou honored me with thy
sacrifices, neither have I made thee serve in offering or incense. Thou hast not
bought for me calamus, neither hast thou filled me with fatness. But thou hast
been burdenous [burdensome] unto me in thy sins, and hast caused me to serve in
thine iniquities,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;234322&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah

<div><font face="Palatino">Assuredly the Jews did all these things daily, but

Moloch.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Some take the copulative for the
adversative [particle,] as if he should say, Yea, rather, ye worshipped the
idol. It may be resolved also into the conjunction causal, thus, You did not
offer sacrifices to me, because ye erected a tabernacle to Moloch. But I expound
it somewhat otherwise, to wit, that God doth first accuse the fathers for the
more vehemency; and then afterwards he addeth, that their posterity did increase
the superstitions, because they gat to themselves new and diverse idols; as if
the prophet had spoken thus in the person of God, If I shall rip up from the
beginning, (O house of Jacob,) how your kindred hath behaved itself toward me;
your fathers began to overthrow and corrupt, even in the wilderness, that
worship which I had commanded; but you have far passed their ungodliness, for
you have brought in an infinite company of gods. And this order is fitter for
Stephen&#8217;s purpose; for he intendeth to prove, (as we have already said,)
that after the Israelites felt away unto strange and bastardly rites, they never
made an end of sinning, but being stricken with blindness, they polluted
themselves every now and then with new idolatries, until they were come even
unto the last end
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F463</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of impiety. Therefore, Stephen confirmeth this sentence fitly with the testimony
of the prophet, that the Jews, descending of wicked and rebellious fathers, had
never ceased to wax worse and worse. And although the prophet&#8217;s words be
somewhat unlike to these, yet is the sense all one. It is to be thought that
Stephen, who had to deal with the Jews, did repeat word for word in their tongue
that which is in the prophet; Luke, who wrote in Greek, did follow the Greek
interpreter. The prophet saith, Ye honored Succoth your king, and Chiun your
image, the star of your gods. The Greek interpreter made a noun common of a noun
proper, because of the alliance
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F464</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the word <i>Succoth, </i>which
signifieth</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> a
tabernacle.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Furthermore, I cannot tell
whence he fetcheth that his Remphan, unless it were because that word was more
used in that time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And figures which ye
made.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The word image, which is in the
prophet, doth of itself signify no evil thing. Moreover, the word

is taken amongst the Grecians in good part.For the ceremonies which God
appointed are called
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tupoi</font><font face="Palatino">];
notwithstanding the prophet condemneth expressly the figures [types] which the
Jews had made. Why so? Because God will not be worshipped under a visible and
external form. If any man object that he speaketh in this place of stars; that
is true, I confess; but I stand only upon this, that although the prophet doth
give their idols some honest name, yet doth he sharply condemn their corrupt
worship; whereby the foolish and childish caviling of the Papists is refuted.
Because they deny that those images which they worship are idols, they say, that
that mad worship of theirs is,
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eikonodouleia</font><font face="Palatino">],
or serving of images, and not
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eidolodouleia</font><font face="Palatino">],<i>
</i>or worshipping of idols. Seeing they mock God sophistically, there is no man
that is endued even but with common understanding, which doth not see that they
are more than ridiculous even in such toys. For although I move no question
about the word, it is certain that the word
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tupov</font><font face="Palatino">];
is more honorable than
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eikwn</font><font face="Palatino">].
But those same
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tupoi</font><font face="Palatino">],<i>
</i>or figures, are simply condemned in this place, which men make to
themselves, not only [</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">prov thn
latreian</font><font face="Palatino">], or that they may worship them, but
[</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">prov thn
proskunhsin</font><font face="Palatino">], that is, that they may give them even
any reverence at all. Therefore that filthy distinction falleth flat to the
ground, wherein the Papists think they have a crafty starting-hole.

that the word Babylon cropt [crept] in here through error; though in the sum of
the thing there be no great difference. The Israelites were to be carried away
to Babylon; but because they thought that they had a sure and strong fortress in
the kingdom of Syria, whose head Damascus was, therefore the prophet saith that
Damascus shall not help them, but that God shall drive them farther; as if he
should say, So long as you have Damascus set against your enemies, you think
that you are well fenced; but God shall carry you away beyond it; even into

For he saith that God had commanded how he would be worshipped by them.
Whereupon it followeth that they were entangled in so many errors, because they
would not follow that form which God had appointed. Although he girdeth
[reprehendeth] them for two causes: Because, being not content with that rule
alone which God had prescribed, they invented to themselves strange worships;
secondly, because they had no respect unto the right end of the temple, and of
the ceremonies which God had appointed. For whereas they ought to have been unto
them exercises of the spiritual worship, they apprehended nothing but that which

reproved for the preposterous abuse of the true and sincere worship; because
they followed the flesh instead of the Spirit. They had, saith he, <i>the
tabernacle of witness. </i>Therefore it was their own wantonness and rashness
only which caused them to sin. For seeing they were well taught what was the
right way and order of worshipping God, all cloak and color of ignorance was
taken away.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Which thing is worth the noting. For seeing God doth
after a sort bridle us, when he maketh his will known unto us, if after we have

the Holy Spirit doth distinguish all bastardly and corrupt worshippings from the
true and sincere worship. Yea, (to speak more briefly,) the first difference
between true worship and idolatry is this: when the godly take in hand nothing
but that which is agreeable to the Word of God, but the other think all that
lawful which pleaseth themselves, and so they count their own will a law;
whereas God alloweth nothing but that which he himself hath appointed. To this

cause why it is so named. For in Moses this is oftentimes repeated, &#8220;I
will meet with you there.&#8221; Therefore the tabernacle was consecrated by the
covenant and the word of the Lord, and his voice was heard there continually,
that it might be distinguished from all profane places.</font><br></div>

point which I have touched; for it may be that he which shall use the ceremonies

careth not for external rites, save only inasmuch as they are of the heavenly
truth; therefore God would have the tabernacle to be made like unto the heavenly
figure,

worship which God commanded the Jews is spiritual, and that they, according to
their carnal blockishness, were evil and false interpreters; therefore, as we
have said, that God alloweth no worship but that which is grounded in his
commandment, so we are taught here that it is requisite in the right use of the
commandment, that the spiritual truth be present; which thing being granted, it
was the like question which we said did consist principally in this issue,
whether the shadows ought to yield to the body or not. Whereas Moses is said to
have seen a form or figure, the Spirit of God signifieth thereby that it is
unlawful for us to invent forms at our pleasure; but that all our senses must be
set upon that form which God showeth, that all our religion may be formed
according to it. The word <i>figure </i>signifieth here, in this place, the
principal pattern,

carried the same whithersoever they went, yet could they not be kept within the

to wit, declaring that God dwelt amidst them, from whom they were so far
distant, and whom <i>they </i>did drive out of that inheritance which <i>he

bring it into the thrashing-floor of Araunah until the Lord had declared, by an
angel from heaven, that that was the place which he had chosen,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;102416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 24:16.) And Stephen counteth this a singular benefit of God, not without
great cause, that the place was showed to David wherein the Israelites should
hereafter worship God; as in the Psalm he rejoiceth as over some notable thing:
&#8220;I was glad when they said unto me, We will go into the house of the Lord;
our feet shall be stable in thy courts, O Jerusalem,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:3) The priesthood was coupled with the kingdom; therefore, the stability of
the kingdom is showed in the resting of the ark; therefore it is said that he
desired this so earnestly that he bound himself with a solemn vow, that he would
not come within his house, that his eyes should enjoy no sleep, nor his temples
any rest, until he should know a place for the Lord, and a tabernacle for the
God of Jacob. Furthermore, the place was showed to David, but it was granted to
Solomon to build the temple,

in this place, as if he did not regard the nature of God in building the temple;
yet did he attempt that work not without the commandment of God. There was also
a promise added, wherein God did testify that he would be present with his
people there. I answer, that when Stephen denieth that God dwelleth in temples
made with hands, that is not referred unto Solomon, who knew full well that God
was to be sought in heaven, and that men&#8217;s minds must be lifted up thither
by faith; which thing he uttered also in that solemn prayer which he
made:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The heaven of
heavens do not contain thee,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and

Kings 8:23;)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but he reproveth the blockishness of the people,
which abused the temple, as if it had had God tied to it; which appeareth more
plainly by the testimony of Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
6:6,) which he citeth also; God, saith he, would have Solomon to build him a
temple; but they were greatly deceived who thought that he was, as it were,
included in such a building; as he complaineth by his prophet that the people do
him injury, when as they imagine that he is tied to a place; but the prophet
doth not for that cause only inveigh against the Jews, because they worshipped
God superstitiously, thinking that his power was tied to the temple, but because
they did esteem him according to their own affection, and, therefore, after that
they had ended
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F473</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
their sacrifices and external pomp, they imagined that he was pleased, and that
they had brought him indebted to them. This was almost a common error in all
ages; because men thought that cold ceremonies were sufficient enough for the
worship of God. The reason is, because forasmuch as they are carnal, and wholly
set upon the world, they imagine that God is like to them; therefore, to the end
God may take from them this blockishness, he saith that he<i> filleth all
things.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>49.</b> For whereas he saith, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heaven is his seat, and the earth
his footstool,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>it must not be so
understood as if he had a body, or could be divided into parts, after the manner
of men; but because he is infinity, therefore he saith that he cannot be
comprehended within any spaces of place; therefore, those men are deceived who
esteem God or his worship according to their own nature; and because the prophet
had to deal with hypocrites, he doth not only dispute about the essence of God,
but also teacheth generally, that he is far unlike to men, and that he is not
moved with the vain pomp of this world as they are. Here ariseth that question
also, why the prophet saith that the Lord hath no place of rest in the world,
whereas, notwithstanding, the Spirit affirmeth the contrary elsewhere,
&#8220;This is my rest for ever,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
132:14.) Moreover, Isaiah doth adorn the Church with this self-same title, that
it is the glorious rest of God, alluding unto the temple, I answer, that when
God appointed signs of his presence ill the temple, and sacrifices in times
past, he did not this to the end he might settle and fasten himself and his
power there; therefore, the Israelites did wickedly, who, setting their minds
wholly upon the signs, did forge to themselves an earthly God. They dealt also
ungodly, who under this color took to themselves liberty to sin, as if they
could readily and easily pacify God with bare ceremonies. Thus doth the world
use to mock God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When God doth declare, by the external rites, that he
will be present with his, that he may dwell in the midst of them, he commandeth
them to lift up their minds, that they may seek him spiritually. Hypocrites,
which are entangled in the world, will rather pluck God out of heaven; and
whereas they have nothing but vain and bare figures, they are puffed up with
such foolish confidence, that they pamper themselves in their sins carelessly,
so, at this day, the Papists include Christ in the bread and wine in their
imagination; that done, so soon as they have worshipped their idol with foolish
worship, they vaunt and crack as if they were as holy as angels. We must
diligently note these two vices, that men do superstitiously forge to themselves
a carnal and worldly God which doth so come down unto them, that they remain
still having their minds set upon the earth, and that they rise not up in mind
to heaven. Again, they dream that God is pacified with frivolous obedience;
hereby it cometh to pass, that they are besotted in the visible signs; and,
secondly, that
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F474</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they go about to bring God indebted to them after a childish manner, and with
things which be nothing worth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we understand in what sense the prophet saith
that God hath no place of rest in the world. He would, indeed, that the temple
should have been a sign and pledge of his presence, yet only to the godly, which
did ascend into heaven in heart, which did worship him spiritually with pure
faith; but he hath no place of rest with the superstitious, who, through their
foolish inventions, tie him unto the elements of the world, or do erect unto him
an earthly worship; neither yet with hypocrites, who are puffed up with drunken
confidence, as if they had done their duty towards God well, after that they
have played in their toys. In sum, the promise received by faith doth cause God
to hear us in his temple, as if he were present to show forth his power in the
sacraments; but unless we rise up unto him by faith, we shall have no presence
of his. Hereby we may easily gather, that when he dwelleth amidst those that be
his, he is neither tied to the earth, neither comprehended in any place, because
they seek him spiritually in heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>50.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Hath not mine hand?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The prophet telleth
the people in these words, that God hath no need either of gold, either of
precious furniture of the temple, either of the sacrifices; whereupon it
followeth that his true worship is not contained in ceremonies. For he desireth
none of all these things which we offer unto him, for his own sake, but only
that he may exercise us in the study of godliness; which argument is handled
more at large, Psalm 1. For although this be a shameful foolishness to go about
to feed God with sacrifices, yet unless hypocrites were drowned in the same,
they would make no such account of toys, because all that is unsavory before God
which dissenteth from the spiritual worship; therefore, let us know that God
seeketh us and not ours, which we have only at pleasure; and hereby it appeareth
also what great difference there is between true religion and the carnal
inventions of men.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>51.</b> Forasmuch as Stephen doth not expressly
answer the points of the accusation, I am of their mind who think that he would
have said more, if his oration had not been broken off with some uproar. For we
know what a session of judges he had; therefore, no marvel if they enforced him
to hold his peace with noise and outcries. And we see, also, that he did use
long insinuation of set purpose, that he might tame and appease them who were
like brute beasts most cruel; but it is likely that their madness was then
incensed, when he proved that they had most wickedly corrupted the law, that the
temple was polluted with their superstitions, and that there is nothing sincere
amongst them; because, whilst they did stick in bare figures, they did not
worship God spiritually, because they did not refer the ceremonies unto the
heavenly figure; but though Stephen did not enter the cause straightway, but
essayed to make their fierce minds somewhat more gentle by little and little,
yet did he reason very fitly, to purge himself of the crime laid to his
charge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These two things, as we have said, were the principal
points of the question, that Stephen had blasphemed God and his temple; that he
went about to disannul the law. That Stephen might clear himself of both these
false slanders, he began at the calling of Abraham, and declareth that the Jews
excelled the Gentiles, not of their own nature, not by any right of their own,
not by any merits of works, but by a free privilege, because God had adopted
them in the person of Abraham. This is also very pertinent to the cause, that
the covenant of salvation was made with Abraham before any temple or ceremonies
were, yea, before circumcision was appointed. Of which things the Jews did so
boast, that they said there was no worship of God without them, neither any
holiness. After that he set down how wonderful and manifold the goodness of God
was towards Abraham&#8217;s stock, and again how wickedly and frowardly they had
refused, so much as in them lay, the grace of God; whereby it appeareth that it
cannot be ascribed to their own merits that they are counted God&#8217;s people,
but because God did choose them of his own accord, being unworthy, and did not
cease to do them good, though they were most unthankful. Their lofty and proud
spirits might by this means have been subdued, tamed, and humbled, that being
emptied of that wind of foolish glory they might come unto the Mediator.
Thirdly, he declared that the Angel was the governor and chief, in giving the
law and delivering the people, and that Moses did so serve in his function, that
he taught that there should come other prophets hereafter, who should,
notwithstanding, have one which should be the chief of them, that he might make
an end of all prophecies, and that he might bring the perfect accomplishment of
them all. Whereby it is gathered that those are nothing less than Moses&#8217;
disciples, who reject that kind of doctrine which was promised and commended in
the law, together with the author thereof.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Last of all, he showeth that all the old worship
which was prescribed by Moses is not to be esteemed of itself, but that it ought
rather to be referred to another end, because it was made according to the
heavenly pattern; and that the Jews have always been wicked interpreters of the
law, because they conceived nothing but that which was earthly. Hereby is it
proved that there is no injury done to the temple and the law when Christ is
made, as it were, the end and truth of both, But because the state of the cause
did consist chiefly in this, that the worship of God doth not properly consist
in sacrifices and other things, and that all ceremonies did nothing else but
shadow Christ, Stephen was purposed to stand upon this point if the Jews would
have permitted him; but because, when he was come to the pith of the matter,
they cannot abide to hear any more, (they were so incensed with fury,) the
application of those things which he had said, unto this cause which he had in
hand, is wanting. And he is enforced to use a sharp reprehension for a
conclusion, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye of an hard
neck,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>saith he,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;023209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
32:9; 33:3,5.) We see how soon he is offended with them with an holy zeal, but
because he saw that he spake many things to small end, especially before deaf
men, he breaketh off his doctrine. This is a metaphor taken from horses or oxen,
which Moses useth often, when he will say that his people is a rebellious
people, and disobedient to God, and also unruly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The upbraiding which followeth was of greater force
with them. Circumcision was unto them a vail and covering to cover all vices.
Therefore, when he calleth them uncircumcised in heart, he doth not only mean
that they are rebellious against God and stubborn, but that they were found
treacherous and covenant-breakers, even in that sign whereof they did so greatly
boast; and so he turneth that back most fitly to their shame, whereof they made
boast to their glory. For this is all one, as if he should have said that they
had broken the covenant of the Lord, so that their circumcision was void and
profane. This speech is taken out of the law and the prophets. For as God hath
appointed the sign, so he would have the Jews know to what end they were
circumcised; to wit, that they might circumcise their hearts and all their
corrupt affections to the Lord, as we read, &#8220;And now circumcise your
hearts to the Lord,&#8221; Wherefore, the letter of circumcision, as Paul
calleth it, is a vain visor with God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:28.) So, forasmuch as at this day the spiritual washing is the truth of our
baptism, it is to be feared, lest that may well be objected to us, that we are
not partakers of baptism, because our souls and flesh are polluted with
filthiness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have always
resisted.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>At the first Stephen
vouchsafed to call these men fathers and brethren, against whom he inveigheth
thus sharply, Therefore, so long as there remained any hope that they might be
made more gentle, he dealt not only friendly with them, but he spake honorably
unto them. Now, so soon as he espieth their desperate stubbornness, he doth not
only take from them all honor, but lest he should have any fellowship with them,
he speaketh unto them as unto men of another kindred. You, saith he, are like to
your fathers, who have always rebelled against the Spirit of God. But he himself
came of the same fathers; and yet that he may couple himself to Christ, he
forgetteth his kindred, inasmuch as it was wicked. And yet for all this, he
bindeth them not all in one bundle, as they say, but he speaketh unto the
multitude.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And those are said to resist the Spirit who reject
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F475</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
him when he speaketh in the prophets. Neither doth he speak in this place of
secret revelations, wherewith God inspireth every one, but of the external
ministry; which we must note diligently. He purposeth to take from the Jews all
color of excuse; and, therefore, he upbraideth unto them, that they had
purposely, and not of ignorance, resisted God. Whereby it appeareth what great
account the Lord maketh of his word, and how reverently he will have us to
receive the same. Therefore, lest, like giants, we make war against God, let us
learn to hearken to the ministers by whose mouth he teacheth
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>52.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Which of the prophets?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Forasmuch as they
ought not to bear their fathers&#8217; fault, Stephen seemeth to deal unjustly,
in that he reckoneth this amongst their faults unto whom he speaketh; but he had
just causes so to do. First, because they did vaunt that they were
Abraham&#8217;s holy progeny, it was worth the labor to show unto them how great
vanity that was, as if Stephen should say, that there is no cause why they
should vaunt of their stock, forasmuch as they come of those who were wicked
murderers of the prophets. So that he toucheth that glancingly which is more
plainly set down by the prophets, that they are not the children of prophets,
but a degenerate and bastardly issue, the seed of Canaan, etc. Which thing we
may at this day object to the Papists, when as they so highly extol their
fathers. Furthermore, this serveth to amplify withal, whereas he saith that it
is no new thing for them to resist the truth, but that they have this
wickedness, as it were, by inheritance from their fathers. Furthermore, it was
requisite for Stephen by this means to pluck from their faces the visor of the
Church, wherewith they burdened him.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F476</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This was an unmeet prejudice against the doctrine of the gospel, in that they
boasted that they are the Church of God, and did challenge this title
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F477</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
by long succession. Therefore, Stephen preventeth them on the contrary, and
proveth that their fathers did, no less than they, rage against the prophets,
through wicked contempt and hatred of sound doctrine. Lastly, this is the
continual custom of the Scripture to gather the fathers and children together
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F478</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
under the same guiltiness, seeing they pollute themselves with the same
offenses, and that famous sentence of Christ answereth thereto, &#8220;Fulfill
the measure of your fathers, until the just blood come upon you, from Abel unto
Zacharias.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who have
foretold.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Hereby we gather that this was
the drift of all the prophets, to direct their nation unto Christ, as he is the
end of the law,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:4.) It were too long to gather all the prophecies wherein the coming of
Christ was foretold. Let it suffice to know this generally, that it was the
common office of all the prophets to promise salvation by the grace of Christ.
Christ is called in this place the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Just,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>not only to note his innocency, but of the effect, because it is proper to
him to appoint justice in the world. And even in this place doth Stephen prove
that the Jews were altogether unworthy of the benefit of redemption, because the
fathers did not only refuse that in times past, which was witnessed unto them by
the prophets, but they did also cruelly murder the messengers of grace, and
their children endeavored to extinguish the author of righteousness and
salvation which was offered unto them. By which comparison Christ teacheth that
the wicked conspiracy of his enemies was an heap of all
iniquities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>53.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Who have received the law.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They called
that fury wherewith they raged against Stephen zeal of the law, as if he had
been a forsaker of the law, and a revolt
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F479</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and had enforced others to fall away in like sort. Although he was determined to
clear himself of this false accusation, yet he did not go through with his
answer. For he could not be heard, and it was to no end to speak to deaf men.
Therefore, he is content, at a word, to take from them their false color and
pretense. It is evident, saith he, that you lie, when you pretend the zeal of
the law, which you transgress and break without ceasing; and as he objected unto
them in the words next going before, the treacherous murder of the Just, so now
he upbraideth unto them their revolting from the law. Some man will say that
Stephen&#8217;s cause is no whit bettered hereby, because the Jews break the
law. But as we have already said, Stephen doth not so chide them, as if his
defense did principally consist in this issue, but that they may not flatter
themselves in their false boasting. For hypocrites must be handled thus, who
will, notwithstanding, seem to be most earnest defenders of God&#8217;s glory,
though indeed they condemn him carelessly. And here is also a fit antistrophe,
because they made semblance that they received the law which was committed to
them, which was, notwithstanding, reproachfully despised by
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the dispositions of
angels</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is word for word,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>into the
dispositions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but it is all one.
Furthermore, we need not seek any other interpreter of this saying than Paul,
who saith that the law was disposed or ordained by angels,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:16;) for he useth the participle there whereof this noun is derived. And his
meaning is, that the angels were the messengers of God, and his witnesses in
publishing the law, that the authority thereof might be firm and
stable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, forasmuch as God did call the angels to
be, as it were, solemn witnesses when he gave the Jews his law, the same angels
shall be witnesses of their unfaithfulness.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F480</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And to this end doth Stephen make mention of the angels, that he may accuse the
Jews in presence of them, and prove them guilty, because they have transgressed
the law. Hereby we may gather what shall become of the despisers of the gospel,
which doth so far excel the law, that it doth, after a sort, darken the glory
thereof, as Paul teacheth, (2 Corinthians 3.)</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F482</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but are faint-hearted through fear of danger. But as for us, howsoever we have
no such success as we could wish, let us know that courage in defending the
doctrine of godliness is a sweet-smelling sacrifice to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>55.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Forasmuch as he was
full.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We cannot almost express into what
straits the servant of Christ was brought, when he saw himself beset round with
raging enemies; the goodness of his cause was oppressed, partly with false
accusations and malice, partly with violence and outrageous outcries; he was
environed with stern countenances on every side; he himself was haled unto a
cruel and horrible kind of death; he could espy succor and ease no where.
Therefore, being thus destitute of man&#8217;s help, he turneth himself toward
God. We must first note this, that Stephen did look unto God, who is the judge
of life and death, (turning his eyes from beholding the world,) when he was
brought into extreme despair of all things, whilst that there is nothing but
death before his eyes. This done, we must also add this, that his expectation
was not in vain, because Christ appeared to him by and by. Although Luke doth
signify, that he was now armed with such power of the Spirit as could not be
overcome, so that nothing could hinder him from beholding the heavens; therefore
Stephen looketh up toward heaven, that he may gather courage by beholding
Christ; that dying he may triumph gloriously, having overcome death. But as for
us, it is no marvel if Christ do not show himself to us, because we are so set
and tied upon the earth. Hereby it cometh to pass, that our hearts fail us at
every light rumor of danger, and even at the falling of a leaf. And that for
good causes; for where is our strength but in Christ? But we pass over the
heavens, as if we had no help any where else, save only in the world,
Furthermore, this vice can be redressed by no other means than if God lift us up
by his Spirit, being naturally set upon the earth. Therefore, Luke assigneth
this cause, why Stephen looked up steadfastly toward heaven, because he was full
of the Spirit. We must also ascend into heaven, having this Spirit to be our
director and guide, so often as we are oppressed with troubles. And, surely,
until such time as he illuminate us, our eyes are not so quick of sight, that
they can come unto heaven. Yea, the eyes of the flesh are so dull, that they
cannot ascend into heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He saw the glory of
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke signifieth, as I have said,
that Christ appeared forthwith to Stephen so soon as he lifted up his eyes
towards heaven. But he telleth us before, that he had other eyes given him than
the fleshly eyes, seeing that with the same
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F483</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he flieth up unto the glory of God. Whence we must gather a general comfort,
that God will be no less present with us, if, forsaking the world, all our
senses strive to come to him; not that he appeareth unto us by any external
vision, as he did to Stephen, but he will so reveal himself unto us within, that
we may indeed feel his presence. And this manner of seeing ought to be
sufficient for us, when God doth not only, by his power and grace, declare that
he is nigh at hand, but doth also prove that he dwelleth in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>56.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I see the
heavens.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God meant not only privately to
provide for his servant, but also to wring and torment his enemies; as Stephen
doth courageously triumph over them, when he affirmeth plainly that he saw a
miracle. And here may a question be moved, how the heavens were opened? For mine
own part, I think that there was nothing changed in the nature of the heavens;
but that Stephen had new quickness of sight granted him, which pierced through
all lets, even unto the invisible glory of the kingdom of heaven. For admit we
grant that there was some division or parting
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F484</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
made in heaven, yet man&#8217;s eye could never reach so far. Again, Stephen
alone did see the glory of God. For that spectacle was not only hid from the
wicked, who stood in the same place, but they were also so blinded within
themselves, that they did not see the manifest truth.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F485</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore, he saith that the heavens are opened to him in this respect, because
nothing keepeth him from beholding the glory of God. Whereupon it followeth that
the miracle was not wrought in heaven, but in his eyes. Wherefore, there is no
cause why we should dispute long about any natural vision; because it is certain
that Christ appeared unto him not after some natural manner, but after a new and
singular sort. And I pray you of what color was the glory of God, that it could
be seen naturally with the eyes of the flesh? Therefore, we must imagine nothing
in this vision but that which is divine. Moreover, this is worth the noting,
that the glory of God appeared not unto Stephen wholly as it was, but according
to man&#8217;s capacity. For that infiniteness cannot be comprehended with the
measure of any creature.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Son of man
standing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He seeth Christ reigning in
that flesh wherein he was abased; so that in very deed the victory did consist
in this one thing. Therefore, it is not superfluous in that Christ appeareth
unto him, and for this cause doth he also call him the Son of man, as if he
should say, I see that man whom ye thought ye had quite extinguished by death
enjoying the government of heaven; therefore, gnash with your teeth as much as
you list: there is no cause why I should fear to fight for him even unto blood,
who shall not only defend his own cause, but my salvation also. Notwithstanding,
here may a question be moved, why he saw him standing, who is said elsewhere to
sit? Augustine, as he is sometimes more subtle than needs, saith, &#8220;that he
sitteth as a judge, that he stood then as an advocate.&#8221; For mine own part,
I think that though these speeches be diverse, yet they signify both one thing.
For neither sitting, nor yet standing, noteth out how the body of Christ was
framed; but this is referred unto his power and kingdom. For where shall we
erect him a throne, that he may sit at the right hand of God the Father, seeing
God doth fill all things in such sort, that we ought to imagine no place for his
right hand?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, the whole text is a metaphor, when Christ
is said to sit or stand at the right hand of God the Father, and the plain
meaning is this, that Christ hath all power given him, that he may reign in his
Father&#8217;s stead in that flesh wherein he was humbled, and that he may be
next him. And although this power be spread abroad through heaven and earth, yet
some men imagine amiss that Christ in every where in his human nature. For,
though he be contained in a certain place, yet that hindereth no whit but that
he may and doth show forth his power throughout all the world. Therefore, if we
be desirous to feel him present by the working of his grace, we must seek him in
heaven; as he revealed himself unto Stephen there. Also, some men do affirm
ridiculously out of this place, that he drew near unto Stephen that he might see
him.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F486</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For we have already said, that Stephen&#8217;s eyes were so lifted up by the
power of the Spirit,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F487</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that no distance of place could hinder the same. I confess, indeed, that
speaking properly, that is, philosophically, there is no place above the
heavens. But this is sufficient for me, that it is perverse doting to place
Christ any where else save only in heaven, and above the elements of the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>57.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Crying with a loud
voice.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This was either a vain show of
zeal, as hypocrites are almost always pricked forward with ambition to break out
into immoderate heat; as Caiaphas when he heard Christ say thus, After this ye
shall see the Son of man, etc., did rent his clothes in token of indignation, as
if it were intolerable blasphemy; or else certainly the preaching of the glory
of Christ was unto them such a torment, that they must needs burst through
madness. And I am rather of this mind; for Luke saith afterward, that they were
carried violently, as those men which have no hold of themselves use to leap out
immoderately.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>58.</b> <i>They stoned. </i>God had appointed this
kind of punishment in the law for false prophets, as it is written in the 13th
chapter of Deuteronomy; but God doth also define there who ought to be reckoned
in that number; to wit, he which doth attempt to bring the people unto strange
gods; therefore the stoning of Stephen was both unjust and also wicked, because
he was unjustly condemned; so that the martyrs of Christ must suffer like
punishment with the wicked. It is the cause alone which maketh the difference;
but this difference is so highly esteemed before God and his angels, that the
rebukes of the martyrs
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F489</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
do far excel all glory of the world. Yet here may a question be moved, How it
was lawful for the Jews to stone Stephen, who had not the government in their
hands? For in Christ&#8217;s cause they answer, It is not lawful for us to put
any man to death. I answer, that they did this violently and in an uproar. And
whereas the president did not punish this wickedness, it may be that he winked
at many things,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F490</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
lest they should bring that hatred upon his own head which they bare against the
name of Christ. We see that the Roman presidents did chiefly wink at the civil
discords of that nation, even of set purpose; that when one of them had murdered
another,

that tumult they observed some show of judgment. This was not commanded in vain
that the witnesses should throw the first stone; because, seeing they must
commit the murder with their own hands, many are holden with a certain dread,
who otherwise are less afraid to cut the throats of the innocent with perjury of
the tongue. But in the mean season, we gather how blind and mad the ungodliness
of these witnesses was, who are not afraid to imbrue their bloody hands with the
blood of an innocent, who had already committed murder with their tongues.
Whereas he saith, that their clothes were laid down at the feet of Saul, he
showeth that there was no let in him, but that being cast into a reprobate sense
he might have perished with the rest.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F492</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For who would not think that he was a desperate, [desperado,] who had infected
his youth with such cruelty?
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F493</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Neither is his age expressed to lessen his fault, as some unskillful men go
about to prove; for he was of those years, that want of knowledge could no whit
excuse him. And Luke will shortly after declare, that he was sent by the high
priest to persecute the faithful. Therefore he was no child, he might well be
counted a man. Why, then, is his youth mentioned? That every man may consider
with himself what great hurt he might have done in God&#8217;s Church, unless
Christ had bridled him betimes. And therein appeareth a most notable token both
of God&#8217;s power and also of his grace, in that he tamed a fierce and wild
beast in his chief fury, even in a moment, and in that he extolled a miserable
murderer so highly who through his wickedness was drowned almost in the deep pit
of hell.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>59.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Calling
on.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Because he had uttered words enough
before men, though in vain, he turneth himself now unto God for good causes, and
armeth himself with prayer to suffer all things. For although we have need to
run unto God&#8217;s help every minute of an hour during our whole warfare, yet
we have greatest need to call upon God in the last conflict, which is the
hardest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And Luke expresseth again how furious mad they were,
because their cruelty was not assuaged even when they saw the servant of Christ
praying humbly. Furthermore, here is set down a prayer of Stephen having two
members. In the former member, where he commendeth his spirit to Christ, he
showeth the constancy of his faith. In the other, where he prayeth for his
enemies, he testifieth his love towards men. Forasmuch as the whole perfection
of godliness consisteth upon [of] these two parts, we have in the death of
Stephen a rare example of a godly and holy death. It is to be thought that he
used many more words, but the sum tendeth to this end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lord
Jesus.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have already said, that this
prayer was a witness of confidence; and surely the courageousness and
violentness
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F494</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of Stephen was great, that when as he saw the stones fly about his ears,
wherewith he should be stoned by and by; when as he heareth cruel curses and
reproaches against his head, he yet stayeth himself meekly
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F495</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
upon the grace of Christ. In like sort, the Lord will have his servants to be
brought to nought as it were sometimes, to the end their salvation may be the
more wonderful, And let us define this salvation not by the understanding of our
flesh,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F496</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but by faith. We see how Stephen leaneth not unto the judgment of the flesh, but
rather assuring himself, even in very destruction, that he shall be saved, he
suffereth death with a quiet mind. For undoubtedly he was assured of this, that
our life is hid with Christ in God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, casting off all care of the body, he is
content to commit his soul into the hands of Christ. For he could not pray thus
from his heart, unless, having forgotten this life, he had cast off all care of
the same.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It behoveth us with David
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;193106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
31:6) to commit our souls into the hands of God daily so long as we are in the
world, because we are environed with a thousand deaths, that God may deliver our
life from all dangers; but when we must die indeed, and we are called thereunto,
we must fly unto this prayer, that Christ will receive our spirit. For he
commended his own spirit into the hands of his Father, to this end, that he may
keep ours for ever. This is an inestimable comfort, in that we know our souls do
not wander up and down
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F497</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when they flit out of our bodies, but that Christ receiveth them, that he may
keep them faithfully, if we commend them into his hands. This hope ought to
encourage us to suffer death patiently. Yea, whosoever commendeth his soul to
Christ with an earnest affection of faith, he must needs resign himself wholly
to his pleasure and will. And this place doth plainly testify that the soul of
man is no vain blast which vanisheth away, as some frantic fellows imagine
dotingly,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F498</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but that it is an essential spirit which liveth after this life. Furthermore, we
are taught hereby that we call upon Christ rightly and lawfully, because all
power is given him of the Father, for this cause, that all men may commit
themselves to his tuition.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F499</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>60.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Kneeling down, he
cried.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the other part of his
prayer, wherein he joineth the love of men with faith in Christ; and surely if
we desire to be gathered to Christ for our salvation, we must put on this
affection. Whereas Stephen prayeth for his enemies, and those most deadly, and
even in the very instant when their cruelty might provoke him unto desire of
revenge, he declareth sufficiently what affection he beareth toward all other
men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we know that we are all commanded
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F500</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to do the same which Stephen did;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F501</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but because there is nothing more hard than so to forgive injuries, that we will
wish well to those who would have us undone,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400543&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:43, 44;) therefore we must always set Stephen before our eyes for an example.
He crieth indeed with a loud voice, but he maketh show of nothing before men
which was not spoken sincerely and from the heart, as God himself doth witness.
Yet he crieth aloud, that he may omit nothing which might serve to assuage the
cruelty of the enemies. The fruit appeared not forthwith, yet undoubtedly he
prayed not in vain; and Paul is unto us a sufficient testimony
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F502</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that this sin was not laid to all their charges. I will not say as Augustine,
that unless Stephen had prayed the Church should not have had Paul; for this is
somewhat hard; only I say this, that whereas God pardoned Paul, it appeareth
thereby that Stephen&#8217;s prayer was not in vain. Here ariseth a question,
how Stephen prayeth for those which he said of late did resist the Holy Ghost;
but this seemeth to be the sin against the Spirit which shall never be forgiven?
We may easily answer, that that is pronounced generally of all which belongeth
to many everywhere; therefore, he called not the body of the people rebellious
in such sort that he exempted none. Again, I have declared before what manner of
resisting he condemned in that place; for it followeth not by and by, that they
sin against the Holy Ghost who resist him for a time. When he prayeth that God
will not lay the sin to their charge, his meaning is, that the guiltiness may
not remain in them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when he had said thus, he fell
on sleep.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This was added, that we may know that
these words were uttered even when he was ready to yield up the ghost, which is
a token of wonderful constancy; also this word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sleep</i></font><font face="Palatino">
noteth a meek kind of death. Now, because he made this prayer when he was at the
point of death, he was not moved with any hope of obtaining pardon, to be so
careful to appease his enemies, but only that they might repent. When this word
sleep is taken in the Scripture for to die, it must be referred unto the body,
lest any man imagine foolishly with unlearned men, that the souls do also
sleep.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER 8</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this history we may first see the state of the
godly in this world, to wit, that they are like sheep appointed to be slain, as
it is in the Psalm,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;194422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
44:22;) and especially when the Lord letteth loose the bridle to his enemies,
that they may put that cruelty in execution which they have in mind conceived.
Secondly, here is set down the end of persecutions, to wit, that they are so far
from breaking off the course of the gospel, that they are rather made helps to
further the same through the wonderful counsel of God. Like as it was a manifest
miracle, that the scattering abroad, mentioned by Luke, gathered many unto the
unity of faith who were estranged from God before. Now, let us consider every
thing in order.</font><br></div>

sore for him. <b>3.</b> But Saul made havock of the church, and, entering into

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At that
day</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The persecution began at Stephen, after
that, when their madness was thereby set on fire, it waxed hot against all, both
one and other. For the wicked are like brute beasts, for when they have once
tasted blood they are more desirous thereof, and become more cruel through
committing murder. For Satan, who is the father of all cruelty, doth first take
from them all feeling of humanity when they are once imbrued with innocent
blood; that done, he stirreth up in them an unquenchable thirsting after blood,
whence those violent assaults to commit murder come; so that when they have once
begun, they will never make an end with their will. Moreover, when they have
power once granted them to do hurt, their boldness increaseth in tract of time,
so that they are carried headlong more immoderately, which thing Luke also
noteth when he saith, The persecution was great. Undoubtedly the Church had but
small rest before, neither was it free from the vexation of the wicked; but the
Lord spared his for a time, that they might have some liberty, and now they
began to be sorer set on.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These things must be applied unto our time also. If
the furiousness of our enemies seem at any time to be as it were fallen on
sleep, so that it casteth not out flames far, let us know that the Lord
provideth for our weakness; yet, let us not in the mean season imagine that we
shall have continual truce, but let us be in readiness to suffer sorer brunts,
as often as they shall break out suddenly. Let us also remember, that if at any
time the constancy of one man have whetted the cruelty of our enemies, the blame
of the evil is unjustly ascribed to him. For Luke doth not defame Stephen,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F503</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when as he saith, that by means of him the Church was sorer vexed than before;
but he rather turneth this to his praise, because he did valiantly, as the
standard-bearer, encourage others with his example to fight courageously. When
he calleth it the Church which was at Jerusalem, his meaning is not that there
were Churches elsewhere, but he passeth over unto these things which ensued
thereupon. For whereas there was but this one only body of the godly in all the
world, it was rent in pieces through flight; yet there sprung up more Churches
by and by of those lame members which were dispersed here and there, and so the
body of Christ was spread abroad far and wide, whereas it was before shut up
within the walls of Jerusalem,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They were all scattered
abroad.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is certain that they were not all
scattered abroad, but the Scripture useth an universal note, for that which we
say, Every where or abroad.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F504</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The sum is this, that not only a few were in danger; because the cruelty of the
enemies raged throughout the whole Church. Many do oftentimes take themselves to
their feet, through faintness of heart, even when they hear any light rumor, but
these are in another case. For they fled not unadvisedly, being discouraged,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F505</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but because they saw no other means to pacify the fury of the adversaries. And
he saith, that they were scattered not only through divers places of Judea, but
that they came even unto Samaria; so that the middle wall began to be pulled
down, which made division between the Jews and the Gentiles,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:14.) For the conversion of Samaria was, as it were, the first fruits of the
calling of the Gentiles. For although they had circumcision, as had the people
of God, yet we know that there was great dissension, and that not without great
cause, forasmuch as they had in Samaria only a forged worship of God, as Christ
affirmeth, because it was only an unsavory emulation.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F506</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore God set open the gate for the gospel then, that the scepter of Christ,
sent out of Jerusalem, might come unto the Gentiles. He exempteth the apostles
out of this number, not that they were free from the common danger, but because
it is the duty of a good pastor to set himself against the invasions of wolves
for the safety of his flock.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here may a question be asked, forasmuch as they
were commanded to preach the gospel throughout the whole world ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:16,) why they stayed at Jerusalem, even when they were expelled thence with
force and hand? I answer, that seeing Christ had commanded them to begin at
Jerusalem, they employed themselves there until such time as being brought into
some other place by his hand, they might know, for a surety, that he was their
guide. And we see how fearfully they proceeded to preach the gospel; not that
they foreslowed [shunned] that function which was enjoined them, but because
they were amazed at a new and unwonted thing. Therefore, seeing they see the
gospel so mightily resisted at Jerusalem, they dare go to no other place until
such time as they have broken that first huge heap of straits. Assuredly, they
provide neither for their ease, nor yet for their own commodities either for
being void of care by staying at Jerusalem; for they have a painful charge, they
are continually amidst divers dangers they encounter with great troubles.
Wherefore, undoubtedly, they are purposed to do their duty; and especially,
whereas they stand to it when all the rest fly, that is an evident testimony of
valiant constancy. If any man object that they might have divided the provinces
amongst them, that they might not all have been occupied in one place, I answer,
that Jerusalem alone had business enough for them all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In sum, Luke reckoneth up this as a thing worthy of
praise, that they followed not the rest into voluntary exile to avoid
persecution; and yet he doth not reprehend the flight of those men whose state
was more free. For the apostles did consider what particular thing their calling
had; to wit, that they should keep their standing, seeing the wolves did invade
the sheepfold. The rigor of Tertullian, and such like, was too great, who did
deny indifferently that it is lawful to fly for fear of persecution. Augustine
saith better, who giveth leave to fly in such sort that the churches, being
destitute of their pastors, be not betrayed into the hands of the enemies. This
is surely the best moderation, which beareth neither too much with the flesh,
neither driveth those headlong to death who may lawfully save their lives. Let
him that is disposed read the 180th Epistle to Honoratus.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That I may return to the apostles, if they had been
scattered here and there with fear of persecution, even at the beginning, all
men might have rightly called them hirelings. How hurtful and filthy had the
forsaking of the place been at the present time? How greatly would it have
discouraged the minds of all men? What great hurt should they have done with
their example among the posterity? It shall sometimes so fall out indeed, that
the pastor may also fly; that is, if they invade him alone, if the laying waste
of the Church be not feared if he be absent.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F507</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But and if both his flock and he have to encounter with the adversary, he is a
treacherous forsaker of his office if he stand not stoutly to it even until the
end. Private persons have greater liberty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They dressed
Stephen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke showeth, that even in the heat of
persecution the godly were not discouraged, but being always zealous, they did
those duties which did belong to godliness. Burial seemeth to be a matter of
small importance; rather than they will foreslow [neglect] the same, they bring
themselves in no small hazard of life. And as the circumstance of time doth
declare, that they contemned death valiantly, so again, we gather thereby that
they were careful to do this thing not without great and urgent cause. For this
served greatly to exercise their faith, that the body of the holy martyr should
not be left to the wild beasts, in whom Christ had triumphed nobly according to
the glory of his gospel. Neither could they live to Christ, unless they were
ready to be gathered unto Stephen into the society of death. Therefore the care
they had to bury the martyr was unto them a meditation unto invincible constancy
of professing the faith. Therefore they sought not in a superfluous matter, with
an unadvised zeal, to provoke their adversaries. Although that general reason,
which ought always and every where to be of force amongst the godly, was
undoubtedly of great weight with them. For the rite of burying doth appertain
unto the hope of the resurrection, as it was ordained by God since the beginning
of the world to this end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Wherefore, this was always counted cruel barbarism to
suffer bodies to lie unburied willingly. Profane men did not know why they
should account the rite of burial so holy; but we are not ignorant of the end
thereof, to wit, that those which remain alive may know that the bodies are
committed to the earth as to a prison,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F508</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
until they be raised up thence. Whereby it appeareth that this duty is
profitable rather for those which are alive than those which are dead. Although
it is also a point of our humanity to give due honor to those bodies to which we
know blessed immortality to be promised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They made great
lamentation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke doth also commend their
profession of godliness and faith in their lamentation. For a doleful and
unprosperous end causeth men, for the most part, to forsake those causes wherein
they were delighted before. But, on the other side, these men declare by their
mourning, that they are no whit terrified with the death of Stephen from
standing stoutly in the approbation of their cause; considering therewithal what
great loss God&#8217;s Church suffered by the death of one man. And we must
reject that foolish philosophy which willeth all men to be altogether blockish
that they may be wise. It must needs be that the Stoics were void of common
sense who would have a man to be without all affection. Certain mad fellows
would gladly bring in the same dotings into the Church at this day, and yet,
notwithstanding, although they require an heart of iron of other men, there is
nothing softer or more effeminate than they. They cannot abide that other men
should shed one tear; if anything fall out otherwise than they would wish, they
make no end of mourning. God doth thus punish their arrogancy jestingly, (that I
may so term it,) seeing that he setteth them to be laughed at even by boys. But
let us know that those affections which God hath given to man&#8217;s nature
are, of themselves, no more corrupt than the author himself; but that they are
first to be esteemed according to the cause; secondly, if they keep a mean and
moderation. Surely that man which denieth that we ought to rejoice over the
gifts of God is more like a block than a man; therefore, we may no less lawfully
sorrow when they be taken away. And lest I pass the compass of this present
place, Paul doth not altogether forbid men mourning, when any of their friends
are taken away by death, but he would have a difference between them and the
unbelievers; because hope ought to be to them a comfort and a remedy against
impatience. For the beginning of death caused us to sorrow for good causes; but
because we know that we have life restored to us in Christ, we have that which
is sufficient to appease our sorrow. In like sort, when we are sorry that the
Church is deprived of rare and excellent men, there is good cause of sorrow;
only we must seek such comfort as may correct excess.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
But Saul</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We must note two things in this place,
how great the cruelty of the adversaries was, and how wonderful the goodness of
God was, who vouchsafed to make Paul a pastor of so cruel a wolf. For that
desire to lay waste the Church wherewith he was incensed did seem to cut away
all hope. Therefore his conversion was so much the more excellent afterward. And
it is not to be doubted but that this punishment was laid upon him by God, after
that he had conspired to put Stephen to death, together with the other wicked
men, that he should be the ringleader of cruelty. For God doth oftentimes punish
sins more sharply in the elect than in the reprobate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And they were scattered abroad</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Luke declareth
in this place also, that it came to pass by the wonderful providence of God,
that the scattering abroad of the faithful should bring many unto the unity of
faith; thus doth the Lord use to bring light out of darkness, and life out of
death. For the voice of the gospel, which was heard heretofore in one place
only, doth now sound everywhere; in the mean season, we are taught by this
example that we must not yield unto persecutions, but rather be encouraged unto
valiantness; for, when the faithful flee from Jerusalem, they are not afterward
discouraged either with exile or with their present miseries, or with any fear,
that they degenerate into slothfulness;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F509</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but they are as ready to preach Christ even in the midst of their calamity as if
they had never suffered any trouble. Moreover, Luke seemeth to note that they
led a wandering life in that they changed their lodgings often. Therefore, if we
desire to be counted their brethren, let us prick forward ourselves so
diligently, that no fear or bitterness of cross discourage us, but that we go
forward in showing forth the profession of faith; and that we never be weary of
furthering the doctrine of Christ; for it is an absurd thing that exile and
flight, which are the first exercises of martyrdom, should make us dumb and
fainthearted.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> Luke said that they all preached the Word
of God, now he maketh mention of Philip alone, both because his preaching was
more fruitful and effectual than the preaching of the rest, and also because
there followed notable histories, which he will add afterward. He put the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>city of
Samaria</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for the <i>city Samaria</i> which was
laid waste by Hyrcanus, and built again by Herod, and called Sebaste. Read
Josephus, in his Thirteenth and Fifteenth Books of Antiquities. When he saith
that Philip </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>preached
Christ,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he signifieth that the whole sum of the
gospel is contained in Christ. The other speech which he useth shortly after is
more perfect; yet it all one in effect. He joineth the kingdom of God and the
name of Christ together; but because we obtain this goodness through Christ, to
have God to reign in us, and to lead an heavenly life, being renewed into
spiritual righteousness, and dead to the world, therefore the preaching of
Christ containeth this point also under it. But the sum is this, that Christ
doth repair with his grace the world, being destroyed; which cometh to pass when
he reconcileth us to the Father. Secondly, when he regenerateth us by his
Spirit, that the kingdom of God may be erected in us when Satan is put to
flight. Moreover, whereas he declared before, that the apostles did not stir one
foot from Jerusalem, it is to be thought that he speaketh of one of the seven
deacons in this place, whose daughters did also prophesy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the multitude gave
ear.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke declareth how the Samaritans did
embrace Philip&#8217;s doctrine. For he saith that they heard, whereby they took
some taste; there was also another prick whereby they were pricked forward, and
that was miracles; at length there followed attentiveness. This is the right
going forward unto faith; for those which refuse that doctrine which they have
not heard, how is it possible that they should ever come unto faith, which
cometh by hearing?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:14.) Therefore, whereas they were ready to hear, that was the first step unto
reverence and attentiveness. And therefore it is no marvel if faith be so rare,
and almost none in the world; for how many be there which vouchsafe to hearken
when God speaketh? whereby it cometh to pass that the more part rejecteth the
truth before they know the same, and have not so much as lightly tasted it. And
as hearing is the beginning of faith, so it should not be sufficient of itself,
unless the majesty of doctrine should also move the hearts. And surely,
whosoever considereth that he hath to do with God, cannot hear him
contemptuously when he speaketh; and the very doctrine which is contained in his
word shall purchase authority for itself, so that attentiveness shall flow of
itself from hearing. As touching miracles we know that there is a double use
thereof; they serve to prepare us to hear the gospel, and to confirm us in the
faith thereof. The adverb, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with
one accord</i></font><font face="Palatino">, may be joined as well with hearing
as with attentiveness. This latter doth like me better, that they were attentive
with one accord; and therein doth Luke commend the force and efficacy of
Philip&#8217;s preaching, because a great number of men was suddenly won to hear
attentively with one consent.</font><br></div>

unclean spirits cried was a token of resistance. Wherefore this served not a
little to set forth the power of Christ, that he did bind the devils with his
commandment, though they resisted stubbornly.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A certain man named
Simon.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This was such a let that it might seem
that the gospel could have no passage to come unto the Samaritans; for the minds
of them all were bewitched with Simon&#8217;s jugglings. And this amazedness was
grown to some strength by reason of long space of time. Furthermore experience
teacheth what a hard matter it is to pluck that error out of the minds of men
which hath taken root through long continuance and to call them back unto a
sound and right mind who are already hardened. Superstition made them more
obstinate in their error, because they counted Simon not only as a prophet of
God, but even as the Spirit of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10. </b>For the surname,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great
power</i></font><font face="Palatino">, tendeth to this end, that whatsoever
should otherwise be divine might wax vile through this greatness. Therefore the
power of Christ appeareth hereby more plainly, in that Philip brake through
these lets; which thing Luke amplifieth,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b> When he saith that <i>they were
astonied</i>, from the least to the greatest. For seeing all men, of what estate
soever they were, were deluded, what entrance could the gospel have, especially
since it was no mean seducing? for all their senses were besotted. And besides
that we see thereby how mighty the truth is, there is also set before us an
example of constancy in Philip, who, though he saw no way, yet doth he set hand
to the Lord&#8217;s work with a valiant courage, waiting for the success which
God should give. And thus must we do, we must valiantly attempt whatsoever the
Lord commandeth, even when our endeavors seem to be vain. Furthermore, whereas
Satan did bewitch the Samaritans, let us know that it is the common punishment
of infidelity. All men are not bewitched, indeed, with the jugglings of
enchanters, neither are there Simons everywhere, which can so seduce and
deceive; but my meaning is, that it is no wonder,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F511</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
if Satan do mock men diversely in the dark; for they are subject to all errors
whosoever are not governed by the Spirit of God. Furthermore, when Luke saith
that they were all seduced one with another, we are taught that neither wit,
neither all that reason and wisdom which we have, are sufficient to avoid the
craftiness of Satan withal. And surely we see in what foolish and doting errors
they were entangled, who were counted in the world wiser than
others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The great power of
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Therefore Satan abused the name of God to
deceive, which is the most pestilent kind of deceiving, so far is it from being
any excuse. It hath been said before, that Simon did take to himself the name of
the principal power of God, that he might suppress and surpass whatsoever was
elsewhere divine, as the sun darkeneth all the stars with his light. This was
wicked and ungodly profaning of the name of God. But we read of nothing which
was done here, which is not done as yet daily; for men are bent to nothing more
than to translate that to Satan which is proper to God. They pretend religion;
but what did this pretense help the Samaritans? Therefore it goeth well with us
when God setteth forth to us his power in Christ, and declareth therewith that
we must not seek the same anywhere else, and doth discover the sleights and
juggling casts of Satan, which we must avoid, to the end he may keep us still in
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When they had
believed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That is the miracle whereof I spake
because they heard Philip, who were altogether made astonied with the illusions
of Simon; in that they were made partakers of the heavenly wisdom who were
blockish and dull. So that they were, after a sort, brought from hell to heaven.
Whereas baptism followed faith, it agreeth with Christ&#8217;s institution, as
concerning strangers,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:47,) and those which were without. For it was meet that they should be
engrafted into the body of the Church before they should receive the sign; but
the Anabaptists are too foolish, whilst they endeavor to prove by these places
that infants are not to be baptized. Men and women could not be baptized without
making confession of their faith; but they were admitted unto baptism upon this
condition, that their families might
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F512</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
be consecrated to God; for the covenant goeth thus:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Simon also
himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He which had besotted the whole city
with his witchery receiveth the truth together with others. He which had boasted
himself to be the principal power of God submitteth himself to God, [Christ; ]
though he were brought to the knowledge of the gospel, not so much for his own
sake alone, as for the whole country&#8217;s sake, that that offense might be
taken out of the way which might have hindered the unskillful. And to this end
tendeth that which Luke setteth down afterward, that he wondered at the signs.
For God meant to triumph over this man, whom the Samaritans counted a petit God;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F513</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which cometh to pass whilst he is enforced to give glory to the true miracles,
after that his vain boasting is taken away. And yet he giveth not himself over
sincerely to Christ; for then his ambition, and that wicked and profane account
which he made of the gifts of God, should not break out. And yet I am not of
their mind who think that he made only a semblance of faith, seeing he did not
believe. Luke saith plainly that he believed, and the reason is added, Because
he was touched with wondering. How, then, doth he shortly after betray himself
to be but a hypocrite? I answer, That there is some mean between faith and mere
dissimulation. The Epicures [Epicureans] and Lucianists do profess that they
believe, whereas notwithstanding they laugh inwardly, whereas the hope of
eternal life is unto them a vain thing; finally, whereas they have no more
godliness than dogs or swine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there be many who howsoever they be not
regenerate with the Spirit of adoption, and do not addict themselves unto God
with the true affection of the heart, being overcome with the power of the Word,
do not only confess that that is true which is taught, but are also touched with
some fear of God, so that they receive doctrine; for they conceive that God must
be heard; that he is both the author and also the judge of the world. Therefore,
they make no semblance of faith before men, which is none, but they think that
they believe. And this faith continueth only for a time, whereof Christ speaketh
in Mark, (Mark 4;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
8:13;) to wit, when the seed of the Word conceived in the mind is,
notwithstanding, choked forthwith with divers cares of the world, or with wicked
affections, so that it never cometh to any ripeness; yea, rather, it groweth out
of kind unto unprofitable corn nothing worth. Such, therefore, was Simon&#8217;s
faith; he perceiveth that the doctrine of the gospel is true, and he is enforced
to receive the same with the feeling of his conscience; but the groundwork is
wanting; that is, the denial of himself. Whereupon it followed that his mind was
enwrapped in dissimulation, which he uttereth forthwith. But let us know that
his hypocrisy was such as he deceived himself in; and not that gross hypocrisy
whereof Epicures and such like make boast;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F514</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because they dare not confess the contempt of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He was
baptized</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It appeareth plainly, by this example
of Simon that all men have not that grace given them in baptism, which grace is
there figured. The opinion of the Papists is this, That unless mortal sin be the
cause of let,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F515</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
all men receive the truth and effect with the signs. So that they attribute unto
the sacraments magical force, as if they did profit without faith, But let us
know that the Lord offereth to us by the sacraments, whatsoever the annexed
promises do sound;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F516</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and that they are not offered in vain, so that
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F517</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
being directed unto Christ by faith, we set [seek] from him whatsoever the
sacraments do promise. And although the receiving of baptism did profit him
nothing then, yet if conversion followed afterward, as some men suppose, the
profit was not extinguished nor abolished. For it cometh to pass oftentimes that
the Spirit of God worketh afterward after a long time, that the sacraments may
begin to show forth their force.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F518</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Did cleave to
Philip</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Whereas Philip admitted him into his
company, it appeareth thereby how hard a matter it is to know hypocrites. And
this is a trial of our patience. So Demas was a companion of Paul for a time;
afterward he became an unfaithful revolt

deceitful will sometimes join themselves unto us; and if at any time the wicked
creep craftily into our company, proud censors burden us unjustly, as if we were
to answer for their misdeeds. Though we must take heed of facility, which
causeth the gospel to be slandered oftentimes, and we must be so much the more
vigilant, that we admit none without great choice, forasmuch as we hear that
great men have been deceived. He saith that he was made astonied with the
greatness of the signs; that we may know that that great power, whereof he
boasted, was nothing else but juggling and smokes. And Luke speaketh not in this
place of any plain wondering, but of a damp or trance which causeth a man to
forget what he doth.

proceedings of the grace of God in the Samaritans, as he useth to enrich the
faithful continually with greater gifts of his Spirit, for we must not think
that the apostles took that counsel whereof Luke speaketh, without the instinct
of the same God who had already begun his work in Samaria by the hand of Philip;
and he useth his instruments diversely unto divers parts of his work, according
to his good pleasure. He used Philip as an instrument to bring them unto the
faith; now he ordaineth Peter and John to be ministers to give the Spirit and
thus doth he foster the unity of his Church when one helpeth another, and not
only knit man and man together, but whole churches also. He could have finished
that which he had begun by Philip; but to the end the Samaritans might learn to
embrace brotherly fellowship with the first Church, he meant to bind them
herewith as with a band; secondly, he meant to grant the apostles (whom he had
commanded to preach the gospel throughout the whole world &#8212;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:15) this privilege, that they might the better all grow together into one
faith of the gospel; and we know that it was otherwise dangerous, lest, seeing
the Jews and Samaritans were much unlike in mind and manners, being so divided,
they should by this means divide Christ, or at least feign to themselves a new
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the mean season, we see how careful the apostles
were to help their brethren; for they stay not until they be requested, but they
take this charge upon them of their own accord. The apostles do not this through
any distrust, as if they did suspect that Philip did not his duty so uprightly
as he ought;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F521</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but they set to their hand to help him in his work, and Peter and John came not
only to help him, and to be partakers of his labors, but also to approve the
same. Again, Philip is not grieved because other men finish that building which
he had begun, but they one help another full gently and faithfully; and surely
it is ambition alone which will not suffer holy fellowship and mutual imparting
of duties to enter.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F522</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Whereas Luke saith that Peter was sent by the rest, we may hereby gather that he
was not the chief ruler over his fellows in office;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F523</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but did so excel amongst them, that yet, notwithstanding, he was subject to, and
did obey the body.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which were at
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This may carry a double meaning,
either that all the apostles were at Jerusalem then, or that there were certain
resident there when the rest went hither and thither; and I do rather allow this
latter, for it is to be thought that they did so divide themselves, that always
some of the number might take upon them divers embassages, as occasion was
offered, that some might stay at Jerusalem, as in the principal standing.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F524</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Again, it may be that after every man had spent some time in his voyage, they
were wont to assemble themselves there. It is certain, indeed, that that time
which they spent at Jerusalem was not spent in idleness; and, secondly that they
were not tied to some one place, forasmuch as Christ had commanded them to go
over all the world
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
prayed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Undoubtedly they taught first, for we
know that they were no dumb persons; but Luke passeth over that which was common
to them and Philip, and declareth only what new thing the Samaritans had by
their coming, to wit, that they had the Spirit given them then.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b> But here ariseth a question, for he saith
that they were only baptized into the name of Christ, and that therefore they
had not as yet received the Holy Ghost; but baptism must either be in vain and
without grace, or else it must have all the force which it hath from the Holy
Ghost. In baptism we are washed from our sins; but Paul teacheth that our
washing is the work of the Holy Ghost,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;560305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
3:5.) The water used in baptism is a sign of the blood of Christ; but Peter
saith, that it is the Spirit by whom we are washed with the blood of Christ
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:2.) Our old man is crucified in baptism, that we may be raised up unto
newness of life,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:6;) and whence cometh all this save only from the sanctification of the
Spirit? And, finally, what shall remain in baptism if it be separate from the
Spirit?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480327&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:27.) Therefore, we must not deny but that the Samaritans, who had put on
Christ, indeed, in baptism, had also his Spirit given them; and surely Luke
speaketh not in this place of the common grace of the Spirit, whereby God doth
regenerate us, that we may be his children, but of those singular gifts
wherewith God would have certain endued at the beginning of the gospel to
beautify Christ&#8217;s kingdom. Thus must the words of John be understood, that
the disciples had not the Spirit given them as yet, forasmuch as Christ was yet
conversant in the world; not that they were altogether destitute of the Spirit,
seeing that they had from the same both faith, and a godly desire to follow
Christ; but because they were not furnished with those excellent gifts, wherein
appeared afterwards greater glory of Christ&#8217;s kingdom. To conclude,
forasmuch as the Samaritans were already endtied with the Spirit of adoptioni
the excellent graces of the Spirit are heaped upon them, in which God showed to
his Church, for a time as it were, the visible presence of his Spirit, that he
might establish for ever the authority of his gospel, and also testify that his
Spirit shall be always the governor and director of the
faithful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They were only
baptized</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We must not understand this as spoken
contemptuously of baptism; but Luke&#8217;s meaning is, that they were only
endued then with the grace of common adoption and regeneration, which is offered
to all the godly in baptism. As for this, it was an extraordinary thing that
certain should have the gifts of the Spirit given them, which might serve to set
forth the kingdom of Christ and the glory of the gospel; for this was the use
thereof, that every one might profit the Church according to the measure of his
ability. We must note this, therefore, because, while the Papists will set up
their feigned confirmation, they are not afraid to break out into this
sacrilegious speech, that they are but half Christians upon whom the hands have
not been as yet laid. This is not tolerable now because, whereas this was a sign
which lasted only for a time, they made it a continual law in the Church, as if
they had the Spirit in readiness to give to whomsoever they would. We know that
when the testimony and pledge of God&#8217;s grace is set before us in vain, and
without the thing itself, it is too filthy mockery; but even they themselves are
enforced to grant that the Church was beautified for a time only with these
gifts; whereupon it followeth that the laying on of hands which the apostles
used had an end when the effect ceased. I omit that, that they added oil unto
the laying on of hands,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;410613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
6:13;) but this, as I have already said, was a point of too great boldness, to
prescribe a perpetual law to the Church, that that might be a general sacrament,
which was peculiarly used amongst the apostles,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:7;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:6;) that the sign might continue still after that the thing itself was ceased;
and with this they joined detestable blasphemy, because they said that sins were
only forgiven by baptism, and that the Spirit of regeneration is given by that
rotten oil which they presumed to bring in without the Word of God. The
Scripture doth testify that we put on Christ in baptism, and that we are
engrafted into his body, that our old man may be crucified, and we renewed into
righteousness. These sacrilegious robbers have translated that to adorn the
false visor of their sacrament which they have taken from baptism.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F525</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Neither was this the invention of one man only, but the decree of one council,
whereof they babble daily in all their schools.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When they had laid their
hands.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The laying on of hands followeth
prayers, whereby they testify that the grace of the Spirit is not included in
the external ceremony, which they crave humbly at the hands of another. And yet
when they confess that God is the author, they neglect not the ceremony which
was delivered them by God to this use; and because they usurp it not rashly, the
effect is also annexed. This is the profit and efficacy of signs, because God
worketh in them, and yet he remaineth the only giver of grace and distributeth
the same according to his good pleasure; but let us remember that the laying on
of hands was the instrument of God, at such time as he gave the visible graces
of the Spirit to his, and that since the Church was deprived of such riches, it
is only a vain visor without any substance.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when
Simon</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Simon&#8217;s hypocrisy is now
discovered, not because that he had feigned before that he believed; for when he
was convicted he gave Christ his hand in earnest, like as many yield unto the
gospel, lest they strive against God, but in the mean season they continue like
to themselves; whereas the denial of ourselves ought to follow true faith. And
this is to mix Christ with Satan, when doctrine pierceth not unto the hidden
affections of the heart, but the inward uncleanness lieth hidden there.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F527</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore God wipeth away that false color now in Simon, lest by professing the
name of Christ he deceive both himself and others. For that ambition which was
hidden before breaketh out now, when as he desireth to be equal with the
apostles. This is now one vice; another is, because while he thinketh that the
grace of God is to be sold, he will get some greedy gain thereby.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F528</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Whereby it appeareth that he is a profane man, and such as had not tasted the
first principles of godliness; for he is touched with no desire of God&#8217;s
glory; yea, he doth not once think what it is to be a minister of God. As he had
heretofore gotten gain by his magic, so he thought that it would be gainsome if
he might give the graces of the Spirit. For undoubtedly he hunted after riches,
and sought to purchase praise in the sight of the world; and he did God great
injury also, because he thought that this heavenly power did nothing differ from
his magical enchantments. Now we understand briefly what and how many ways Simon
offended. In the gifts of the Spirit he doth not adore, neither acknowledge the
power of Christ; he doth not confess that the apostles were endued with heavenly
power, to set forth Christ&#8217;s glory by their ministry; his own ambition
driveth and carrieth him headlong, so that he desireth to become excellent; and
to make the world subject to himself, setting God apart, he will buy the Holy
Ghost, as if he could be bought with money.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peter
answered.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Peter giveth him the repulse here
stoutly, and being not content to chide him, he addeth a bitter curse (or wish,)
that Simon and his money may perish together; though he doth not so much wish
unto him destruction, as he telleth him that the just vengeance of God hangeth
over his head, that he might terrify him. In sum, he showeth what he hath
deserved, when he hath made the Spirit of God subject to filthy buying and
selling; as if he should have said, Thou art worthy to perish with thy money,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F529</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when thou dost so blaspheme the Spirit of God. For we may easily gather by that
which followeth, that Peter would rather have had Simon saved than destroyed.
But as it were supplying the place of a judge, he pronounceth what punishment
Simon&#8217;s ungodliness deserveth; and it was requisite that he should be thus
accused with such vehemence, that he might perceive the greatness of his
offense.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F530</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
To the same end tendeth that that he judged his money to perish; for he
signifieth that it was as it were infected and polluted with cogitation of
wickedness, because it was offered to such a wicked use. And surely we ought
rather to wish that all the whole world perish, than that those things should
darken the glory of God, which, in comparison thereof, are nothing worth. When
he wisheth thus to a sacrilegious man, he doth not so much respect the person as
the fact; for we must be offended with the offenses of men in such sort, that we
must pity the men themselves. Such are those sentences of God which adjudge
adulterers, thieves, drunkards, and wrongful dealers, to destruction,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460609&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 6:9;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
5:5;) for they do not cut off all hope of salvation from them, but they are only
referred unto their present state and declare what end is prepared for them, if
they go forward obstinately.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast no
part.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some do frame this sentence otherwise,
that Simon is not partaker of grace, because he setteth a price thereof. But the
other reading which we have followed is more usual, to wit, that that reason be
joined to the former member. And surely it is better to knit the two sentences
together, thus, Thy money perish with thee, because thou thinkest that the
inestimable gift of the Spirit can be bought with money. Whereas the old
interpreter had put, <i>in this word;</i> Erasmus translated it more fitly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in this
business;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for Peter&#8217;s meaning is, that
that sacrilegious person hath nothing to do in all that administration, who doth
wickedly profane the same.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore both the Papists, and also the old
divines, have disputed much concerning simony; but that which the Papists call
simony doth not agree with Simon&#8217;s fact. Simon would have bought the grace
of the Spirit with money; the Papists apply the crime of simony unto their idle
revenues; and yet I speak not this that I may extenuate those horrible sins
which reign at this day in Popery, in buying and selling spiritual promotions.
Now, this wickedness is filthy enough of itself, in that they hold such a mart
in the Church of God. And in the mean season, we must note the true definition
of simony, to wit, that it is a wicked buying and selling of the gifts of the
Spirit, or some other such like thing, whilst that a man abuseth them unto
ambition or other corruptions. Though I confess that all those imitate Simon who
strive to attain unto the government of the Church by unlawful means; which
thing we see committed at this day without shame, as if it were lawful; and we
can scarce find one priest in all Popery which is not manifestly a simoniacal
person in this respect; because none can put up his head amongst them,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F531</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but he must creep in by indirect means. Although we must confess, (which thing
even children see, to our great shame,) that this vice is too common even
amongst the false professors of the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us remember, first, to the end we may be free
from the infection of Simon, that the gifts of the Spirit are not gotten with
money, but that they are given of the free and mere goodness of God, and that
for the edifying of the Church; that is, that every man may study to help his
brethren according to the measure of his ability; that every man may bestow
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F532</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that about the common good of the Church which he hath received; and that the
excellency of no man may hinder, but that Christ may excel all. Notwithstanding,
it may seem a marvelous matter, that Peter excludeth Simon from being a partaker
of the Spirit, as concerning special gifts; because his heart is not right
before God. For the wickedness of Judas did not let him from having the gifts of
the Spirit in great measure; neither had the gifts of the Spirit been so
corrupted amongst the Corinthians, if their heart had been right in the sight of
God. Therefore that reason which Peter allegeth seemeth insufficient; because
many men excel oftentimes in the gifts of the Spirit, who have an unclean heart.
But, first of all, there followeth no absurdity, if God give such graces to men
which are unworthy thereof. Secondly, Peter prescribeth no general rule in this
place, but because the Church alone is for the most part made partaker of the
gifts of the Spirit, he pronounceth that Simon, who is a stranger to Christ, is
unworthy to have the same graces given him, (which are bestowed upon the
faithful,) as if he were one of God&#8217;s household. Moreover, he had
blasphemed those gifts whereof he is deprived.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Repent,
therefore.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Whereas he exhorteth him unto
repentance and prayer, he putteth him in some hope of pardon thereby; for no man
shall ever be touched with any desire of repentance, save only he which shall
believe that God will have mercy upon him; on the other side, despair will
always carry men headlong unto boldness. Furthermore, the Scripture teacheth
that God is not called upon aright save only by faith. Therefore, we see how
Peter raiseth up Simon now unto hope of salvation, whom he had thrown down
before with the cruel lightnings and thunderbolts of words; and yet
Simon&#8217;s sin was no small sin. But, if it could be, we ought to pluck men
even out of hell.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, until such time as even the most wicked
men do by manifest signs betray themselves to be reprobates, no one of them is
to be handled so sharply but that remission of sins is to be set before him.
Yea, we must so deal with those for whom sharp chiding is profitable, by reason
of their hardness and stubbornness, that we throw them down with one hand, and
set them on foot with the other; for the Spirit of God doth not suffer us to
accurse them
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F533</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But Peter seemeth to bring him into some fear and doubt, when he saith, if
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peradventure</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
And the Papists go about to prove by this place and such like, that we must pray
with doubtful minds; because men may unadvisedly promise themselves certain
success in their petitions. But we may readily answer them; for the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ei
ara</font><font face="Palatino"> signifieth as much as if a man should say, If
by any means thou must obtain pardon of God. Peter useth this word, not that he
may leave Simon&#8217;s mind in a perplexity, but that he may the more prick him
forward to be earnest in prayer. For the very difficulty doth not a little serve
to stir us up; because when we see the thing at hand, we are too careless and
sluggish. Therefore Peter doth not terrify Simon, that he may overthrow or
trouble all hope of obtaining in his heart, but putting him in sure hope if he
shall crave pardon humbly and from his heart, he telleth him only that pardon is
hard to be gotten, by reason of the greatness of his offense, to the end he may
provoke him unto ferventness; for it is requisite that we may be lightened by
faith when we go unto God, yea, that she be the mother of
prayer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the gall of
bitterness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Peter doth sharply reprove Simon
again, and striketh him with God&#8217;s judgment. For unless he had been
compelled to descend into himself, he would never have been turned in good
earnest unto God. For there is nothing more deadly for men which are blockish
than when we flatter them, or when we do but a little scrape the skin, whereas
they ought rather to be thrust through. Therefore, until such time as a sinner
shall conceive sorrow and true heaviness by reason of his sin, we must use such
severity as may wound his mind; otherwise the rotten sore shall be nourished
within, which shall by little and little consume the man himself. Yet let us
always observe this mean, that we provide for men&#8217;s salvation so much as
in us lieth. Moreover, there be two excellent fine metaphors in Peter&#8217;s
words; the one whereof seemeth to be taken out of Moses, where he forbiddeth
that there be not in us any root, from which springeth gall and wormwood,
(Deuteronomy 29.) By which speech is noted the inward wickedness of the heart;
when as it hath so conceived the poison of ungodliness, that being therewith
infected, it can bring forth nothing but bitterness. To the same end tendeth the
binding of iniquity: to wit, when the whole heart is kept bound and tied by
Satan. For it falleth out sometimes that men which are otherwise given very
godlily, do break out into evil works, who have not their heart corrupt inwardly
with poison. We know that hypocrisy is engendered in man&#8217;s nature; but
when as the Spirit of God doth shine, we are so blinded in our vices, that we
nourish them within as if it were some hidden bundle. Therefore Peter&#8217;s
meaning is, that Simon fell not only in one point, but that his very heart root
was corrupt and bitter; that he fell into Satan&#8217;s snares not only in one
kind of sin, but that all his senses were ensnared, so that he was wholly given
over to Satan, and was become the bond-slave of iniquity. In the mean season, we
are taught that the greatness of offenses is esteemed not so much according to
the fact
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F534</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which appeareth, as according to the affection of the heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Simon answered.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hereby we gather that he did
not so take that which Peter had threatened unto him, but that he did consider
that his salvation was sought. And though Peter alone spake, yet he attributeth
the speech unto all by reason of the consent. Now ariseth a question what we
ought to think of Simon. The Scripture carrieth us no farther, save only unto a
conjecture. Whereas he yieldeth when he is reproved, and being touched with the
feeling of his sin, feareth the judgment of God; and that done, flieth unto the
mercy of God, and commendeth himself to the prayers of the Church; these are
assuredly no small signs of repentance; therefore we may conjecture that he
repented. And yet the old writers affirm with one consent, that he was a great
enemy to Peter afterward, and that he disputed with him by the space of three
days at Rome. The disputation is also extant in writing under the name of
Clement, but it hath in it such filthy dotings, that it is a wonder that
Christian ears can abide to hear them. Again, Augustine, writing to Januarius,
saith, that there were divers and false rumors spread abroad in Rome in his time
concerning that matter. Wherefore, nothing is more safe than bidding adieu to
uncertain opinions, simply to embrace that which is set down in the Scriptures.
That which we read elsewhere of Simon may justly be suspected for many
causes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they
testified.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In these words Luke teacheth that
Peter and John came not only that they might enrich the Samaritans with the
gifts of the Spirit, but also that they might establish them in the faith which
they had already received, by approving Philip&#8217;s doctrine. For thus much
doth the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>testify</i></font><font face="Palatino">
import; as if he should say, that it came to pass by their testimony, that the
word of God had full and perfect authority, and that the truth was of force, as
being well testified and authentic. Notwithstanding Luke teaeheth therewithal
that they were faithful witnesses of God, when he addeth that they uttered the
word of God. This was, therefore, the sum of the apostles&#8217; doctrine,
faithfully to utter those things which they had learned of the Lord, and not
their own inventions, or the inventions of any man else. He saith, that they did
this not only in the city, but also in villages. Therefore we see that they were
so inflamed to further the glory of Christ, that whithersoever they came they
had him in their mouth. So that the seed of life began to be sown throughout the
whole region, after that it was preached in the city.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
angel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Luke passeth over unto a new history, to
wit, how the gospel came even unto the Ethiopians. For though he reporteth there
was but one man converted unto the faith of Christ, yet because his authority
and power was great in all the realm, his faith might spread abroad a sweet
smell far and wide. For we know that the gospel grew of small beginnings; and
therein appeared the power of the Spirit more plainly, in that one grain of seed
did fill a whole country in a small space. Philip is first commanded by the
angel to go toward the south; the angel telleth him not to what end. And thus
doth God oftentimes use to deal with those that be his, to prove their
obedience. He showeth what he will have them to do; he commandeth them to do
this or that, but he keepeth the success hidden with himself. Therefore let us
be content with the commandment
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F536</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of God alone, although the reason of that which he enjoineth, or the fruit of
obedience, appear not by and by.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F537</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For although this be not plainly expressed, yet all the commandments of God
contain a hidden promise, that so often as we obey him, all that work which we
take in hand must needs fall out well. Moreover, this ought to be sufficient for
us, that God doth allow our studies, when as we take nothing in hand rashly or
without his commandment. If any man object, that angels come not down daily from
heaven to reveal unto us what we ought to do, the answer is ready, that we are
sufficiently taught in the Word of God what we ought to do, and that they are
never destitute of counsel who ask it of him,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F538</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and submit themselves to the government of the Spirit. Therefore nothing doth
hinder and keep us back from being ready to follow God, save only our own
slothfulness and coldness

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the way which goeth down to
Gaza.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> All the learned grant that that is called
Gaza here which the Hebrews call Haza. Wherefore, Pomponius Mela is deceived,
who saith that Cambyses, king of Persia, called that city by this name, because
when he made war against the Egyptians, he had his riches laid up there. It is
true, indeed, that the Persians call treasure or plenty, <i>Gaza</i>; and Luke
useth this word shortly after in this sense, when as he saith that the eunuch
was the chief governor of the treasure of Candace; but because that Hebrew word
was used before such time as Cambyses was born, I do not think but that it was
corrupt afterwards, the letter
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">h</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>(heth)</i> being changed into <i>g</i>, which thing we see was done in all
others almost. The epitheton waste is added for this cause, because Alexander of
Macedonia laid waste that old Gaza. Also Luke refuteth those who make
Constantinus the builder of the second and new Gaza, who affirmeth that it was
an hundred and fifty years before; but it may be that he beautified and enlarged
the city after it was built. And all men confess that this new Gaza was situate
on the seacoast, distant twenty furlongs from the old city.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, a man, an
Ethiopian.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He calleth him a man, who he saith
shortly after was an eunuch; but because kings and queens in the East were wont
to appoint eunuchs over their weighty affairs, thereby it came to pass that
lords of great power were called generally
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F540</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
eunuchs, whereas, notwithstanding, they were men. Furthermore, Philip findeth
indeed, now at length, that he did not obey God in vain. Therefore, whosoever
committeth the success to God, and goeth on forward thither whither he biddeth
him, he shall at length try
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F541</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that all that falleth out well which is taken in hand at his appointment.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F542</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The name <i>Candace</i> was not the name of one queen only; but as all the
emperors of Rome were called Caesars,, so the Ethiopians, as Pliny withesseth,
called their queens Candaces. This maketh also unto the matter that the writers
of histories report that that was a noble and wealthy kingdom, because it may
the better be gathered by the royalty and power thereof how gorgeous the
condition and dignity of the eunuch was. The head and principal place
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F543</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
was Meroe. The profane writers agree with Luke, who report that women used to
reign there.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Came [had come] to
worship.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hereby we gather that the name of the
true God was spread far abroad, seeing he had some worshippers in far countries.
Certes, it must needs be that this man did openly profess another worship than
his nation; for so great a lord could not come into Judea by stealth, and
undoubtedly he brought with him a great train. And no marvel if there were some
everywhere in the East parts which worshipped the true God, because that after
the people were scattered abroad, there was also some smell
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F544</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the knowledge of the true God spread abroad with them throughout foreign
countries; yea, the banishment
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F545</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the people was a spreading abroad of true godliness. Also, we see that though
the Romans did condemn the Jewish religion with many cruel edicts, yet could
they not bring to pass but that many, even on [in] heaps, would profess the
same.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F546</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
These were certain beginnings
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F547</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the calling of the Gentiles, until such time as Christ, having with the
brightness of his coming put away the shadows of the law, might take away the
difference which was between the Jews and the Gentiles; and having pulled down
the wall of separation, he might gather together from all parts the children of
God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whereas the eunuch came to Jerusalem to worship, it
must not be accounted any superstition. He might, indeed, have called
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F548</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
upon God in his own country, but this man would not omit the exercises which
were prescribed to the worshippers of God; and, therefore, this was his purpose,
not only to nourish faith privily
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F549</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in his heart, but also to make profession of the same amongst men. And yet,
notwithstanding, he could not be so divorced
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F550</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from his nation, but that he might well know that he should be hated of many.
But he made more account of the external profession of religion, which he knew
God did require, than of the favor of men. And if such a small sparkle of the
knowledge of the law did so shine in him, what a shame were it for us to choke
the perfect light of the gospel with unfaithful silence? If any do object that
the sacrifices were even then abrogated, and that now the time was come wherein
God would be called upon everywhere without difference of place, we may easily
answer, that those to whom the truth of the gospel was not yet revealed, were
retained in the shadows of the law without any superstition. For whereas it is
said that the law was abolished by Christ, as concerning the ceremonies, it is
thus to be understood, that where Christ showeth himself plainly, those rites
vanish away which prefigured him when he was absent. Whereas the Lord suffered
the eunuch to come to Jerusalem before he sent him a teacher, it is to be
thought that it was done for this cause, because it was profitable that he
should yet be framed by the rudiments of the law, that he might be made more apt
afterward to receive the doctrine of the gospel. And whereas God sent none of
the apostles unto him
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F551</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
at Jerusalem, the cause lieth hid in his secret counsel, unless, peradventure,
it were done that he might make more account of the gospel, as of some treasure
found suddenly, and offered unto him contrary to hope; or because it was better
that Christ should be set before him, after that being separated and withdrawn
from the external pomp of ceremonies and the beholding of the temple, he sought
the way of salvation quietly at such time as he was at rest.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F552</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He read
Esaias.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The reading of the prophet showeth that
the eunuch did not worship a God unadvisedly, according to the understanding of
his own head, whom he had reigned to himself, but whom he knew by the doctrine
of the law. And surely this is the right way to worship God, not to snatch at
bare and vain rites, but to adjoin the word thereunto, otherwise there shall be
nothing but that which cometh by chance and is confused. And certainly the form
of worshipping prescribed in the law differeth nothing from the inventions of
men, save only because God giveth light there by his word. Therefore, those
which are God&#8217;s scholars do worship aright only, that is, those who are
taught in his school. But he seemeth to lose his labor when he readeth without
profit. For he confesseth that he cannot understand the prophet&#8217;s meaning,
unless he be helped by some other teacher. I answer, as he read the prophet with
a desire to learn, so he hoped for some fruit, and he found it indeed.
Therefore, why doth he deny that he can understand the place which he had in
hand? For because
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F553</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he manifestly confesseth his ignorance in darker places. There be many things in
Isaiah which need no long exposition, as when he preacheth of the goodness and
power of God, partly that he may invite men unto faith, partly that he may
exhort and teach them to lead a godly life. Therefore, no man shall be so rude
an idiot
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F554</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which shall not profit somewhat by reading that book, and yet, notwithstanding,
he shall, peradventure, scarce understand every tenth verse. Such was the
eunuch&#8217;s reading. For seeing that, according to his capacity, he gathered
those things which served to edification, he had some certain profit by his
studies. Nevertheless, though he were ignorant of many things,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F555</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet was he not wearied, so that he did cast away the book. Thus must we also
read the Scriptures. We must greedily, and with a prompt mind, receive those
things which are plain, and wherein God openeth his mind. As for those things
which are hid from us, we must pass them over until we see greater light. And if
we be not wearied with reading, it shall at length come to pass that the
Scripture shall be made more familiar by continual use.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
How should I?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Most excellent modesty of the
eunuch, who doth not only permit Philip who was one of the common sort, to
question with him, but doth also willingly
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F556</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
confess his ignorance. And surely we must never hope that he will ever show
himself apt to be taught who is puffed up with the confidence of his own wit.
Hereby it eometh to pass that the reading of the Scriptures doth profit so few
at this day, because we can scarce find one amongst a hundred who submitteth
himself willingly to learn. For whilst all men almost are ashamed to be ignorant
of that whereof they are ignorant, every man had rather proudly nourish his
ignorance than seem to be scholar to other men. Yea, a great many take upon them
haughtily to teach other men. Nevertheless, let us remember that the eunuch did
so confess his ignorance, that yet, notwithstanding, he was one of God&#8217;s
scholars when he read the Scripture. This is the true reverence of the
Scripture, when as we acknowledge that there is that wisdom laid up there which
surpasseth
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F557</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
all our senses; and yet notwithstanding, we do not loathe it, but, reading
diligently, we depend upon the revelation of the Spirit, and desire to have an
interpreter given us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He prayed Philip that he would come
up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is another token of modesty, that he
seeketh an interpreter and teacher. He might have rejected Philip according to
the pride of rich men; for it was a certain secret upbraiding of ignorance when
Philip said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Understandest thou
what thou readest?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But rich men think that they
have great injury done them if any man speak homely to them. And, therefore,
they break out by and by into these speeches, What is that to thee? or, What
hast thou to do with me? But the eunuch submitteth himself humbly to Philip that
by him he may be taught. Thus must we be minded if we desire to have God to be
our teacher, whose Spirit resteth upon the humble and meek,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;236602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
66:2.) And if any man, mistrusting himself, submit himself to be taught, the
angels shall rather come down from heaven
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F558</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
than the Lord will suffer us to labor in vain; though (as did the eunuch) we
must use all helps, which the Lord offereth unto us, for the understanding of
the Scriptures. Frantic men require inspirations and revelations
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F559</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from heaven, and, in the mean season, they contemn the minister of God, by whose
hand they ought to be governed. Other some, which trust too much to their own
wit, will vouchsafe to hear no man, and they will read no commentaries. But God
will not have us to despise those helps which he offereth unto us, and he
suffereth not those to escape scot free which despise the same. And here we must
remember, that the Scripture is not only given us, but that interpreters and
teachers are also added, to be helps to us. For this cause the Lord sent rather
Philip than an angel to the eunuch. For to what end served this circuit, that
God calleth Philip by the voice of the angel, and sendeth not the angel himself
forthwith, save only because he would accustom us to hear men? This is,
assuredly, no small commendation of external preaching, that the voice of God
soundeth in the mouth of men to our salvation, when angels hold their peace.
Concerning which thing, I will speak more upon the ninth and tenth
chapters.</font><br></div>

that it came to pass by the wonderful providence of God, that Philip should have
a proposition or principle from which the whole sum of Christianity might be
set.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F560</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore, first, he hath matter of full instruction brought to his hand by the
secret direction of the Spirit; secondly, the form is plainly applied to the
ministry of man. This is an excellent prophecy of Christ, and above all others
to be remembered; because Isaiah saith plainly there
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F561</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that such should be the manner of redeeming the Church, that the Son of God do
by his death purchase life for men, that he offereth himself in sacrifice to
purge
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F562</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
men&#8217;s sins, that he be punished with the hand of God, and that he go down
even unto the very hell, that he may exalt us unto heaven, having delivered us
from destruction. In sum, this place teacheth plainly how men are reconciled to
God, how they obtain righteousness, how they come to the kingdom of God, being
delivered from the tyranny of Satan, and loosed from the yoke of sin; to be
brief, whence they must fetch all parts of their salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Notwithstanding, I will only expound those things
which Luke here citeth, and there be, indeed, two members. In the former, he
teacheth that Christ, to the end he may redeem the Church,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F563</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
must needs be so broken, that he appear like to a man which is cast down and
past hope. Secondly, he affirmeth that his death shall give life, and that there
shall a singular triumph issue out of great despair. Whereas he compareth Christ
to a lamb, which suffereth itself to be led and slain, and to a sheep, which
offereth herself meekly to be shorn; his meaning is, that the sacrifice of
Christ shall be voluntary. And surely this was the way to appease God&#8217;s
wrath, in that he showed himself obedient. He spake, indeed, before Pilate,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431834&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
18:34, 36,) but not to save his life, but rather that he might willingly offer
himself to die,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F564</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as he was appointed by the Father, and so might bring that punishment upon
himself which was prepared for us. Therefore the prophet teacheth both things,
that Christ must needs have suffered that he might purchase life for us, and
that he was to suffer death willingly, that he might blot out the stubbornness
of men by his obedience. And hence must we gather an exhortation unto godliness,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F565</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as Peter doth; but that doctrine of faith which I have already touched is former
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F566</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in order.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>33.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In his humility his
judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The eunuch had either the Greek
volume, or else Luke did set down the reading which was then used, as he useth
to do. The prophet saith that Christ was exalted out of sorrow and judgment, by
which words he signifieth a wonderful victory, which immediately ensued his
casting down. For if he had been oppressed with death, there could nothing have
been hoped for at his hands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, to the end the prophet may establish our
faith in Christ, after that he had described him to be stricken with the hand of
God, and to be subject to be slain,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F567</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he putteth upon him a new person now; to wit, that he cometh up out of the depth
of death as a conqueror, and out of the very hell, being the author of eternal
Life. I know, indeed, that this place is diversely expounded. Some there be
which understand by this, that he was carried from the prison to the cross;
other some there be who think that to be taken away doth signify as much as to
be brought to nought. And, indeed, the signification of the Hebrew word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">hjl</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>lachah</i>) is doubtful,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F568</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as is also the signification of the Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">airesqai</font><font face="Palatino">.
But he which shall thoroughly weigh the text, [context,] shall agree with me in
that which I have said, that he passeth now from that doleful and unseemly sight
which he had set before our eyes, unto the new beginning of unlooked-for glory.
Therefore the Greek interpretation differeth not much from the words of the
prophet in the sum of the matter. For Christ&#8217;s judgment was exalted in his
humility or casting down; because at such time as he might seem to be cast down
and oppressed, the Father maintained his cause. After this sort
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgment
</i></font><font face="Palatino">shall be taken in this place (as in many other)
for <i>right</i>. But it signifieth <i>condemnation</i> in the Hebrew text. For
the prophet saith, that after that Christ shall be brought into great straits,
and shall be like unto a condemned and lost man, he shall be lifted up by the
hand of the Father. Therefore the meaning of the words is, that Christ must
first have suffered death, before the Father should exalt him unto the glory of
his kingdom; which doctrine must be translated unto the whole body of the
Church; because all the godly ought wonderfully to be lifted up with the hand of
God, that they be not swallowed up of death. But when God appeareth to be the
revenger of his, he doth not only restore them to life but also, getteth to them
excellent triumphs of many deaths, as Christ did triumph most gloriously upon
the cross; whereof the apostle maketh mention in the Colossians
2.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His
generation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After that the prophet hath set
forth the victorious death of Christ, he addeth now that his victory shall not
last only for a small time, but shall go beyond all number of years. For the
exclamation of the prophet importeth as much as if he should deny that the
perpetuity of Christ&#8217;s kingdom can be expressed by the tongue of men. But
interpreters have wrested this place miserably. Whereas the old writers have
endeavored hereby to prove the Eternal Generation of the Word of God against
Arius, it is too far dissenting from the prophet&#8217;s mind.
Chrysostom&#8217;s exposition is never a whit truer, who referreth it unto the
human generation. Neither do they understand the prophet&#8217;s meaning, which
suppose that he inveigheth against the men of that age. Other some think better,
who take it to be spoken of the Church, save only that they are deceived in the
word generation, which they think doth signify a posterity or issue. But the
word
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">rd</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>dor</i>,) which the prophet useth, signifieth, amongst the Hebrews, <i>an
age</i>, or the continuance of man&#8217;s life. Therefore, undoubtedly this is
the prophet&#8217;s meaning, that Christ&#8217;s life shall endure for ever,
when as he shall be once delivered by his Father&#8217;s grace from death;
although this life, which is without end, appertaineth unto the whole body of
the Church; because Christ rose, not that he may live for hlmself, but for us.
Therefore, he extolleth now in the members
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F569</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the fruit and effect of that victory which he placed in the Head. Wherefore
every one of the faithful may conceive sure hope of eternal life out of this
place; secondly, the perpetuity of the Church is rather avouched in the person
of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because his life is taken from the
earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is, to look to, (to be) a very
absurd reason, that Christ doth reign with such renown in heaven and earth,
because he was cut off. For who can believe that death is the cause of life? But
this was done by the wonderful counsel of God, that hell should be a ladder,
whereby Christ should ascend into heaven; that reproach should be unto him a
passage into life; that the joyful brightness of salvation should appear out of
the horror and darkness of the cross; that blessed immortality should flow from
the deep pit of death. Because he humbled himself, therefore the Father exalted
him, that every knee may bow before him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;502910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The eunuch said to
Philip.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here it appeareth what an earnest
desire the eunuch had to learn. He wandereth in divers prophecies of Isaiah as
through doubtful boughts,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F570</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and yet he is not weary of reading. And whilst that he arrogateth nothing to
himself, he getteth far more, contrary to his hope, even at a sudden, than he
could get during his whole life by taking great pains, if he had brought all his
quickness of wit. So the Lord will be unto us a Master, though we be but small,
if, acknowledging our ignorance, we be not loth to submit ourselves to learn.
And as the seed, covered with earth, lieth hid for a time, so the Lord will
illuminate us by his Spirit, and will cause that reading which, being barren and
void of fruit, causeth nothing but wearisomeness, to have plain light of
understanding. The Lord doth never keep the eyes of his so shut, but that so
soon as they are once entered, the way of salvation appeareth unto them in the
Scripture; but that they profit ever now and then a little by reading. Yet doth
he suffer them to stick fast oftentimes, and permitteth their course to be
hindered by some bar which is laid in the way, both that he may try patience of
faith in them, and also that he may teach them humility, by putting them in mind
of their ignorance, that he may make them more attentive after that they have
shaken off drowsiness; that he may make them more fervent in prayer; that he may
prick them forward to love the truth more dearly; that he may set forth the
excellence of his heavenly wisdom, which is otherwise not so esteemed as it
ought. But howsoever the faithful do not attain unto the mark of perfect
knowledge, yet they shall always perceive that their labor is not in vain, so
that they stop not the way before themselves with proud loathsomeness.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Philip, opening his
mouth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To open the mouth is taken in Scripture
for, to begin a long speech concerning some grave and weighty matter. Therefore
Luke&#8217;s meaning is, that Philip began to intreat [discourse] of Christ, as
it were, with full mouth. He saith that he began with this prophecy, because
there is no one which depainteth out Christ more lively;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F573</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and it was then brought
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F574</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to his hand. Therefore, after that Philip had showed, by the prophet&#8217;s
words, after what sort Christ should come, and what was to be hoped for at his
hands, he conferred the thing itself afterward, that the eunuch might know that
that Christ which was promised was already revealed and given, and that he might
understand his power. Where we translate it, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he preached
Christ,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke saith that he preached the gospel.
The sense is, that he taught that of Christ which he uttered in his gospel
himself, and commanded to be taught; whereby we gather, that when Christ is
known, we have the sum of the gospel.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>36.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What letteth
me?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The eunuch&#8217;s baptism ensueth now,
whence we gather how greatly he profited in a small time, seeing he offereth
himself willingly to give Christ his name. For it must needs be that faith was
after a sort ripe in his heart, seeing that he brake out into external
profession with such desire. I like not that which Chrysostom noteth, that he
was kept back with modesty from requiring baptism plainly; for that
interrogation hath greater vehemency than if he should simply have said to
Philip, I will have thee to baptize me. But we see that Christ was preached to
him in such sort, that he knew that baptism was a sign of new life in him, and
that therefore he would not neglect the same, because it was added to the word,
and such an addition as was inseparable. Therefore, as he embraced that
willingly which he heard concerning Christ, so now he breaketh out with a godly
zeal into the external confession of faith; neither doth he think it sufficient
for him to believe inwardly before God, unless he testifieth before men that he
is a Christian. There might many things have come into his mind, which might
have kept him back from being baptized, lest that he should lay himself open to
the hatred and rebukes both of the queen, and also of the whole nation. But he
denieth that any of these things doth hinder him from desiring to be numbered
amongst the disciples of Christ. If being instructed but a few hours he came to
this point, how filthy is the sluggishness of those men who suppress the faith
which they have conceived, having been taught five, ten, or twenty years?
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou believest with all thy
heart.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Whereas the eunuch is not admitted to
baptism, until he have made confession of his faith, we must fetch a general
rule hence, That those ought [not] to be received into the Church, who were
estranged from the same before, until they have testified that they believe in
Christ. For baptism is, as it were, an appurtenance of faith, and therefore it
is later in order. Secondly, if it be given without faith whose seal it is, it
is both a wicked and also too gross a profaning. But frantic fellows do both
unskillfully and also wickedly impugn baptizing of infants under color hereof.
Why was it meet that faith should go before baptism in the eunuch? To wit,
because seeing that Christ marketh those alone which are of the household of the
Church with this note and mark, they must be ingrafted unto the Church who are
to be baptized. And as it is certain that those who are grown up are ingrafted
by faith, so I say that the children of the godly are born the children of the
Church, and that they are accounted members of Christ from the womb, because God
adopteth us upon this condition, that he may be also the Father of our seed.
Therefore, though faith be requisite in those which are grown up, yet this is
untruly translated unto infants whose estate is far unlike. But certain great
men have abused this place, when as they would prove that faith hath no
confirmation by baptism. For they reasoned thus, The eunuch is commanded to
bring perfect faith unto baptism, therefore there could nothing be added. But
the Scripture taketh the whole</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"> oftentimes for a <i>sincere</i> and
unfeigned heart, whose opposite is a double heart. So that there is no cause why
we should imagine that they believe perfectly who believe with the whole heart,
seeing that there may be a weak and faint faith in him who shall,
notwithstanding, have a sound mind, and a mind free from all hypocrisy. Thus
must we take that which David saith, That he loveth the Lord with all his heart.
Philip had, indeed, baptized the Samaritans before, and yet he knew that they
were yet far from the mark. Therefore, the faith of the whole heart is that
which, having living roots in the heart, doth yet notwithstanding desire to
increase daily.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I believe that Jesus
Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As baptism is grounded in Christ, and
as the truth and force thereof is contained there, so the eunuch setteth Christ
alone before his eyes. The eunuch knew before that there was one God, who had
made the covenant with Abraham, who gave the law by the hand of Moses, which
separated one people from the other nations, who promised Christ, through whom
he would be merciful to the world. Now he confesseth that Jesus Christ is that
Redeemer of the world, and the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Son of God;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> under which title he comprehendeth
briefly all those things which the Scripture attributeth to Christ. This is the
perfect faith whereof Philip spake of late, which receiveth Christ, both as he
was promised in times past, and also showed at length, and that with the earnest
affection of the heart, as Paul will not have this faith to be feigned.
Whosoever hath not this when he is grown up, in vain doth he boast of the
baptism of his infancy. For to this end doth Christ admit infants by baptism,
that so soon as the capacity of their age shall suffer, they may addict
themselves to be his disciples, and that being baptized with the Holy Ghost,
they may comprehend, with the understanding of faith, his power which baptism
doth prefigure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>38.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They went down into the
water.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here we see the rite used among the men
of old time in baptism; for they put all the body into the water. Now the use is
this, that the minister doth only sprinkle the body or the head. But we ought
not to stand so much about such a small difference of a ceremony, that we should
therefore divide the Church, or trouble the same with brawls. We ought rather to
fight even an hundred times to death for the ceremony itself of baptism,
inasmuch as it was delivered us by Christ that that we should suffer the same to
be taken from us. But forasmuch as we have as well a testimony of our washing,
as of newness of life, in the figure of water; forasmuch as Christ representeth
unto us his blood in the water as in a glass, that we may fet
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F575</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
our cleanness thence; forasmuch as he teacheth that we are fashioned again by
his Spirit, that being dead to sin, we may live to righteousness; it is certain
that we want nothing which maketh to the substance of baptism. Wherefore the
Church did grant liberty to herself, since the beginning, to change the rites
somewhat, excepting this substance. For some dipped them thrice, some but once.
Wherefore there is no case why we should be so straitlaced in matters which are
of no such weight;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F576</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so that external pomp do no whit pollute the simple institution of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>39.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
When they were come up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To the end Luke may at
length conclude his speech concerning the eunuch, he saith that Philip was
caught away out of his sight. And that was of no small weight to confirm him,
forasmuch as he saw that that man was sent unto him by God like to an angel, and
that he vanished away before he could offer him any reward for all his pains;
whence he might gather that it was no gainful insinuation, seeing that he was
vanished away before he had one halfpenny given him. Whereas Philip had no
reward at the eunuch&#8217;s hand, let the servants of Christ learn hereby to
serve him freely, or rather let them so serve men for nothing that they hope for
a reward from heaven. The Lord granteth leave, indeed, to the ministers of the
gospel to receive a reward at their hands whom they teach,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 9:9,) but he forbiddeth them therewithal to be hirelings which labor
for lucre&#8217;s sake,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
10:12, 13.) For this must be the mark whereat they must shoot, to gain the men
themselves to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rejoicing.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Faith and the knowledge of God bring forth this fruit always of themselves. For
what truer matter of joy can be invented than when the Lord doth not only set
open unto us the treasures of his mercy, but poureth out his heart into us,
(that I may so speak,) and giveth us himself in his Son, that we may want
nothing to perfect felicity? The heavens begin to look clear, and the earth
beginneth to be quiet then; the conscience being then delivered from the doleful
and horrible feelings of God&#8217;s wrath, being loosed from the tyranny of
Satan, escaping out of the darkness of death, beholdeth the light of life.
Therefore it is a solemn thing amongst the prophets to exhort us to be joyful
and to triumph, so often as they are about to speak of the kingdom of Christ.
But because those men whose minds are possessed with the vain joys of the world,
cannot lift up themselves unto this spiritual joy, let us learn to despise the
world and all vain delights thereof, that Christ may make us merry
indeed.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
Saul.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke setteth down in this place a noble
history, and a history full well worthy to be remembered, concerning the
conversion of Paul; after what sort the Lord did not only bring him under, and
make him subject to his commandment, when he raged like an untamed beast but
also how he made him another and a new man. But because Luke setteth down all
things in order as in a famous work of God, it shall be more convenient to
follow his text, [context,] that all may come in order whatsoever is worth the
noting. When as he saith, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he
breathed out threatenings and slaughter as yet,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
his meaning is, that after that his hands were once imbued with innocent blood,
he proceeded in like cruelty, and was always a furious and bloody enemy to the
Church, after that he had once made that entrance
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F578</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
whereof mention is made in the death of Stephen. For which cause it was the more
incredible that he could be so suddenly tamed. And whereas such a cruel wolf was
not only turned into a sheep, but did also put on the nature of a shepherd, the
wonderful hand of God did show itself therein manifestly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b> And Luke describeth therewithal that he was
furnished with weapons and power to do hurt, when as he saith that he had
<i>obtained </i>letters of the highest priest, that he might bring all those
bound to Jerusalem whom he should find professing the name of Christ. There is
mention made of women, that it may the better appear how desirous he was to shed
blood who had no respect of sex whom even armed enemies are wont to spare in the
heat of war. Therefore he setteth forth before us a fierce and cruel beast who
had not only liberty given him to rage, but had also his power increased to
devour and destroy godly men, as if a madman had a sword put into his hand.
Whereas I have translated it sect, Luke hath way, which metaphor is common
enough in the Scriptures. Therefore Paul&#8217;s purpose was quite to put out
the name of Christ by destroying all the godly cruelly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
As he was in the way.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In craving epistles of
the high priest, he ran headlong against Christ willingly; and now he is
enforced to obey whether he will or no. This is surely the most excellent mercy
of God, in that that man is reclaimed unto salvation contrary to the purpose of
his mind, whom so great a heat carried headlong into destruction. Whereas the
Lord suffereth him to receive letters, and to come near to the city; (whereby we
see how well he knoweth the very instants of times to do everything in due time;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F579</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)
he could have prevented him sooner, if it had seemed good to him so to do, that
he might deliver the godly from fear and carelessness.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F580</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But he setteth out his benefits more thereby, in that he tieth the jaws of the
greedy wolf, even when he was ready to enter the sheepfold. Also we know that
men&#8217;s stubbornness increaseth more and more by going forward. Wherefore
the conversion of Paul was so much the harder, forasmuch as he was already made
more obstinate by continuing his fury.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shined about
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Because it was no easy matter to pull down
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F581</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
so great pride to break such a lofty courage, to pacify such a blind heat of
wicked zeal, and, finally, to bridle a most unbridled beast, Christ must needs
have showed some sign of his majesty, whereby Paul might perceive that he had to
do with God himself, and not with any mortal man;. although there were some
respect had of humbling him, (because he was unworthy to have Christ,) to
accustom him by and by to obey, by laying upon his neck the meek and sweet yoke
of his Spirit. And he was scarce capable of so great gentleness, until his
cruelty might be broken.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F582</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Man&#8217;s sense cannot comprehend the Divine glory of Christ as it is; but as
God did oftentimes put upon him forms wherein he did show himself, so Christ did
now declare and make manifest his divinity to Paul, and showed some token of his
presence, that he might thereby terrify Paul. For although the godly be afraid
and tremble at the seeing of God, yet it must needs be that Paul was far more
afraid when as he perceived that the divine power of Christ was set full against
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b> And therefore Luke saith that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fell to the
ground.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For what other thing can befall man,
but that he must lie prostrate and be, as it were, brought to nothing, when he
is overwhelmed with the present feeling of God&#8217;s glory? And this was the
first beginning of the bringing down of Paul, that he might become apt to hear
the voice of Christ, which he had despised so long as he sat haughtily upon his
horse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Saul,
Saul!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke compared the light which shined
round about Paul to lightning, though I do not doubt but that lightnings did fly
in the air. And this voice, which Christ did send out to beat down his pride,
may full well be called a <i>lightning </i>or<i> thunderbolt,</i> because it did
not only strike him, and make him astonished, but did quite kill him, so that he
was now as nobody with himself, who did so much please himself before and did
challenge to himself authority to put the gospel to flight. Luke putteth down
his name in Hebrew in this place,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Saul,
Saul!</i></font><font face="Palatino"> because he repeateth the words of Christ,
who spake unto him, undoubtedly, according to the common custom of the
country.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who art thou,
Lord?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We have Paul now somewhat tamed, but he
is not yet Christ&#8217;s disciple. Pride is corrected in him, and his fury is
brought down. But he is not yet so thoroughly healed that he obeyeth Christ; he
is only ready to receive commandments, who was before a blasphemer. Therefore,
this is the question of a man that is afraid, and thrown down with amazedness.
For why doth he not know, by so many signs of God&#8217;s presence, that it is
God that speaketh? Therefore that voice proceeded from a panting and doubtful
mind; therefore, Christ driveth him nigher unto repentance, When he addeth,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am
Jesus,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> let us remember that that voice sounded
from heaven. Therefore it ought to have pierced the mind of Paul when he
considered that he had made war against God hitherto. It ought to have brought
him by and by to true submission, when he considered that he should not escape
scot free, if he should continue rebellious against him whose hand he could not
escape.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This place containeth a most profitable doctrine, and
the profit thereof is made manifold, for Christ showeth what great account he
maketh of his gospel, when he pronounceth that it is his cause, from which he
will not be separated. Therefore he can no more refuse to defend the same than
he can deny himself. Secondly, the godly may gather great comfort by this, in
that they hear that the Son of God is partner with them of the cross, when as
they suffer and labor for the testimony of the gospel, and that he doth, as it
were, put under his shoulders, that he may bear some part of the burden. For it
is not for nothing that he saith that he suffereth in our person; but he will
have us to be assuredly persuaded of this, that he suffereth together with us,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F583</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as if the enemies of the gospel should wound us through his side. Wherefore Paul
saith, that that is wanting in the sufferings of Christ what persecutions soever
the faithful suffer at this day for the defense of the gospel,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510124&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:24.) Furthermore, this consolation tendeth not only to that end to comfort us,
that it may not be troublesome to us to suffer with our Head, but that we may
hope that he will revenge our miseries, who crieth out of heaven that all that
which we suffer is common to him as well as to us. Lastly, we gather hereby what
horrible judgment is prepared for the persecutors of the Church, who like giants
besiege the very heaven, and shake their darts, which shall pierce
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F584</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
their own head by and by; yea, by troubling the heavens, they provoke the
thunderbolt of God&#8217;s wrath against themselves. Also, we are all taught
generally, that no man run against Christ by hurting his brother unjustly, and
specially, that no man resist the truth rashly and with a blind madness, under
color of zeal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is hard for
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is a proverbial sentence, taken from
oxen or horses, which, when they are pricked with goads, do themselves no good
by kicking, save only that they double the evil by causing the prick to go
farther into their skins. Christ applieth this similitude unto himself very
fitly, because men shall bring upon themselves a double evil, by striving
against him, who must of necessity be subject to his will and pleasure, will
they nill they. Those which submit themselves willingly to Christ are so far
from feeling any pricking at his hands, that they have in him a ready remedy for
all wounds; but all the wicked, who endeavor to cast out their poisoned stings
against him, shall at length perceive that they are asses and oxen, subject to
the prick. So that he is unto the godly a foundation whereon they rest, but unto
the reprobate who stumble at him, a stone which with his [its] hardness grindeth
them to powder. And although we speak here of the enemies of the gospel, yet
this admonition may reach farther, to wit, that we do not think that we shall
get any thing by biting the bridle so often as we have any thing to do with God,
but that being like to gentle horses, we suffer ourselves meekly to be turned
about and guided by his hand. And if he spur us at any time, let us be made more
ready to obey by his pricks, lest that befall us which is said in the Psalm,
That the jaws of untamed horses and mules are tied and kept in with a hard bit,
lest they leap upon us, etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this history we have a universal figure of that
grace which the Lord showeth forth daily in calling us all. All men do not set
themselves so violently against the gospel; yet, nevertheless, both pride and
also rebellion against God are naturally engendered in all men. We are all
wicked and cruel naturally; therefore, in that we are turned to God, that cometh
to pass by the wonderful and secret power of God, contrary to nature. The
Papists also ascribe the praise of our turning unto God to the grace of God; yet
only in part, because they imagine that we work together. But when as the Lord
doth mortify our flesh, he subdueth us and bringeth us under, as he did Paul.
Neither is our will one hair readier to obey than was Paul&#8217;s, until such
time as the pride of our heart be beaten down, and he have made us not only
flexible but also willing to obey and follow. Therefore, such is the beginning
of our conversion, that the Lord seeketh us of his own accord, when we wander
and go astray, though he be not called and sought; that he changeth the stubborn
affections of our heart, to the end he may have us to be apt to be
taught.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, this history is of great importance to
confirm Paul&#8217;s doctrine. If Paul had always been one of Christ&#8217;s
disciples, wicked and froward men might extenuate the weight of the testimony
which he giveth of his Master. If he should have showed himself to be easy to be
entreated, and gentle at the first, we should see nothing but that which is
proper to man. But when as a deadly enemy to Christ, rebellious against the
gospel, puffed up with the confidence which he reposed in his wisdom, inflamed
with hatred of the true faith, blinded with hypocrisy, wholly set upon the
overthrowing of the truth, [he] is suddenly changed into a new man, after an
unwonted manner, and of a wolf is not only turned into a sheep, but doth also
take to himself a shepherd&#8217;s nature, it is as if Christ should bring forth
with his hand some angel sent from heaven. For we do not now see that Saul of
Tarsus, but a new man framed by the Spirit of God; so that he speaketh by his
mouth now, as it were from heaven.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b> The fruit of that reprehension followeth,
wherewith we have said it was requisite that Paul should have been sore shaken,
that his hardness might be broken. For now he offereth himself as ready to do
whatsoever he should command him, whom of late he despised. For when he asketh
what Christ would have him do, he granteth him authority and power. Even the
very reprobate are also terrified with the threatening of God, so that they are
compelled to reverence him, and to submit themselves unto his will and pleasure;
yet, nevertheless, they cease not to fret and to foster stubbornness within. But
as God humbled Paul, so he wrought effectually in his heart. For it came not to
pass by any goodness of nature, that Paul did more willingly submit himself to
God than Pharaoh,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;020713&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
7:13;) but because, being like to an anvil, [Pharaoh] did, with his hardness,
beat back the whips of God wherewith he was to be brought under, (even as it had
been the strokes of a hammer;) but the heart of Paul was suddenly made a fleshy
heart of a stony heart, after that it received softness from the Spirit of God;
which softness it had not naturally. The same thing do we also try [experience]
daily in ourselves. He reproveth us by his word; he threateneth and terrifieth
us; he addeth also light correction, and prepareth us divers ways unto
subjection. But all these helps shall never cause any man to bring forth good
fruit, unless the Spirit of God do mollify his heart within.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord said unto
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After that Paul had put his stiff neck
under the yoke of Christ, he is now governed by his hand. For doubtless the Lord
doth not so bring us into the way, that he leaveth us either before we begin our
course, or in the midst thereof; but he bringeth us unto the very mark by little
and little. Luke depainteth out unto us in this place this continual course of
God&#8217;s governance. For He taketh him afterward unto himself to be taught
whom He hath made apt to be taught. Neither doth that any whit hinder that he
useth man&#8217;s ministry ill this point. Because the authority and power
remaineth nevertheless in him, howsoever he accomplish his work by man; though
it may seem an absurd thing that Christ, who is the Eternal Wisdom of God, doth
send a scholar (who was ready to hear, and did gape after instruction) unto
another
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F585</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
man, that he might learn. But I answer, that that was done not without cause.
For the Lord meant by this means to prove Paul&#8217;s modesty, when he sendeth
him to one of his scholars to be taught; as if he himself would not vouchsafe as
yet to speak unto him familiarly, but sendeth him to his servants whom he did of
late both so proudly contemn and so cruelly persecute.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we are also taught humility under his person. For
if Christ made Paul subject to the teaching of a common disciple, which of us
can grudge to hear any teacher, so that he be appointed by Christ, that is, he
declare himself to be his minister in deed? Therefore, whereas Paul is sent to
Ananias, let us know that that is done to adorn the ministry of the Church. This
is assuredly no small honor whereunto it pleaseth God to exalt mankind, when as
he chooseth our brethren from amongst us to be interpreters of his will; when as
he causeth his holy oracles to sound in the mouth of man, which is naturally
given to lying and vanity. But the unthankfulness of the world betrayeth itself
again herein, that no man can abide to hear when God speaketh by the mouth of
man. All men could desire to have angels come flying unto them, or that heaven
should be now and then cut asunder, and that the visible glory of God should
come thence. Forasmuch as this preposterous curiosity springeth from pride and
wicked contempt of the Word, it setteth open a gate to many dotings, and
breaketh the bond of mutual consent among the faithful. Therefore the Lord doth
testify, that it pleaseth him that we should be taught by men, and confirmeth
the order set down by himself. And to this purpose serve these titles, &#8220;He
which heareth you heareth me,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421016&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
10:16;) that he may cause his word to be reverenced as it
ought.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It shall be told
thee.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Christ putteth Ananias in his place by
these words, as touching the office of teaching; not because he resigneth his
authority to him, but because he shall be a faithful minister, and a sincere
preacher of the gospel. Therefore we must always use this moderation, that we
hear God alone in Christ, and Christ himself alone, yet as he speaketh by his
ministers. And these two vices must be avoided, that the ministers be not proud,
under color of such a precious function, or that their base condition impair no
whit of the dignity of heavenly wisdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And the men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He speaketh now briefly of the
companions of Paul, that they were witnesses of the vision. Yet it seemeth that
this narration doth not in all points agree with that of Paul, which we shall
see in the 22nd chapter,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;442209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
22:9.) For he will say there, that his companions were terrified with the light,
but they heard no voice. Some there be who think that it was a fault,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F586</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and that through ignorance of the writer
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F587</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the negation is placed out of its right place. I think that it is no hard matter
to answer it; because it may be that they heard the sound of the voice, yet did
they not discern either who it was that spake, or what was spoken. &#8220;They
heard not,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;the voice of him that spake with me.&#8221;
Surely this is the meaning of these words, that he alone knew the speech of
Christ. It followeth not thereupon, but that the rest might have heard a dark
and doubtful voice. Whereas Luke saith in this place that there was a voice
heard, and no man seen, his meaning is, that the voice proceeded from no man,
but that it was uttered by God. Therefore, to the end the miracle may carry the
greater credit, Paul&#8217;s companions see a light like to lightning; they see
Paul lie prostrate; a voice they hear (though not distinctly
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F588</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)
sounding from heaven; and yet, nevertheless, Paul alone is taught what he must
do.</font><br></div>

earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke addeth now, that he was taken with

also blind for a time, that he might forget his former wit and wiliness.

his eyes were covered, as it were, with scales; but the meaning of this place
is, that he was blind indeed, and deprived of his sight for that three days;
because when he opened his eyes he saw nothing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b> Whereas he saith, that he neither ate nor

For although the men of the east country endure hunger better than we, yet we do
not read that any did fast three days, save only those who had want of victual,
or who were constrained by some greater necessity. Therefore we gather that Paul
was wonderfully afraid,

rather chosen than any of the apostles, that Paul, having laid away the swelling
of his arrogancy, might learn to hear the least, and that he [might] come down
from too great loftiness even unto the lowest degree. And this vision was
necessary for Ananias, lest through fear he should withdraw himself from that
function which was enjoined him, to wit, to teach Paul. For though he know that
the Lord calleth him, yet he slideth back, or, at least, he excuseth himself.
Therefore it was requisite that he should have some certain testimony of his
calling, that there should happy success be promised to his labor, that he might
take that in hand with a joyful and valiant mind which the Lord commanded.
Furthermore, as Christ animateth and confirmeth Ananias, by appearing to him in
the vision, so he prepareth and maketh Paul ready for all things, that he may
receive Ananias reverently, as if he would receive an angel coming from heaven.
The Lord could have sent Paul straightway unto Ananias, and have showed him his
house, but this was more fit for his confirmation; because he knew the better
that the Lord had a care of him. And also the Lord setteth out his grace unto
us, that as he stopped Paul before, so now he reacheth him his hand of his own
accord, by his minister. And, in the mean season, we are also taught, by his

imaginations and visures.

hunger, because he was after a sort deprived of sense, as men which are in a
trance use to be. Christ doth assuredly speak of no short prayer
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F595</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in this place, but he doth rather show that Paul continued in this kind of
exercise until he should be more quiet in mind. For besides other causes of
terror, that voice might sound in his ears, &#8220;Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me?&#8221; And it is not to be doubted but that the careful

gladly go to some other place; but this is a point of a good man, that he

to fly to him for succor, invocation cannot be without sure confidence. By both

The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>instrument</i></font><font face="Palatino">
doth show that men can do nothing, save inasmuch as God useth their industry at
his pleasure. For if we be instruments, he alone is the author; the force and

of Paul appertaineth to all men, both one and other. Therefore how stoutly
soever every man labor, and how carefully soever he behave himself in his duty,
yet there is no cause why he should challenge to himself any part of praise.
Those which dispute subtilely about the word <i>vessel,</i> dote through
ignorance of the Hebrew tongue. Luke putteth the genitive ease for the dative
and that according to the common custom of the Hebrew tongue. And he meant to
express a certain excellency, as if he should have said, that this man shall be
no common minister of Christ, but shall be indued with singular excellency above
others. Nevertheless, we must note that if any thing be excellent, it dependeth
upon the favor of God, as Paul himself teacheth elsewhere. Who is he that
separateth thee? to wit, that thou shouldst excel others,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1

(<i>schenos</i>) for a<i> vessel</i>, this should be a continual metaphor,
because a minister of the gospel serveth instead of a vessel to publish the name

generally, I take these words<i> to carry my name</i>, for to extol the same
unto due honor. For Christ is placed after a sort in his princely throne when as
the world is brought under his power by the preaching of the

quiet, and the world to yield to him willingly; therefore Luke addeth, that he
shall be also taught to bear the cross. For the meaning of the words is, I will
accustom him to suffer troubles: to endure reproaches, and to abide all manner
[of] conflicts, that nothing may terrify him, and keep him back from doing his
duty. And when Christ maketh himself Paul&#8217;s teacher in this matter, he
teacheth that the more every man hath profited in his school, the more able is
he to bear the cross. For we strive against it, and refuse it as a thing most
contrary, until he make our minds more gentle. Also this place teacheth, that no
man is fit to preach the gospel, seeing the world is set against it, save only
he which is armed to suffer. Therefore if we will show ourselves faithful
ministers of Christ, we must not only crave at his hands the spirit of knowledge
and wisdom, but also of constancy and strength, that we may never be discouraged
by laboring and toiling; which is the estate of the godly.</font><br></div>

faith. Let the readers note out of the chapter next going before how this
ceremony is effectual to give the Spirit, But seeing Paul received the Spirit by
the hand of Ananias, the Papists are more than ridiculous, who will have the
bishops alone to lay on their hands.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There fell from his eyes as it
had been scales.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The blindness of Paul, as we
have said before did not proceed from fear alone or from amazedness; but by this
means was he admonished of his former blindness, that he might quite abandon
that boldness and vain confidence wherewith he was puffed up. He boasted that he
was taught at the feet of Gamaliel,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;442203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
22:3;) and undoubtedly he thought very well of his great wittiness,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F605</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which was notwithstanding mere blindness. Therefore he is deprived of the sight
of his body
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F606</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
three days, that he may begin to see with his mind; for those must become fools,
whosoever they be, which seem to themselves wise, that they may attain to true
wisdom. For seeing that Christ is the Sun of righteousness, in seeing without
him we see not; it is he also which openeth the eyes of the mind. Both things
were showed to Paul, and to us are they showed in his person; for he hath his
eyes covered with scales, that, condemning all his knowledge of ignorance,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F607</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he may learn that he hath need of new light, which he hath hitherto wanted; and
he is taught that he must let [seek] the true light from none other save only
from Christ, and that it is given by no other means save only through his
goodness. Furthermore, whereas being pined with three days hunger, he maketh no
haste to receive meat until he be baptized, thereby appeareth the earnest

desire he had to learn, because he refreshed not his body with meat until his
soul had received strength.</font><br></div>

Paul&#8217;s conversion was, to wit, that he came abroad by and by,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F609</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and did not only profess that he was a disciple of Christ, but did also set
himself against
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F610</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the fury and hatred of the enemies, by defending the gospel stoutly. Therefore,
he who of late ran headlong against Christ with furious force, doth now not only
submit himself meekly unto his will and pleasure but like a stout
standard-bearer fighteth even unto the utmost danger to maintain his glory.
Certain it is that he was not so quickly framed by Ananias&#8217; industry,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F611</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but that so soon as he had learned the first principles by man&#8217;s mouth, he
was extolled by God unto higher things afterward. He comprehendeth the sum of
his preaching briefly, when he saith that Christ was the Son of God. In the same
sense, he saith shortly after that he saw Christ. And understand thus much, that
when Paul intreated out of the law and the prophets of the true office of the
Messiah, he taught also that all whatsoever was promised of, and was to be hoped
for, at the hands of the Messiah, was revealed and given in Christ. For the
words signify thus much, when he saith that he preached that Christ is the Son
of God. That was undoubtedly a principle amongst the Jews, that there should a
Redeemer come from God, who should restore all things to a happy estate. Paul
teacheth that Jesus of Nazareth is he, which he cannot do, unless he shake off
those gross errors which he had conceived of the earthly kingdom of the Messiah.
Certain it is that Paul declared how Christ was promised in the law, and to what
end; but because all tended to this end, that he might prove that the son of
Mary was he of whom the law and the prophets bare witness, therefore Luke is
content with this one word only.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They were all
amazed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is added, that we may know that
the power of God was acknowledged. For seeing that the zeal of Paul against the
gospel was openly known, they saw no other cause of such a sudden change but the
hand of God. And, therefore, this is also one fruit of the miracle, that they
all wonder at him being made a new man so suddenly, so that his doctrine doth
the more move their minds. Whereas they say that he raged horribly with great
cruelty, and that he came of late to Damascus that he might proceed in his
purpose, these circumstances serve to augment the miracle. We must also note the
phrase, those which call on his name, which withesseth that the godly did so
profess the name of Christ, that they placed all their hope of salvation in him.
According to that, these</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Saul waxed
stronger.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke doth not only in this place
commend the bold zeal of Paul in confessing the faith of Christ, but also he
telleth us that he had strong reasons to convince the Jews. He waxed strong,
saith he, that is, he got the victory in disputation; his confession did carry
with it great force and efficacy,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F612</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because being furnished with testimonies of Scripture, and such other helps of
the Holy Ghost, he did, as it were, tread all his adversaries under his feet.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F613</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For the word confounded, which Luke useth, doth signify, that, forasmuch as Paul
did urge them out of measure, they were so stricken that they could not tell
where they were.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F614</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The manner of the confounding is expressed, because Paul proved that Jesus was
Christ. For the sense is this, that even when the Jews were most desirous to
resist, they were overcome and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>confounded.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
So that Paul tried [found] by experience, that that was most true which he
himself affirmeth, that the Scripture is profitable to convince,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;550316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 3:16.) Also, he performed that which he required elsewhere of a bishop
and teacher,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;560107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:7;) for he was armed with the word of God to maintain the truth. And Luke
setteth down two things, that Paul so got the victory in disputing that he
overthrew the Jews; and yet their stubbornness was not broken and tamed that
they yielded to the truth, because their consciences rage nevertheless inwardly,
and being thrown down from their false opinion, they do not submit themselves to
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whence had Paul this victory, save only because the
Scripture was his sword? Therefore, so often as heretics stand up to resist the
true faith, so often as wicked men endeavor to overthrow all godliness, so often
as the ungodly do obstinately resist, let us remember that we must fet [seek]
armor hence. Because the Papists find no weapons in Scripture, yea, because they
see that it maketh quite against them, they fly into this miserable fortress
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F615</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they must not dispute with heretics, and that there can no certain thing be
set down out of Scripture. But if Satan himself be vanquished with the sword of
the word, why shall it not be able to put heretics to flight? not that they will
submit themselves, or make an end of murmuring,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F616</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but because they shall lie overcome in themselves.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F617</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And if so be it we covet to escape this trouble, let us raise no tumults against
God, but let us, with a quiet and meek spirit, receive that peace which the
Scripture offereth us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When many days were
fulfilled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He saith that many days were
expired, that we may know that Paul had some space of time granted him wherein
he might do good. For although the Jews did resist him even from the first day,
yet the Lord did not suffer the course which he had begun well to be broken off
so soon, so he doth with his wonderful counsel hinder the purposes of the
enemies, stay their endeavors, restrain their malice and madness, whilst that he
furthereth
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F618</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the gospel; and also we see what the hatred of the truth doth. For when the
wicked see that they are unable to resist, they are carried headlong into bloody
fury. They would gladly contemn the word of God if they could; but because they
are enforced, whether they will or no, to feel the force thereof, they run
headlong, like furious beasts, with blind violence.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F619</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The unadvised and rash heat of zeal will always almost break out into such
cruelty, unless men suffer themselves to be ruled by the word of God. This is,
assuredly, horrible blindness. For why are they so mad, save only because their
wounded conscience doth vex them? But God doth by this means punish their
hypocrisy, who do, therefore, hate sound religion; because, being friends of
darkness, they fly the light.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, we see how sweetly these preposterous
zealous fellows
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F620</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
grant themselves liberty to do whatsoever them lusteth, when Satan hath once
pricked them forward to persecute the truth. For they fear not to take counsel,
under color of zeal, to put a man to death, which they know is mere wickedness,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F621</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as at this day the Papists think that they may do whatsoever they will, so they
can quench the doctrine of the gospel. They rage not only with sword, but they
go about by lying in wait, by treachery, and by most execrable means, to destroy
us. We must, first, beware that that do not befall us, that we entangle not
ourselves in the defense of evil causes; secondly, that we handle those causes
well which we know are good. But it is to be thought that they laid wait for
Paul privily; that done, when they could do no good this way, it is likely that
they came to the governor of the city, and that then the gates were watched,
that they might by one means or other catch him. For Paul saith that Aretas, the
king&#8217;s governor, commanded that which Luke attributeth in this place to
the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
The disciples having taken him by night.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There
is a question moved here, whether it were lawful for the disciples to save Paul
thus or no? and also, whether it were lawful for Paul to escape danger by this
means or no? For the laws say that the walls of cities are holy, [sacred,] and
that the gates are holy. Therefore, he ought rather to have suffered death, than
to have suffered a public order to be broken for his sake. I answer, that we
must consider why it is decreed by the laws that the walls should not be
violated; to wit, that the cities may not be laid open to murders and robberies,
and that the cities may be free
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F622</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from treason. That reason ceaseth when the question is concerning the delivery
of an innocent man. Therefore, it was no less lawful for the faithful to be let
down in a basket, than it shall be lawful for any private person to leap over a
wall, that he may avoid
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F623</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the sudden invasion of the enemy. Cicero doth handle this latter member, and he
setteth down very well, that although the law forbid a stranger to come near the
wall, yet doth not he offend who shall go up upon the wall to save the city,
because the laws must always be inclined
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F624</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to equity. Therefore Paul is not to be blamed, because he escaped by stealth,
seeing that he doth that without raising any tumult amongst the people.
Nevertheless, we see how the Lord useth to humble those that be his, seeing that
Paul is enforced to steal his life from the watchmen of the city if he will save
himself. Therefore, he reckoneth this example amongst his infirmities. He was
acquainted betime with the cross

of him. Therefore, he doth patiently suffer the brethren to refuse his company,
seeing they had just cause of fear. This was true conversion, that whereas he
raged horribly before, he doth now valiantly suffer the storms of persecutions;
and, in the mean season, when as he cannot be admitted into the company of the
godly, he waiteth with a quiet mind until God reconcile them unto him. We must
diligently note what he desireth, to wit, that he may be numbered amongst the
disciples of Christ. This can he not obtain. Here is no ambition, but he was to
be instructed by this means to make more account even of the lowest place
amongst the disciples of Christ than of all masterships in corrupt and revolted

But he doth either extenuate or lighten their fault, because they suspected him
for just causes, whom they had found and tried

to be such a deadly enemy; and, it was to be feared, lest they should rashly
endanger themselves if they should have showed themselves to be so easy to
entreat. Therefore, I think that they are not to be blamed for that fear which
they conceived for just cause, or that they deserve to be even accused for the
same. For if they had been called to give an account of their faith, they would
have provoked

not Paul only, but also all the furies of hell, without fear. Whence we gather
that every fear is not to be condemned but such as causeth us to turn aside from
our duty. The narration which Luke addeth may be referred as well unto the
person of Barnabas as of Paul. Yet I think rather that Paul declareth to the
apostles what had befallen him; and yet the speech may be well applied to
Barnabas, especially when as mention is made of Paul&#8217;s
boldness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b> Luke saith afterwards that Paul <i>went in
and out with the disciples,</i> which speech signifieth amongst the Hebrews
familiarity, as the inhabitants of cities are said to go in and out at the gates
of the city. Therefore after that Paul was commended by the testimony of
Barnabas, he began to be counted one of the flock, that he might be thoroughly
known to the Church. Luke saith again that he dealt boldly in the name of the
Lord, by which words he commendeth his (stoutness and) courage in professing the
gospel. For he durst never have whispered amidst so many lets, unless he had
been endowed with rare constancy. Nevertheless, all men are taught what they
ought to do; to wit, every man according to the measure of his faith. For though
all be not Pauls, yet the faith of Christ ought to engender in our minds so
great boldness, that we be not altogether dumb when we have need to speak. I
take</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the name of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"> in this place for the profession of the
gospel; in this sense, that Paul defended Christ&#8217;s cause

the world. Those men were wont to come together

to Jerusalem to worship. And it is to be thought that Paul disputed rather with
strangers and aliens,

than with those who dwelt at Jerusalem,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F636</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because this latter sort would never have abidden him, neither had it been
wisely done to come in their sight. Therefore being excluded from those who knew
him before he tried whether there were any hope to do good amongst men whom he
knew not, so that he did most stoutly whatsoever concerned the duty of a valiant
soldier.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They would have slain
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Behold, again, fury instead of zeal; and
it cannot otherwise be, but that hypocrisy and superstition will be cruel and
fierce. The godly must be incensed with an holy wrath, when they see the pure
truth of God corrupted with false and wicked opinions; yet, so that they
moderate their zeal, that they set down nothing until they have thoroughly
weighed the cause; and, secondly, that they essay to bring those into the way
who wander out of the same. Lastly, that if they see their stubbornness to be
past hope, they themselves take not the sword in hand, because they must know
that they have no authority granted them of the Lord to (punish or) revenge. But
hypocrites are always ready to shed blood before they know the matter; so that
superstition is bloody, through blind and headlong fury. But Paul, who of late
ran up and down to vex the godly, can abide nowhere now.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F637</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And yet this estate was far better for him, than if he should have reigned in
peace and quietness, driving the godly everywhere out of their
places.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b> In that he went to Tarsus, he did it
undoubtedly to this end, that he might carry the doctrine of the gospel thither,
because he hoped that he should have some favor and authority in his country,
where he was famous; yet was he brought thither by the brethren, that they might
deliver him from the lying in wait.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then the
Churches.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke&#8217;s meaning is, that the
enemies of the gospel were greatly provoked by Paul&#8217;s presence. For why
was there such peace made suddenly by his departure, save only because the very
sight of him did provoke the fury of the enemies? And yet this is no reproach to
him, as if he had been, as it were, some trumpet in war; but Luke doth rather
commend him for this, because he made the wicked run mad, only with the smell of
him when he was near them. For Christ meant so to triumph in him, that he might
be no less a trouble than an ornament to his Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore we are taught by this example that those
are not by and by
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F638</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to be condemned, who inflame the madness of the wicked more than others; which
admonition is not a little profitable. For as we are too dainty and too much
besotted with the love of our own rest, so we be also sometimes angry with the
best and most excellent servants of Christ, if we think that through their
vehemency the wicked are pricked forward to do hurt; and by this means we do
injury to the Spirit of God, whose force and speech kindleth all that
flame.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And whereas Luke saith, that the Churches had peace,
let us know that it was not continual, but because the Lord granted his servants
some short breathing. For thus doth he bear with
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F639</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
our infirmity, when he appeaseth or mitigateth the winds and storms of
persecutions, lest if they should hold on still, they should urge us out of
measure. And this blessing is not to be despised, neither is it any common
blessing, when as the Churches have peace. But Luke addeth other things, which
are of far more value; to wit, that the Churches were edified, they walked in
the fear of God, and they were filled with the consolation of the Spirit. For as
we are wont to riot and exceed in time of peace, the Churches are more happy,
for the most part, amidst the tumults of war, than if they should enjoy what
rest they would desire. But and if holy conversation, and the consolation of the
Spirit, whereby their state doth flourish, be taken away, they lose not only
their felicity, but they come to nought. Therefore, let us learn not to abuse
external peace in banqueting and idleness; but the more rest we have given us
from our enemies, to encourage ourselves to go forward in godliness whilst we
may. And if at any time the Lord let loose the bridle to the wicked to trouble
us, let the inward consolation of the Spirit be sufficient for us. Finally, as
well in peace as in war, let us always joyfully go forward toward him who hath a
reward for us.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F640</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Edification may be taken either for increase; to wit,
whilst the Churches are augmented with the number of the faithful, or for their
going forward who are already in the flock; to wit, whilst they have new gifts
given them, and have greater confirmation of godliness. In the first
signification it shall be referred unto the persons; in the second unto the
gifts of the Spirit. I embrace both willingly; that there were some every now
and then gathered unto the Church who were strangers before, and those who were
of the household of the Church did increase in godliness and other virtues.
Furthermore, the metaphor of a building is very convenient, because the Church
is the temple and house of God, and every one of the faithful is also a temple,

God, and that they were filled with the consolation of the Spirit, are parts of
that edification. Therefore, though the Churches had peace, yet they were not
drunken with delights and earthly joy, but, trusting to God&#8217;s help, they
were more emboldened to glorify God.</font><br></div>

increased by miracles. And he reciteth two miracles: That a man who had been
bedrid eight years, having the palsy, was suddenly healed; and that a certain
woman was raised from death. First, he saith, that as Peter walked throughout
all, he came to Lydda. And by all understand not Churches, but the faithful,
because it is in Greek of the masculine gender, though that skilleth not much
for the sense. And it was meet that the apostles, who had no certain place of
abode, should wander hither and thither as occasion was offered. Wherefore,
whilst they are all occupied in divers parts, Peter took upon him this charge,
whereby the foolishness of the Papists is refuted, who gather Peter&#8217;s
primacy by the authority which he had to visit; as if the rest of the apostles
did live idly at Jerusalem like private men, when Peter did visit the Churches.
Again, admit we grant that Peter was the chief apostle, which thing the
Scripture showeth oftentimes, doth it thereupon follow that he was the head of
the world? But would to God the bishop of Rome, who will be counted
Peter&#8217;s successor, would travel as he did to animate the brethren, and
would every where prove indeed that he is the apostle of Christ. Now, he which
out of his throne doth with more than tyrannous lordship oppress all the
Churches, pretendeth that Peter did visit the Churches with great
pains.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which dwelt at
Lydda.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Lydda, which was afterward called
Diospolis, was situated not far from the Mediterranean Sea, being a renowned
city as well for antiquity as also for many gifts. Joppa was nigh to this city,
which had a famous haven, though very full of rocks. The city itself stood upon
a high cliff, whence they might see to Jerusalem. At this day there is nothing
to be seen there but the ruinous walls of the old city, save only that the haven
remaineth, which they call most commonly Japhet. It should seem that Luke nameth
Assaron as some town or city. Jerome mentioneth Saron, and thinketh that thereby
is meant the whole plain lying between Cesarea and Joppa. But because Jerome
showeth no reason why he should change the reading which is commonly used, I
admit that willingly which Luke&#8217;s text showeth me, to wit, that it was a
city hard by. But I do not contend about this matter; as I do not ambitiously
gather those things which may serve for a vain brag, because it shall be
sufficient for the godly readers to know those things which make to Luke&#8217;s
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Jesus Christ maketh thee whole. </i></font><font face="Palatino">It is certain
that the apostles would never have attempted the doing of miracles, unless they
had been first certified of the will of God, whereupon the effect did depend.
For they had no such power of the Spirit given them that they could heal
whatsoever sick persons they would; but as Christ himself used a measure in his
miracles, so he would have his apostles to work no more than he knew were
profitable. Therefore Peter did not rashly break out into these words; because
he might have set himself to be laughed at, unless he had already known the will
of God. It may be that he prayed apart. The Spirit who was the author of all
miracles, and which wrought by the hand of Peter, did even then direct his
tongue, and did move his heart by a secret inspiration. And in these words Peter
showeth plainly that he is only the minister of the miracle, and that it
proceedeth from the power of Christ; that he may by this means extol the name of
Christ alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make thy
bed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These circumstances do amplify the glory
of the miracle, in that he doth not only recover strength to rise, but is also
able to make his own bed, who could move no member before. To the same end
tendeth the continuance of the disease; for a palsy of eight years&#8217;
continuance is not easily cured. In like sort is he said to have laid in his
bed, that we may know that all his members were lame; for it was a little bed
wherein they were wont to rest at noon. Whereas AEneas was so ready to make
trial of his members, he thereby declared the obedience of his faith. For
although he perceived the strength which was given him,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F641</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet he was most of all moved with the efficacy of the
words,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> to
rise.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>35.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And all those.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> His meaning is, that the miracle
was published abroad, and was known throughout the whole city. For when the
Scripture saith
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
it doth not comprehend every one how many so ever it noteth; but it putteth all
for the more part, or for many, or for the common sort of men. Therefore, the
sense is, that whereas there was but a small number of godly men there, a great
part of the people became members of the Church. And in this clause is expressed
the fruit of the miracle, because they embraced Christ and his gospel. Wherefore
those men corrupt miracles, whosoever they be, which look only upon men, and do
not turn their eyes toward this end, that being instructed concerning the power
and grace of Christ, they may stick only to him. Therefore that token of
Christ&#8217;s divine power which he showed was the beginning of turning to him.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>36.</b> There followeth a more famous token of
Christ&#8217;s power, by how much it is more hard to restore life to a dead
body, than to restore health to a man that is sick. But Luke doth first commend
the person of Tabitha on whom the miracle was showed, and that with a double
title; to wit, that she was Christ&#8217;s disciple, and that she approved her
faith with good works and alms. He hath oftentimes already put this word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>disciple
</i></font><font face="Palatino">for a Christian man; and lest we should think
that that name was proper to men only, he attributeth the same to a woman. And
this title teacheth us that Christianity cannot be without doctrine; and that
that form of learning is prescribed, that the same Christ may be Master to all.
This is the chiefest praise, this is the beginning of holy life, this is the
root of all virtues, to have learned of the Son of God the way to live, and the
true life. The fruits of good works proceed afterward from faith. By good works
I mean the duties of love, wherewith our neighbors are helped; and Luke placeth
the chief kind in alms. The commendation of liberality is great, because, as the
Holy Ghost doth witness, it containeth in itself the sum of a godly and perfect
life. Now we see what titles Tabitha hath. For religion toward God or faith
goeth first; secondly, that she exercised herself in helping the brethren, and
specially in relieving the poverty of the poor. For by use it is come to pass,
that all that help wherewith the poor, and those which are in misery, are
helped, is called
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">elehmosunh</font><font face="Palatino">.
Tabitha is rather a Syrian word than an Hebrew, which Luke did turn into Greek,
that we might know that it was not like to the virtues of the holy women, and
that she was debased in such a simple name;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F643</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for Dorcas signifieth a goat; but the holiness of her life did easily wipe away
the blot of a name not very seemly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>37.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It happened that she was
sick.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He saith in plain words that she was
sick, that he may the more plainly express her death which followed. To the same
end he saith that the corpse was washed and laid in an upper chamber; therefore,
these circumstances serve to make the miracle to be believed. Whereas they carry
her not straightway to the grave, but lay her in the upper part of the house,
that they may keep her there, we may thereby gather that they had some hope of
recovering her life. It is likely that the rite of washing, whereof Luke maketh
mention, was most ancient; and I do not doubt but that it came from the holy
fathers by continual course of times, as if it had been delivered from hand to
hand, that in death itself some visible and of the resurrection might comfort
the minds of the godly, and lift them up unto some good hope; to wit, seeing the
manifestation of eternal life was not so evident, yea, seeing that Christ, the
pledge and substance of eternal life, was not as yet revealed, it was requisite
that both the obscurity of doctrine, and also the absence of Christ, should be
supplied by such helps. Therefore they washed the bodies of the dead, that they
might once
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F644</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
stand before the judgment-seat of God, being clean.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F645</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Finally, there was the same reason for washing the dead which was for the
living; the daily washing put them in mind of this, that no man can please God
save he who should be purged from his filthiness. So, in the rite of burying,
God would have some sign extant whereby men might be admonished that they went
polluted out of this life by reason of that filthiness which they had gathered
in the world. Washing did no more help those which were dead than burial, but it
was used to teach the living;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F646</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for because death hath some show of destruction, lest it should extinguish the
faith of the resurrection, it was requisite that contrary shows should be set
against it, that they might represent life in death. The Gentiles also took to
themselves this ceremony, for which cause Ennius saith<i>, A good woman did wash
and anoint Tarquinius&#8217;s corpse.</i> But (their) imitation was but apish
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F647</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in this thing, as in all other ceremonies. And Christians also have taken to
themselves this example unadvisedly, as if the observation of a figure used
under the law ought to continue always; for at the beginning of the gospel,
although the necessity were abolished, yet the use was lawful, until such time
as it might grow out of use in tract of time. But the monks do at this day no
less imitate Judaism than did the Gentiles in times past, without choice and
judgment, for they wash corpses, that they may bury Christ in shadows, which,
being buried with him in his grave, ought never to have been used any
more.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>38.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
The disciples, which had heard,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The washing of
the corpse showeth that the disciples knew not what would come to pass, for by
this means they make the corpse ready to be buried. Yet this is some token of
hope, that they lay her in an upper chamber, and send to Peter. Furthermore,
they murmur not against God, neither do they cry out that it is an unmeet thing;
but they humbly crave God&#8217;s help, not that they will make Tabitha
immortal, but their only desire is to have her life prolonged for a time, that
she may yet profit the Church.</font><br></div>

more like to be true, that they requested him absolutely that he would come to
work a miracle. But there ariseth another question, whether he knew God&#8217;s
purpose or not? First, if he should mistrust the success, he should go with them
unadvisedly? I answer, although he did not yet know what the Lord would do, yet
can he not be blamed for yielding to the request of the brethren. Also, there
were other reasons why he should come; to wit, to mitigate their sorrow; to
strengthen them with godly exhortations, lest they should faint, being
discouraged with the death of one woman; to establish the Church, which was as
yet tender, and but as it were an infant. Lastly, this one thing ought to have
been sufficient for him, because in refusing he should have been thought proudly
to despise his brethren, notwithstanding we must know this also, that so often
as the Lord determined to work some miracle by his apostles, he did always
direct them by the secret motion of the Spirit. I do not doubt but that although
Peter were not yet certain of the life of Tabitha, yet did he undoubtedly
perceive that God was his guide and conductor in that journey, so that he
addressed himself to go not unadvisedly, though being uncertain of the event.

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All the
widows.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke expresseth in this place the cause
for which Tabitha was raised from death; to wit because God pitied the poor, and
did at their desire restore the woman to life. There were also other ends. For
seeing she liveth two lives, those virtues which Luke commended before are
adorned in her person, but the chief end is, that the glory of Christ may be set
forth. For God could have kept her alive longer; neither doth he change his
purpose, as being moved with repentance when he doth restore her to life again,
but because many of the disciples were weak and novices, who had need of
confirmation, God declareth by the second life of Tabitha, that his Son is
author of life. Therefore God did respect the poor and widows in such sort,
that, by relieving their poverty, he established in their minds the faith of his
gospel; for in this miracle he gave ample matter of profiting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>40.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When they were all put
forth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> When as he taketh a time to pray, he
seemeth as yet to doubt what will be the end. When he healed AEneas he brake out
into these words, without making any stop, <i>AEneas, Jesus Christ make thee
whole.</i> But as the operation of the Spirit is not always alike and the same,
it may be that though he knew the power of God, yet he went forward unto the
miracle by degrees. Yet it seemeth to be an absurd thing, that he putteth all
the saints out of the chamber, for whom it had been better to have seen it with
their eyes. But because the Lord had not as yet revealed the time when, and the
manner how, he would show forth his power, he desired to be alone, that he might
the more fitly pray. Also it might be, that he knew some other reason which
moved him to do this, which we know not. It is recorded in the Sacred History,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;111723&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 17:23,) that Elias did the same. For he being alone, and not so much as
the mother of the child with him, doth stretch himself thrice upon the dead
corpse. For the Spirit of God hath his vehement motions, which, if any man will
square out according to the common use of men, or measure by the sense of the
flesh, he shall do wickedly and unjustly. We must this think, when as Peter, as
it were doubting, seeketh a by place, he preventeth superstition, lest any man
should ascribe to his power the work of God, whereof he was only a minister, For
he which withdrew himself from company, and did pray so instantly, did plainly
confess that the matter was not in his own hand. Therefore, when Peter wisheth
to know what pleaseth the Lord, he confesseth that he alone was the author of
the work. Kneeling in time of prayer is a token of humility, which hath a double
profit, that all our members may be applied unto the worship of God, and that
the external exercise of the body may help the weakness of the mind; but we must
take heed so often as we kneel down, that the inward submission of the heart be
answerable to the ceremony, that it be not vain and false.

reason, that he speaketh unto a corpse without feeling; but this speaking unto
the dead corpse was one point of the vehemency whereunto the Spirit of God
enforced Peter. And if any man desire a reason, this form of speech doth more
lively express the power of God in raising the dead, than if it should be said
in the third person, let this body receive life again and live. Therefore, when
as Ezekiel doth shadow the deliverance of the people under a figure of the
resurrection:</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">For this was indeed the voice of Christ, which was
uttered by the mouth of Peter, and gave [back] breath to the body of Tabitha.
The circumstances following serve to confirm the certainty of the
miracle.</font><br></div>

who dream that the soul of man is only a blast which vanisheth away until the
day of the resurrection, snatch at this place to prove their doting withal. To
what end was it (say they) to call back the soul of Tabitha into the prison of
the body, where it should suffer such misery, if it were received into blessed
rest? As if it were not lawful for God to have respect of his glory as well in
death as in life; and as if this were not the true felicity of the godly to live
and die to him, yea, as if Christ were not to us a vantage, as well by living as
dying,

Tabitha, although, as the commodity

greater good that she revived, that she might be a more excellent instrument of

there, as every where, a church of the common sort of men, that he might throw
down the pride of the flesh; and also thereby appeareth Peter&#8217;s courtesy,
in that he vouchsafeth to lodge with a man of that calling; although it seemeth

band [cohort] did consist upon [of] a thousand footmen, and he which was chief
captain was called a tribune, (or marshal.) Again, every hundred had a captain.
A legion had for the most part five bands. That band was called the Italian
band, because the Romans did choose soldiers oftentimes from amongst those which
dwelt in the provinces; but they had the strength of the army
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F653</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
out of Italy; therefore, Cornelius was an Italian born; but he was at Cesarea
with his hundred, to guard the city. For the Romans were wont so to distribute
their places of abode,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F654</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that every city of renown might have a garrison to stay sudden uproars. A rare
example that a soldier was so devout towards God, so upright and courteous
towards men! For at that time the Italians, when as they were carried into the
provinces to live in warfare, ran to and fro like hungry wolves to get some
prey; they had for the most part no more religion than beasts; they had as great
care of innocency as cutthroats; for which cause the virtues of Cornelius
deserve the greater commendation, in that leading a soldier&#8217;s life, which
was at that time most corrupt, he served God holily, and lived amongst men
without doing any hurt or injury. And this is no small amplification of his
praise, in that casting away superstition wherein he was born and brought up, he
embraced the pure worship of God; for we know what account the Italians made of
themselves, and how proudly they despised others. And the Jews were at that time
in such contempt, that for their sakes pure religion was counted infamous, and
almost execrable. Seeing that none of these things could hinder Cornelius, but
that forsaking his idols he did embrace the true worship of the true God alone,
it must needs be that he was endued with rare and singular sincerity. Moreover,
he could find scarce any thing amongst the Jews wherewith he could be allured
unto the study of godliness, because there was then scarce one amongst a
thousand which had even some small smattering of the law; and, undoubtedly,
Cornelius had lighted upon some good worshipper of God, who being sound from
corrupt opinions, did expound unto him the law faithfully, without mixing any
leaven therewith; but because Luke giveth him many titles of commendation, we
must note them all [singly.]</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b> He saith that he was a godly man, and one
that feared God; secondly, that like a good householder he had a care to
instruct his families; he praiseth him afterward for the offices of love,
because he was beneficial [beneficent] toward all the people; and, lastly, that
he prayed [to] God continually. The sum is this, that Cornelius was a man of
singular virtues, wherein the integrity of the godly consisteth, so that his
life was framed, in all points, according to the rule which God prescribeth unto
us. And because the law is contained in two tables, Luke commendeth, in the
former place, Cornelius&#8217; godliness; secondly, he descendeth unto the
second part, that he exercised the offices of love toward men. This is very
profitable to be marked, because we have a way to live well described in his
person.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Wherefore, in ordering the life well, let faith and
religion be the foundation, which being taken away, all other virtues are
nothing else but smokes. Luke reckoneth up the fear of God and prayer as fruits
and testimonies of godliness and of the worship of God, and that for good
causes. For religion cannot be separated from the fear of God and the reverence
of him, neither can any man be counted godly, save he who acknowledging God to
be his Father and Lord, doth addict himself wholly to him. And let us know that
voluntary fear is commended in this place when those men submit themselves to
God willingly and from their heart, who duly consider themselves what is due to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, because a great part of the world doth,
with reigned trifles, corrupt and deprave the worship of God, Luke added, for
good causes, that Cornelius prayed continually; whereby he doth signify, that he
proved not his godliness only with external ceremonies, but that he worshipped
God spiritually, when as he exercised himself in prayer. We must also note the
continuance of his prayer; whence we gather, that he did not pray only coldly,
after the common custom, but that he was earnestly bent to prayer, as the
continual benefits of God do exhort us and prick us forward thereunto, and the
force of faith ought there to show itself. Wherefore let every one of us exhort
himself to persevere in prayer by the example of Cornelius.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With all his
house.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We must not lightly pass over this
commendation that Cornelius had a church in his house. And, surely, a true
worshipper of God will not suffer so much as in him lieth God to be banished
from his house. For how unmeet a thing is it for him to maintain his own right
stoutly, that his wife, children, servants, and maids may obey him, and not to
regard that God is disobeyed. It shall sometimes fall out so that a godly man
cannot have even his wife to be of his mind; yet he, which ruleth others, must
endeavor by all means to have God obeyed; and there is nothing more meet than
that we should consecrate all ours to God as ourselves. Therefore, if a godly
man have children which are unlike him, or a wife of evil conditions, or lewd
and wicked servants, let him not wink, nor yet suffer his house to be polluted
through his slothfulness. The diligence of Cornelius is not so much commended as
the blessing of God, whereby it came to pass that he had his house obedient unto
him in godliness. And we must not omit the circumstance, that he instructed his
family in the fear of God, setting light by the fear of danger, which did hang
over his head therefore. For the Jewish religion was in great contempt;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F655</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and no citizen of Rome might freely
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F656</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
receive any strange religion, as they called it. Wherefore, although the sincere
profession of the gospel be evil spoken of in the world, yet is it too corrupt
frightfulness
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F657</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
if that unjust hatred hinder any man from offering his family to God for a
sacrifice, by godly instruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Giving
alms.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is also the figure
<i>synecdoche</i> in this member, [clause.] For as it was said, even now, that
the worship of God was proved by prayers, so now, when Luke speaketh of love, he
maketh choice of one kind; whereby he showeth that Cornelius was a liberal and
bountiful man. For our godliness ought so to appear to men, that we declare that
we fear God by using bountifulness and justice. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>alms</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is translated unto those external good works wherewith we help the poor,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
58:7,) forasmuch as <i>misericordia,</i> or mercy, is the inward affection of
the heart properly. For from this fountain springeth true and well ordered
bountifulness, if the troubles and sorrows of our brethren do move us to
compassion; if, considering the unity which is amongst us, we foster and cherish
them as we would cherish our own flesh, and study to help them as we would help
our own members. Hypocrites are, indeed, sometimes liberal, or at least
bountiful; but howsoever they waste all,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F658</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet no relief which they shall bestow upon the poor shall be worthy to be called
by the name of alms. For we must hold that of Paul, He which hath no love is
nothing, though he give all his goods to the poor,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 13:3.) Let us, therefore, learn by this word, that God doth then
allow our liberality, if we relieve the poverty of the poor, being moved with
compassion, and if, as it were, with open bowels we bestow that which the
liberality of God doth give.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whereas Luke saith that he gave alms to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all</i></font><font face="Palatino">
the people, it signifieth as much as everywhere to the poor; for there were not
a few rich men to whom to have given had been an absurd thing. But whereas he
bestowed so liberally upon the Jews, he declared how he agreed with them in
religion; in which respect Luke saith, shortly after, that he was allowed of
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F659</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
all the Jews. And if so be it he was such an excellent mirror of godliness and
holiness, even when he had but a small smattering of faith, although he were
letted so many ways,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F660</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
ought not we to be ashamed who will be accounted most Christian doctors, and are
yet so cold in the exercises of godliness? If a small sparkle of faith prevailed
so much in him, what ought the full brightness of knowledge to work in us? But
howsoever we boast of Christ with full mouth, yet how far are we, for the most
part, from the example of the holy man, so that there appeareth scarce a small
shadow of those virtues wherewith he was replete? For how loose
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F661</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
are we in prayer? How slow and sluggish to do the duties of mercy? Yea, many are
not only letted with filthiness and covetousness from giving liberally so much
of their own as they ought, but they are so inflamed with a desire
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F662</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to have, they are become so beastly through cruelty,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F663</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that they are not afraid to rob the poor of their substance, and to eat their
very flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He saw in a
vision.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke putteth vision for a kind of
oracle coming from God, that we may know that Cornelius was brought unto the
faith of Christ after an heavenly manner. And because men are oftentimes
deceived with juggling, Luke setteth down the time to avoid all suspicion, when
he mentioneth the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ninth
hour.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> And at that time they were wont to divide
the day into twelve hours; from the rising of the sun until the going down
thereof. Whereupon it followeth that it was fair daylight when the angel
appeared, that the vision might be more evident. Although there were always
seals added unto visions, that they might free the servants of God from fear of
illusions, because when he appeared in dreams, yet were there such marks of
certainty imparted in their minds as would not suffer them to
doubt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he beheld, and was
afraid.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke expresseth his attentiveness in
plain words, that we may know that it was no vain imagination which came upon
the man as he was sleeping or doing some other thing. The fear wherewith he was
taken
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F664</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
proceeded from the perceiving of the majesty of God;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F665</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for so soon as men conceive the presence of God, they must needs be afraid and
cast down with fear. And whereas his words do no whit terrify us, that must be
imputed to our sluggishness, because we do not know nor perceive that it is God
which speaketh. But the godly, to whom God revealeth himself in his word, do
tremble when they hear it, as Isaiah saith,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;236602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
66:2, 5.) Furthermore, the sight of God is unto them terrible, not that they may
always lie confounded, and be swallowed up of fear, but only that they may
humbly address themselves to reverence him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What is it,
Lord?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It appeareth plainly by this answer, that
Cornelius&#8217; mind was touched with religion; that he knew that he had to
deal with God. Therefore the common translation hath it evil,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F666</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Who art thou, Lord? And it is likely that that which is there read was put in
instead of this, forasmuch as in the Greek text there is no doubtfulness,
whereby the interpreter might be deceived, and all the copies agree together in
this reading, </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ti
esti</font><font face="Palatino">. And assuredly, when Cornelius perceived that
it is God, he submitteth himself to obey; as the answer is nothing but a
commandment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thy prayers and
alms.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Because God seemeth to be after a sort
deaf, unless he answer our petitions by and by, hence cometh that speech, that
our prayers come unto him, and that he is mindful thereof. Furthermore, the
angel assigneth this as the cause why God vouchsafeth to show to Cornelius the
light of his gospel; because he hath heard his prayers and accepted his alms.
Whence we gather that virtues and good works do not only please God, but that
they are also adorned with this excellent reward, that he heapeth upon us and
enricheth us with greater gifts for their sakes; according to that, &#8220;To
him that hath shall be given,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:12.) And again,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Well done, good
and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful in a few things, I will set thee
over many
things,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402521&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
25:21.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For God doth after this sort extol his by a continual
course of his gifts, as it were by certain steps, until he bring them to the
top.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Papists abuse this place two ways; for
because God respected the prayers and alms of Cornelius, so that he endued him
with the faith of the gospel, they wrest that unto the preparations which they
have invented, as if a man did get faith by his own industry and power, and did
prevent
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F667</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the grace of God by the merits of works. Secondly, they gather, generally, that
good works are meritorious in such sort, that the graces of God are increased in
every man as he hath deserved. In the former they are too childishly deceived,
whilst that they feign that the works of Cornelius were acceptable to God before
he was illuminate by faith. And we need not to fet [seek] a proof far to refute
their ignorance; for he could obtain nothing by prayer unless faith went before,
which only openeth the gate for us to pray; and Augustine weigheth that well and
wisely, who derideth Pelagius, because he said that faith was obtained by
prayers before it was in man in any measure: Who (saith he) will seek a
physician save he who is already healed in some part? And it is the health of
faith which teacheth us to knock. Furthermore, the fear of God and godliness do
plainly prove that he was regenerate by the Spirit. For Ezekiel giveth
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F668</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
this praise to God alone, that he frameth the hearts of men to fear him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;263204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
32:40.) And Isaiah saith, that the Spirit of the fear of God resteth in Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;231102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:2,) that we may know that he can be found no where save only in his members.
Therefore it is too great folly to feign a man in the person of Cornelius, who,
having nature for his guide, can attain unto eternal life, or endeavor to come
thither. Therefore they reason blockishly, that we are able to prevent the grace
of God with the merits of works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As touching the second error, when as they imagine
that every one of us is increased with greater graces as he hath deserved, it
may easily be refuted. First, we deny that we have any good works which God hath
not freely given us; secondly, we say that the right use of gifts cometh from
him also and that this is his second grace, that we use his former gifts well.
Thirdly, we deny that we deserve any thing by our works,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F669</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which are always lame and corrupt. Good works do indeed purchase for us the
increase of grace, but not by their own desert. For they cannot be acceptable to
God without pardon, which they obtain by the benefit of faith. Wherefore it is
faith alone which maketh them acceptable.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F670</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus did Cornelius obtain more perfect knowledge of Christ by his prayers and
alms, but in that he had God to be favorable and merciful to his prayers and
alms, that did depend upon faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, if good works be esteemed [estimated] by
faith, it is of mercy, and not of merit, that God doth allow [approve] them. For
because faith findeth no worthy thing in us whereby we can please God, it
borroweth that of Christ which we want. And this is too perverse, that though
the Papists have this word merit every now and then in their mouths, and cease
not to puff up fools with a vain confidence, yet they bring nothing whereby the
studies of men may be moved to do well. For they leave their consciences always
in a doubt, and command men to doubt whether their words please God or not. Must
not men&#8217;s minds need faint when they are possessed with such fear? But as
for us, though we take merit from works, yet when as we teach that there is a
reward laid up for them, we prick men forward with an excellent and sharp prick,
to desire to live well. For we address ourselves then joyfully to serve God,
when we are persuaded that we lose not our labor. And whereas there appeareth at
this day no more plentiful abundance of the gifts of the Spirit, but that the
more part doth rather wither away, we must thank our unthankfulhess for that.
For as God did crown Cornelius&#8217; prayers and alms, and holiness, with the
most precious pearl of his gospel, so there is just cause why he should suffer
us to starve, being brought unto hungry poverty, when as he seeth us abuse the
treasure of his gospel wickedly and ungodlily.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet here may a question be asked, Whether faith
require the knowledge of Christ, or it be content with the simple persuasion of
the mercy of God? for Cornelius seemeth to have known nothing at all concerning
Christ. But it may be proved by sound proofs that faith cannot be separated from
Christ; for if we lay hold upon the bare majesty of God, we are rather
confounded with his glory, than that we feel any taste of his goodness.
Therefore, Christ must come between, that the mind of man may conceive that God
is merciful. And it is not without cause that he is called the image of the
invisible God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:15;) because the Father offereth himself to be holden in his face alone.
Moreover, seeing that he is the way, the truth, and the life,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
14:6;) whithersoever thou goest without him, thou shalt be enwrapped on every
side in errors, and death shall meet you [thee] on every side. We may easily
answer concerning Cornelius. All spiritual gifts are offered unto us in Christ;
and especially whence cometh regeneration, save only because we are ingrafted
into the death of Christ, our old man is crucified? (Romans, 6:5, 6.) And if
Cornelius were made partaker of the Spirit of Christ, there is no cause why we
should think that he was altogether void of his faith; neither had he so
embraced the worship of the true God, (whom the Jews alone did worship,) but
that he had also heard
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F671</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
somewhat of the promised Mediator; though the knowledge of him were obscure and
entangled, yet was it some. Whosoever came at that time into Judea he was
enforced to hear somewhat of the Messiah, yea, there was some fame of him spread
through countries which were far off.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F672</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Wherefore, Cornelius must be put in the catalogue of the old fathers, who hoped
for salvation of the Redeemer before he was revealed. And it is properly
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F673</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
[improperly] said of Augustine, that Peter grounded his faith; whereas it had
now before a firm foundation; although Augustine thinketh as we do in the thing
itself, who affirmeth plainly, that Cornelius could not pray unless he had
faith, in his Book of the Predestination of Saints, and other
places.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now send to
Joppa.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> God dealt most favorably with Cornelius,
in that he doth not command him to go himself, but to send messengers unto
Peter, that he may stay quietly at home, and that Peter may endure the toil of
the journey for his sake. But let us not wonder that Cornelius was so
courteously handled, seeing that God thrusteth the ministers of his word daily
upon the unwilling; so that he appeareth of his accord to those which do not
seek him, as he saith by Isaiah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;236501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
65:1.) But why doth not the angel rather teach him?
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F674</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For this seemeth an inconvenient
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F675</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
thing that he resigneth his office to a mortal man; for the oracle should have
had greater authority than when the gospel is preached to him by a mortal man.
As when Christ appeared to Paul by a vision, he set, notwithstanding, Ananias to
teach him, that he might by such an example establish the ministry of the
preaching of the gospel, which he committed to his Church; so now the angel
giveth place to Peter, that he may execute the office committed unto him by
Christ. Therefore, whosoever will be the disciple of Christ, and be illuminated
by the (heavenly) light of the heavenly wisdom, let him not grudge to use
attentiveness and docility toward the external voice of men, which Christ useth
as an instrument, and whereunto he will have our faith annexed. And we see how
sore God hath punished their furious pride, who, contemning preaching, have
looked for
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F676</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
revelations from heaven. For since God will be heard in men, the ministers to
whom he hath given his word
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F677</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
cannot be contemned without contempt and reproach of him. Nevertheless, I
confess that the spirits must be proved,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 4:1,) that we hear not without choice whosoever do pretend that they are
ministers of Christ. But because faith cometh by hearing,

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Two of his
servants.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Cornelius had this reward for being
so diligent in teaching his family, that he had faithful and honest servants who
were willing to do him service; and also such as that he might commit any thing
to them. On the other side, the Lord doth oftentimes punish masters with just
punishments who have no regard to instruct their families. For they find those
justly stubborn and unfaithful whom they would not frame unto godliness and the
fear of God, and also they are afraid of their treachery.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A godly
soldier.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Forasmuch as this soldier was much
conversant with Cornelius, he had also taught him to fear God, as well as his
household servants. It is meet that we call to mind here that which I touched
before, that there is no kind of life which excuseth us but that we must worship
God purely. For a soldier&#8217;s life was at that time most corrupt; for they
were fallen unto filthy licentiousness, from the ancient discipline, and yet the
Spirit of God beareth record in this place of the godliness of soldiers.
Wherefore, there is no cause why they should require a calling that is free from
worshipping God, under color of warfare, who would by one means or other be free
from all righteousness. If they deny that they can serve God because they be
soldiers, they shall have these two soldiers meet judges and witnesses against
them at the last day, who shall condemn them. And in the mean season, those
brain-sick fellows are condemned who cry that it is unlawful for Christians to
carry weapons. For these men were warriors, and yet godly, and when they embrace
Christ they forsake not their former kind of life; they cast not away their
armor as hurtful, nor yet forsake their calling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b> Whereas Cornelius expoundeth the whole
matter to the soldier and his servants, it tendeth to this end, that he may the
more encourage them to give ear to the commandment, which they see is rather a
commandment of God than of man; and he is not afraid to make known unto them so
great a matter whom he had instructed well before.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
On the morrow, as they journeyed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As Luke
declared that Cornelius was admonished by an oracle to send for Peter, so now he
setteth down another vision, whereby Peter is commanded to come to him. Whereby
it appeareth that all this matter was governed by the wonderful counsel of God,
who doth both make Cornelius apt to be taught, yea, he kindleth in him a study
and desire to learn and, on the other side, maketh Peter willing to take in hand
to teach him. But we must note the circumstances whereby he maketh the history
more evident.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peter went up upon the
house,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that he might pray alone by himself; for
a quiet and lone place is a great help to prayer, which thing Christ himself did
not omit, that the mind, being free from all things which might call it away,
might be the more earnest and bent toward God. And the Jews had another manner
of houses and buildings than we use; for they had walks upon the tops of their
houses. The sixth hour was then noon. And it is not to be doubted but that he
got himself to prayer then according to his custom. For because we are drawn
away with divers businesses,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F679</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and there is no end of turmoiling, unless we bridle ourselves, it is good to
have certain hours appointed for prayer, not because we are tied to hours, but
lest we be unmindful of prayer, which ought to be preferred before all cares and
business. Finally, we must think the same thing of time which we think of place;
to wit, that they are certain remedies whereby our infirmities is holpen; which,
if the apostles counted fit for them, how much must more the sluggish and slow
use the same?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Excess of mind.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Because our minds are wholly,
as it were, set upon the earth, to the end Peter might the better comprehend the
oracle, it was meet that his mind should be, as it were, moved from his place
and carried up; and by this means was he prepared to receive the oracle, when as
he is carried up above the world after an unwonted manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b> The opening of heaven signifieth, in my
judgment, another thing in this place than in the seventh chapter. For it is
said there that heaven was opened to Stephen, that he did behold the glory of
Christ; in this place Peter saw our heaven which we see divided, so that a sheet
came thence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b> If any man ask how he could see a great
multitude of living creatures at once, the question is easily answered. For Luke
saith, <i>All manner,</i> because there were there divers kinds mixed one with
another. Therefore he beginneth not at the first kind, that he may prosecute the
number unto the last. Again, we must not measure this seeing according to the
manner of men, because the trance gave Peter other eyes. But before we go any
farther we must know the end of the vision. Some dispute more subtilely about
the same than the place requireth, in my judgment. Therefore, I think that it is
generally showed to Peter that the difference which God had made in times past
is now taken away. And as he had put difference between living creatures, so,
having chosen to himself one people, he counted all nations unclean and
profane.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the difference between living creatures being
taken away, he teacheth by the consequent that there is no such disagreement
among men any longer as there was in times past, and that there is no difference
between the Jew and the Grecian. Hereby Peter is admonished that he do not abhor
the Gentiles as being unclean. Undoubtedly, God meant to encourage Peter to come
to Cornelius without fear; but he had separated one people to himself from the
rest, as saith Moses in his song, when as the Most High did distribute the
nations, he put his lot in Jacob, etc.,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;053209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:9;) therefore he called it his inheritance and peculiar
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">According to this order, it had not been lawful to
Peter to bring the covenant of salvation unto the Gentiles; for that was to take
the children&#8217;s bread and to cast it to dogs,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401526&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
15:26,) unless, peradventure, they would be circumcised, and embrace the Jewish
religion; for it was lawful to receive such as did yield themselves. Wherefore,
when as the apostles were sent before to preach the gospel, they were forbidden
to turn in unto the Gentiles,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:5.) And forasmuch as the preaching of the gospel is a most holy and weighty
matter, Peter ought not to have attempted any thing therein with a doubting and
wavering mind. Therefore, to the end he may be assured of his calling, God
showeth manifestly, as in a picture, that the legal difference between the clean
and unclean is abolished; whence he may gather that the wall which was
heretofore between the Jews and the Gentiles is now pulled down. And Paul saith,
that it is a mystery hid from the beginning of the world, that the Gentiles are
made partakers of the same salvation with the people of God, and ingrafted into
one body,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:16;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore Peter durst never have opened the gate of
heaven unto the Gentiles, unless God himself had made a plain way and entrance
for all men, by taking away the wall of separation. I said even now that there
was no time wherein it was not lawful to admit the Gentiles unto the worship of
God, so they were circumcised; but so long as they continued in uncircumcision
they were strangers with God. But now God made the covenant of life common to
all the whole world, which he had shut up in one nation, as in a treasure.
Whence we gather that this vision is not a little profitable for us; for, when
as it teacheth that the difference between Jews and Gentiles continued only for
a season, it is as much as if God should pronounce from heaven that he receiveth
all people of the world into favor, that he may be God over all. Finally, we
have an evident proclamation from heaven, which putteth us in hope of eternal
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But some men will object that Peter was taught before
concerning this matter; for he and the rest were commanded to preach the gospel
throughout the whole world,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:15.) Therefore, he was either ignorant of his calling, or else this vision
was superfluous. I answer, that there was such and so great difficulty in the
novelty itself, that they could not acquaint themselves therewith by and by.
They knew both the prophecies of the prophets, and the late commandment of
Christ concerning the calling of the Gentiles by the gospel; but when they come
to the push, they doubted nevertheless, being stricken with the strangeness of
the thing. Wherefore, it is no marvel if the Lord confirm Peter with a new sign,
concerning which thing we must also say somewhat as yet in the next
chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A voice from
heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The voice came from heaven as did the
sheet, that Peter might know that both came from God; neither had the sight done
him any good, unless God had with this voice made clean those things which were
before unclean. Whereas some pick an allegory out of the word kill, as if God
did signify that men are sacrificed to him by the spiritual sword of the gospel;
I do not prosecute that, but plainness pleaseth me better, that God doth take
away by this voice the law concerning the choice of beasts, that he may also
teach that he rejecteth no people,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:16.) For if by the former word be meant <i>sacrificing,</i> what shall
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eat
</i></font><font face="Palatino">signify? </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not so,
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the voice of him which doth as
well refuse, as also object to God his own commandment; for he is afraid, for
good causes, to touch that which he knew was forbidden him in the law of God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;031121&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
11:21, etc.) Therefore he objecteth to God the law which he himself made, lest
he should break the same unadvisedly. There was a certain show of repugnancy
between the law and the vision; therefore Peter is not hasty, but desireth first
to have his doubt dissolved before he depart from observing the law. Yet it is a
strange matter why Peter resisted more in meats than did Abraham in killing his
son; for Abraham [might have] had more things to object,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;012209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:9, 10.) I dare not here say that that befell Peter which is too common among
men, to stand more about outward and small matters than about the chief points
of the law; I rather make that answer which is out of doubt, that
Abraham&#8217;s mind was so persuaded, and that he was furnished with such power
of the Spirit, that he overcame with 1ofty and heroical fortitude all those
things which might have hindered him. But the Spirit of God wrought slenderly,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F680</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in Peter; whereby we are taught that every small or light thing doth cause us to
doubt, unless the Lord do furnish us with counsel and constancy to overcome all
fear. Yet Peter dealeth very godly and very religiously, in that being in doubt
amidst divers cogitations, he dare do nothing until it better appear what he
ought to follow.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Common</i></font><font face="Palatino"> signifieth in this place profane. For
because the Lord (as we have said) had chosen the Jews to be a peculiar people,
he had prescribed unto them this rite and manner of living, that it might
distinguish them from the profane Gentiles. Therefore, whatsoever the Gentiles
did use contrary to the rule of the law, that did they call common, because
there was nothing pure or holy but that which God had appointed for the use of
his people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God hath made
clean.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He speaketh of meats; but this sentence
must be extended unto all parts of the life. It is word for word,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That which God hath made clean,
do not thou make profane;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> but the sense is, It
is not for us to allow or condemn any thing; but as we stand and fall by the
judgment of God alone, so is he judge of all things,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:4.) As touching meats, after the abrogating of the law, God pronounceth that
they are all pure and clean. If, on the other side, there start up a mortal man,
making a new difference, forbidding certain, he taketh unto himself the
authority and power of God by sacrilegious boldness. Of this stamp were the old
heretics, Montanus, Priscillianus, the Donatists, the Tatians, and all the
Encratites. Afterwards the Pope, to the end he might bind all those sects in a
bundle, made a law concerning meats. And there is no cause why the patrons of
this impiety should babble that they do not imagine any uncleanness in meats,
but that men are forbidden to eat flesh upon certain days, to tame the flesh.
For seeing they eat such meats as are most fit, both for delicacy and also for
riot, why do they abstain from eating bacon, as from some great offense, save
only because they imagine that that is unclean and polluted which is forbidden
by the law of their idol? With like pride doth the tyranny of the Pope rage in
all parts of life; for there is nothing wherein he layeth not snares to entangle
the miserable consciences of men. But let us trust to the heavenly oracle, and
freely despise all his inhibitions. We must always ask the mouth of the Lord,
that we may thereby be assured what we may lawfully do; forasmuch as it was not
lawful even for Peter to make that profane which was lawful by the Word of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, this is a place of great importance to
beat down the frowardness of men, which they use too much in perverse judgments.
There is no man almost which doth not grant liberty to himself to judge of other
men&#8217;s doings. Now, as we are churlish and malicious, we lean more toward
the worse part, so that we take from God that which is his. This voice alone
ought to suffice to correct such boldness, That it is not lawful for us to make
this or that unclean, but that this power belongeth to God alone. And also in
these words is given us to understand, that the Jews were not therefore the holy
people of the Lord, because they excelled through their own worthiness, but only
by reason of God&#8217;s adoption. Now, after that God had received the Gentiles
into the society of the covenant, they have all equal right.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

should remain in his mind. Whence we gather how deeply the observing of the law
was rooted in his mind. And I know no reason why God left him in a dump,
[perplexed,] until, by the event which followed, he might learn the cause of the
vision, save only because being astonished he did not desire to know what this
thing meant; although it was all in good time, that the messengers of Cornelius
should come shortly after to interpret it. The

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b> Peter was taught not only by the vision,
but also by the Word of God; and yet in seeing he saw not, until the Spirit is
unto him an interpreter; a most excellent mirror of our slackness. Although we
be yet far unlike to Peter; for we are so far from understanding by and by what
God will, or to what end he speaketh to us, that many interpretations are scarce
sufficient for us. But we must also note that which Luke addeth, that Peter did
think earnestly upon the vision, to wit, after that he was come to himself again
after his amazedness; for this was a token of godly reverence, that he did not
carelessly suffer the vision to escape him. Therefore the Lord opened to him
when he did knock,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
7:7.) And we are justly plagued for our sluggishness, in that we profit no
better in the Word of the Lord, seeing we are so cold, and have so small desire
to inquire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Go, doubting nothing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Scripture useth this
word often, when it will express of what sort the obedience of faith ought to
be. So Paul, in the fourth chapter to the Romans,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450419&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:19,) when as he commendeth the faith of Abraham, saith, That he doubted not
when as the Lord promised him seed, being now aged and past hope of children.
And in the fourteenth,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451423&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:23,) in treating of meats, he condemneth doubting consciences. And it is
properly to reason on both sides, (as they say,) when as we are carried hither
and thither by course, by gathering contrary reasons. But we must not follow God
with a doubtful and wavering, but with a quiet and constant mind. In sum, the
Lord will have us to attribute so much to him, that when we hear him we dispute
no longer what we have need to do, but that we set down for a certainty, that
that must be done which he commandeth. And surely it is meet that his will
should show us the way, when all clouds are driven away, and that it should
subdue all our senses unto it, unto willing obedience, all reasoning
[disputation] being broken off; which is also better gathered by the next text.
For the reason is added, why it is not lawful for Peter to suspend his judgment
in an uncertain matter, because God is the author of the business; because it is
as much as if it should be said, that we ought to be content with the beck of
God alone, that we may obey his commandment. And hereby are we also admonished
that men&#8217;s consciences shall by no other means be quiet, that they safely
do that which they do, than when being taught by the Word of God, they determine
that they do nothing without his commandment and conduct.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Behold, I am he whom ye seek.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke declareth
now how ready Peter was to obey; secondly, that he understood at length, by the
messengers, to what end the vision was showed unto him. For he heareth that he
is called by Cornelius, a man that is a Gentile, whom he would have counted
profane, and unworthy of his company, unless his judgment had been corrected
with this voice, &#8220;That which God calleth pure, judge not thou to be
common.&#8221; This is to be wise indeed, when as abandoning all vain
confidence, and correcting our stubbornness, the authority of God doth so pull
us unto it, and doth so possess our minds, that we count nothing right but that
which it prescribeth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

him, but that Peter may the less abhor his company.

And for this cause they say that he was approved of the Jews, that Peter may
know that he was not estranged from true and sincere godliness. For even those
which were superstitious, though they served idols, did boast that they were
worshippers of God. But Cornelius could not have the Jews, who retained the
worship of the true God alone, to be witnesses of his godliness, unless he had
professed that he worshipped the God of Abraham with them. Furthermore, as this
was a rare example, so it ought to have moved Peter not a little. Although they
lean most of all to this argument, that they may persuade him that which they go
about, that all this matter is governed by the commandment of God, as if they
should say, That he is not so much called by a mortal man as by God, who had so
commanded by his angel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b> And Peter also, being overcome with the
authority of God, deliberateth no longer, but lodgeth the men, that he may go
with them forthwith. So we must meekly submit ourselves to God; and there
remaineth nothing after that we know his will, but that we run speedily thither
whither he calleth us. There is no difficulty in the rest.</font><br></div>

flattered [excused] himself; for he was not commanded to call others to

was indebted

knowledge with sloth or fear, but we must rather endeavor that our faith may
shine before others to give light, and to show the way to them; for the
inheritance of the kingdom of heaven is not such, that even the least portion
can be taken from us, if many be made partakers thereof; but if others be made
co-heirs with us, it shall rather increase our glory, Furthermore, we must mark
how far he is from vainglory; for he calleth them to be his school-fellows,
being himself ready to learn. This is the true study of godliness, when as
together with zeal there appeareth such plainness,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F687</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that we are not ashamed to depend upon the mouth of God. For many are pricked
forward with ambition, to employ themselves in teaching the ignorant; and
foolish babbling discovereth their folly, when as they huddle out words more
earnestly, and they would have none heard but themselves. But this alone ought
to be the drift of all men, to bring themselves and all the whole world under
God, that when men are subdued unto true humility, he alone may have the
preeminence. Let not him which excelleth in the faculty and grace of teaching
refuse to teach his brethren, so that he be free from boasting, and proud desire
to excel. Let him to whom it was not granted to be a teacher keep himself within
his bounds. Let neither of them desire mastership, as James teacheth them; but
let one so edify another, that neither the learned, neither the unlearned, be
ashamed to be brought into order.</font><br></div>

what kinsfolks he could have in Judea, seeing that he was an alien, and was come
thither only by reason of war, which continued but for a short time? As I affirm
nothing, so I embrace this as most probable, that he had some in his garrison
which were his kinsmen; for neighbors, and those which were of acquaintance were
wont to serve under one captain. And we need not doubt of this, but that
Cornelius&#8217; kinsmen were desirous to be under him, forasmuch as he was a
centurion. He calleth familiar friends
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">anagkaiouv</font><font face="Palatino">,
as those are called of the Latins, <i>Necessarii,</i> which are nearer together.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Falling down at his feet, he worshipped.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here
is the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">prosekunhsen</font><font face="Palatino">,
which signifieth to testify honor or worship, either by bowing the knee or
ducking down the head, or by any other gesture. Now, the question is, whether
Peter refuteth this worship for modesty&#8217;s sake only, or he disalloweth it
as a thing altogether unlawful? It appeareth that Cornelius&#8217; fact
displeased Peter., by the reason which is by and by
added,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Arise, for even I am a
man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For we may gather that there was some
divine thing in that worship, because he did ascribe unto mortal man the honor
which is due to God alone. But we must not think that Cornelius did count Peter
instead of God; for if he translated God&#8217;s honor unto mortal man, where is
that godliness and religion, with the title whereof he was of late adorned?
Therefore, I think that he meant nothing less than to spoil God of his lawful
worship, that he might give it to man; but forasmuch as he meant to give
singular honor unto the prophet and apostle of Christ, he fell into an
immoderate token of reverence, and so he offended in excess.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For it can scarce be expressed in words how prone men
are to fall to superstition, when as that honor is given to the ministers of
Christ, which hath any small show of divine worship; for we fall easily unawares
into that whereof we thought full little. There were less danger in a king or in
the chief chieftains of this world; for he which falleth down before a king
keepeth himself within the bounds of earthly and civil honor. But the case
standeth otherwise in the ministers of Christ; for as their office is spiritual,
so if any man fall down at their feet to worship them, this honor hath in it
some spiritual thing. For we must put a difference between civil worship, which
men use among themselves in respect of civil order, and that under which is
contained religion, or which respecteth directly the honor of God; as also
between laws which are made for temporal regimen, or which bind the conscience.
For certain foolish men are deceived too far, who think that kneeling is in this
place condemned simply and of itself. But this is that which I said, Cornelius
doth not here salute his proconsul, or the emperor, after any civil sort; but
being stricken with wondering when he saw Peter, he honoreth him as he would
have honored God, if he had been present; so that he giveth man more than is
meet, having, as it were, forgotten himself. He thought nothing less (as I have
already said) than to rob God of any part of his honor, that he might give that
to man which he took from him. But when as the worship which is given to man
hath somewhat which is, as it were, linked with the honor of God, men fall into
a fault contrary to their hope and opinion, so that they extol man above his
degree, and give him the worship which is due to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Papists, omitting that distinction, snatch only
at one member for they handle religious worship only. To the end they may
ascribe some part thereof, with some honest color, unto creatures, they cut
[subdivide] it into <i>latria, dulia,</i> and<i> hyperdulia</i>. They give<i>
latria</i> to God alone; as if they should say, that the adoration of worship is
due to him alone. They make dulia common to the dead and their bones, to images
and pictures. They assign their <i>hyperdulia</i> to the Virgin Mary, and to the
cross whereon Christ hanged. That I may omit to say that they babble through
childish ignorance, how many of them do understand that rotten distinction?
Neither do I speak only of the common sort, but of the chieftains. Therefore,
all their worshippings must needs be infected and corrupt with wicked
superstition, seeing they unadvisedly match creatures with God. But Luke saith
not in this place that Cornelius gave to Peter <i>latria,</i> (or the honor due
to God;) he useth only the general word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>worshipped,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and he addeth, notwithstanding, that he was reproved, because he did wickedly
extol man higher than became him. Surely, if that new opinion concerning the
adoration which is called <i>dulia</i> had any place, Peter ought to have
admonished Cornelius that he should not go beyond<i> dulia</i>. But because no
worship whereunto religion is annexed, and the respect of God&#8217;s honor,
doth leave to God his honor untouched, what man soever it have; therefore, Peter
is content with this one only reason that he is a man. Moreover, I would gladly
know of the Papists, whether they think that John was so blockish, that he would
take the honor due to God, which they call <i>latria,</i> and give it to the
angel? Surely, there was nothing else that caused him to worship the angel, save
only too much and preposterous reverence, and that in honor of God, whose glory
shone in the angel; notwithstanding his fact is condemned. Therefore, to the end
we may give God that which is his own, let the spiritual worship, under which is
comprehended religion, remain whole and sound to him.</font><br></div>

than win their hearts, when as they hear that they are accounted so unclean,
that with their familiarity and conference they pollute the saints; which must
needs be a great reproach for them. But it was needful for Peter thus to speak,
lest they should suspect that he had an evil conscience, because, contrary to
the custom delivered by the fathers, he came.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F691</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But when as he affirmeth that he was sent of God, all such suspicion is taken
away and purged. Moreover, he mitigateth very well by these words the offense
which did stick in their minds, by reason of an old grudge which was between the
Jews and the Gentiles, so that he could by no means have entered his speech
better, For he pronounceth that those are now clean who were before unclean, so
that they have mutual fellowship now with the saints. Furthermore, whereas he
said that it was wickedness for the Jews to go in unto the Gentiles, we must
know that this came not so much from the law, as from the observation of the
fathers. God had forbidden, indeed, that they should (not) entangle themselves
with marriages or covenants,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;050703&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
7:3;) they were never forbidden to eat with them, or to use the common
businesses of life. But lest that familiarity might entice them into that which
was forbidden, they observed the custom delivered by the fathers, so that they
did not company together. It is to no end to dispute here whether that tradition
did bind men&#8217;s consciences; for Peter doth not teach
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F692</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

more plain, when he referreth that unto men which was spoken of meats. And

particular persons; for it is certain that all unbelievers are polluted with
uncleanness of conscience, so that they pollute those things which are otherwise
pure, when as they do but touch them. Paul also saith that their children remain
unclean until they be cleansed by faith. Finally, if faith alone do purge and
purify the hearts of men, unbelief doth make the same profane. But Peter

at that time; secondly, that the vision may be the less suspected. For doubtless
the brain of a man that is fasting (where there is moderate sobriety) doth not
easily admit any strong imaginations, wherein appear images and strange forms,
whereby men are deceived.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F699</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore Cornelius&#8217; meaning is, that he was earnestly bent to pray, at
such time as the angel appeared to him, and that his mind was free from all such
lets which use to make men subject to fantasies and imaginations.

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A man stood in shining garment.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He calleth him a man, whom he knew was an angel
of God; but it is a common thing for the name of the visible form wherein God or
his angels appear to be translated unto him or them; so Moses doth sometimes
call them angels, and sometimes men, which appeared to Abraham in shape of men.
The shining garment was a token of heavenly glory, and, as it were a sign of the
divine Majesty which appeared
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F701</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in the angel. The evangelists declare, that there was such brightness in
Christ&#8217;s garment when he showed his glory to the three disciples in the
mount. The same thing do they witness of the angels which were sent to testify
Christ&#8217;s resurrection. For, as the Lord beareth with our infirmity thus
far that he commandeth his angels to descend under form of our flesh, so he
casteth out upon them certain beams of his glory, that the commandments which he
hath committed to them may be the more reverenced and believed. Here ariseth a
question, whether that were a true and natural body, and whether that were a
garment in deed, or Cornelius did only see such a shape and show; and though
this be not so necessary to be known, and we can scarce affirm any thing for a
truth,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F702</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet it seemeth to me more probable as touching conjecture, that God to whom it
belongeth to create all things gave to the angel a true body, and did clothe the
same with a most gorgeous garment; but so soon as the angel had ended his
embassage, I think he was restored to his own nature, the body and garment being
brought to nought, and that he suffered no human thing

Peter may be more ready and willing to teach, Cornelius affirmeth that himself
and the rest will be apt to be taught, and ready to obey God; for this serveth
not a little to move the teacher to take pains with the hearers, when as he
hopeth assuredly that they shall profit thereby, These words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> may have a double meaning; they may either
be an oath, or Cornelius may thereby simply profess that that company was
gathered together at his house, as in the sight of God, that they may hear
man&#8217;s voice in like sort as if it proceeded out of God&#8217;s own mouth.

for to the end Cornelius may the more procure the credit of his sincerity, he
testifieth that he hath God before his eyes, whom no man may mock by
dissimulation; and assuredly, so often as the Word of God is set before us, we
must thus think with ourselves, that we have not to deal with a mortal man, but
that God is present, and doth call us. For, from this respect of God ariseth the
majesty of God&#8217;s word, and reverence in hearing the same. Notwithstanding,
he seemeth to promise unadvisedly for others in a matter so weighty, for who can
be a fit borrow [cautioner] for another man&#8217;s faith? But because every man
had promised obedience for himself, he doth, for good causes, hope that they
were so affectioned; and, undoubtedly, we may think that they had promised that
they would be obedient to his sayings so soon as the matter was showed them, and
that even then every one confirmed by himself that which one had spoken in the
name of all.</font><br></div>

doctrine of God, as if they had made a covenant with God, save only so far forth
as it pleaseth them. If any thing displease them they either carelessly contemn
or mislike the same. But Cornelius doth wisely distinguish between God and man,
for he maketh God the author of the doctrine, and leaveth nothing for man
besides the ministry and embassage. &#8220;Thou shalt&#8221; saith he,
&#8220;have attentive scholars, and those which will be obedient in all things
which God hath commanded thee; that he alone may be principal, and thou only his

is to apprehend, or to gather by reasons, signs, and conjectures. Cornelius was
a Gentile born, yet God heareth his prayers; he vouchsafeth to show him the
light of the gospel; he appointed and sendeth an angel to him particularly;
thereby doth Peter know that, without respect of persons, those do please God
which live godly and innocently. For before, (being wholly possessed with this
prejudice, that the Jews alone were beloved of God, as they alone were chosen
out of all people,) [nations,] he did not think that the grace of God could come
unto others. He was not, indeed, so gross that he thought that godliness and
innocency of life were condemned because they were in a man that was a Gentile;
but, seeing he did simply snatch at that,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F705</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that all those were estranged from the kingdom of God, and were profane, which
were uncircumcised, he entangleth himself unawares in that so filthy an error,
that God did despise his pure worship and an holy life, where there was no
circumcision; because uncircumcision made all virtues unsavory to the Jews. By
which example, we are taught how greatly we ought to beware of prejudices, which
make us oftentimes judge amiss.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, we must note what the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>person</i></font><font face="Palatino">
doth signify, because many are thereby deceived, whilst that they expound it
generally, that one man is preferred before another. So Pelagius denied in times
past that some are chosen and some are [re]proved
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F706</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of God; because God did not accept persons. But by this word we must understand
the external state or appearance, as they call it; and whatsoever is about man
himself, which doth either bring him in favor, or cause him to be hated; riches,
nobility, multitude of servants, honor, do make a man to be in great favor;
poverty, baseness of lineage, and such like things, make him to be despised. In
this respect, the Lord doth oftentimes forbid the accepting of persons, because
men cannot judge aright so often as external respects do lead them away from the
matter.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F707</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In this place, it is referred unto the nation; and the meaning is, that
circumcision is no let, but that God may allow
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F708</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
righteousness in a man that is a Gentile. But it shall seem by this means that
God did respect persons for a time. For, when as he did choose the Jews to be
his people, passing over the Gentiles, did he not respect persons? I answer,
that the cause of this difference ought not to be sought in the persons of men,
but it doth wholly depend upon the hidden counsel of God. For, in that he rather
adopted Abraham, that with him he might make his covenant, than the Egyptians,
he did not this being moved with any external respect, but (all) the whole cause
remained in his wonderful counsel. Therefore, God was never tied to
persons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Notwithstanding, the doubt is not as yet dissolved,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F709</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because it cannot be denied but that circumcision did please God, so that he
counted him one of his people who had that token of sanctification. But we may
easily answer this also that circumcision followed after the grace of God,
forasmuch as it was a seal thereof. Whereupon it followeth that it was no cause
thereof. Nevertheless, it was unto the Jews a pledge of free adoption; in such
sort, that uncircumcision did not hinder God, but that he might admit what
Gentiles he would unto the society of the same salvation. But the coming of
Christ had this new and especial thing, that after that the wall of separation
was pulled down, (Ephesians. 2:14,) God did embrace the whole world generally.
And this do the words </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in every
nation</i></font><font face="Palatino"> import. For so long as Abraham&#8217;s
seed was the holy inheritance of God, the Gentiles might seem to be quite
banished from his kingdom; but when Christ was given to be a light of the
Gentiles, the covenant of eternal life began to be common to all
alike.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>35.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He which feareth God, and doth
righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In these two members is
comprehended the integrity of all the whole life. For the fear of God is nothing
else but godliness and religion;
and</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is that equity which men use
among themselves, taking heed lest they hurt any man, and studying to do good to
all men. As the law of God consisteth upon [of] these two parts, (which is the
rule of good life) so no man shall prove himself to God but he which shall refer
and direct all his actions to this end, neither shall there be any sound thing
in all offices, [duties,] unless the whole life be grounded in the fear of God.
But it seemeth that this place doth attribute the cause of salvation unto the
merits of works. For if works purchase favor for us with God, they do also win
life for us which is placed in the love of God towards us. Some do also catch at
the word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
righteousness,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that they may prove that we are
not justified freely by faith, but by works. But this latter thing is too
frivolous. For I have already showed that it is not taken for the perfect and
whole observing of the law, but is restrained unto the second table and the
offices of love. Therefore it is not the universal righteousness whereby a man
is judged just before God, but that honesty and innocency which respecteth men,
when as that is given to every man which is his.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore the question remaineth as yet, whether
works win the favor of God for us? which that we may answer, we must first note
that there is a double respect of God in loving men. For seeing we be born the
children of wrath,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:3,) God shall be so far from finding any thing in us which is worthy of his
love, that all our whole nature causeth him rather to hate us; in which respect,
Paul saith that all men are enemies to him until they be reconciled by Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:10.) Therefore the first accepting of God, whereby he receiveth us into favor,
is altogether free; for there can as yet no respect of works be had, seeing all
things are corrupt and wicked, and taste of [bespeak] their beginning. Now, whom
God hath adopted to be his children, them doth he also regenerate by his Spirit,
and reform in them his image: whence riseth that second respect. For God doth
not find man bare and naked then, and void of all grace, but he knoweth his own
work in him, yea, himself. Therefore, God accepteth the faithful, because they
live godly and justly. And we do not deny that God accepteth the good works of
the saints; but this is another question, whether man prevent the grace of God
with his merits or no, and insinuate himself into his love, or whether he be
beloved at the beginning, freely and without respect of works, forasmuch as he
is worthy of nothing else but of hatred. Furthermore, forasmuch as man, left to
his own nature, can bring nothing but matter of hatred, he must needs confess
that he is truly beloved; whereupon, it followeth that God is to himself the
cause that he loveth us, and that he is provoked [actuated] with his own mercy,
and not with our merits. Secondly, we must note, that although the faithful
please God after regeneration with good works, and their respects of works, yet
that is not done with the merit of works. For the cleanliness of works is never
so exact that they can please God without pardon; yea, forasmuch as they have
always some corruption mixed with them, they are worthy to be refused.
Therefore, the worthiness of the works doth not cause them to be had in
estimation, but faith, which borroweth that of Christ which is wanting in
works.</font><br></div>

Concerning the matter.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Because the Greek text
is abrupt, some think that the accusative case is put instead of the nominative;
and that the sense is this, This is the word which God hath sent unto the
children of Israel. Other some refer it unto the
word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> ye
know</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which followeth afterward; and they think
that there was another word added to make the sentence more pleasant. For Luke
putteth
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">logon</font><font face="Palatino">
in the former place, and afterward
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">rhma</font><font face="Palatino">.
But forasmuch as it is common and familiar amongst the Grecians to understand
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F710</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the prepositions; this sense, which I have set down, seemeth to me more
agreeable, though, if the harshness of the speech can be any better mitigated, I
will willingly yield. Therefore I take this member to be a preface, which
appertaineth unto this worthy work of God, which he showed amongst the children
of Israel, preaching peace by Christ. That done, there is added a narration. At
length, in the conclusion of his speech, Peter showeth to what end Christ was
sent into the world. Furthermore, he beginneth with this commemoration not
without cause, That God sent his word unto the children of Israel. And
<i>speech</i> is put for</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
thing</i></font><font face="Palatino"> in the Hebrew phrase. The eternal
covenant which God had made with that people was at that time famous. There was
nothing more commonly known among the Jews than that there was a Redeemer
promised in times past to the fathers, who should restore things which were
decayed unto a flourishing and blessed estate. This did those also know who were
familiarly conversant with the Jews. Therefore, to the end Peter may purchase
greater credit, he saith that he will speak of no new or unknown thing, but of
the restoring of the Church, which did depend upon the eternal covenant of God,
and which was now manifestly showed, and almost in every man&#8217;s
mouth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Preaching
peace.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Peter teacheth here what manner [of ]
rumor and thing that was which was spread abroad; to wit, such as that it did
make peace. I take peace in this place for the reconciling of men and God,
which, notwithstanding, hath in it the perfect
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F711</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
salvation of the Church. For, as horrible confusion, and, as it were, a huge
lump,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F712</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
do follow after that God is once estranged from us; so, so soon as his fatherly
favor doth once appear, he gathereth his Church together, and true felicity
ariseth. Therefore, this is Peter&#8217;s meaning, that God showed himself
merciful to his people in Christ, and that he received into favor
Abraham&#8217;s children again, (whom he seemed to have cast away for a time,)
that he might establish among them a flourishing estate. And as he maketh God
the author of this peace, so he placeth Christ in the midst as the pledge
thereof, that it may be certain and holy. He coupleth peace and preaching
expressly together, because this is one way whereby the fruit of the
reconciliation, purchased by Christ, cometh unto us. In like sort, after that
Paul had taught that Christ is our peace, he addeth immediately, that he came to
preach peace unto those who were nigh at hand and far off,

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>37.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye know how the
word.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This sermon of Peter consisteth upon [of
] two members principally; for in the former he reciteth an history; secondly,
he descendeth unto the fruit of the history). For seeing that the coming of
Christ into the world, his death and resurrection, are the matter of our
salvation, Christ cannot otherwise be set before us to salvation, than if we
first know that he hath put on our flesh; that he was in such sort conversant
amongst men; that he proved himself, by certain testimonies, to be the Son of
God; that he was at length nailed upon the cross, and raised up from the dead by
the power of God. Again, lest the knowledge of the history be unprofitable and
cold, we must also show the end why he came down from his heavenly glory into
the world, why he suffered such a death so reproachful amongst men, and accursed
by the mouth of God. The cause of his resurrection must be showed, whence the
effect and fruit of all these things is gathered; to wit, that Christ was
humbled, that he might restore us unto perfect blessedness who were quite lost;
and also that he put on brotherly love together with our flesh; that by taking
upon him our infirmities, he unburdened us thereof; that he made satisfaction
for our sins, by the sacrifice of his death, that he might purchase the
Father&#8217;s favor for us; that when as he had gotten the victory of death, he
purchased for us eternal life; that he set heaven open for us by his entrance
into the same; that all the power of the Spirit was poured out upon him, that he
might enrich us with his abundance,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;236101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
61:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This order of teaching doth Peter observe when he
beginneth with the history of the gospel; and afterward showeth what we have by
Christ&#8217;s descending into the earth, by his death and resurrection. First,
he saith, that Jesus of Nazareth came abroad after John&#8217;s baptism. For
because John was appointed to this end, by the counsel of God, that he might
lift up the minds of the people to wait for Christ, it was not meet that this
point should be omitted. He was counted an excellent prophet of God; therefore
his authority was of great importance to make Christ to be believed, especially
amongst the ignorant and those which were but novices. We must note the phrase,
that John preached baptism. For Luke comprehendeth, indeed, under the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>baptism,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
all the whole ministry of John; nevertheless he showeth that it was no dumb
sign, and void of doctrine. And assuredly this is the chiefest thing in all
sacraments, that the Word of God may appear engraven there, and that the clear
voice may sound. For which cause, that wicked profanation which is seen in
Papistry is so much the more to be detested, because, burying preaching, they do
only charm the sacraments with magical enchantment,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>38.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus of
Nazareth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He calleth him a Nazarite here, not
because he was born there, but because he came thence to execute his office;
again, because he was surnamed thus commonly. He saith that he was anointed with
the Spirit and power by <i>hypallage.</i> For the power wherein Christ exceeded
proceeded from the Spirit alone. Therefore, when as the heavenly Father anointed
his Son, he furnished him with the power of his Spirit. Peter saith immediately
after, that this power appeared in miracles; although he expresseth one kind
only in plain words, that Christ testified that he was endowed with power of the
Holy Ghost that he might do good in the world. For it was not meet that the
fearful power of God should be showed forth in him, but such as might allure the
world with the sweet taste of goodness and grace to love him and to desire him.
The metaphor of anointing is usual so often as mention is made of the gifts of
the Holy Ghost. It is now applied unto the person of Christ, because by this
means he was consecrated a king and priest by his Father. And we know that in
time of the law, oil was a solemn token of consecration. The going of Christ is
taken for the course of his calling, as if he should say, that he fulfilled his
function until the time appointed before. The similitude is taken from travelers
which go forward in their journey until they come unto the appointed place;
although he showeth therewithal that he walked through Judea in three years, so
that no corner was without his good deeds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Those which were holden of
devils.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This also was a more manifest token of
God&#8217;s power in Christ, that he did not only heal men of common diseases,
but did also cure desperate evils. All diseases are indeed light punishments
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F713</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
wherewith God doth punish us; but when as he dealeth more gently with us
according to his fatherly kindness, he is said to strike us with his hand then;
but in more grievous scourges he useth Satan as the minister of his wrath, and
as it were an hangman. And we must diligently mark this distinction; for it were
an absurd thing to say that he is tormented of the devil who is sick of an ague,
or of some other common kind of disease; but the alienating of the mind,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F714</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
furious madness, and other, as it were, monstrous griefs, [evils,] are fitly and
properly attributed to Satan. And, in this respect, the Scripture useth to call
men who are so taken and carried headlong with such madness that they have no
hold of themselves, so that they seem to be turned almost into beasts, men
possessed of devils.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because God was with
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Peter noteth briefly to what end those
powers did tend which were showed
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F715</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
by the hand of Christ, to wit, that tie might purchase credit among men, who did
behold God as it were present; and this was the true use of miracles, as we have
said already elsewhere, and as we shall see again hereafter when we come to it.
For we must stay ourselves upon this principle, that we diminish the majesty of
God unless we embrace and reverence those whom he marketh with the mark of his
servants. Therefore, forasmuch as powers [miracles] did plainly prove that
Christ descended from heaven, his dignity is placed without the lot of
man&#8217;s judgment.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F718</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and that they are brought forth, as it were, by God, that they might by their
preaching bring men unto the faith of Christ. So Paul, in the fifteenth of the
First to the Corinthians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461515&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:15,) saith,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">And we have already heard by the mouth of Christ,
&#8220;Ye shall be my witnesses in Judea, Samaria, and at Jerusalem.&#8221; And
now Peter calleth himself only an historical witness, because he beheld the
things which were done. And here he toucheth his death briefly, because it was
openly known; he standeth longer upon his resurrection, which was more doubtful,
and the knowledge whereof was more available unto faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>41.</b> If any man demand here, Why God did not
show his Son openly to all men after his resurrection? I answer, Although there
could no reason be showed, yet ought the counsel of God alone to suffice sober
and modest men, that they may ,assure themselves without all doubt that that is
best which God hath thought meet. And yet, assuredly God used this moderation to
a good end. For the certainty of the resurrection was proved by many and firm
testimonies, and this was profitable to exercise the faith of the godly, to
believe the gospel rather than their eyes. As touching the wicked and professed
enemies of Christ seeing that being so often convict they would never yield to
God, they were unworthy to have Christ to admit them to behold the glow of his
resurrection. Though even they were sufficiently convict with the report of the
soldiers, whom they had hired to keep the sepulcher; that I may omit other
reasons which we may fet out of the Harmony.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F719</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Therefore, let us assure ourselves of this, that the holy apostles were chosen
by the holy decree of God, that by their testimony the truth of Christ&#8217;s
resurrection might stand. Whosoever is not content with this approbation, let
him take away and overthrow if he can that inviolable decree of God, which Peter
commendeth to us in this place. And as for us, if we covet to have God the sure
author of our faith let us learn to be content with the witnesses whom in due
time he hath brought forth, as it were, by his hand, being ordained by him
before the world was made.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who did
eat.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> And here it appeareth what great regard
Christ had of our rudeness and ignorance, who did abase himself so far for our
sake, that when he was now endued with heavenly glory, he did yet,
notwithstanding, eat and drink as a mortal man. Wherefore, there is no cause why
we should complain that the resurrection of Christ is obscure and doubtful; for
he suffered his disciples to be slow and hard of belief for this cause, that
being better confirmed, they might take from us all occasion of doubting. Yea,
rather, we must endeavor ourselves that our unworthiness and unthankfulness do
not darken so great kindness of the Son of God toward us. But when as the
Scripture saith, that Christ did eat, curious men move a question, what became
of that meat? But the answer is easy; that like as it was created out of
nothing, so was it easily brought to nothing by the divine power of Christ. That
meat which is taken for the sustenance of the body is concocted and afterward
digested; but we know that Christ took this meat to feed our faith, and in this
use was it spent. And those men are deceived who think that Christ did only seem
to eat, For what good could such a visor or vain show have done?
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F720</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For when, as we say that Christ was not enforced with any necessity of his own
to eat, but that he meant only to provide for those that were his, all occasion
is cut off
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F721</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from the frivolous inventions of men.</font><br></div>

And he commanded us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He beginneth in this place
to intreat of the kingdom of Christ, when he saith that Christ did rise again
for this cause, that he may once judge the world. For by the same right are the
government of heaven and earth, and the perpetual government of the Church, due
to him. He saith that he shall be judge
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of quick and
dead;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> because, when as the dead shall rise
again, others also, who shall then remain alive, shall be changed in a moment,
as Paul teacheth in the fifteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the
Corinthians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461551&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:51, 52,) and in the First to the Thessalonians, and the fourth
chapter,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;520417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 4:17.) In the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>testify</i></font><font face="Palatino">
there is great weight; because, as men are naturally inclined unto unbelief, the
simple preaching of the gospel should not be so effectual, unless the Lord
should establish it with strong protestations. And chiefly, every one of us doth
feel in himself too much what a hard matter it is both to lift up our minds to
hope for the coming of Christ, which are entangled in earthly snares, and also
continually to keep them fixed in this meditation, seeing they cease not with
their lightness to be carried hither and thither continually.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>43.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To him bear all the
prophets.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke toucheth and gathereth the sum
of the sermon briefly, as we have said; therefore is he so short
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F722</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in noting the fruit of the history. Let us know that the words uttered by Peter
are not recited in this place; but that it, is only declared of what things he
intreated. And we must consider three things, That it is the proper office of
Christ to reconcile men to God when their sins are done away; that we have
remission of sins by faith; that this doctrine is not new or of late invented,
but that it had all the prophets of God since the beginning of the world to bear
witness of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As touching the first, if God be pleased and pacified
by not imputing our sins, it appeareth hereby that he hateth and is displeased
with all mankind,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F723</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
until such time as they begin to please him by free pardon. Therefore we are all
condemned of sin, which maketh us subject to the wrath of God, and bindeth us
with the guiltiness of eternal death; and because we are destitute of
righteousness in ourselves, we are taught to flee unto the mercy of God, as unto
our only fortress. When as he saith that the faithful receive remission of sins,
there is understood a hidden contrariety between them and God; for God must
needs offer it of his own accord that the faithful may receive it. When as he
saith that it is given by the name of Christ, his meaning is, that we return
into God&#8217;s favor by the benefit of Christ alone, because he hath once
reconciled him to us by his death; or, as they say commonly, that we obtain
forgiveness of sins by Christ&#8217;s mediation, (and coming between,) and by
none other means.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Satan could never blot out of the minds of men the
feeling of their guiltiness, but that they were always careful to crave pardon
at God&#8217;s hands; but forasmuch as there was but one way and means to obtain
pardon, miserable men, being deluded with the jugglings [impostures] of Satan,
did invent to themselves wonderful labyrinths, in whose crooks and turns they
wearied themselves in vain. This first error did first lead them away from the
right way, because they essayed to deserve pardon, which is offered freely, and
is received by faith alone. Afterward there were innumerable kinds of
satisfactions [expiations] invented whereby they appeased God. The beginning
thereof flowed indeed from the Word of God; but forasmuch as when God gave unto
the fathers the sacrifices and rites of oblations, he shadowed Christ, blind and
profane men, setting Christ aside, and following a vain shadow, did corrupt all
that which was God&#8217;s in sacrifices and satisfactions.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F724</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Wherefore, what sacrifices soever the Gentiles did use since the beginning of
the world, and those which the Turks and Jews use at this day, may be set
against Christ as things altogether contrary. The Papists are never a whit
better, save only that they sprinkle their satisfactions with the blood of
Christ; but they deal too disorderly therein,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F725</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because, being not content with Christ alone, they gather to themselves, on
every side, a thousand manner of sacrifices or satisfactions. Therefore,
whosoever desireth to have remission of sins, let him not turn aside from
Christ, even the least nail&#8217;s breadth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When as we hear, that we have remission of sins by
believing, we must understand and know the force and nature of faith, as
undoubtedly Peter intreated abundantly of this, [viz.] after what sort we must
believe in Christ. And this is nothing else, but with the sincere affection of
the mind to embrace him as he is set before us in the gospel; so that faith
dependeth upon the promises. Yet Peter seemeth to deal amiss, because whereas we
have two principal things by our Savior Christ, he doth only make mention of the
one of them; for he speaketh nothing of repentance and newness of 1ife, which
ought not to be omitted in the sum of the gospel.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F726</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But we may easily answer, That the regeneration of the Spirit is comprehended
under faith, as it is an effect thereof. For we believe in Christ for this
cause, partly that he may restore us unto the Father&#8217;s favor by the free
imputation of righteousness; partly that he may sanctify us by his Spirit, And
we know that we are adopted by God to be his children upon this condition, that
he may govern us by his Spirit. Therefore, it was sufficient for Peter to show
how men, who were by nature estranged from God, do return into favor with
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As touching the third member, we need not reckon up
all places of the prophets, where they set before us Christ to be the mediator,
who by obtaining pardon for our sins, doth reconcile God to us; but this is
their common order of teaching, and, as it were, their rule, to call back all
the godly unto that covenant which God made with Abraham putting the mediator
between.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F727</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Furthermore, this point is very needful to be known, that the grace which was
offered at length by Christ is the same which the law and the prophets, in times
past, delivered unto the fathers to be hoped for. And surely it was of great
force with Cornelius and such like, who did greatly reverence the law and
prophets, that they might know that that was performed and accomplished in very
deed in Christ which was testified in the oracles of the prophets. Therefore, to
the end the ministers of the Church may agree with the prophets in their form of
teaching, let them study by preaching to set forth Christ; let them continually
testify that we must seek righteousness at his hands alone, which consisteth
upon [of] free remission of sins. This is another manner of antiquity than that
which is showed with great boasting of the Papists, whilst that they thrust in
the rotten inventions

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And as Peter yet
spake.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> God declareth now by a new miracle, that
the doctrine of the gospel is common as well to the Gentiles as to the Jews. And
this is an excellent seal of the calling of the Gentiles; because the Lord would
never have vouchsafed to bestow upon the Gentiles the graces of his Spirit,
unless it had been to declare that even they were adopted together into the
society of the covenant. These gifts, mentioned by Luke, differ indeed from the
grace of regeneration; and yet, undoubtedly, God did by this means seal both
Peter&#8217;s doctrine, and also their faith and godliness which heard him. He
saith that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all</i></font><font face="Palatino">
endowed with the Spirit, like as we saw before, that they came all encouraged to
learn and obey.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This visible sign representeth unto us, as it were in
a table, what an effectual instrument of God&#8217;s power the preaching of the
gospel is; for he poured out his Spirit as Peter spake, to the end he might show
that he sendeth not teachers to that end, that they may beat the air with the
vain sound of their voice, but that he may work mightily by their voice, and may
quicken the same by the power of his Spirit, to the salvation of the godly. Thus
doth Paul put the Galatians
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:2.) in mind, that they received the Holy Ghost by the hearing of faith; and in
another place he saith that he is the minister of the Spirit, and not of the
letter,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:6.) The gift of the tongues, and other such like things, are
ceased long ago in the Church; but the spirit of understanding and of
regeneration is of force, and shall always be of force, which the Lord coupleth
with the external preaching of the gospel, that he may keep us in reverence of
his word, and may prevent the deadly dotings, wherein brain-sick fellows enwrap
themselves, whilst that, forsaking the word, they invent an erroneous and
wandering spirit. But it doth not, nor shall not, always so fall out, that all
those which hear the word with their outward ears, do or shall also receive the
Spirit; and the ministers do seldom light upon such hearers as Peter had, who
are willing, with one consent, to follow God. Yet he bringeth to pass that all
the elect feel in themselves the consent of the external word, and of the secret
power of the Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>45.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The faithful were
astonished.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He calleth them faithful who were
as yet possessed with a wicked error. So the Lord doth not by and by wipe away
all clouds of ignorance from his, and yet they do not darken the praise of faith
before God, because he pardoneth errors and doth vouchsafe to favor it, as if it
were pure and plain. And yet it is a wonder, that seeing they knew that Peter
was sent of God, they would now be amazed, as at some strange and new thing,
because God giveth the grace of his Spirit to those to whom he would have Christ
now preached; but the sudden change is the cause of this, because, whereas God
until that day had separated the Gentiles from his people as strangers and
aliens, he doth now favor them both alike, and lifteth them up into the like
degree of honor. Although we be also taught by this example, how hard a matter
it is for us to wind out ourselves out of our errors once conceived, especially
when they are of any continuance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>46.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
For they heard them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He expresseth what gifts
of the Spirit were poured out upon them, and therewithal he noteth the use; to
wit, that they had variety of tongues given them, so that they did glorify God
with many tongues. Also, it may be gathered out of this place, that the tongues
were given them not only for necessity, seeing the gospel was to be preached to
strangers and to men of another language, but also to be an ornament and worship
to the gospel. But ambition did afterward corrupt this second use, forasmuch as
many did translate that unto pomp and vain glory which they had received to set
forth the dignity of the heavenly wisdom, as Paul doth sharply reprove this
fault in the Corinthians. Therefore, no marvel if God took away that shortly
after which he had given, and did not suffer the same to be corrupted with
longer abuse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>47.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Peter answered.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Peter reasoneth from the thing
to the sign; for, seeing that baptism is an addition or appurtenance of the
spiritual grace, he which hath received the Spirit is also apt [fit] to receive
baptism; and this is the (most) lawful order, that the minister admit those unto
the receiving of the outward sign whom God hath testified to be his children by
the mark and pledge of his Spirit; so that faith and doctrine are first. And
whereas unlearned men infer thereupon that infants are not to be baptized, it is
without all reason. I grant that those who are strangers from the Church must be
taught before the sign of adoption be given them; but I say, that the children
of the faithful which are born in the Church are from their mother&#8217;s womb
of the household of the kingdom of God. Yea, the argument which they use
preposterously against us do I turn back [retort] upon themselves; for, seeing
that God hath adopted the children of the faithful before they be born, I
conclude thereupon that they are not to be defrauded of the outward sign;
otherwise men shall presume to take that from them which God hath granted them.
As touching the manifest grace of the Spirit, there is no absurdity therein, if
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F729</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it follow after baptism in them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And as this testimony maketh nothing for maintenance
of their error, so it doth strongly refute the error of the Papists, who tie the
grace of the Spirit to the signs, and think that the same is fet [fetched] from
heaven with enchantments,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F730</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as those witches did think that they did pull down the moon with their charms.
But forasmuch as Luke saith that these had the Holy Ghost given them who were
not as yet baptized, he showeth that the Spirit is not included in baptism.
Lastly, we must note that the apostles were content with water alone when as
they did baptize,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F731</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and would to God this plainness had been retained amongst their posterity, and
that they had not gathered here and there divers trifles, whereof baptism is
filth in Popery. They think that the worthiness of baptism is adorned with oil,
salt, spittle, wax-candles, whereas they are rather filthy pollutions which
corrupt the pure and natural [genuine] institution of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>48.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he commanded them to be
baptized.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It was not of necessity that baptism
should be ministered by Peter&#8217;s hand, as Paul doth likewise testify that
he baptized few at Corinth, for other ministers might take this charge upon
them. Whereas he saith, in the name of the Lord, it must not be restrained unto
the form, as we have said in the third chapter; but because Christ is the proper
scope of baptism, therefore are we said to be baptized in his name. When as Luke
saith, last of all, that Peter was requested by Cornelius and his kinsmen that
he would tarry a few days, he commendeth in them their desire to profit. They
were, indeed, endued with the Holy Ghost; but they were not so come to the top,
but that confirmation was as yet profitable for them. And, according to their
example, so often as opportunity to profit offereth itself, we must use it
diligently; and let us not swell with pride, which stoppeth the way before
doctrine.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the
apostles.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Whereas Luke declareth that the fame
of one house which was converted was spread abroad everywhere amongst the
brethren, that did arise by reason of admiration; for the Jews accounted it as a
monster that the Gentiles should be gathered unto them as if they should have
heard that there had been men made of stones. Again, the immoderate love of
their nation did hinder them from acknowledging the work of God. For we see that
through this ambition and pride the Church was troubled; because the equality
which did diminish their dignity was not tolerable. For which cause they did
contend stoutly to bring the necks of the Gentiles under the yoke. But forasmuch
as it was foretold by so many prophecies of the prophets, that the Church should
be gathered of all people after the coming of the Messiah, and forasmuch as
Christ had given commandment to his apostles touching the preaching of the
gospel throughout the whole world, how can it be that the conversion of a few
men should move some, as some strange thing, and should terrify other some, as
if it were some monster? I answer, that whatsoever was foretold touching the
calling of the Gentiles, it was so taken as if the Gentiles should be made
subject to the law of Moses, that they might have a place in the Church. But the
manner of the calling, the beginning whereof they saw then, was not only
unknown, but it seemed to be quite contrary to reason. For they did dream that
it was impossible that the Gentiles could be mixed with the sons of Abraham, and
be made one body with them, (the ceremonies being taken away,) but that there
should be great injury done to the covenant of God; for to what end served the
law save only to be the mid wall to note out the disagreement? Secondly, because
they were acquainted with that difference during their whole life, the
unlooked-for newness of the thing doth so pierce them, that they did forget all
that which ought to have quieted their minds. Finally, they do not straightway
comprehend the mystery, which, as Paul teacheth, was unknown to the angels from
the creation of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
They reasoned with him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Obstinacy doth for the
most part accompany error. This was now a fault having in it too gross
ignorance, in that they did not quietly receive the Gentiles into their bosom,
united to them by the same Spirit of faith. But they do not only leap back, but
also contend with Peter contentiously, and blame him for his fact, which
deserved great praise. They hear that the Gentiles have embraced the Word of
God; what letteth them then from embracing them, that they may be coupled
together
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F733</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
under the government of one God? For what more holy bond can there be, than when
all men, with one consent, are coupled and joined to God? And why should not
those grow together into one body who make the Messiah of God their head? But
because they saw the external form of the law broken, they thought that heaven
and earth did go together.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F734</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And note, that although Luke said before that the
apostles and brethren had heard this fame, yet he spake nothing of offense; but
he bringeth in now, as it were, a new sect of men, which did contend with Peter.
The brethren, saith he,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
heard,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and there an end; it followeth,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When Peter was come to Jerusalem,
those which were of the circumcision did contend
with</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
who were undoubtedly unlike to the first; again, these words
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">peritomhv</font><font face="Palatino">,
do not simply signify the Jews, but those who were too much addicted to keeping
the ceremonies of the law. For there were none of Jerusalem in Christ&#8217;s
flock at that time, save only those which were circumcised. From whom, then,
could he distinguish those men? Lastly, it seemeth to be a thing unlike to be
true that the apostles, and those which were moderate being of the number of the
faithful, did attempt this combat. For though they had been offended, yet they
might have conferred with Peter privately, and have demanded some reason of his
fact. By these reasons am I moved to think that those are said to be of the
circumcision who did make so great account of circumcision, that they granted no
man a place in the kingdom of God, unless he took upon him the profession of the
law, and, being admitted into the Church by this holy rite, did put off
uncleanness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Unto men being uncircumcised.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This was not
forbidden by the law of God, but it was a tradition which came from the fathers.
And yet, notwithstanding, Peter doth not object that they dealt too hardly
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F735</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
with him in this point, and that he was not bound by the necessity of
man&#8217;s law. He omitteth all this defense, and doth only answer, that they
came first unto him, and that they were offered unto him, as it were, by the
hand of God. And here we see the rare modesty of Peter, because whereas,
trusting to the goodness of the cause, he might have justly despised unskillful
men, who did trouble him unjustly, yet doth he mildly excuse himself as it
becometh brethren. This was no small trial in that he was unworthily accused,
because he had obeyed God faithfully. But because he knew that this law was
enjoined the whole Church, that every man be ready to give an account of his
doctrine and life so often as the matter requireth, and he remembered that he
was one of the flock, he doth not only suffer himself to be ruled, but
submitteth himself willingly to the judgment of the Church. Doctrine, indeed, if
it be of God, is placed above the chance and die of man&#8217;s judgment; but
because the Lord will have prophecy judged, his servants must not refuse this
condition, that they prove themselves to be such as they will be accounted. But
we shall see anon how far the defense both of doctrine, as also of facts, ought
to extend.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this present we must know this, that Peter doth
willingly answer for himself when his fact is reproved.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F736</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And if the Pope of Rome be Peter&#8217;s successor, why is not he bound by the
same law? Admit we grant that this submission was voluntary, yet why doth not
the successor imitate such an example of modesty showed unto him? Although we
need no long circumstance
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F737</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
here; for if that be true which the Popes spew out in their sacrilegious
decrees, Peter did treacherously betray and forsake the privileges of their
seat, [See,] and so he betrayed the See of Rome. For, after that they have made
the Pope the judge of all the whole world, affirming that he is not subject to
man&#8217;s judgment; after that they have lifted him up above the clouds, that,
being free from giving an account, his will and pleasure may stand for a reason,
[law,] they make him forthwith patron of the apostolic seat, [See,] stoutly to
defend the privileges thereof. Of what great sluggishness shall Peter then be
condemned, if he did lose his right given him of God, by yielding so cowardly?
[easily.] Why did not he at least object that he was free from the laws, and
exempt from the common sort? But he useth no such preface, but entereth [on] the
cause without making any delay. And let us remember, that there is nothing which
hindereth us from contemning that idol safely, seeing that usurping such
unbridled tyranny, he hath blotted himself out of the number of the
bishops.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Peter
beginning.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Because this narration is all one
with [that] which we had in the chapter next (going before,) and because it is
repeated almost in the very same words, if any thing need to be expounded let
the readers repair thither. The purpose of Peter, and all the whole sum of his
speech, shall appear by the conclusion. Yet, before I come thither, we must
briefly mark that he maketh the preaching of the gospel the cause of salvation.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt hear (saith he) words
wherein thou mayest have salvation,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> not because
salvation is included in man&#8217;s voice, but because God, offering his Son
there unto eternal life, doth also cause us to enjoy him by faith. This is
assuredly wonderful goodness of God, who maketh men ministers of life, who have
nothing but matter of death in themselves, and which are not only subject to
death in themselves, but are also deadly to others. Nevertheless, the filthy
unthankfulness of the world betrayeth itself in this point, which, loathing true
and certain salvation offered unto it, and forsaking it when it lieth at the
feet, doth imagine divers and vain salvations, in seeking which, it had rather
gape being hungry,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F738</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
than to be filled with the grace of God which meeteth it and is
present.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I remembered the word of the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We have sufficiently declared in the
first chapter, that when Christ uttered that sentence, he did not make a
comparison between two baptisms; but that he intended to declare what difference
there was between him and John,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
1:5.) For, as we distinguish the sign from his [its] truth, so it is good to
distinguish the minister from the author, lest mortal man challenge
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F739</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that which is proper to God. Man hath the sign in his hand; it is Christ alone
which watereth and regenerateth. For it skilleth much whither men&#8217;s minds
be directed in seeking the graces of God, because they shall not receive one
drop without Christ. Therefore, there is this general difference between Christ
and all the ministers of the Church, because they give the external sign of
water, but he fulfilleth and performeth the effect of the sign by the power of
his Spirit. The readers were to be admonished of this thing again in this place,
because many do falsely infer that John&#8217;s baptism and ours are not all
one, whilst that Christ, challenging to himself the Spirit, doth leave nothing
for John save water alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if any man trusting to this testimony do make
baptism a cold spectacle, and void of all grace of the Spirit, he shall be also
greatly deceived. For the Holy Scripture useth to speak two manner of ways of
the sacraments. For because Christ is not unfaithful in his promises, he doth
not suffer that to be vain which he doth institute; but when as the Scripture
doth attribute to baptism strength to wash and regenerate, it ascribeth all this
to Christ, and doth only teach what he worketh by his Spirit by the hand of man
and the visible sign. Where Christ is thus joined with the minister, and the
efficacy of the Spirit with the sign, there is so much attributed to the
sacraments as is needful,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;560305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
3:5;) but that conjunction must not be so confused, but that men&#8217;s minds,
being drawn from mortal and frail things, and things like to themselves, and
from the elements of the world, they must learn to seek for salvation at
Christ&#8217;s hand, and to look unto the power of his Spirit alone; because he
misseth the mark of faith, whosoever turneth aside even but a little from the
Spirit unto the signs; and he is a sacrilegious person who taketh even but an
inch of Christ&#8217;s praise, that be may deck man therewith. And we must also
remember that Christ did comprehend under the word Spirit, not only the gift of
tongues, and such like things, but all the whole grace of our renewing; but
because these gifts were an excellent argument of Christ&#8217;s power, this
sentence may well be applied unto them. I will make this more plain; seeing that
Christ did bestow upon the apostles the visible graces of the Spirit, he did
plainly declare that the Spirit was in his hand; so that by this means he did
testify, that he is the alone author of cleanness, righteousness, and of the
whole regeneration. And Peter applieth it unto his purpose thus, that forasmuch
as Christ did go before, carrying with him the force of baptism, it became him
to follow with the addition,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F740</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that is, the outward sign of water.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who was
I?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Now do we see to what end Peter made that
narration; to wit, that he might declare that God was the author and governor of
all the whole matter; therefore, the state of the question consisteth in
[turneth upon] the authority of God, whether meat be not of more weight than
men&#8217;s counsels.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F741</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Peter affirmeth that he did nothing but that which was rightly and orderly done,
because he obeyed God; he showeth that he preached the doctrine of the gospel,
neither amiss, neither rashly, where Christ bestowed the graces of his Spirit.
The approbation of our doctrine, and also our deeds, must be brought to this
rule so often as men call us to an account; for whosoever stayeth himself upon
the commandment of God, he hath defense enough. If men be not content, there is
no cause why he should pass for their judgments any more.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F742</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And hereby we gather that the faithful ministers of God&#8217;s word may in such
sort give an account of their doctrine, that they may no whit impair the credit
and certainty thereof; to wit, if they show that it was given them by God: but
if they shall deal with unjust men, who will not be enforced with the reverence
of God to yield, let us let them alone with their obstinacy, appealing unto the
day of the Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And we must also note, that we do not only resist God
by striving against him, but also by lingering, if we do not that which our
calling requireth, and which is proper to it. For Peter saith that he cannot
deny baptism and brotherly fellowship to the Gentiles, but that he should be
[without being] an enemy to God. But he should have essayed nothing which was
manifestly contrary to the grace of God. That is true indeed; but he which doth
not receive those whom God offereth, and shutteth the gate which God openeth, he
hindereth the work of God so much as in him lieth; as we say at this day, that
those men make war against God who are set against the baptizing of infants;
because they most cruelly exclude those out of the Church whom God hath adopted
into the Church, and they deprive those of the outward sign whom God vouchsafeth
to call his children. Like unto this is that kind of resisting, in that many
dissemblers, who, whilst they be magistrates, ought to assist, according to
their office, the martyrs of Christ, go about to stop their mouths, and to take
from them their liberty. For because they hate the truth, they would have it
suppressed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When they heard these things they
were quieted.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The end doth show that those were
not moved with malice which did contend with Peter; for this is an evident sign
of godliness, in that being thoroughly instructed touching the will of God, they
cease forthwith to contend. By which example we are taught, that those are not
to be despised who, being offended through unadvised zeal, reprove any thing
wrongfully; but that their consciences must be appeased by the Word of God,
which are troubled by error, and that their docility is tried at least thus far
forth. As touching us, we do hereby, in like sort, learn whereupon our judgment
must depend, namely, upon the sole and simple beck of God. For this honor is due
to him, that his will be to us the certain and principal rule of truth and
justice. So often as it is requisite for us to know the cause of any thing, the
Lord doth not conceal the same from us; but to the end he may accustom our faith
unto just obedience, he telleth us sometimes simply and plainly that this or
that thing pleaseth him. He which granteth liberty to himself to inquire
farther, and taketh a delight in his curiosity, doth nothing else but throw
himself headlong with devilish boldness. And Luke doth not only declare that
these men held their peace, but that they gave glory also to God. Some are
enforced by shame to hold their peace, who, notwithstanding, keep in that in
their minds which they dare not utter. That is rather a dissemblance of modesty
than docility. But these men do so thoroughly submit themselves to God, that
they are not afraid nor ashamed to recant by and by,
[forthwith.]</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then hath
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke doth briefly declare in these words
what the gospel containeth, and to what end it tendeth, to wit, that God may
reconcile men to himself, being renewed by his Spirit. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>repentance</i></font><font face="Palatino">
alone is expressed in this place, but when he addeth
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unto
life,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> it appeareth plainly that it is not
separated from faith. Therefore, whosoever will rightly profit in the gospel,
let him put off the old man, and think upon newness of life,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:22;) that done, let him know for a certainty that he is not called in vain
unto repentance, but that there is salvation prepared for him in Christ. So
shall it come to pass, that the hope and assurance of salvation shall rest upon
the free mercy of God alone, and that the forgiveness of sins shall,
notwithstanding, be no cause of sluggish security. This member, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>give repentance,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">may be expounded two manner of ways; either
that God granted to the Gentiles place for repentance, when as he would have his
gospel preached to them; or that he circumcised their hearts by his Spirit, as
Moses saith,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;053006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy

that they may begin to be new creatures; and it agreeth better with this second
sense; it is not so much racked, and it agreeth better with the phrase
[phraseology] of Scripture.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Those which were scattered
abroad.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke returneth now unto the former
history, (and unto that which followed in the same.) For he had said before that
after that Stephen was slain the cruelty of the wicked increased; and many fled
hither and thither for fear, so that the apostles were almost left alone at
Jerusalem. Whereas the Church was thus torn in pieces, and fear did cause those
which were fled to keep silence or else contempt of strangers,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F743</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he declareth that that event did follow which no man would have hoped for; for
as the seed is sown that it may bring forth fruit, so it came to pass through
their flight and scattering abroad, that the gospel was spread abroad in nations
which were far off, which was included before within the walls of one city, as
in a barn.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F744</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In like sort it came to pass, that the name of Christ, passing over mountains
and seas, did flow even unto the farthest parts of the world; and by this means,
according to the prophecy of Isaiah, the consumption did abound
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F745</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in righteousness. If so many godly men had not been expelled out of Jerusalem,
Cyprus had heard nothing, Phenice had heard nothing of Christ; yea, Italy and
Spain, which were farther off, had heard nothing. But the Lord brought to pass,
that of many torn members did arise more bodies. For how came it to pass that
there were Churches gathered at Rome and at Puteoli, save only because a few
exiled men, and such as fled away,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F746</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
had brought the gospel thither with them? And as God did at that time make the
endeavors of Satan frustrate after a wonderful sort, so we need not doubt but
that even at this day he will make to himself triumphs of the cross and
persecution, that the Church may better grow together, though it be scattered
abroad. Phenice joineth to Syria, and is nigh to Galilee. Antioch is a most
famous city of Syria, at which part it is joined to Cilicia.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speaking to
none.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Peradventure they were letted not only
with fear of persecution, that they durst not speak to the Gentiles, but also
with that foolish religion, in that they thought that the children&#8217;s bread
was thrown to the dogs,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:15;) whereas, notwithstanding, Christ had commanded that the gospel should be
preached to all the world after his resurrection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b> Luke doth at length declare that certain
of them brought this treasure even unto the Gentiles. And Luke calleth these
Grecians not
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Ellhnev</font><font face="Palatino">,
but
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Ellhnistai</font><font face="Palatino">.
Therefore, some say that those came of the Jews, yet did they inhabit Greece;
which I do not allow. For seeing the Jews, whom he mentioned a little before,
were partly of Cyprus, they must needs be reckoned in that number, because the
Jews count Cyprus a part of Greece. But Luke distinguisheth them from those,
whom he calleth afterward
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Ellhnistav</font><font face="Palatino">.
Furthermore, forasmuch as he had said that the word was preached at the
beginning only to the Jews, and he meant those who, being banished out of their
own country, did live in Cyprus and Phenice, correcting as it were this
exception, he saith that some of them did teach the Grecians. This contrariety
doth cause me to expound it of the Gentiles. For Luke&#8217;s meaning is, that a
few did more freely preach the gospel,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F747</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because the calling of the Gentiles was not unknown to them. But the constancy
of them all deserveth no small praise; because, being delivered, as it were, out
of the midst of death, they are not afraid to do their duty toward God even with
danger. Whence we gather to what end, and how far forth Christians may fly
persecution; to wit, that they may spend
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F748</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the residue of their life in spreading abroad the glory of God. If any man
demand how it came to pass that strangers lately coming, and such as might have
been suspected among all the Jews, and hated of them, because they were banished
out of Jerusalem, were so bold, I answer, that this came to pass through the
singular motion of God, and that they consulted suddenly according to the
occasion offered them. For this deliberation is not of flesh and
blood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
The hand of the Lord was.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke proveth by the
success that the gospel was offered unto the Gentiles also by the brethren of
Cyprus and Cyrene not rashly nor unadvisedly, because their labor was fruitful
and profitable. But such increase should never have followed, unless God had
commanded and favored. Therefore, it followeth that it pleased God that the
Gentiles should be called. The hand, as it is well known, doth signify power and
strength. Therefore, this is Luke&#8217;s meaning, that God did testify by his
present aid that the Gentiles were called together with the Jews, through his
direction, to be made partakers of the grace of Christ. And this blessing of God
served not a little to confirm the minds of all men. This place did also teach
us, that what pains soever the ministers of God take in teaching, it shall be
all vain and void, unless God bless their labors from heaven. For we may plant
and water, as Paul teacheth, but the increase cometh from God alone, (1
Corinthians 3,) in whose hand the hearts of men are, that he may bend and frame
the same at his pleasure. Therefore, as often as we are to intreat of faith, let
us always remember this speech, that God wrought by his ministers, and that he
made their doctrine effectual by his hand, that is, by the secret inspiration of
the Spirit. Therefore, let the minister attempt nothing trusting to his own wit
and industry, but let him commit his labor to the Lord, upon whose grace the
whole success dependeth; and where doctrine shall work effectually, let those
which shall believe thank God for their faith. Furthermore, we must note that
which Luke saith, that many were turned unto God by faith, because he doth very
well express the force and nature of faith; that it is not idle and cold,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F749</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but such as restoreth men (who were before turned away from God) unto his
government, and bindeth them unto his righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And the tidings.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> If this report had been
brought before Peter did excuse himself, those good men should have been
reproved of many whose ministry notwithstanding God had sealed with the grace of
his Spirit; but that superstition was now wiped away out of their minds,
forasmuch as God had by evident signs declared that no nation ought to be
counted profane. Therefore, they contend no longer, neither do they count it a
point of rashness, that some durst preach Christ unto the Gentiles; but by
sending help, they testify that they allow that which they had done.
Furthermore, this was the cause why they sent Barnabas. The apostles did at that
time bear all the burden of the kingdom of Christ; therefore, it was their duty
to frame and set in order Churches every where; to keep all the faithful,
wheresoever dispersed, in the pure consent of faith; to appoint ministers and
pastors wheresoever there was any number of the faithful. The crafty wiliness of
Satan is well known. So soon as he seeth a gate set open for the gospel, he
endeavoreth by all means to corrupt that which is sincere, [pure;] whereby it
came to pass that divers heresies brake out together with Christ&#8217;s
doctrine. Therefore, the greater gifts every Church hath, the more careful ought
it to be, lest Satan mix or trouble any thing amongst the ignorant, and those
who are not as yet established in the right faith; because it is the easiest
matter in the world to corrupt corn in the blade. To conclude, Barnabas was sent
to bring them farther forward in the principles of faith; to set things in some
certain order; to give the building which was begun some form, that there might
be a lawful state of the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When he had seen the grace of
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words Luke teacheth, first, that
the gospel which they had received was true; secondly, that Barnabas sought
nothing else but the glory of Christ. For, when he saith that he saw the grace
of God, and that he exhorted them to go forward, hereby we gather that they were
well taught. And the joy is a testimony of sincere godliness. Ambition is
evermore envious and malicious; so that we see many seek for praise by reproving
other men, because they are more desirous of their own glory than of the glory
of Christ. But the faithful servants of Christ must rejoice (as did Barnabas)
when they see the gospel increase, by whomsoever God shall make his name known.
And assuredly those which help one another, so that they acknowledge that all
the effect which springeth thence is the work of God, will never envy one
another, neither will they seek to carp [at] one another, but will, with one
mouth and mind, praise the power of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again, this is worth the noting, that Luke doth
attribute the faith of the men of Antioch, and whatsoever was worthy [of ]
praise there, to the grace of God. He might have reckoned up all those virtues
which might make for the commendation of men; but he comprehendeth what
excellence soever was in that Church under this word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grace.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Lastly, we must note Barnabas&#8217; exhortation. We have already said that
Barnabas did subscribe to the former doctrine which they had embraced; but lest
doctrine fall away, it is most requisite that it be thoroughly imprinted in the
minds of the faithful by continual exhortations. For seeing that we have to
encounter continually with so many and such strong adversaries, and our minds
are so slippery, unless every man arm himself diligently, it will by and by fall
away, which thing infinite numbers do show to be true by their falling away.
Whereas he setteth down this manner of perseverance, that they continue with
purpose of heart we are hereby taught that faith hath taken deep root then when
it hath a place in the heart. Wherefore it is no marvel, if scarce one of ten of
those who profess faith do stand unto the end, seeing that very few know what
the affection and purpose of heart meaneth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
For he was a good man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Barnabas is commended
with the commendation of the Holy Ghost; yet we must know that there was respect
had not so much of him as of us. For all those are condemned of ungodliness and
malice who envy other men&#8217;s labors, and are grieved when they see the same
have good success.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Also we must note the epithet used in the description
of a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good man, full of the Holy
Ghost, full of faith.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For after that he had
said that he was an upright and good man, he showed from what fountain this
goodness did flow; that, abandoning the affections of the flesh, he did, with
all his heart, embrace godliness, having the Spirit to be his guide. But why
doth he separate faith from the Spirit, whose gift it is? I answer, that it is
not named severally, as if it were a diverse thing, but it is rather set forth
as a principal token, whereby it might appear that Barnabas was full of the Holy
Ghost.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There was a great multitude
added.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Though the number of the godly was
already great, yet Luke saith that it was increased by Barnabas&#8217; coming.
Thus doth the building of the Church go forward when one doth help another with
mutual consent, and one doth gently allow

that which another hath begun.</font><br></div>

he respecteth nothing but that Christ may be chief; how he setteth before his

success of the gospel. Therefore, Barnabas is no whit afraid lest Paul do any
whit debase him by his coming, so he glorify Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b> He addeth afterward, that such a holy
concord was blessed from heaven; for this was no small honor that the holy name
of Christians began there for all the whole world. Though the apostles had been
long time at Jerusalem, yet God had not vouchsafed to bestow upon his Church,
which was there, this excellent title of his Son. Whether it were because at
Antioch much people was grown together into one body, as well of Jews as of
Gentiles, or whether it were because the Church might be better ordered in time
of peace; or because they were more bold to confess their faith, there were in
very deed Christians both at Jerusalem and also in Samaria before that time; and
we know that Jerusalem was the first fountain from which Christianity did flow.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F751</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And what is it else to be a disciple of Christ but to be a Christian? But when
they began plainly to be called that which they were the use of the name served
greatly to set forth the glory of Christ, because by this means they referred
all their religion unto Christ alone. This was, therefore, a most excellent
worship for the city of Antioch. that Christ brought forth his name thence like
a standard, whereby it might be made known to all the world that there was some
people whose captain was Christ, and which did glory in his
name.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But and if Rome had such a color of [pretext for]

themselves whatsoever, when they come to the matter, they are found altogether
vain; yea, Antioch itself doth plainly prove that the estate of one place is not
continual. Admit we grant the Romans these plausible titles, <i>we have been
sometimes, [we once were,]</i> shall they yet be so bold as to take one-half of
that which belongeth to Antioch? And is the dignity of Antioch the greater now,
because the Christians had their name thence? Yea, it is rather a manifest
mirror of the horrible vengeance of God. For, seeing there is nothing to be seen
there but evil favored wastiness,

the men of Antioch by the fruit, because they endeavored to relieve the poverty
of that church, from whence they received the gospel, with their abundance; and
that did they unrequested. Such earnest care for the brethren doth sufficiently
declare how seriously they worshipped Christ, the head of all. Luke doth signify
that the fame of that church was spread abroad, when he saith that there came
excellent men thither from Jerusalem. But forasmuch as the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophet
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is taken divers ways in the New Testament as we
may learn by the former Epistle to the Corinthians, those are called prophets in
this place who were endued with the gift of prophesying, as the four daughters
of Philip shall have the same title given them hereafter. And forasmuch as the
foretelling of the famine is attributed to Agabus alone, we may hereby gather
that this was granted to every one by a certain measure to know things to
come.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He signified by the
Spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Luke doth plainly express that the
Spirit of God was the author of this prophecy, that we may know that it was not
a conjecture taken by the stars, or some other natural causes; again, that
Agabus did not play the philosopher after the manner of men, but he uttered that
which God had appointed by the secret inspiration of the Spirit. Barrenness may
indeed be sometimes foretold by the disposition of the stars, but there is no
certainty in such foretellings, both because of the opposite concourses, and
also, especially, because God doth govern earthly things at his pleasure, far
otherwise than can be gathered by the stars, that he may lead men away from the
perverse beholding of stars. And although these foretellings have their degree,
yet the prophecies of the Spirit do far exceed them. But it seemeth that the
foretelling of the famine was unlucky, [of evil omen,] and not to be wished for;
for to what end was it for men to be made miserable before their time, by having
the unhappy event foretold? I answer, that there be many causes for which it is
expedient that men should be warned before in time when the judgments of God
hang over their heads, and punishments [are] due to their sins. I omit others
which are usual
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F753</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in the prophets, because [viz. that] they have a space granted wherein to
repent, that they may prevent God&#8217;s judgment, who have provoked his wrath
against themselves; because [that] the faithful are instructed in time to arm
themselves with patience; because [that] the obstinate wickedness of wicked men
is convict; because [that] both good and evil learn that miseries do not come by
chance, but that they are punishments wherewith God doth punish the sins of the
world; because [that] those are awakened out of their sleep and sluggishness by
this means, who took great delight in their vices. The profit of this present
prophecy appeareth by the text, because the men of Antioch were thereby pricked
forward to relieve their brethren which were in misery.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which happened under
Claudius</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Suetonius also maketh mention of this
famine, who saith that there were crusts or shards thrown at Claudius&#8217;
head in the midst of the market and that he was so sore afraid of stoning, that
he had a singular care afterward, during his whole life, to make provision for
victual. And Josephus, in his Fifteenth Book of Antiquity, saith, that Judea was
sore oppressed with scarcity, by reason of continual drought.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b> But here ariseth a question, seeing that
the misery was common to all, why ought they rather to have succored one people
than all the rest? I answer, that forasmuch as Judea was impoverished with great
destructions of wars and other miseries, the men of Antioch were not without
cause more moved with the miseries of the brethren which were there; secondly,
the greater the rage of the enemies was, the more wretched was the estate of the
brethren. Finally, Paul doth sufficiently declare, in the Epistle to the
Galatians, that Judea had certain especial necessities, whereof all other had
regard, not without cause, (Galatians 3) And this thankfulness deserved no small
commendations, in that the men of Antioch thought that they ought to help the
needy brethren, from whom they had received the gospel. For there is nothing
more just than that those should reap earthly things who have sown spiritual
things. As every man is too much bent to provide for himself, every man might
readily have excepted and objected: Why shall not I rather provide for myself?
But when they call to mind how greatly they are indebted to the brethren,
omitting that carefulness,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F754</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they turn themselves to help them. In sum, this alms had a double end; for the
men of Antioch did the duty of charity toward their needy brethren and they did
also testify by this sign, what great account they made of the gospel, whilst
that they honored the place whence it came.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As every man was
able.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We see the men of Antioch observe in this
place that mean which Paul prescribeth to the Corinthians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470806&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 8:6,) whether they did this of themselves, or being instructed by
him; and it is not to be doubted, but that he continued like to himself
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F755</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in both places. Therefore we must follow this rule, that every one, considering
how much is granted him, impart the same courteously with his brethren, as one
that must give an account; so shall it come to pass, that he which is but poor
shall have a liberal mind, and that a small reward
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F756</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
shall be counted a fat and gorgeous sacrifice. By this word <i>determined,</i>
Luke giveth us to understand that their oblation was voluntary. Which thing
ought so to be, as Paul teacheth, that we reach out our hand unto the needy not
as constrained, but cheerfully,

say, that one did not prescribe another a law, neither did they burthen one
another with their prejudice, but that every man did bestow his liberality as
seemed good to himself; and we must note the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diakoniav</font><font face="Palatino">,
whereby we are taught that rich men have greater abundance given them upon that
condition, that they may be the ministers of the poor in the dispensation
committed to them by God. Lastly, Luke teacheth that the blessing was sent not
to all the whole nation, but only to those that were of the household of faith,
not because we ought never to use any bountifulness, or courtesy towards the
unbelievers, seeing love ought to extend itself unto all mankind, but because
those ought to be preferred whom God hath joined and linked to us move near, and
with a more holy band.</font><br></div>

Sending it unto the elders,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> [presbyters.] We
must note two things in this place, that the men of Antioch did choose faithful
men, and of known honesty, to carry their blessing; secondly, that they sent it
unto the elders, that they might wisely bestow the same. For if alms be thrown
into the midst of the common people, or be set in the midst where every one may
take what he will, every man will by and by take it to himself as if it were
some common prey; and so he that is most bold will defraud the needy; yea,
through his greediness he will cut the throats of the hungry. Therefore, let us
mark these places, which teach that we must not only deal uprightly and
faithfully, but that there is also an order and wisdom required as well in
making choice as in all our administration. Those are called elders in whose
hands the government of the Church was, among whom the apostles were chief; the
men of Antioch refer the holy money (which they had appointed for the poor) to
their discretion. If any man object that this was the office of the deacons,
forasmuch as the apostles did deny that they could both serve tables and attend
upon doctrine, answer is easy, that the deacons were appointed over tables, in
such sort, that yet, notwithstanding, they were under the elders, [presbyters,]
neither did they any thing but at their appointment.</font><br></div>

Herod. We see that the Church had some short truce, that it might, as it were,
by a short breathing, recover some courage against the time to come, and that it
might then fight afresh. So at this day there is no cause why the faithful,
having borne the brunts of one or two conflicts, should promise themselves rest,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F757</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
or should desire such a calling
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F758</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
as old overworn soldiers use to have. Let this suffice them if the Lord grant
them some time wherein they may recover their strength. This Herod was Agrippa
the greater, [elder,] the son of Aristobulus, whom his father slew. Josephus
doth no where call him Herod, it may be, because he had a brother who was king
of Chalcis, whose name was Herod. This man was incensed to afflict the Church
not so much for any love he had to religion, as that by this means he might
flatter the common people which did otherwise not greatly favor him; or rather,
he was moved hereunto with tyrannical cruelty, because he was afraid of
innovation, which tyrants do always fear, lest it trouble the quiet estate of
their dominion. Yet it is likely that he did shed innocent blood, that,
according to the common craft of kings, he might gratify a furious people;
because St. Luke will shortly after declare that Peter the apostle was put into
prison that he might be a pleasant spectacle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He killed
James.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Undoubtedly the cruelty of this
mad man was restrained and bridled by the secret power of God. For assuredly he
would never have been content with one or two murders, and so have abstained
from persecuting the rest, but he would rather have piled up martyrs upon heaps,
unless God had set his hand against him, and defended his flock. So when we see
that the enemies of godliness, being full of fury, do not commit horrible
slaughters, that they may mix and imbrue all things with blood, let us know that
we need not thank their moderation and clemency for this; but because, when the
Lord doth spare his sheep, he doth not suffer them to do so much hurt as they
would. This Herod was not so courteous, that he would stick to win peace or the
people&#8217;s favor with the punishment of an hundred men or
more.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Wherefore, we must think with ourselves that he was
tied by one that had the rule over him, that he might not more vehemently
oppress the Church. He slew James, as, when any sedition is raised, the heads
and captains go first to the pot,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F759</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that the common riff-raft may by their punishment be terrified. Nevertheless,
the Lord suffered him whom he had furnished with constancy to be put to death,
that by death he might get the victory as a strong and invincible champion. So
that the attempts of tyrants notwithstanding, God maketh choice of
sweet-smelling sacrifices to establish the faith of his gospel. Luke calleth
this games which was slain the brother of John, that he may distinguish him from
the son of Alpheus. For whereas some make him a third cousin of Christ&#8217;s,
who was only some one of the disciples, I do not like of that, because I am by
strong reasons persuaded to think that there were no more. Let him that will,
repair to the second to the Galatians. Therefore, I think that the apostle and
the son of Alpheus were all one, whom the Jews threw down headlong from the top
of the temple, whose death was so highly Commended for his singular praise of
holiness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seeing that it pleased the
Jews.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It appeareth more plainly by this
that Herod was not moved either with any zeal that he had to Moses&#8217; law or
with any hatred of the gospel, thus to persecute the Church; but that he might
provide for his own private affairs, for he proceedeth in his cruelty that he
may win the people&#8217;s favor; therefore we must know that there be diverse
causes for which the Church is assaulted on every side. Oftentimes perverse zeal
driveth the wicked headlong to fight for their superstitions, and that they may
sacrifice an offering to their idols by shedding innocent blood; but the more
part is moved with private commodities only, so in times past, at such time as
Nero knew, after the burning of the city, that he was loathed and hated of the
people, he sought by this subtle means to get into favor again, or, at least, he
went about to stay their slanders and complaints, by putting certain thousands
of the godly to death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In like sort, that Herod may win the people&#8217;s
favor, who did love him but a little, he putteth the Christians to death. as a
price wherewith he might redeem their favor; and such is our estate at this day,
for though all men run by troops upon the members of Christ,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F760</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet few are pooked
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F761</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
forward with superstition; but some sell themselves to antichrist, like
profitable bond-slaves; other some bear with, and commend the outrageous
outcries of monks and the common people. But we, in the mean season, being
abjects, must be glad to bear their mocks; yet there is one comfort which doth
excellently keep us on foot, in that we know that our blood is precious in the
sight of Almighty God, which the world cloth shamefully abuse; yea, the more
shamefully and reproachfully the wicked do handle us, so much the less shall
God&#8217;s goodness forsake us.</font><br></div>

</i>Luke doth, in this place, declare by circumstances that Peter was, as it
were, shut up in his grave, so that it might seem that he was quite past hope;
for as they divided the day and night into four parts by three hours, so Herod
divided the watches, that four soldiers might always keep watch, and that one
quaternion might succeed another every third hour. He showeth the cause why he
was not forthwith put to death, because it had been an heinous offense to put
him to death in the Easter holidays; therefore, Herod doth not delay the time as
doubtful what to do, but doth only wait for opportunity; yea, he maketh choice
of a time, when as his gift may be more plausible, because there came a great
multitude together from all parts unto the holy day.

duty, Peter stood in the forward

alone; but all the rest fought with their prayers together with him, and they
aided him so much as they were able. Hereby we do also gather, that they were
not discouraged, for by prayer they testify that they persist so much as they
are able in defense of the cause, for which Peter is in danger of life. This
place teacheth, first, how we ought to be affected when we see our brethren
persecuted by the wicked for the testimony of the gospel, for if we be slothful,
and if we be not inwardly touched with their dangers, we do not only defy and
them of the due duty of love, but also treacherously forsake the confession of
our faith; and, assuredly, if the cause be common, yea, if they fight for our
safety and salvation, we do not only forsake them, but even Christ and
ourselves; and the present necessity requireth, that they be far more fervent in
prayer than commonly they are, whosoever will be counted Christians. We see some
of our brethren (being brought to extreme poverty) live in exile, others we see
imprisoned, many cast into stinking dungeons, many consumed with fire, yea, we
see new torments oftentimes invented, whereby being long tormented they may feel
death. Unless these provocations sharpen our desire to pray, we be more than
blockish; therefore, so soon as any persecution ariseth, let us by and by get
ourselves to prayer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Also, it is a likely thing that the Church took
greater thought for Peter&#8217;s life, because they should have suffered great
loss if he had gone.

Neither doth Luke say barely that</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

but so long as Peter was in the conflict, the faithful did what they could to
help him, and that without wearisomeness. We must always understand the name of
God, which is here expressed, whensoever mention is made of prayer in the
Scripture, for this is one of the chiefest and first principles of faith, that
we ought to direct our prayers unto God alone, as he challengeth to himself this

When he was about to bring him forth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It
seemeth at the first blush that the Church prayeth to small purpose, for the day
was now appointed wherein Peter should be put to death, and he is within one
night of death, and yet the faithful cease not to pray, because they know that
when the Lord doth purpose to deliver his, he taketh his time oftentimes in the
last and farthest point of necessity, and that he hath in his hand diverse ways
to deliver. Secondly, we may think that they did not so much pray for
Peter&#8217;s life, as that the Lord would arm him with invincible fortitude,
for the glory of the gospel, and that God would [not] set the gospel of his Son
open to the reproaches and slanders of the wicked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That night he
slept.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>All these circumstances do more
set forth the wonderful power of God, for who would not have thought that Peter
was already swallowed up of death? for though he drew breath as yet, yet he had
no chinch [chink] to creep out at, for as much as he was beset with many deaths.
Therefore, whereas he escapeth from amidst deaths, whereas he goeth safely among
the hands of his hangmen, whereas the chains are molten and are loosed, whereas
the iron gate openeth itself to him; hereby it appeareth that it was a mere
divine kind of deliverance, and it was profitable for Peter to be thus taught by
these signs, that he might with more assurance forthwith declare unto men the
grace of God thus known. Again, it appeareth by this strait keeping that Herod
meant nothing less
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F766</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
than to let Peter go away alive.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
A light shined,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is to be thought that
Peter alone saw this light, and that the soldiers did either sleep so soundly,
or else were so amazed, that they neither felt nor perceived any thing, And
there might be two causes why God would have the light to shine; either that
Peter might have the use thereof, and that the darkness might be no hindrance to
him, or that it might be to him a sign and token of the heavenly glory. For we
read oftentimes that the angels appeared with glistering brightness, even when
the sun did shine, Assuredly, Peter might have gathered by the strange light
that God was present, and also he ought to have made his profit thereof. When as
the angel smiteth Peter&#8217;s side, it appeareth hereby what a care God hath
for his, who watcheth over them when they sleep, and raiseth them when they are
drowsy. And surely there were nothing more miserable than we, if the continuance
of our prayers alone did keep<i> </i>God in his watching over us; for such is
the infirmity of our flesh that we faint and quail, and we stand most of all in
need of his help when our minds, being drawn away, do not seek him. Sleep is a
certain image of death, and doth choke and drown all the senses, what should
become of us if God should then cease to<b> </b>have respect to us? But
forasmuch as when the faithful go to sleep, they commit their safety to God, it
cometh to pass by this means, that even their sleep doth call upon
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whereas he saith, that immediately after the angel
had said the word the chains were loosed, we gather by this, that there is power
enough in the commandment of God alone to remove all manner [of] lets, when all
ways seem to be stopt on all sides, so that if he intend to appease the motions
and tumults of war, although the whole world were appointed in armor, their
spears and swords shall forthwith fall out of their hands; on the other side, if
he be determined to punish us and our sins with war, in a moment, (in the
twinkling of an eye,) their minds, which were before given to peace, shall wax
hot, and they shall lay hand on their swords. Whereas Luke setteth down
severally both the words of the angel, and also the course of the matter, it
serveth for the more certainty of the history, that it may in every respect
appear that Peter was delivered by God.</font><br></div>

true</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is taken in this place for that
which is done naturally and after the manner of men. For we must note the
contrariety [antithesis] that is between the thing itself and the vision.
Furthermore, though he think that it is a vision, yet doth he willingly obey;
whereby his obedience is proved, whilst that being content with the commandment
of the angel alone, he doth not inquire nor reason what he must de, but doth
that which he is commanded to do.</font><br></div>

miracle might be the greater. So he created the world in six days, (Genesis 1.)

us in the meditating upon his works,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;022011&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
20:11,) for he applieth the manner of doing unto our capacity, and unto the
increase of faith. If Peter had at a sudden been carried unto the house where
the brethren were assembled, then should one only deliverance have been
acknowledged, but now we see, as it were with our eyes, that he was delivered
more than ten times.</font><br></div>

word for word, being made in himself, because, being before astonied with a
strange and incredible thing, he was, as it were, without himself. But now at
length, as it were after a trance, he knoweth that he is delivered from death.
His words set down by Luke contain a thanksgiving; for he extolleth with himself
the benefit of God which he had tried, [experienced,] and whereof he had tasted,
and he doth highly commend it with himself, until he find some other witnesses.
He saith that the angel was sent of God, according to the common meaning of the
godly, who hold that the angels are appointed to be ministers, to be careful
for, and to take charge of their safety; for unless he had been thus persuaded,
he would not have spoken of the angel. And yet he doth not commend the angel as
the author of the grace, but he ascribeth all the whole praise of the work to
God alone, neither do the angels help us to this end, that they may derive unto
themselves even the least jot of God&#8217;s glory. Whereas he saith that he was
delivered out of the hand of Herod, he amplifieth the goodness and benefit of
God, by the power of his enemy. To the same end tendeth that which he addeth of
the Jews; for the greater the number of the enemies was, the more excellent was
the grace of God toward his servant; for it is a great matter that God alone

nought.</font><br></div>

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;271005&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
10:5, 12.) Neither doth the Scripture promise to every man a certain and
peculiar angel, but rather that the Lord hath charged his angels to keep all the
faithful,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;199111&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;193408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

every man is profane. Let this be sufficient for us, that the whole host of
heaven doth watch for the safety of the Church; and that as necessity of time
requireth sometimes one angel, sometimes more do defend us with their aid.
Assuredly, this is inestimable goodness of God, in that he saith that the
angels, who are the beams of his brightness, are our ministers.</font><br></div>

Tell James and the brethren:</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By brethren
I understand not every one that was of the Church but the apostles and elders.
For though it were requisite that the miracle should be made known to all, yet
will Peter worthily for honor&#8217;s sake, have his fellows in office to be
certified thereof. Ecclesiastical writers after Eusebius report that this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>James</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

of the three pillars of the Church,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
2:9,) I do not think that a disciple was advanced to that dignity, and the
apostles set aside. Wherefore, I do rather conjecture, that this was James the
son of Alpheus, whose holiness was such, that it caused the Jews to wonder at
it. And there be two reasons for which Peter would have this joyful message
brought unto the brethren; to wit, that he might rid them of that care which did
vex them; secondly, that they might be encouraged with such an example of
God&#8217;s goodness to be the more bold. Whereas he passeth into another place,
I think it was done for this cause, because, forasmuch as the house was well
known and famous, because many of the brethren resorted thither, he might lie
hid elsewhere with less danger. Therefore, he sought a place which was not so
much suspected of the enemy, and that he might not only save himself, but also
his hostess and others.</font><br></div>

When it was day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke returneth now unto
Herod and the soldiers; and he saith that there was no small ado amongst them.
For they could not suspect that Peter was taken from them by violence, or that
he was escaped by some subtle shift. Herod examineth the matter afterward as a
judge; but when as he perceived that the soldiers were in no fault, he himself
is also enforced to be a witness of the deliverance wrought by God. Whereas he
commandeth them to be carried out of his sight, or to be carried to prison, we
may thereby gather, that their faithfulness and diligence were approved and
seen; for if there had been any suspicion of negligence, there was punishment
prepared for them; but the cause why he doth not let them go free was partly
rage, mixed with tyrannous cruelty, and partly shamefacedness. Though some
expound it otherwise, that he commanded that they should be punished forthwith.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F769</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And whether, being angry, he delivered them to the hangman, or he was content to
punish them with perpetual imprisonment, it is assuredly an excellent example of
blindness, that whereas he ought to perceive the power of God, yea, though his
eyes were shut, yet doth he not bend, neither doth he wax more meek, but
proceedeth to resist God of obstinate malice. Thus doth Satan deprive the wicked
of understanding, that in seeing they see not; and the Lord, by smiting them
with this horrible amazedness, doth justly revenge himself and his
Church.</font><br></div>

history, which doth not only show, as it were in a glass, what end is prepared
for the enemies of the Church, but also how greatly God hateth pride. The
Scripture saith that &#8220;God resisteth the proud,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:5.) God himself did show a lively image thereof in the person of Herod.
And assuredly men cannot extol themselves higher than becometh them, but they
shall make war with God, who, to the end he may surpass all,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F771</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
commandeth all flesh to keep silence. And if God did so sharply punish pride in
a king whom prosperity did puff up, what shall become of those of the common
sort who are ridiculously puffed up without cause? Furthermore, we must note the
course of the history, that all things go well with Herod after that he had
miserably vexed the Church; he enforced the nations round about him, being tamed
with hunger, to come to crave pardon upon their knees, as if God had rewarded
him well for his wicked fury. This was no small trial for the godly, who might
have thought thus with themselves
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F772</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that God cared not for them, and they were afraid lest with Herod&#8217;s power
his tyranny and cruelty should increase. But the Lord had another purpose,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F773</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for he set the oppressor of his Church on high that he might have the greater
fall. Therefore, that shadowish felicity, wherein he delighted too much, was
unto him a certain falling against the<i> </i>day of slaughter. In like sort,
when at this day we see the bloody enemies of the Church carried up upon the
wings of fortune into heaven, there is no cause why we should be discouraged;
but let us rather call to mind that saying of Solomon,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Herod was

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">qumomacon</font><font face="Palatino"><i>

not make open war against those cities; but such was his displeasure, that he
essayed to subdue them by policy, as it were by undermining them by little and
little. It is a rare matter, saith Demosthenes, for free cities to agree with
monarchs. Moreover, Herod was naturally cruel, bold, of insatiable covetousness;
and it is not to be doubted but that Tyre and Sidon were, as it were, certain
bars or rails to stay his fury, as they were wealthy cities, and unaccustomed to
bear the yoke. Also, the remembrance of their old glory might have encouraged
them; forasmuch as pride cometh commonly of wealth, it is no marvel if these two
cities were proud, the one whereof Isaiah calleth queen of the seas, whose
merchants, he said, were kings, and her chapmen dukes,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
23:8.) Also, he saith elsewhere that Sidon was become proud by reason of her
wealth. And although they had sundry times been brought almost to utter ruin,
yet the commodiousness of their situation did shortly restore them to their
wonted state. Hereby it came to pass that they could more hardly digest Agrippa,
of late a base fellow, a man of no estimation,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F774</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and one who had been let out of prison; especially seeing that he had behaved
himself so cruelly toward his own subjects, and was troublesome and injurious to
his neighbors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Forasmuch as their country was

out of his realm. By this means did he, without any army, besiege them by little
and little. For the borders of both cities were strait, and their ground barren,
whereas there was a great people to be fed. Therefore, after that they were
tamed with hunger, they humbly crave peace, and that not free, for assuredly
they had some laws given them; and it is to be thought that this Blastus
mentioned by Luke was not with bare words persuaded, but with rewards [gifts]
won to entreat the peace.

Upon an appointed day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke saith that
the men of Tyrus and Sidon had peace granted them, because this was the occasion
of the king&#8217;s oration, without doubt, that he might make them his
underlings hereafter. The same history is extant in Josephus, in his Nineteenth
Book of Antiquities, save only that he calleth him everywhere Agrippa, whom Luke
calleth Herod. It is to be thought that Agrippa was his proper name, and that he
was called by none other name so long as he was a private man; but after that he
was advanced to be a king, he took to himself princely dignity, according to the
name of his grandfather. Josephus and Luke agree together wonderfully in the
thing itself, and in all circumstances. First, they agree concerning the place.
Josephus saith, That his garment was embroidered with gold, on which, when the
sun-beams light, it did glister again; and that this was the cause which moved
the courtiers to call him
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F777</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
a god. That he was suddenly wounded; also, that there was seen an owl sitting
upon a cord over his head, which cord did prognosticate his ruin. And he is so
far from doubting that his sacrilegious pride was punished with this kind of
punishment, that he saith, that he confessed the same openly amidst his cruel
torments, &#8220;Behold me, whom you call a god; I am enforced to finish my life
most miserable.&#8221; There is no mention made there of the peace made with
those of Tyrus and Sidon; but that he made and set forth plays
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F778</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in honor of Caesar. But it may be that the solemnity of the plays was appointed
in respect of the peace concluded, which we know was a solemn
thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Forthwith he smote him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>As, before, the
angel was a minister of God&#8217;s grace in the delivery of Peter, so now he
taketh vengeance upon Herod. And God doth sometimes use the ministry of angels
in heaven in punishing; but sometimes he maketh the devils as hangmen, by whose
hand he executeth his judgments. And this doth he as well toward his faithful
servants as toward the reprobate. Saul was troubled and vexed by Satan,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;091614&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 16:147) but the same did also befall holy Job,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;180112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
1:12; 2:7.) In the Psalms, the punishments wherewith God doth chasten the wicked
are attributed to the evil angels; yet we see how the angel which had the
government of the safety of the Church smiteth the Egyptians in the
first-begotten,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021229&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
12:29;) although the Scripture calleth the wicked spirits God&#8217;s spirits,
because they are obedient to his commandment, though full sore against their
will. But where the epithet <i>evil </i>is not added, as in this place, we must
understand the angel which doth willingly obey God, and yet the shape of the
owl, whereof Josephus maketh mention, did rather serve to figure the devil than
an heavenly angel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, I dare not affirm for a surety what
manner of disease that was. The word which Luke useth doth signify that he was
eaten up of worms. Many conjecture that it was a lousy disease. This is certain,
that even when he was yet alive he was corrupt with stink and rottenness, so
that he was, as it were, a living carcass. So that he was not only vexed with
cruel torments, but also made a laughing-stock to all men, and of all men
reviled. For God intended to make choice of a kind of punishment wherewith he
might repress the cruelty of a proud man with extreme ignominy. If he had been
overcome of some great and valiant army, and had been brought to poverty, the
judgment of God had not been so marked; and this had been an honest and princely
chastisement;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F779</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but forasmuch as he abhorreth lice and worms, and this filthiness cometh out of
his body, which doth kill him by eating him up, he is handled according to his
deserts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In like sort Pharaoh, forasmuch as he did so oft
exalt himself against God with untamed pride, he was not orderly assailed by
some prince that did border upon him, but locusts and caterpillars were
God&#8217;s warriors [soldiers] to make war against him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;020817&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
8:17, 24;) for the more proudly a man exalteth himself, the more doth he deserve
to be cast doom of God into the lowest hell with shame and reproach. This is the
reason why he set this reigned god Herod to be eaten up of worms, which he was
at length enforced to grant, when he said, &#8220;Behold me, whom ye saluted as
a god; I die miserable.&#8221; Such a manifest example of horrible vengeance in
a king&#8217;s person ought to terrify us not a little from presuming to take to
ourselves more than we ought; and that we do not suffer ourselves to be made
drunk with the false commendation and flattery of men as with deadly
poison.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because he gave not the glory to
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He is condemned of sacrilege, not
only because he suffered himself to be called God, but because, forgetting
himself, he took to himself the honor due to God. We do not read that the king
of Babylon was thus extolled; and yet the prophet upbraideth to him that he went
about to make himself equal with God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;231413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
14:13, 14.) Therefore this sacrilege is a common fault in all proud men,
because, by taking to themselves more than they ought, they darken the glory of
God; and so, like giants, so much as ever they are able, they endeavor to pluck
God out of his seat. Howsoever, they do not usurp the title of God, neither
openly boast with their mouth that they are gods; yet because they take to
themselves that which is proper to God, they desire to be, and to be accounted
gods, having brought him under, furthermore, the prophet pointeth out the
beginning of this evil in one word, when he bringeth in Nebuchadnezzar speaking
on this wise, &#8220;I will go up,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;231413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

<div><font face="Palatino">Wherefore there is but one remedy, if every one keep
himself in that degree wherein he is placed. Let those who are base and
castaways [in a humble station] not desire to climb higher; let kings, and those
who are above others, remember that they are mortal, and let them modestly
submit their highness to God. And we must note, that it is not enough if men
give to God only half the honor which is due to him, who challengeth all that
wholly which is his own; if they submit themselves but in part, whom he will
have to be thoroughly humbled. Now, forasmuch as the Scripture despoileth us
quite of all praise of wisdom, virtue, and righteousness, there is no one of us
that can take to himself the least jot of glory without sacrilegious robbing of
God. And it is a wonder that, seeing the Scripture pronounceth that all those
make, as it were, open war against God which exalt themselves; and we do all
grant that that cannot be done without our overthrow, [destruction;] the
greatest part of men runneth, notwithstanding, headlong with furious boldness
unto their own destruction; for there is scarce one of an hundred who, being
mindful of his condition, doth leave to God his glory

<div><font face="Palatino">Here followeth an history, not only worthy to be
remembered, but also very profitable to be known, how Paul was appointed the
teacher of the Gentiles; for his calling was, as it were, a key whereby God
opened to us the kingdom of heaven. We know that the covenant of eternal life
was properly concluded with the Jews, so that we had nothing to do with
God&#8217;s inheritance, forasmuch as we were strangers,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:12;) and the wall of separation was between, which did distinguish those of
the household from strangers. Therefore it had profited us nothing, that Christ
brought salvation unto the world, unless, the disagreement being taken away,
there had been some entrance made for us into the Church. The apostles had
already received commandment touching the preaching of the gospel throughout the
whole world,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;411616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
16:16,) but they had kept themselves until this time within the borders of
Judea. When Peter was sent to Cornelius, it was a thing so new and strange, that
it was almost counted a monster, [prodigy.] Secondly, that might seem to be a
privilege granted to a few men extraordinarily; but now, forasmuch as God doth
plainly and openly appoint Paul and Barnabas to be apostles of the Gentiles, by
this means he maketh them equal with the Jews; that the gospel may begin to be
common as well to the one as to the other. And now the wall of separation is
taken away, that both those who were far off and those which were nigh hand may
be reconciled to God; and that being gathered under one head, they may grow
together to be one body. Therefore Paul&#8217;s calling ought to be of no less
weight amongst us, than if God should cry from heaven in the hearing of all men,
that the salvation, promised in times past to Abraham, and to the seed of
Abraham,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;012217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:17) doth no less appertain unto us at this day, than if we had come out of
the loins of Abraham. For this cause is it that Paul laboreth so much
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F781</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in defense and avouching of his calling,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
1:17, 12-24;) that the Gentiles may assuredly persuade themselves that the
doctrine of the gospel was not brought to them by chance, neither by man&#8217;s
rashness, but, first, by the wonderful counsel of God; secondly, by express
commandment, whilst that he made that known to men which he had decreed with
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
There were in the church.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>I have
declared in the fourth to the Ephesians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:11)<i> </i>and in the twelfth of the First to the Corinthians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 12:28,) what difference there is (at least in my judgment) between
doctors and prophets. It may be that they are in this place synonyma,
[synonymous,] (or that they signify both one thing,) so that this is
Luke&#8217;s meaning, that there were many men in that church endowed with
singular grace of the Spirit to teach. Surely I cannot see how it can hang
together, to understand by prophets those which were endowed with the gift of
foretelling things; but I think rather that it signifieth excellent interpreters
of Scripture. And such had the office to teach and exhort, as Paul doth testify
in the fourteenth of the First to the Corinthians, (1 Corinthians 45:37.) We
must mark Luke&#8217;s drift: Paul and Barnabas were ministers of the church of
Antioch; God calleth them thence now unto another place. Lest any man should
think that that church was destitute of good and fit ministers, so that God did
provide for other churches with the loss of it, Luke preventeth this, and saith,
that there was such store there, that though it did help others, yet did there
remain sufficient for the use thereof; whereby appeareth how plentifully God had
poured out his grace upon the Church, whence rivers, as it were, might be
deducted and carried into diverse places.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So even in our time God doth so enrich certain
churches more than others, that they be seminaries to spread abroad the doctrine
of the gospel. It must needs be that Manaen, who was brought up with Herod, came
of some noble family. And this doth Luke recite of purpose that he may set forth
to us his godliness who, despising worldly pomp, had coupled himself to the
simple and despised flock of Christ. He might, indeed, have been a principal
courtier if he had been ruled by ambition; but that he may wholly addict himself
to Christ, he refuseth not to change those smokes of honor with [for] reproach
and ignominy. For if we consider in what state the Church stood then, he could
not give his name to the gospel, unless he should make himself subject
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F782</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to common infamy. Therefore the Lord meant to teach us, by his example, to
despise the world, that those may learn with a valiant and lofty mind to despise
the world, who cannot otherwise be true Christians, unless they cast away those
things which are precious to the flesh, as hurtful lets and
hindrances.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And they ministered to the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The
word which Luke useth doth not only signify to be occupied about holy things,
but also sometimes to bear public offices. And because the holy rites of the
Gentiles did for the most part consist upon [of] burnt-offerings and sacrifices,
it is oftentimes taken for <i>to offer sacrifice; </i>which sense did well like
the Papists, that they might prove that the apostles did use some sacrifice. But
admit it were so; yet do they foolishly pretend for defense of their mass, that
the teachers of Antioch did sacrifice. First, forasmuch as the word is of the
plural number, it followeth that every one of them did say mass. But letting
toys pass, I say we must consider what manner of sacrifice Christ commended to
his Church. The Papists feign that the office of priesthood is enjoined them, to
sacrifice Christ and by sacrificing him to redeem peace with God. There is so
little mention made hereof in Scripture, that the Son of God doth rather
challenge this honor to himself alone. Wherefore Christ&#8217;s Church hath
another priesthood, to wit that every man may offer himself and his to God; and
that the public ministers may sacrifice to God, souls, with the spiritual sword
of the gospel, as Paul teacheth,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:16.) Moreover, the prayers of all the godly are the spiritual calves of the
lips,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;281402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
14:2,) wherewith God is well pleased, when they are offered up upon the holy
altar; that is, in Christ&#8217;s name, [as] in the thirteenth to the
Hebrews<i>,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
13:15.) Therefore, when Luke saith that the prophets and teachers ministered to
God when the Spirit spake to them, I understand nothing else but that they were
in the public action. He addeth
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fasting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that we may know that their minds were then free from all impediments, that
nothing might hinder them from giving attendance to prophesying. But the
question is,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F783</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
whether they kept a common fast, or Luke doth only signify that they were
fasting then until that time. This is, without question, that these
circumstances were expressed, that Paul&#8217;s calling may carry the more
credit amongst us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Separate to
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God commandeth that Paul and
Barnabas be sent by the consent of the Church, thither whither he had appointed
them to be sent; whereby we gather that there is no lawful election of pastors,
save only wherein God is chief. For whereas he hath commanded that the Church
should elect pastors and bishops, he hath not therefore granted men so much
liberty, but that he will bear the chief sway as the chief governor. The
ordinary election of pastors differeth from this appointing of Paul and
Barnabas, because it was requisite that they should be appointed by the heavenly
oracle to be the apostles of the Gentiles; which is not necessary to be done
daily in ordaining pastors. But they agree in this, that as God did testify that
Paul and Barnabas were already appointed by his decree to preach the gospel, so
none may be called unto the office of teaching save only those whom God hath
already chosen to himself after a sort.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, there is no need that the Spirit should
cry to us out of heaven, that he is called of God about whom we are,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F784</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because we receive those, as it were, from hand to hand, (as they say,) whom God
hath furnished with necessary gifts, forasmuch as they are framed and made fit
by his hand. But whereas Luke saith in this place, that Paul was appointed by
the voices and consents
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F785</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of the Church; it doth seem not to agree with Paul&#8217;s own words, where he
doth deny that he was called of men, or by men,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
1:1.) I answer, that he was made an apostle long before, (and that by no voices
[suffrages] of men,) before such time as he was sent unto the Gentiles; and he
had now already executed the office of an apostle many years, when he was called
to go unto the Gentiles by a new oracle. Wherefore, that he may have God for the
author of his apostleship, it is not without cause that he excludeth men. And he
doth not now command that he be ordained by the Church therefore, [viz.] that
his calling may depend upon men; but God publisheth that his decree, which was
as yet known to a few, and that with a public commandment, and he commandeth
that it be sealed with the solemn subscription of the Church. Therefore, this is
the meaning of the words, That this is the time wherein Paul must preach the
gospel among the Gentiles, and the wall being pulled down, he must gather a
Church of the Gentiles, who were before strangers from the kingdom of God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:14.) For although God had used him hitherto at Antioch and elsewhere, this was
now added as a peculiar thing, that God did intend to adopt the Gentiles into
the same inheritance of life with the Jews. But and if he were thus created a
teacher of the Church from the beginning, he should not then have been called at
that time by men. For, seeing the Lord doth pronounce that he had called him,
what doth he leave for the Church, save only that they subscribe obediently? For
men&#8217;s judgment is not here put as in a doubtful matter, neither have their
voices and consents any freedom. But we must mark what I have already said, that
Paul and Barnabas are not now only appointed teachers, but they have an
extraordinary office enjoined them, that they may begin to bring the grace of
God commonly unto the Gentiles. And that do the words import, when it is said,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Separate to the
work</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For undoubtedly he speaketh of a
new work, and which had heretofore not been used.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But how is Barnabas in this place appointed to be
Paul&#8217;s companion and fellow in office, who, as far as we can read, did
never execute the office of teaching? yea, who did always give Paul leave to
teach, without saying anything himself? I answer, that he had occasions enough
offered him to speak in Paul&#8217;s absence, so that they had both of them
enough to do. For one could not always be present in all places. It is not to be
doubted but that he did faithfully discharge that duty which God had enjoined
him, and that he was no dumb looker on. And why should we wonder that Luke doth
not set down his sermons in plain words, seeing that he scarce repeateth one of
a thousand of Paul&#8217;s?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Spirit
said.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Whatsoever Macedonius and his sect
object that they may turn their backs,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F786</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet we have a more plain and sound testimony of the divine essence of the Spirit
in this place, than that they can escape it and make it frustrate. There is
nothing more proper to God than with his power and commandment to govern the
Church alone; but the Spirit challengeth this right when he commandeth that Paul
and Barnabas be separated to him, and testifieth that they were called by his
beck. Assuredly we must needs confess that the body of the Church is lame and
without a head, unless we confess that it is God who ordereth the same at his
pleasure, who setteth teachers over it, who governeth the proceedings and order
thereof. We shall have afterwards chapter 20, in Paul&#8217;s sermon,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;442028&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
20:28,) that all bishops are placed by the Holy Ghost, which govern the Church;
but no man is to be counted a lawful pastor of the Church, as the same Paul
witnesseth, save he which is called of God; neither doth God point out false
prophets by any other mark, save only by this, that he hath not sent them;
therefore, we gather that the Holy Ghost is God indeed, whose authority is
sufficient to choose pastors, and who hath the chief rule in choosing them,
which is likewise confirmed out of the words of Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;And now, behold,
the Lord hath sent me, and his
Spirit,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;234816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah

<div><font face="Palatino">Furthermore, we must note out of these words, that he
is a person truly subsisting in God; for if we admit Sabellius&#8217;s
invention, that the word Spirit importeth no person,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F787</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
but that it is a bare adjunct, [epithet] that shall be a foolish and absurd
speech, that the Holy Ghost hath said,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F788</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Isaias also should foolishly ascribe to him the sending of a
prophet.</font><br></div>

When they had fasted and prayed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>That
they may obey the oracle, they do not only send Paul and Barnabas away; but also
with a solemn rite they appoint them to be the apostles of the Gentiles; it is
without question that this was a public fast. Luke said before, that they were
fasting, forasmuch as they were busied in their ministry: it might be that that
was according to the custom; but now there is another reason, for in appointing
a public fast, which used to be done in hard matters and of great importance,
they provoke both themselves and others unto an earnest ferventness in prayer,
for this is oftentimes added in Scripture as a help to prayer; but (it was a
matter of such weight to erect the kingdom of Christ amongst the Gentiles) the
teachers of Antioch do not without cause earnestly pray the Lord, that he will
enable his servants;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F789</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and that was not the end of their prayer, that God would, by his Spirit of
wisdom and discretion, govern their judgments in choosing, because all
disputation or doubting concerning this matter was taken away; but that God
would furnish those with the Spirit of wisdom and strength whom he had already
chosen to himself, that he would strengthen them with his power against all the
invasions of Satan and the world, that he would bless their labors, that they
might not be unfruitful, that he would open a gate for the new preaching of the
gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The laying on of hands which Luke reckoneth up, in
the third place, was a kind of consecration, as we have said,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
6:6.) For the apostles retained the ceremony which was used amongst the Jews,
according to the old custom of the law; as also kneeling, and such rites, which
were profitable to exercise godliness. In sum, this is the end why they laid
their hands upon Barnabas and Paul, that the Church might offer them to God, and
that they might with their consent declare that this office was enjoined them by
God; for the calling was properly God&#8217;s alone, but the external ordaining
did belong to the Church, and that according to the heavenly
oracle.</font><br></div>

is no mention made here of the election made by the Church, because it was
altogether a divine calling; the Church did only receive those who were offered
them by the hand of God. He saith, that they came first to Seleucia, which was a
city of Syria. There was, indeed, a country of the same name; but it is more
likely that Luke speaketh of the city, which was not far from Cyprus by
sea.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b> He saith that they began to preach the
gospel first in Salamis, a famous city of Cyprus. Notwithstanding, they seem to
begin amiss; for whereas they were sent specially to the Gentiles, they preach
the word of God, nevertheless, to the Jews, I answer, that they were not so
addicted to the Gentiles, that, setting aside the Jews, it stood them upon to go
straight to the Gentiles, for when God did make them teachers of the Gentiles,
he did not depose them from the office which they had heretofore exercised; so
that there was no reason to let them, but that they might take pains, both with
Jews and Gentiles;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F790</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yea, farther, it was meet that they should begin with the Jews, as we shall see
in the end of the chapter. Moreover, Luke addeth by the way, that they were
helped by John; for his meaning is not that he was their minister for any
private use, or for the uses of body; but rather in that he was their helper to
preach the gospel, he commandeth his godly study [zeal] and industry; not that
the degree of honor was equal, but because the labor was common to all; for
which cause he had the less excuse afterward, seeing that he forsook the holy
calling.</font><br></div>

When they had passed over.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is to be
thought that this their passage was not altogether without fruit; and,
assuredly, Luke would never have passed over with silence a general repulse; but
it was sufficient for him to say that they were not idle in the office of
teaching in their journey, seeing that he maketh haste unto a famous history,
which he will set down immediately. And forasmuch as Salamis, situated upon the
east coast, did look toward Syria, it was requisite that Paul and Barnabas
should pass through the midst of the island unto the other side, that they might
come to Paphos; for Paphos was a city situated upon the sea-coast toward the
south. Furthermore though all the island was dedicated to Venus, yet Paphos was
the principal seat of the idol. For which cause the goodness of God is more
wonderful, in that he would have the light of his gospel to pierce into such a
filthy and cruel [dire] den. For we may thereby gather what manner of integrity
and chastity, and honesty and temperance, was in that city, in that religion did
grant liberty to the inhabitants to commit all manner of shameful and heinous
offenses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They found a certain fake
prophet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Seeing that religion was quite
corrupt among the Jews, it is no marvel if they fell away unto many wicked
superstitions. And forasmuch as they had hitherto professed that they worshipped
a certain peculiar god, this was a fair color to deceive withal, seeing that
they might pretend the name of the unknown God at their pleasure; but this is a
wonder how it was possible for Elymas, with his juggling, to cozen a grave and
wise man. For we know that the Jews were at that time hated of all the world,
and especially of the Romans, and with hatred was coupled extreme contempt of
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now Luke doth not without cause expressly commend
Sergius&#8217;s wisdom, lest any man should think that his foolishness and
lightness was subject to the seducings of the sorcerer. His meaning was, indeed,
to show in a clear mirror how frivolous and vain man&#8217;s wisdom is, which
cannot beware of such gross subtlety of Satan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And assuredly where the truth of God doth not appear,
the more men seem to be wise, the more filthily foolish are they. We see what
filthy monsters of superstition did reign amongst the most witty Gentiles, and
such as were furnished with all manner of learning. Therefore, there is neither
judgment nor wisdom, save only from the Spirit of God. And this is the just
vengeance of God upon all idolaters, that being delivered up to a reprobate
sense they can discern nothing,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:28.) Though it may be that Sergius Paulus, being weary of superstitions, did
then begin to desire a more pure worship of God, at such time as he [did] light
upon that sorcerer. Which if we receive, it was surely a wonderful judgment of
God, that he suffered a man godly-affected to throw himself headlong into the
[deadly] snares of Satan. But God doth sometimes so exercise his elect, that he
causeth them to wander many ways, before they be directed into the right
way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b> And whereas Sergius Paulus, desiring some
better thing than that which he had learned from his childhood, was unaptly
drawn aside unto diverse superstitions, I gather hereby that he sendeth for Paul
and Barnabas of his own accord, to teach him. Therefore, he had conceived a
certain reverence and fear of God, though he knew him not as yet; and forasmuch
as he was persuaded that that was the true God which was worshipped in Judea, he
desired to know out of his word a pure and certain rule of godliness. So soon as
he hath tasted of the dotings of the false prophet he standeth in doubt. And it
is not to be doubted, but that God doth solicit his mind, that he may not be
altogether stayed in vanity, though he suffered himself to be deceived for a
time by a wicked man.</font><br></div>

And Saul, who was also called Paul.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke
showeth now how God brake the bond wherein the deputy was bound. For seeing that
he was too much addicted to the magician, he could not embrace true doctrine as
one that was free and at liberty; for the devil keepeth those minds (which he
hath entangled) in his slavery after a wonderful and incredible manner, that
they cannot see even the most plain truth; but so soon as he was once
vanquished, Paul could easily enter in unto the deputy. And mark what Luke
saith, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is overthrown when the word of God
is resisted. Whence we may gather that faith is so grounded in the word, that
without this shore
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F794</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
it fainteth at every assault; yea, that it is nothing else but the spiritual
building of the word of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
O thou full of deceit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was not
without a cause that Paul was thus hot and angry; for he had no hope to do any
good if he should deal after some moderate and mild sort. We must always begin
with doctrine, and those are also to be admonished, exhorted, and pricked
forward, who do not as yet appear to be altogether obstinate. Neither doth Paul
so vehemently inveigh against the sorcerer at the first dash; but when he seeth
him maliciously and manifestly fight against the doctrine of godliness, he
handleth him like a bond-slave of Satan. Thus must we deal with the desperate
enemies of the gospel, in whom appeareth open contumacy and wicked contempt of
God, especially when they stop the way before others, And lest any man should
think that Paul was out of measure angry, Luke saith plainly that the
inspiration of the Spirit was his guide. Wherefore this heat of zeal is not only
not to be reprehended, but it ought to make the profane condemners of God sore
afraid, who fear not to rebel against his word; forasmuch as this judgment is
given upon them all not by mortal man, but by the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of
Paul.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As touching the words, this place refuteth their
error who think that Paul took his name of the deputy, as if he had set up some
token of victory. There may many reasons be brought, and those strong enough, on
the contrary; but this one place is sufficient, where Luke showeth that at such
time as the deputy was not brought to the faith he had two names. And it is not
to be doubted but that he retained his own name
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F795</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
amongst the Jews; and we know that this was a usual thing, that those who were
citizens of Rome should borrow some Italian name. Luke joineth <i>subtlety
</i>with</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
deceit,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>which is contrary to sincerity;
to wit, whilst crafty men transform their wit hither and thither, so that they
have in them no simplicity; though the Greek word which Luke useth signifieth
ready boldness to do hurt; but the former signification agreeth better. By
the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> son of the
devil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is meant a reprobate and desperate
man. Such are all those which resist maliciously, and as it were of set purpose,
that which is just and right; therefore Paul addeth, that he is a
great</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> enemy of all
righteousness.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dost thou not cease to pervert?
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He calleth all that means whereby the Lord
bringeth us unto himself the ways of the Lord. He testifieth that this is plain
and straight; and he accuseth the sorcerer for making the same crooked, full of
turnings, and doubtful, with his boughts and turns. Whence may be gathered a
profitable doctrine, that it cometh to pass through the subtlety of Satan that
we do not readily, with straight course, go unto the Lord. For he showeth us in
his word a plain way, and such as is not thorny. Wherefore we must take good
heed of seducers, which trouble the way with their ditches or thorns, or else
make the same hard and unpleasant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it shall be convenient to repeat here that which
I touched before, that the servants of Christ must not be blamed if they do sore
inveigh against the professed enemies of sound doctrine, unless we will accuse
the Holy Ghost of intemperance. Neither am I ignorant how easily men may fall in
this point; for which cause godly teachers must take so much the more heed,
first, that they favor not the affections of the flesh too much under the color
of zeal; secondly, that they break not out with headlong and unseasonable heat
where there is yet place for moderation; thirdly, that they give not themselves
over to foolish and uncomely railing, but only that they express the
unseemliness of the thing by gravity and weight of words. Such was the vehemency
of holy zeal and of the Spirit in the prophets, which if dainty and soft men
judge troublesome and raging, they consider not how dear and precious
God&#8217;s truth is to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now there riseth not one Elymas to subvert the faith
but many, and those which are far more wicked. For we see with what sacrilegious
boldness they despoil God of all honor; with what filthy corruptions they
profane all religion; how cruelly they throw miserable souls headlong into
eternal destruction; how unseemly they mock Christ; how filthily they disfigure
all the whole worship of God; with what cruel reproaches they rend the holy
truth of God; with what barbarous tyranny they lay waste the Church of God; so
that you would say that they tread God under foot. And yet there be many crabbed
philosophers who would have these furious giants flattered and clawed by the
back.

calleth

or <i>power,
</i>(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 12:28.) For as they did excel in power of the Spirit to help the
faithful with miracles, so had they the whip in their hand to tame the
rebellious and obstinate withal. Such vengeance of God did Peter show upon
Ananias and Sapphira,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
5:5.) But because miracles ought, for the most part, to resemble the nature of
Christ, who is all gentle, sweet, bountiful, and merciful; therefore he would
seldom have the apostles to show examples of the contrary power. Neither must we
think that they were endued with this power to punish any man so often as it
seemeth good in their own eyes, but the same Spirit of God, which did thus arm
them, did direct them unto the lawful and right use. Therefore we must remember
that which we had before, that Paul spake by inspiration of the Spirit.
Furthermore, it was a very fit kind of punishment. For seeing that the sorcerer
essayed to darken the sun, and to take from others the benefit of the light, he
was, by good right, cast into horrible darkness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But now, forasmuch as many of the Papists do far
exceed this sorcerer at this day in ungodliness, it is a wonder why they be
suffered to be so bold without being punished. Is the hand of God weakened? Is
he less careful for his glory? Hath he no care to revenge the gospel? I answer,
that this visible punishment which was once laid
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F799</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
upon the sorcerer, and such as this, are perpetual examples of God&#8217;s wrath
against all those who are not afraid either to corrupt and deprave, or openly
with slanders to resist the pure doctrine of the gospel. For we do know that
miracles were wrought for a time to this end, that they may continually be in
force, and be fresh before our eyes, and that they may give us light to behold
the judgments of God, which we cannot see so plainly; but it is not for us to
prescribe God this or that way to punish his enemies. Sergius Paulus, who,
before he came to man&#8217;s estate, had no taste of true religion, who, from
his childhood, was infected with diverse superstitions, and had very hard lets,
which kept him back from embracing the faith; lastly, who was bewitched with the
dotings of the sorcerer, that he could scarce come to the faith, had need of no
small helps. Hereby it came to pass that God did, as it were, reach his hand out
of heaven manifestly, though he helped us all in his person; for the same
gospel, the authority whereof was then established, is at this day preached to
us, and yet, notwithstanding, God doth not so linger, but that he showeth his
fearful power diverse ways against the enemies of the gospel, unless our eyes
were so dull when he showeth his judgments that we cannot see.</font><br></div>

snares were broken wherein Elymas kept him entangled, for he was brought by the

and the preparation. Therefore, forasmuch as he saw an evident token of the
power of God, he knew that Paul was sent of God, and so he began to reverence
his doctrine, whereof he did doubt before. If God do now miraculously strengthen
in the minds of many the faith of the gospel, which is shaken with so many and
such strong engines; if he bring to pass, after an incredible manner, that the
course of faith doth pass through a thousand lets, being content with this his
grace, let us not murmur against him, or reason the matter with him, as if our
condition were worse, if he do not daily show such miracles as we would

Paul, no marvel if he reckon up those things only which did belong unto the
order of teaching. And this is a notable place, out of which we learn after what
sort they handled doctrine at that time among the Jews. The law and the prophets
had the first place; because there must nothing be set before the Church which
was not drawn out of that fountain. Also we gather by this that the Scripture
was not suppressed among a few, but that both one and other
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F802</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
were admitted to the reading thereof, afterward those who were able, and had the
grace to teach and exhort, had the second place, as interpreters of the
Scripture which was read. Notwithstanding Luke showeth, last of all, that every
one was not suffered to speak, lest confusion should arise by liberty; but the
office of exhorting was committed to certain men, whom he calleth rulers of the
synagogue, or masters. Therefore Paul and Barnabas begin not forthwith to speak,
lest they disturb the accustomed order with too much haste; but they do modestly
stay till they have liberty granted them to speak, and that with their leave who
had authority by public consent. We know how corrupt the state of that people
was then; and Luke will at length declare, in the end of the chapter, that these
men of Antioch were too stout and stubborn in receiving
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F803</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the grace of Christ; and yet there remained this goodness among them, that their
assemblies were honestly and decently governed;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F804</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for which cause such evil favored confusion is so much the more shame fill which
is seen at this day among those who will be counted Christians. The Papists do
indeed sing
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F805</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the Scriptures in their churches with shrill and sounding voice, but in an
unknown tongue, so that the people reap no fruit thereby. There is seldom any
doctrine used; and it were better for the wicked babblers even then to hold
their peace, who thrust in their own unclean inventions instead of the Word of
God, and pollute with the stink of their impiety whatsoever is
holy.</font><br></div>

greatly upon that, because the sense may be plain, If you have any exhortation

is properly the office of the teacher to utter no new thing of his own brain,
but to apply the Scripture, wherein is comprehended the whole wisdom of the
godly, unto the present use of the people. Thus, they do not only teach, but
also apply the doctrine which they have elsewhere, unto the edifying of the

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b> We must note the state of this sermon,
lest we think that he uttered words in vain. Paul seemeth, indeed, to begin even
at the very first beginning, but he speaketh nothing but that which is most
convenient for the present purpose. His purpose is to bring the Jews unto the
faith of Christ; and that he may the better do this, it is needful to declare
that they excel other nations in this one thing, because the Savior was promised
them, whose kingdom is their principal and only felicity. This is, therefore,
Paul&#8217;s beginning, that whereas they were chosen in times past to be the
peculiar people of God; whereas they had so many benefits bestowed upon them
from time to time, though they showed themselves most unworthy, this did depend
upon the promise of the Messiah, and did tend to that end, that God might govern
them by the hand of the Messiah; and that therefore they have nothing whereof
they may boast, unless they be gathered under their Head; yea, that unless they
receive him when he is offered, the covenant of life which God had made with
their fathers shall be void, and the adoption shall be frustrate. This is the
drift of the first part of the sermon: that this is the principal point of the
law and the foundation of God&#8217;s covenant, that they have Christ for their
Captain and Governor, that he may restore all things among them; that without
him religion cannot stand, and that they shall be most miserable without him.
Thence Paul passeth unto another member, that Jesus, whom he preacheth, is
Christ indeed, through whom salvation is offered to the people; also he
declareth the means of the redemption purchased by him. Furthermore, he
intreateth of his power and office, that they may know what good things they
ought to hope for at his hands. The conclusion containeth a chiding; for he
threateneth to them horrible judgment, if they refuse the author of salvation,
who offereth himself, even of his own accord, whom earnestly to desire the law
and prophets provoke. This is, in a manner, the sum; now let us discuss every
point by itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Men and
brethren.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Because Paul knew that there
were many bastardly sons of Abraham, or such as were grown out of kind,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F807</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
he calleth the Jews to whom he speaketh by a double name. First, he calleth them
brethren, having respect unto common kindred, notwithstanding he showeth
therewithal that they shall be true Israelites if they fear God, and that even
then they are likewise true hearers, because &#8220;the fear of the Lord is the
beginning of wisdom.&#8221; In like sort he maketh the faithful attentive, and
purchaseth audience among them, as if he should say, Seeing many boast that they
are sons of Abraham, who were unworthy of such honor, show yourselves to be no
bastardly seed. Let us learn by this that it is not a fault common to one age
only, that good and sincere worshippers being mixed with hypocrites, have the
name of the Church common among them. But we must have a great care hereof, that
we be indeed that which we are called; which thing the true fear of Almighty God
will bring to pass, and not the external profession alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
The God of this people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This preface did
witness that Paul did go about no new thing, which might lead away the people
from the law of Moses. There is but one God, who is God of all nations; but he
calleth him God of that people, to whom he had bound himself, and who was
worshipped amongst the posterity of Abraham, amongst whom alone true and pure
religion was to be found. To the same end tendeth that which is added
immediately, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He chose our
fathers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For he testifieth by these
words that he seeketh nothing less
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F808</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
than that they may fall away from the true and living God, who hath separated
them from the residue of the world. Neither do I doubt but that he did more
manifestly express that he did not preach to them an unknown or strange God, but
the same who revealed himself long ago to their fathers; so that he doth briefly
comprehend the sound knowledge of God, grounded in the law, that their faith,
conceived out of the law and prophets, may continue firm.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Notwithstanding, he doth, in the mean season, commend
and set forth the free love of God toward that people. For how came it to pass
that only the children of Abraham were the Church and inheritance of God, save
only because it pleased God to dissever them from other nations? For there was
no worthiness to distinguish them; but the difference began at the love of God,
wherewith he did freely love Abraham.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Of this free love of God, Moses doth oftentimes put
the Jews to mind, as
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;050407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
4:7, 8, 10, 14, 32, 34, and in other places; wherein God did set before us a
mirror of his wonderful counsel, in that finding no excellence in Abraham, an
obscure person and miserable idolater, he doth, notwithstanding, prefer him
before all the world. Furthermore, this election was common to all the people,
as was also circumcision, whereby God did adopt to himself the seed of Abraham;
but there was also a more hidden election, whereby severing to himself a few of
many children of Abraham, he did declare, that not all who came of the seed of
Abraham according to the flesh are reckoned in the spiritual
stock.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He did drive out a
people.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Paul teacheth that all those
benefits which God bestowed afterwards upon the Jews, did proceed and flow from
that free favor which he did bear toward their fathers. For this was the cause
that they were delivered by the wonderful power of God, and brought by his hand
into the possession of the land of Canaan, after that he had driven out so many
nations for their sake. For it is no small matter for the land to be deprived of
her inhabitants, that she might receive strangers. This is the fountain and root
of all good things whereunto Paul calleth us, that God chose the fathers. This
was the reason and cause which moved God to so great patience, that he would not
cast off that rebellious people, who should otherwise have destroyed themselves
a thousand times with their own wickedness. Therefore, where the Scripture
maketh mention that their sins were pardoned, it saith that God remembered his
covenant. He saith that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>exalted,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>though they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strangers,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>that they may remember how worthy and gorgeous their deliverance
was.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
He suffered their manners.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The compound
verb hath greater force and grace in the Greek, whereby the mercifulness of God
is expressed in suffering the people, whom he knew to be stubborn and
disobedient. And Paul giveth us to understand again, that the election of God
was the cause that his goodness did strive with the wickedness of the people.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F809</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Notwithstanding, we must note that God did so take pity upon his elect people,
whilst that he will continue firm in his purpose, that he did, notwithstanding,
sharply punish the rebellious and wicked. He spared the people indeed, so that
he did not quite destroy them, as he might by good right; but he found also
means that their wickedness might not remain unpunished. And so that of Isaiah
was fulfilled,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;If the multitude
shall be as the sand of the sea,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">a

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He gave them
judges.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Under this name the Scripture
comprehendeth rulers and governors; and here is another testimony of the
infinite goodness of God toward the Jews, in that he pardoned so many
backslidings in them. For it is likely that Paul handled those things more at
large, which Luke gathereth briefly. And we know what was the estate of the
people during all that time, seeing that through untamed wantonness they did
ever now and then shake off the yoke. They were often punished with most
grievous plagues, yet so soon as they were once humbled, God delivered them from
the tyranny of their enemies. So that he saved the body thereof alive, amidst
many deaths, four whole ages and one-half. And hereby it appeareth how unworthy
they were of the favor of God, which they did despise and reject so often,
unless the constancy of the election had gotten the victory. For how is it that
God is never wearied, but that he keepeth promise with those who are
truce-breakers an hundred times, save only because turning his eyes toward his
Christ, he hath not suffered his covenant, grounded in him, to decay or perish?
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Afterward they
desire.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>And this change was all one as
if they would quite and manifestly overthrow the government which he had
appointed, whereof God himself complaineth in Samuel,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;090805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 8:5, 7.) But the stability of the election saved them from being punished
as such madness did deserve; yea, the wicked and unlawful desire of the people
was to God a new and incredible occasion to erect the kingdom whence Christ
should afterward come. For how is it that the scepter came to the tribe of
Judah, save only because the people were desirous to have a king? And assuredly
the people dealt wickedly; but God, who knoweth how to use evil things well,
turned that offense into safety. Whereas Saul was thrown down from the kingdom,
it served to reprove the fault of the people,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;091528&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 15:28,) but immediately when the kingdom is established in David&#8217;s
family the prophecy of Jacob was verified,

49:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.
I have found David, my servant.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This
title was not so much cited in praise of the person, as that Paul might make the
Jews more attentive to receive Christ. For the Lord doth testify that his mind
was thoroughly set upon David for no light cause, but he commandeth in him some
singular thing; and by extolling him so highly, his intent is to lift up the
minds of the faithful unto Christ in his person. The place is taken out of the
fourscore and ninth Psalm,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;198920&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
89:20.) Only Paul putteth in that which is not there to be found, that David was
the son of Isai, [Jesse,] which amplifieth the grace of God. For seeing that
Isai [Jesse] was a breeder of cattle, it was a wonderful work of God to take the
least of his sons from the sheepfolds, and to place him in the throne of the
kingdom. By the word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
found,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>God meaneth that he had gotten
such a man as he would. Not that David had brought to pass by his own travel and
industry that he should meet God, being such a one, but the phrase is taken from
the common custom of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the question is, Seeing that David fell so
grievously, how God giveth testimony of his continual obedience? We may answer
two ways; for God had respect rather unto the continual course of his life, than
unto every of his particular actions. Secondly, he did thus set him forth, not
so much for his own merit as for his Christ&#8217;s sake. Assuredly he had
deserved, by one wicked fact, eternal destruction for him and his, and, so much
as in him lay, the way of the blessing of God was shut up, that there might
nothing but vipers&#8217; seed come of Bathsheba. But that so filthy a fact, in
the death of Uriah,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;101127&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Samuel 11:27) turneth to a contrary end by the wonderful counsel of God, because
Solomon is born and cometh of that unlooked-for wedlock, which was full of
treachery, and, finally, polluted with many spots. And though David sinned
grievously, yet because he followed God all the course of his life, he is
praised without exception, that he showed himself obedient to God in all things;
though (as I have said before)the Spirit carrieth us into a farther thing; yea,
the common calling of all the faithful in Christ, the head, is here depicted out
to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
According to promise.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This clause doth
also prove that which I have already said elsewhere, that in sending Christ, the
Lord had respect only unto his own faithfulness and goodness; for he sent him
because he had promised so to do. And as the promise doth testify that salvation
was free, so it doth also purchase no small credit to the gospel; because it
appeareth by this that Christ came not at a sudden, of whom there was never
anything spoken; but that he who was promised from the beginning was now given
in his time. But the promises which Luke here toucheth by the way are famous and

commonly by no other name but the Son of David,

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b> We know what office John had, to wit, to
prepare the way of the Lord. Therefore Paul bringeth in his testimony, that he
may prove to the Jews that he preached no false Christ, but the true Christ of
God, whom that most famous forerunner had before commended; not that man&#8217;s
testimony is sufficient to prove so weighty a matter; but there was another
respect to be had to John whom all men almost did think to be a prophet of God.
Therefore hence cometh the authority of the testimony, that a crier sent from
heaven, and no private man, speaketh of Christ. And Paul reciteth two things
summarily concerning John, that he taught the baptism of repentance before
Christ&#8217;s coming. Secondly, that casting from him of his own accord the
title and honor of the Messiah, he submitted himself to Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The baptism of
repentance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Baptism brought in contrary
to the rite and custom of the law was a token of great alteration. For it was
unlawful to renew anything before Christ&#8217;s coming. The Jews had indeed in
the law their baptisms or washings, which were also exercises of repentance, but
John was the author of new and strange baptism, or rather the minister, who put
them in hope of the restoring long looked-for and desired. When he calleth it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the baptism of
repentance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he doth not exclude remission
of sins, but he speaketh according to the circumstance of the place, because
this baptism was a preparation unto the faith of Christ. And we must note the
phrase, that he preached baptism. Whereby we are taught that the sacraments are
then rightly administered, when doctrine is joined with the visible figure; for
the mouth of the baptizer must not be dumb, because the sign is vain without
doctrine.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When John fulfilled his
course.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The second member of the
testimony, that when John drew near to the end of his course he sent his
disciples to Christ; for he had fashioned them before with the rudiment of
baptism, and then he sent them to Christ (as they say) from hand to hand. And
this interrogation,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Whom do ye
think me to be?</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is not a question of one
that doubteth. For John reproveth and chideth the Jews, because they did falsely
give to him the honor of the Messiah. Though it may be read in one text, I am
not he whom you take me to be; yet the other reading is more usual, as it hath
also greater force to refute the error. Furthermore, his testimony doth deserve
greater credit, in that he doth willingly refuse the honor offered him, (which
he might have taken to himself, not without commendations) and doth submit
himself to another. There cannot, assuredly, be any suspicion of ambition, or of
seeking after honor here, which may discredit his words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, he
cometh;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is, he is about to come,
the Hebrew phrase, which is common enough in the New Testament. Whereas he
confesseth that he is unworthy to loose the latchets of Christ&#8217;s shoes, it
is a proverbial figure, whereby he abaseth himself so much as he can, lest his
greatness darken Christ&#8217;s glory; for he meant to do that faithfully which
was given him in charge, that Christ alone might have the preeminence. Therefore
he saith, that how great soever he be, yet he is nothing in respect of Christ.
For though God&#8217;s servants have their dignity, yet being compared to
Christ, they must all be as nothing, that he alone may excel; as we see all
stars vanish away, that they may give place to the brightness of the
sun.</font><br></div>

calleth them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children of

but that they may know that they be heirs of eternal life; and he speaketh them

their estate; but were counted the first-begotten in God&#8217;s family;
therefore is it that he saith, that salvation was sent to them, because they
were first in order; yet because the carnal kindred was of itself of no great
importance, and the ungodliness of many brake out, Paul speaketh specially unto
the true worshippers of God, signifying that words were but vain, unless the
fear of God reign in their hearts, which may receive them, and, receiving them,

an offense which might have been a great hindrance to their faith, [men&#8217;s
faith.] For Jerusalem was God&#8217;s sanctuary, the king&#8217;s seat, the
fountain of truth, and the light of the whole world; but Christ was put to death
there. Furthermore, nothing could seem more absurd to look to than to receive
him who was cast out of the temple of God; and to seek the doctrine of salvation
any where else than there whence God himself had testified it should come.
Moreover, by believing in Christ, they seemed to make a departure from the
Church; and, therefore, this one objection was strong enough to refute all
Paul&#8217;s sermon, Why dost thou force upon us, under color of God&#8217;s
covenant, a man whom the principal part of the holy people condemned? This
objection doth Paul answer, lest it hinder the course of the gospel; and not
that only, but he turneth it also to the contrary part; for seeing that the
author of life was despised and rejected at Jerusalem, Paul exhorteth the men of
Antioch, at least those who among them feared God, that they receive him so much
the more joyfully; for this doth the causal word declare, as if he should have
said, Seeing that Jerusalem knew not her good, it behoveth you to be the more
awakened and inflamed, lest the same unthankfulness and forwardness be found in
you.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he useth another reason to remove the offense, to
wit, that their ungodliness was so far from diminishing any whit of
Christ&#8217;s divine excellency, that it ought rather to serve to prove and
establish the same, for whereby doth Christ better appear than because all that
was fulfilled in him which had been foretold in the law and prophets?
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422425&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
24:25, 26.) Furthermore, what got the enemies of Christ, save only that in him

wicked, that he might acquit us before God; it was expedient that sins should be

for even the Scripture contained these things,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah

<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, the more violently the captains of the
people sought to extinguish Christ, they did in very deed prove him to be
Christ, and the Lord did wonderfully deceive [frustrate] them, so that their
obstinate impiety doth more edify the faith of the godly than destroy it. Of the
same sort are almost all offenses which lead away weak and inconstant souls from
Christ; for if they would thoroughly ponder the whole process of the work of
God, there should be matter of confirmation where they faint. Therefore it
cometh to pass, for the most part, that
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F811</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
we be troubled with offenses and stumbling-blocks, because, whilst we behold
those things which belong to Christ with purblind eyes,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F812</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
we imagine that to be black which is white; and we see how far Paul is from
dissimulation, and how freely

he professeth the truth of the matter, that Christ was hated not only of the
common sort, but also of the chief chieftains; and that he was not hissed at by
a few, but oppressed by the wicked conspiracy of all the people. That was hard
and hateful at the first conflict; but Paul opposeth a more strong engine, that
God used them against their wills as a touchstone, whereby he might try his Son.
Seeing that the gospel standeth in the same state at this day, let us not be
ashamed, with Paul, to confess that the proud princes of the world, and those
who bear the greatest sway in the Church, are the deadly enemies of Christ,
seeing that doth rather turn to Christ&#8217;s praise than reproach; for by this
means is the Scripture fulfilled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seeing they knew him
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Though deliberate malice did
enforce the rulers to oppress Christ, yet doth Paul truly impute it to
ignorance,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F814</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because otherwise they would never have crucified the Lord of glory,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:8.) For the malice of the wicked is like to raging madness, and in
seeing it doth not see. Undoubtedly, we need not doubt of this, that they were
deprived of a sound mind and the light of the Spirit, who were not afraid to
fight against God to their own destruction. Again, he hitteth them in the teeth
with ignorance of the Scripture; and lest any should object that he speaketh of
some dark and unknown manner; he addeth also, that he doth speak of no other
prophecies than of those which are read every Sabbath day; as if he should say,
that the oracles of Scripture are most plain and known to the most ignorant, and
yet they knew them not. Thus doth Paul teach how monstrous their unbelief was,
that he may make the hearers loathe it; and by this example are we taught, that
although the Lord appears to us by the Scripture, yet all men have not eyes.
After that also the blockishness of the nation waxed more gross, as Paul saith
elsewhere, that there is a veil put before their face, that they cannot see
Moses when he is present,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470315&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:15.) In the mean season, we must note that we are recalled to the
Scripture, lest the authority of great men deceive us, neither is there any
cause why any man, inventing to himself a prejudice according to the wicked
meaning of other men, should think that he is acquitted; for Paul exhorteth the
men of Antioch to judge out of the Scripture against the visored governors of
the Church;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F815</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for this cause is it given, that it may be read; and reading is not appointed in
vain by the Lord; but that all godly men may thereby profit and judge what is
right.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This they
fulfilled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>So that we see that not only
creatures void of understanding, but even the very devil, and also the wicked,
are subject to the power
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F816</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
of God, that he may execute by them that which with himself he hath decreed. The
same had we in the third and fourth chapters,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
3:23;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440428&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
4:28,) that when the enemies of Christ did most of all rage to destroy him, yet
could they not obtain their purpose; but rather they brought that to pass with
their own hands which God had in his counsel determined; which thing maketh not
a little for commendation of God&#8217;s truth, because he is not only of
sufficient power to perform those things which he hath promised; but also those
who go about to bring his counsels to nought do their endeavor to establish
them, though it be against their will. For how should not the truth of God stand
which the chiefest enemies are enforced to fulfill? Yet wisdom is necessary
here, lest we join God and Satan together.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the Jews are not therefore excusable, because
they fulfilled the Scriptures; because we must consider their wicked will, and
not the event, which they did not look for, yea, which ought to be counted a
miracle. If we look into their work by itself, it is quite contrary to God; but
as God doth, in the sun and other planets, by wonderful cunning, temper contrary
motions, and such as strive among themselves, so he directeth the perverse
endeavors of the wicked, by his secret power, unto another end than they thought
upon and did desire, lest they should do any thing but that which he would.
They, indeed, as touching themselves, do contrary to his will; but it falleth
out according to the will of God after an incomprehensible manner. Forasmuch as
this course is contrary to nature, no marvel if the wisdom of the flesh see it
not. Therefore, it must be discerned with the eye of faith, or rather it must be
reverenced;<i> </i>and those dogs who bark against it must be despised with
their wantonness.

matter that they should know that Christ was put to death guiltless, for we
could not have been justified by his death, if he had suffered death for his own
evil deeds; therefore it was requisite that he should be guiltless, that his
death might be a satisfaction for the sins of the world. And, undoubtedly, I
think that Paul did plainly declare that Pilate condemned Christ, not according
to the office of a judge, but that he consented that he should be put to death
after that he was overcome with the ungodly requests of the people; and also
that the Jews were driven by lust, and not enforced by reason, to desire
Christ&#8217;s death.: For it stood him upon to terrify the hearers, that they
might not couple themselves
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F818</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

custom, those things which Paul did then more at large declare.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When they had fulfilled all
things;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to<i> </i>wit, which it pleased God
should be done by them. For they did so handle Christ that there was nothing of
the prophecies of the Scripture left unfulfilled. By this means is the
stumbling-block (which the understanding of the flesh conceiveth by reason of
the ignominy of the cross) taken away, that the Son of God was not laid open to
the furious fury of the wicked; but he obeyed his fathers decree. Furthermore,
it doth also in Scripture appear what condition was appointed for him in times
past. Whereas he saith that Christ was buried by the same which had slain him,
it seemeth contrary to the history of the gospel; but it may be that Luke did
take the word <i>buried </i>indefinitely. And if it please you to refer it unto
the same, it shall be <i>synecdoche. </i>For he was buried with Pilate&#8217;s
leave; and at the appointment and pleasure of the priests there were watchmen
set to watch the grave. Therefore, though Joseph and Nicodemus did bury Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402757&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
27:57,) that is ascribed improperly, and yet not absurdly, to the Jews; because
it is not Paul&#8217;s drift in this place to commend the good deed, but to
prove Christ&#8217;s resurrection; because God took him out of the grave whom
his enemies had shut up there. Therefore he giveth us to understand that the
body of Christ was not taken thence privily or by stealth, but that it was laid
in a place both famous and known to the adversaries; and so, consequently, that
even they were set to watch it; and yet for all this it was not found: whence we
may gather the certainty of the resurrection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
God hath raised him up.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The death of
Christ was the salvation of the godly, yet joined with the resurrection;
therefore doth Paul stand longer upon this second point. For he should never
have persuaded his hearers that they were to seek salvation in Christ&#8217;s
death, unless the power of Almighty God had appeared in raising Christ from
death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b> After that he hath said that Christ came
out of the grave, which was beset with the hired ministers of the adversaries,

the enemies, who were ready and bent to resist, and did omit nothing, there
were, notwithstanding, such as did openly affirm that Christ rose again, and
were also such as saw that thing with their eyes; for if there had been any

himself the office and honor of an apostle, that he may be heard as a lawful
minister of God. And he saith the sum of the embassage enjoined him is, that
that is revealed and given in their time which was promised in times past. And
in few words doth he comprehend many and great matters. First, he giveth them to
understand that he bringeth in nothing which is new, or contrary to the law and
prophets, but that he did reveal the fulfilling of that doctrine which they
themselves did confess, and were persuaded to have been delivered by God.
Whereupon it followeth that they cannot refuse that which he offereth them, but
they shall break the covenant made with the fathers by God, so much as in them
shall lie; secondly, he commandeth the faithfulness of God, because it doth now
in very deed appear that there was nothing promised in times past unadvisedly or
in vain; but he doth chiefly extol the greatness of the grace given at length in
Christ. For we must note the comparison between them and the fathers, when he
saith, that they had gotten that which was promised to the fathers. For the more
liberally the grace of God is poured out upon them, the more filthy shall their
unthankfulness be, if they shall despise or loathe that inestimable good thing.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To their children, namely, to
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is certain that Paul speaketh of
natural children, who had their beginning of the holy fathers, which we must
therefore note, because certain brain-sick men, drawing all things unto
allegories, dream that there is no respect to be had in this place of kindred,
but only of faith. And with such an invention they make the holy covenant of God
of none effect, where it is said,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It is faith (say they)alone which maketh us the
children of Abraham. But I say, on the other side, that even those who are born
the children of Abraham according to the flesh, are also counted the spiritual
children of God, unless they grow out of kind through unbelief
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F821</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For the boughs be naturally holy, because they spring from a holy root, until
they become profane through their own fault,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:16.) And assuredly it is Paul&#8217;s drift to allure the Jews unto Christ;
and that he may do this, they must be distinguished from the common sort by some
privilege. And yet it followeth not thereupon (which these knaves do odiously
object) that the grace of God is tied to the carnal seed; because, though the
promise of life came by inheritance to the posterity of Abraham, yet many were
deprived by their unbelief. Therefore faith is the cause, that of a great
multitude only a few are counted children. And that is the double election
whereof I spake before. The one common to the whole nation alike; because the
first adoption of God containeth the whole family of Abraham. The other, which
is restrained unto the secret counsel of God, and is at length established by
faith, that it may be confirmed to men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore Paul doth well and truly affirm that that
was performed to the Jews which God had promised to the fathers. For it was
promised to them also, as Zacharias saith in his song, &#8220;The oath which he
sware to our father Abraham, that he would give himself for us,&#8221; etc. And
yet the worthiness of that nation doth not hinder but that the grace of Christ
may also spread itself throughout the whole world; because the first-begotten
hath the first degree of honor, so that he doth, notwithstanding, leave the
second place to his brethren. For in that after the old people were cast off,
the possession of the church was left empty for strangers, it began to be a new
occasion of gathering the Church of the Gentiles; but and if that people had
stood in the faith, the Gentiles had been joined into the common society of
honor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After that he had raised

repeated. For he doth not only say that Christ rose from the dead, but that he
was appointed of God, and, as it were, brought to light by the hand of God, that
he might fulfill the office of the Messiah, as the Scripture teacheth everywhere
that kings and prophets are raised up.

his servants in times past, by the effect itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Likeas, in the second
Psalm.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Though the Greek books,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F823</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
agree in the number, yet we must not pass over that which Erasmus saith, that
many of the old writers read the <i>first Psalm. </i>And it may be that Luke
wrote so; for that which at this day is counted the second Psalm, might have
been called the first not without reason, seeing that it is likely that the
first Psalm was added instead of a proem by the scribes and priests, by whose
industry the Psalms were gathered into one body. For the name of the author is
not set to it, and it doth only exhort to meditate upon the law of God. But
there is no great weight in that matter.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F824</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For this is the chiefest thing, that we know how properly and how well Paul
applieth the testimony taken out of the Psalm unto the matter which he hath in
hand. We do not deny that David, when he saw that he was on every side assailed
by his enemies<i>, </i>and that they were of greater power and might than that
he was able to resist them, doth set against them God&#8217;s aid, who he
knew<i> </i>was the author of his kingdom and reign. But forasmuch as he was a
figure of the true Messiah, we know that those things were shadowed in his
person, which do appertain, wholly and perfectly<i> </i>to<i> </i>the Messiah
alone. And the text itself doth prove sufficiently that there is not only a
simple and bare thanksgiving contained there, agreeable to David&#8217;s
kingdom, but it is a higher prophecy. For it is well known that David did in his
life scarce taste of the hundredth part of the glory which is spoken of in this
place, concerning which we have spoken more at large, chapter
4.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now let us look nigher into the words: Kings are
indeed called sons of God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;198206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
82:6.) But seeing that God doth intend to prefer David before all other kings,
and to exempt him out of the number of them, this title of honor is given to him
principally above all other; not because so great honor resteth in his person,
because by this means he should pass
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F825</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the angels, as it is in the Epistle to the Hebrews, 1st chapter. Therefore he is
thus gorgeously set out in respect of Christ, whose image he was, that God doth
not take him for one of the common sort, or for some one of a great multitude,
but he doth, as it were, acknowledge him to be his only begotten Son. The proof
followeth, because God did beget him when he established the kingdom in his
hand. For that was not done by man&#8217;s industry, but God showed from heaven
the invincible power of his hand, whereby it might plainly appear that he
reigned according to God&#8217;s counsel. Therefore this begetting, by him
mentioned, must be referred unto the understanding of knowledge of men; to wit,
because it was then openly known that he was begotten of God, when as he was set
upon the throne of the kingdom wonderfully, contrary to the hope of all men, and
did, by the heavenly power of the Spirit, break infinite conspiracies; because
he could not reign until he had brought all nations round about him in
subjection, as if a certain world were subdued.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, let us come unto Christ. He came not into the
world without testimony, whereby he did prove that he was the Son of God. For
his glory did appear as became the only begotten Son of God, as it is written,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:14, and he saith everywhere that he hath God for the witness and maintainer of
this honor. Therefore God begat Christ, when he gave him certain marks, whereby
he might be known to be his true and lively image and Son. And yet this doth not
let but that Christ is the Wisdom begotten of the Eternal Father before time.
But that is the secret generation; and now David declareth that it was revealed
to men; so that the relation is, as we have said, unto men and not unto God;
because that which was hidden in the heart of God was make known to men. And it
is a very fine figure, because Christ&#8217;s divinity was no less declared and
established, than if he had been begotten of God before the eyes of men. I know
that Augustine&#8217;s deep sight
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F826</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
doth please some, that by <i>today </i>is meant <i>perpetuity. </i>But when as
the Spirit of God himself is his own interpreter, and whereas he doth expound
that by the mouth of Paul which he had said by David, we must not invent any
other sense. And forasmuch (as the same Paul doth witness) that Christ was
declared to be the Son of God in power when he rose from the dead,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:4,) we gather that this was the principal token of celestial excellency, and
that the Father did then bring him truly to light, that the world might know
that he was begotten of him. Therefore, though God began to raise Christ when he
came into the world, yet his raising was then, as it were, perfect and full;
because whereas he was humbled before, having taken, as it were, the form of a
servant,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:7,) he did then appear to be the conqueror of death and the Lord of life; so
that he wanted nothing of that majesty which was meet for the Son of God, and
that for the only begotten Son.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>34.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
That he should not return.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He addeth now
the other member, that Christ was once raised from death that he may live for
ever, as Paul teacheth,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450610&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:10,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He dieth no more,
neither shall death have dominion over him any more; because he liveth to
God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the hope conceived of Christ&#8217;s resurrection
should be slender and cold, if he were yet subject to destruction, or to any
change. Therefore he is said to be entered into the kingdom of God, that he may
also give to his [people] eternal felicity, living for ever. For because Christ
rose rather for our sake than for himself, the perpetuity of life which the
Father hath given him reacheth unto us all, and is ours. Notwithstanding the
place of Isaiah which is here cited, seemeth to make but a little for proof of
Christ&#8217;s immortality, I will give you the holy things of David,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
55:3.) But it is not so. For seeing Isaiah speaketh of the redemption promised
to David, and affirmeth that the same shall be firm and stable, we do well
gather by this the immortal kingdom of Christ, wherein the eternity of salvation
is grounded. And Paul followed the Greek interpreters when he
put</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> holy
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for mercies. <i>Chessed,
</i>which signifieth <i>meek, merciful, </i>and <i>gentle, </i>is wont by the
Grecians to be translated <i>holy. </i>Therefore they translated
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">ydsh</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>of David, </i>the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>holy things
of David,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>whereas the prophet meaneth
rather the grace promised to David. But Paul granted this to the ignorant and
weak, who were better acquainted with the Greek reading, especially forasmuch as
the force of the testimony consisteth in another point. For this is Paul&#8217;s
meaning in sum, If the grace be eternal which God saith he will give in his Son,
the life of his Son must be eternal, and not subject to corruption.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F827</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For we must hold this rule, that all the promises of God are in Christ yea and
amen,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470120&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 1:20;) and that therefore they cannot be of any force unless he do
quicken them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>35.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Thou shalt not suffer thy Holy One.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This
place was likewise cited by Peter in the first sermon, set down by Luke in the
second chapter,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440227&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
2:27,) where I expounded the same; therefore, let the readers repair thither.
Only I will touch this briefly, that David putteth two Hebrew words for <i>the
grave, </i>as he useth repetitions commonly; the former whereof is derived of
<i>desiring </i>or <i>lusting, </i>because the grave devoureth all things as an
insatiable gulf; and the other of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>corruption.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>According to this etymology David&#8217;s meaning is faithfully expressed in
Greek; for the quality of the grave is noted, when as it receiveth the corpse,
and doth, as it were, swallow it up, that it may rot there, and may at length
perish when it is consumed. Paul affirmeth that that belongeth to Christ alone,
that he was free and saved from corruption; for though his body was laid in the
grave, corruption had, notwithstanding, no title to it, seeing that it lay there
whole, as in a bed, until the day of the resurrection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>36.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
When David had served his time.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Lest any
man should think that that place intreateth of David, Paul showeth briefly that
this agreeth not to David in all points, whose corpse was rotten in the grave.
Therefore it remaineth, that because this was a privilege belonging to Christ
alone, that David prophesied of him in spirit. Nevertheless, we must note the
proportion between the members and the head; for as the truth of this prophecy
was found whole and perfect in Christ alone, as in the head, so it taketh place
in all the members according to the measure and order of every man. And
forasmuch as Christ rose to this end, that he may fashion and make our base body
like to his glorious body,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500321&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
3:21;) upon this condition do the godly go down into the pit, that rottenness
may not [finally] consume their bodies. Therefore, according to the hope of the
resurrection to come, David saith by good right that he shall not see
corruption; for that ought not altogether to be counted corruption for which
there is a better restoring prepared; for the bodies of the faithful corrupt to
this end, that they may put on blessed incorruption in their time. Yet this is
no let but that the estate of the head and members may be far unlike, and that
we may follow the Son of God afar off and lazily.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F828</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we see that both things are true and fitly said,
that David and the rest of the faithful, inasmuch as they shall be like to their
head, shall not see corruption, and yet the Son of God alone shall be free from
corruption wholly. We must note the phrase, when he saith, that <i>David served
his age, </i>or the men of his time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The old interpreter distinguisheth it otherwise, and
certain Greek copies agree thereto, to wit, that <i>David served the will of God
in his time; </i>which reading, though it is to be allowed,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F829</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
yet it doth not cause me to mislike the other. For it is neither superfluous nor
cold, that he slept by the will of God, or the counsel of God; because the
meaning thereof is, that God, in the death of David, did not forget that
prophecy; as if he should say that the body of David lay in the grave not
without the counsel or purpose of God, until it should rise again, that<i>
</i>the effect of the prophecy might be extended unto Christ. If no man mislike
that which I say, we are taught hereby to what end men live in the world, to
wit, that one man may help another. For every man doth not live, neither is
born, for himself, but mankind is knit together with a holy knot. Therefore,
unless we be disposed to overthrow the laws of nature, let us remember that we
must not live for ourselves, but for our neighbors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here may a question be asked, whether we ought
not also to care for our posterity? I answer, that the ministry of the godly is
also profitable for the posterity, as we see that David, being dead, doth profit
us more at this day than a great part of those which live with us; but Paul
meaneth simply, that the faithful during their whole life employ themselves and
their offices<i> </i>to help their neighbors, and that death is unto them as a
goal, because they have made an end then, when the Lord calleth them out of the
world. The sum is, that we must have respect first to our time, that we may
serve our brethren, with whom and among whom we lead our life; and, secondly, we
must do our endeavor that the fruit of our ministry may redound unto our
posterity. Seeing that God prescribeth his servants this law, their rashness
cannot be excused who feign that the dead pray for us, and that they do no less
serve the Church than whilst they lived.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the counsel of God he fell on
sleep.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Paul might have said simply that
David died; he addeth by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
counsel of God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that we may know that
that was not fulfilled in the person of the prophet which is read in the Psalm.
Notwithstanding, we are taught that the bond of life and death is in like sort
appointed for us by God, as it is
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;199003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm

And for this cause, when he speaketh of David&#8217;s death, he maketh mention

chance, as if God had forgotten his promise; but that it came to pass by
God&#8217;s providence, that the faithful might know that the prophecy was to be
referred unto another. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To

Therefore, be it known unto you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>After
that he hath declared the mean whereby salvation is purchased through Christ, he
doth now intreat of his office and power. And this is the principal point, to
know what good things we have by the coming of Christ, and what we are to hope
for at his hands. And although Luke setteth down in a word that Paul preached of
the benefits of Christ, yet there is no cause why any man should doubt but that
so great matters were handled weightily, and only according as their dignity did
require. By this word,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> Be it
known unto you,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Paul meaneth that
nothing should hinder them from knowing such an excellent and plain matter, save
only sloth; and that, therefore, it was an absurd thing that those benefits of
God should be hidden from the faithful which were offered by Christ. For he was
sent with the shrill preaching of the gospel, which our faith ought to hear,
that it may enter into the sure possession of his good things; for we must know
what he is, that we may enjoy him truly. Forgiveness of sins is set first,
whereby God doth reconcile us unto himself. That which God will have preached to
all his people doth he show to be necessary for all men; for Paul speaketh not
to one or two, but to all the Jews which were at Antioch.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, we must first mark that we be all enemies
to God through sin,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:13.) Whereupon it followeth that we are all excluded from the kingdom of God,
and are given over to eternal death, until God receive us to favor by the free
forgiveness of sins. We must also note this, that God doth pardon to us our
sins, and that he is reconciled through the Mediator, because like as without
him there is no satisfaction, so neither is there any pardon or forgiveness of
guiltiness. These be principles of our faith which are not learned in the
schools of the philosophers, that all mankind is condemned and drowned in sin,
that there is in us no righteousness which is able to reconcile us to God; that
the only hope of salvation resteth in his mercy, whilst that he doth freely
forgive us; and that those remain under the guilt which fly not unto Christ, and
seek not forgiveness
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F832</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in his death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And from all
things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He doth secretly prevent that
which might seem contrary to the former doctrine. For look how many ceremonies
of the law there were, so many exercises were there to obtain remission of sins.
Therefore, the Jews might readily object, If he alone do reconcile God to us,
our sins being done away, to what end serve so many washings and sacrifices,
which we have hitherto used according to the prescript of the law? Therefore,
lest the ceremonies of the law hinder the Jews, Paul teacheth that Christ doth
that which they were not able to do. Not that Paul spake so briefly and
compendiously, (for he did not hope that the Jews would at the first come unto
Christ, casting from them suddenly the affiance which they had in the
righteousness of the law;) but it was sufficient for Luke briefly to collect
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F833</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the sum of those things which he then taught in just and due order. His meaning
is, that the Mediator took away that let from the Jews wherein they did stick.
The ceremonial law ought indeed to have been a schoolmaster to lead them by the
hand unto Christ; all rites commanded by God were helps to help and further
their faith; but as men use preposterously to corrupt the holy ordinances of
God, they stop the way before themselves by their ceremonies, and they shut the
gate of faith, that they could not come to Christ. They thought they had
righteousness in sacrifices; that by washings was gotten true cleanness; that
God was pleased with them so soon as they had ended their external pomp: in sum,
forsaking the body, they laid hold upon vain shadows. God did indeed appoint no
unprofitable or vain thing in the law; wherefore ceremonies were sure and
undoubted testimonies of remission of sins. For God did not lie in these words,
Let the sinner do sacrifice, and his iniquity shall be purged. But as Christ was
the end of the law, and the heavenly pattern of the tabernacle, so the force and
effect of all ceremonies did depend upon him; whereby it is proved that they
were vain shadows, when he was set aside,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
8:5.) Now we see Paul&#8217;s drift and purpose; to wit, that he meant to draw
away the Jews from the false and perverse confidence which they reposed in the
law; lest being puffed up, they should think that they had no need of
Christ&#8217;s help, or lest they should seek only external felicity in
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be justified in the
law.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This place doth plainly show what
the word </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>justified
</i></font><font face="Palatino">doth import in all other places where it is
used; to wit, to be delivered and acquitted. There was mention made of remission
of sins; Paul affirmeth that there is no other way whereby we can obtain the
same but the grace of Christ. Lest any man should object that there be remedies
to be found in the law, he answereth that there was in them no force. Therefore
the sense is plain, that they cannot be justified from sin in the law, because
the rites of the law were neither just nor lawful prices to remove guiltiness;
they were nothing worth of themselves to deserve righteousness, neither were
they sufficient recompenses to appease God. Certainly, it cannot be denied (but
wickedly) that that justification annexed to remission of sins is, as it were,
the means and way to obtain the same. For what else doth Paul go about but to
confirm that saying, that our sins are forgiven us through the benefit of
Christ, by answering contrary objections? And he proveth it, because neither
satisfactions, neither all the rites of the law, call justify us from sin.
Therefore he is justified by Christ, who is freely loosed from the guilt and
judgment of eternal death to which he was subject. This<i> </i>is the
righteousness of faith, whilst that God counteth us just, by not imputing our
sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This only propriety of the word is sufficient to
refute the cavils of the Papists, who hold that we are not justified by pardon
or by free accepting, but by habit and infused righteousness. Therefore, let us
not suffer them to rend in pieces unworthily and wickedly this text of Paul,
when he saith that they are justified from all things, that we may be assured of
remission of sins. And now we must know that the law of Moses is set against
Christ, as the principal mean to obtain righteousness, if there had been any
besides Christ. Paul disputeth, indeed, of ceremonies; but we must note that
there was nothing omitted in them which might serve to purge sins and to appease
God. Yet there was not one of all the ceremonies of the law which did not make
man guilty, as a new handwriting; as Paul teacheth,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:14. What then? Assuredly God meant to testify that men are justified by the
death of his Son alone, because he made him sin for us who did [knew] no sin,
that we might have righteousness in him,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470521&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:21.) Whereupon it followeth that whatsoever satisfactions are
invented by men, they tend to rob Christ of his
honor.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> In the

phrase.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From all
things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this member is refuted the
wicked invention of the Papists, who teach that only original sin and actual
sins committed before baptism are clearly and freely forgiven by Christ, and
that others are redeemed by satisfactions. But Paul saith plainly that we are
justified from sins by Christ throughout the whole course of our life. For we
must remember that the ceremonies [rites] of the law were committed to the Jews,
that as well the profit as the use thereof might flourish daily in the Church;
that is, that the Jews might indeed understand that their sacrifices and
washings were not continually reiterated in vain. If the truth and substance of
them be found in Christ, it followeth that there is no other satisfaction or
sacrifice to put away sins but his death; otherwise there should be no analogy
or proportion between this and the old figures. The Papists call us back unto
repentance and the keys, as if the ceremonies of the law were not exercises to
think upon repentance, and as if the power of the keys were not annexed unto
them. But the faith of the godly was holpen by such helps, that they might fly
unto the grace of the Mediator alone. Therefore, let this remain sure and
certain that the righteousness which we have in Christ is not for one day or a
moment, but it is everlasting, as the sacrifice of his death doth daily
reconcile us to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>39.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Every one that believeth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Paul showeth
how men obtain the righteousness of Christ; to wit, when they receive it by
faith; and that which faith doth obtain is not obtained by any merits of works.
Wherefore, Paul&#8217;s opinion is plain, that we are justified by faith alone,
which, notwithstanding the Papists oppugn [oppose] and strive against no less
obstinately than bitterly, nevertheless, it is requisite that we know what the
word </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>believe
</i></font><font face="Palatino">doth import, which is made unsavory to the
Papists through ignorance. There be also other benefits of Christ which we reap
by faith; for when he regenerateth us by his Spirit, he restoreth in us the
image of God; and after that the old man is crucified he fashioneth us unto
newness of life. But it was enough for Luke to express this one thing, how men
return into favor with God, from whom they be estranged by sin, because we may
easily pass thence unto the residue.</font><br></div>

stiff-necked men, or at least there were diverse in the company which were
stiff-necked (as if he meant with a hammer to soften their stubbornnesses) he
addeth a chiding unto doctrine. For if the Jews had been obedient and willing to
obey, undoubtedly he would have sought sweetly to allure them unto Christ. But
it was either their sluggishness, or else their willfulness, that caused him to
be more angry; like as all those must be cited to appear before God&#8217;s

eternal death must be denounced to those. He signifieth, indeed, that there is

the words of Habakkuk, which go thus, &#8220;Behold, ye Gentiles, and see and

man shall believe when it shall be told him.&#8221; Paul saith, &#8220;Behold,
ye despisers,&#8221; that the Jews may know that the vengeance which was once
brought upon their fathers is common to the despisers of the word; as if he
should say, God doth at this day make no less account of his word, the contempt
whereof he did once punish so sharply. Therefore, the prophet&#8217;s
denunciation doth appertain unto all ages, so that the despisers cannot hope
that they can escape that vengeance now whereof others have tasted. They boasted
of the temple; they vaunted that they were the people of God; being puffed up
with wicked pride, they despised all threatenings. Therefore Paul putteth them
in mind of that which God by his prophets doth threaten to the
despisers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A work in your

believe the word of God shall feel his hand, that being at length with plagues

experience is the mistress of fools. So the Lord doth indeed punish the wicked,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F835</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that being tamed with miseries, they may begin to confess his power. And what
manner [of] punishment doth he denounce? Because you (saith he) do not believe
my word, I will show an example among you which no man will believe; by which
words he meaneth, that he will punish them, so that the world shall be afraid to
see it. For as rebellion against God is a detestable monster, so it is no marvel
if of itself it beget monsters of punishments. Therefore, we must beware, lest,
if we cease to give credence to God&#8217;s word, we feel his hand more mighty
than all our senses do comprehend, and even unto the astonying [astonishment] of
all the whole world; and lest even we be made astounded through fear. Habakkuk
prophesieth of the destruction brought upon them by the Chaldeans; but the
punishment whereby God revenged the contempt of his gospel was more cruel,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When they were gone out of the
synagogue.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It may be also read, out of
the synagogue of the Jews, and peradventure more fitly. For it is likely that
they were gone out before the multitude was dispersed; and that is gathered out
of the text because Luke saith shortly after, that when the synagogue was
dissolved certain of the Jews did follow Paul and Barnabas. Therefore, the sense
is, that Paul and Barnabas went out whilst the Jews were yet assembled, and that
they were then requested by the Gentiles to take some pains with them in the
mean season.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>43.</b> And that afterward there came certain of
the Jews and proselytes to Paul, being both desirous to learn, and also that
they might make profession of their faith. When as the old interpreter and
Erasmus did translate it <i>the Sabbath following, </i>they did not understand
Luke&#8217;s meaning. For seeing that he intreateth in this place of the
Gentiles, I do not think that they choose a Sabbath wherein they may hear Paul
and Barnabas. For that day was appointed for the Jews, but the Gentiles had no
less opportunity upon other days. Therefore, to what end should they defer their
desire and prayers until the eighth day? Yea, rather they covet to hear Paul
whilst he is at leisure, and is not occupied in teaching the Jews. So that the
Lord doth not suffer them to be idle until the Sabbath come, offering unto them
matter in the Gentiles, wherein they may exercise themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>42<i>.</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

</i>may be taken for </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ta
auta</font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>as in some other places. Then the
sense should be, that they were requested that they would that week intreat of
the same things before the Gentiles. Furthermore, whilst that the Gentiles do
snatch greedily at every first opportunity, the Jews being quiet,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F837</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
do neglect that which is set before them; only that certain of them join
themselves to Paul and Barnabas. Luke expresseth the proselytes by name, who
seeing they had embraced the doctrine of the law, and did worship the God of
Israel, were not puffed up with that pride which hindered the Jews, who made
boast of their long stock and race.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>43.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

it may be referred unto the Jews<i> </i>and proselytes, that they exhorted Paul
and Barnabas that they should not faint, but stand stoutly in the grace of God.
Neither did they want occasion; for they saw combats prepared for them; and that
therefore they had need of invincible constancy to suffer and abide the brunts
of the contrary faction. Wherefore that might very well agree, that being
inflamed with a desire to go forward, they sought to encourage Paul and Barnabas
to hold on. If you refer it unto Paul and Barnabas, the sense shall be this,
that they did not reject those which came, but they entertained them courteously
and gently, and confirmed and strengthened them, that they might persist in the
grace which they had received. And this word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

which come thence to us; or, that I may speak more briefly, the calling into the

assembly of the people doth prove that Paul and Barnabas loitered not between
the Sabbaths, and they did not take pains with the Gentiles in vain; for the
studies and desires of the people had been so prepared, that they all desired to
know the whole matter more surely, which they did hope would be, if it should be
discussed among the Jews. For we may guess that though they were allured with
some sweet taste, yet were they not as yet thoroughly persuaded to receive the
doctrine of the gospel without doubting,

of the wicked to be inflamed when the light of the gospel is set somewhat
nearer; especially when they see the increase of sound doctrine, they break out
with greater violence to resist. And it is to be doubted whether Luke do mean,
by the word <i>zeal, </i>that they were moved with a certain wicked indignation,
to set themselves against Paul and Barnabas, as ambition is the mother as well
of envy as of all contention; or he take <i>zeal
</i>for</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
indignation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>conceived thereupon, because
they did lament that the Gentiles were made equal with the people of God. For
they counted this a very unmeet thing, that the holy treasure of doctrine, which

reasons and discouraged, they wax harder and harder; and wittingly and willingly
they spew out at length blasphemies against God and the truth. Wherefore we must
take so much the more heed when as the truth of God is plainly set before us,
lest, if we be carried away with a desire to speak against it, we fall
straightway into that steep down.

When they had taken liberty.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Luke
showeth that the servants of Christ were so far from being discouraged with the
stubbornness of the enemies, that they began, therefore, to inveigh against them
afresh more freely. For though they had sharply pricked them, yet they did yet
spare them a little; but now, when they see Christ obstinately rejected by them,
they
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F841</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
excommunicate them and deprive them of the kingdom of God. And by this example
are we taught that we must not use extreme severity, save only against those who
are quite past hope. And the more bold the reprobate are to oppress the truth,
the more courage ought we to take to ourselves. For the servants of God must be
armed with invincible constancy of the Spirit, that they may never give place to
the devil, nor to his ministers; as the Lord commandeth Jeremiah to encounter
with the reprobate with a face of iron.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It was
necessary.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He accuseth them of
unthankfulness, because, whereas they were chosen by God out of all people, that
Christ might offer himself unto them, they refuse so great a benefit
maliciously. And in the former member he setteth down the degree of honor and
excellency whereunto God had exalted them; afterward followeth the upbraiding,
because they do willingly cast from them so great grace; whereupon he concludeth
that it is now time that the gospel be translated unto the Gentiles. In that he
saith, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it was meet that it
should first be preached to them,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>it
doth properly appertain unto the time of Christ&#8217;s kingdom. For under the
law, before Christ was given, the Jews were not only the first, but alone.
Therefore was it that Moses called them a priestly kingdom, and the peculiar
people of God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021905&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:5, 6.) But the adoption of God rested then with them alone upon this
condition, (the Gentiles being omitted,) that they should be preferred as yet
before the Gentiles by the coming of Christ. For though Christ reconciled the
world to his Father, yet they were former in order, who were already near unto
God, and of his family. Therefore, that was the most lawful order, that the
apostles should gather the Church first of the Jews, afterward of the Gentiles,
as we saw in the first chapter,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;440118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
1:18,) and in other places, so that the fellowship of the Gentiles did not take
from the Jews the right of the first-begotten, but that they were always the
chief in the Church of God. In this respect Paul saith, that the righteousness
of God is made manifest in the gospel, first to the Jews, then to the Grecians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:16.) Such greatness of grace which God vouchsafed to bestow upon them, doth
exaggerate and increase the greatness of their sin, whilst that they reject that
which is so mercifully offered unto them. Therefore he addeth that they give
judgment of themselves,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that they
are unworthy of eternal life.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>For seeing
that the rejecting of the gospel is the denial of the righteousness of God, we
need no other judge to condemn the unbelievers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And after that ye
reject.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Paul seemeth to reason unfitly.
For, first it was not of necessity that the Jews should be excluded, that the
Gentiles might be admitted unto the hope of salvation; secondly, this was more
convenient, that, after the Jews had embraced the gospel, they should grant the
second place to the Gentiles. And Paul speaketh in like sort as if they could
not grow together into one body, and as if the gospel could not come unto the
Gentiles unless it were rejected of the Jews. And now was he not ordained to be
the apostle of the Gentiles before he found such stubbornness in the Jews?
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F842</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I answer, that there is great force in the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we are
turned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For his meaning is, that he is
now turned away from the Jews, that he may addict and give over himself wholly
to the Gentiles. If they had remained in their degree such turning had not
followed, but he should have drawn the Gentiles also with a continual course,
after that the Jews were received into the bosom; and he should have embraced
them both together, know, forasmuch as the Jews turn their backs, and withdraw
themselves from his ministry, he cannot look upon them and the Gentiles both at
once. Therefore, taking his leave of them, he is enforced to translate his
care<i> </i>unto the Gentiles. Therefore, unless the Jews had estranged
themselves from the Church, the calling of the Gentiles should have been such as
is by the prophets described: &#8220;In that day shall seven strangers take hold
of the cloak of a man that is a Jew, and shall say, we will walk with you;
because God is with you.&#8221; But now the Gentiles are called after a new and
accidental manner; because, when the Jews were rejected, they entered into the
empty possession. They ought to have been gathered unto the Jews; but after that
they fell away, and were driven out, they came in their place. So that their
death was the life of the Gentiles, and the natural branches being cut off, the
wild olives were ingrafted into the holy root, until God do at length restore
them also unto life, being ingrafted into their former root, that the Israel of
God being gathered together from all quarters may be saved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>47.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
As he hath commanded.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The place is taken
out of Isaiah, where, notwithstanding, God doth rather speak unto his Son than
unto the apostles. But we must note, that many things which the Scripture
attributeth to Christ do appertain unto his ministers. I say many things; not
all things: for there be certain titles proper to the person of Christ,
wherewith to adorn the ministers were wicked sacrilege. Christ is called our
Righteousness, because he was the only purging sacrifice,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F843</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and hath reconciled the Father to us by his death, and did rise again afterward,
that, having overcome death, he might purchase for us eternal life. Therefore
the whole substance of our salvation is in Christ&#8217;s person; but inasmuch
as he worketh by his ministers, by resigning to them his office, he doth also
impart with [to] them his titles. Of this sort is the preaching of the gospel.
He alone was appointed by the Father to be our teacher; but he hath put in his
place pastors and doctors, who speak, as it were, out of his mouth. So that the
authority remaineth wholly to him, and he is nevertheless heard in his
ministers. Therefore Paul doth fitly apply unto himself the testimony of Isaiah,
where he intreateth of the preaching of the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have made thee a
light.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It should seem that he speaketh
in that place of such a calling of the Gentiles as doth not carry with it the
casting off of the old people. For God doth rather associate strangers unto the
Jews, who were before of the household. It is but a small matter, saith he, that
thou be my minister in teaching Israel, because I have made thee a light to the
Gentiles. God doth seem to begin his Church among the children of Abraham, and,
that done, to reach out his hand to the Gentiles, that they may both make one
Church by one consent of faith. But Paul doth in such sort cite the prophecy, as
if it could not be fulfilled unless the Jews had been cast off. For he
signifieth that the light of Christ was lighted to the Gentiles, after that they
were cast into the darkness of death. I answer, that this cannot be necessarily
proved out of the text, that Paul doth affirm that the Gentiles could not have
been illuminated before the light of the Jews had been put out. For this may be
the sense, Forasmuch as you have deprived yourselves of eternal life, there is
no cause why ye should think that the grace of God is profaned, if, leaving you,
we take care and charge of the Gentiles; for the Messiah is not given to you
alone, but he is appointed to be the Savior of the whole world; as it is
written, &#8220;I have made thee,&#8221; etc.; although, if you weigh the place
of the prophet more thoroughly, you shall find the casting off of the old people
included therein. For God pronounceth that he will be glorious and renowned in
the ministry of Christ, though Israel be not gathered together. He addeth
afterward, by way of exposition, that the power of Christ shall not be
restrained unto one people only, because his light shall shed abroad his beams
unto the farthest parts of the world unto salvation. It seemeth that Paul noteth
this occasion of calling the Gentiles, namely, because, seeing he found no
matter to exercise himself in among the Jews, he gave himself wholly to the
Gentiles. We must note this by the way, in the words of the prophet, that
salvation is put after light, according to that saying of
Christ,</font><br></div>

length fulfilled which was foretold many years before. For doubtless it was
small confirmation of their faith, because salvation was promised to them by the
coming of Christ, whereby it did also come to pass that they did with more
earnest desire and reverence embrace the gospel. To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glorify
</i></font><font face="Palatino">the word of God may be expounded two manner of
ways, either that they did confess that it was true which was prophesied by
Isaiah, or that they embraced the doctrine which was set before them with faith.
Assuredly there is a full subscription noted out, because they dispute or doubt
no longer, so soon as they saw that Paul had gotten the victory. And surely we
do then honor the word of God as we ought, when we submit ourselves obediently
to it by faith; as it cannot be more grievously blasphemed than when men refuse
to believe it. And here we see how the Gentiles were not hindered, by that
stubbornness which they saw in the Jews, from giving their name to Christ. With
like courage
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F844</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
must we despise and tread under foot the pride of the wicked, when, by their
obstinacy, they study to stop the way before us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they
believed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is an exposition of the
member next going before, at least in my judgment.: For Luke showeth what manner
[of] glory they gave to the word of God. And here we must note the restraint,
[reservation,] when he saith that they believed, (but) not all in general, but
those who were ordained unto life. And we need not doubt but that Luke calleth
those
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tetagmenouv</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>who were chosen by the free adoption of God. For it is a ridiculous cavil to
refer this unto the affection of those which believed, as if those received the
gospel whose minds were well-disposed. For this ordaining must be understood of
the eternal counsel of God alone. Neither doth Luke say that they were ordained
unto faith, but unto life; because the Lord doth predestinate his unto the
inheritance of eternal life. And this place teacheth that faith dependeth upon
God&#8217;s election. And assuredly, seeing that the whole race of mankind is
blind and stubborn, those diseases stick fast in our nature until they be
redressed by the grace of the Spirit, and that redressing floweth from the
fountain of election alone. For in that of two which hear the same doctrine
together,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F845</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the one showeth himself apt to be taught, the other continueth in his obstinacy.
It is not, therefore, because they differ by nature, but because God doth
lighten [illumine] the former, and doth not vouchsafe the other the like grace.
We are, indeed, made the children of God by faith; as faith, as touching us, is
the gate and the first beginning of salvation; but there is a higher respect of
God. For he doth not begin to choose us after that we believe; but he sealeth
his adoption, which was hidden in our hearts, by the gift of faith, that it may
be manifest and sure. For if this be proper to the children of God alone to be
his disciples, it followeth that it doth not appertain unto all the children of
Adam in general. No marvel, therefore, if all do not receive the gospel;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F846</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
because, though our heavenly Father inviteth all men unto the faith by the
external voice of man, yet doth he not call effectually by his Spirit any save
those whom he hath determined to save. Now, if God&#8217;s election, whereby he
ordaineth us unto life, be the cause of faith and salvation, there remaineth
nothing for worthiness or merits.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore, let us hold and mark that which Luke
saith, that those were ordained before unto life, who, being in-grafted into the
body of Christ by faith, do receive the earnest and pledge of their adoption in
Christ. Whence we do also gather what force the preaching of the gospel hath of
itself. For it doth not find faith in men, save only because God doth call those
inwardly whom he hath chosen, and because he draweth those who were his own
before unto Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430637&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
6:37.) Also Luke teacheth in the same words, that it cannot be that any of the
elect should perish. For he saith not that one or a few of the elect did
believe, but so many as were elect. For though God&#8217;s election
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F847</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
be unknown to us until we perceive it by faith, yet is it not doubtful or in
suspense in his secret counsel; because he commendeth all those whom he counteth
his to the safeguard and tuition of his Son, who will continue a faithful keeper
even unto the end. Both members are necessary to be known. When election is
placed above faith, there is no cause why men should challenge to themselves any
thing in any part of their salvation. For if faith, wherein consisteth
salvation, which is unto us a witness of the free adoption of God, which
coupleth us to Christ, and maketh his life ours, whereby we possess God with his
righteousness, and, finally, whereby we receive the grace of sanctification, be
grounded without us in the eternal counsel of God; what good things so ever we
have, we must needs acknowledge that we have received it of the grace of God,
which doth prevent us of its own accord. Again, because many entangle themselves
in doubtful and thorny imaginations, whilst that they seek for their salvation
in the hidden counsel of God, let us learn that the election of God is therefore
approved by faith, that our minds may be turned unto Christ as unto the pledge
of election, and that they may seek no other certainty save that which is
revealed to us in the gospel; I say, let this seal suffice us,
that</font><br></div>

of the gospel; wherein appeareth how true the parable of Christ is, when he
saith that it is like to leaven,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421321&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
13:21.) We heard before that there was great concourse of people, so that the
seed of true doctrine was sown throughout the whole city. Luke saith now that it
was spread farther, to wit, throughout the whole country.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>50.</b> Nevertheless, he declareth that that was
done not without great pains and trouble. Therefore, the beginning of the
calling of the Gentiles was joyful and prosperous, neither could Satan hinder
the course of the grace of God; but in the mean season, it stood Paul and
Barnabas upon (whom God had brought forth into the field
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F849</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)
to strive. And we must mark what Luke saith, that the religious and honest
women, together with the chief men of the city, were enforced to persecute the
servants of Christ. For this was no small offense to the rude, and those who
were as yet scarce begotten in Christ, when they saw all those men and women
which were of any account or estimation set against Christ, and also whatsoever
was praise-worthy according to men. A great multitude of men received Christ,
but it was but the multitude and the offscourings of men. Against them were set
the chief men of the city, who with their pomp did easily oppress the base and
obscure multitude. That might also cause doctrine to be suspected, yea, to be
hated, in that godly and honest matrons to look to were enemies to it. If
wicked, ungodly, and mischievous men should have issued out of their taverns and
dens; if companies of whores should break out of their brothel-house, it should
be no reproach to the gospel; yea, rather the dignity thereof should thereby
appear more plainly; but now, what may the weak think with themselves, but that
the doctrine which hath such adversaries is not of God? Therefore it was
expedient that not only the faithful, who were as yet weak, should be confirmed
by the Lord, lest their faith should fall, but also that the hand should be
reached out to Paul and Barnabas, lest, being discouraged, they should leave
off.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And by this example the Lord meant to teach us that
we must valiantly resist such lets;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F850</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and that we must beware lest the vain visors of virtue
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F851</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
do blind our eyes, so that we cannot see the glory of Christ which shineth in
the gospel. For it is certain that all that virtue and honesty which is in men
is mere hypocrisy where they set themselves against. Christ; though it may be
that those who are rashly carried against Christ for a time may afterwards
repent. Notwithstanding, we must thus think with ourselves, that whatsoever fair
show of holiness those bear who resist the gospel, they are neither endued with
the perfect fear of God, neither are they any thing else but a vain shadow, how
greatly soever they boast of their virtue. Neither is it without cause that
Christ hath this title given him, that he revealeth the cogitations of many
hearts,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420235&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
2:35.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Religious.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>And what manner [of] religion could that be where there was no reverence of
the Word of God? We must note that there be four kinds of men: as there be few
which worship God sincerely and from the heart, so there be few who openly
profess the manifest and gross contempt of him. These be two sorts. And the more
part is neither quite without religion, neither is it altogether void of the
common worship of God; but yet, notwithstanding, whilst they do coldly, and, as
it were, overfields
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F852</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
play with God, if they be thoroughly examined they be but profane; like as, at
this day, the ungodliness of many is after a sort shrouded under ceremonies, and
the reigned profession of the worship of God. So that in all ages there have
been certain worshippers of God who have worshipped him like stage-players,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F853</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
whose holiness did wholly consist in gestures and vain pomps. In Paul&#8217;s
time, even as at this day, a peculiar study of godliness was to be found in a
few, whose religion, though it were impure, and their heart reigned, deceitful,
and double, yet are they counted after a sort religious, in respect of their
zeal. But hereby appeareth what account we may make of bare religion, which
driveth headlong, through unadvised heat, the professors thereof, to resist the
kingdom of God, and to oppress his glory. Furthermore, it is to be thought that
though these matrons had not altogether given their name to Judaism, neither had
they been nousled
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F854</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in the doctrine of the law, yet were they half Jewesses, and that was the cause
that they did so willingly take upon them the defense of the nation. For thus
are women led about captive, being laden with sins, as Paul
witnesseth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>51.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
When they had shaken of the dust of their
feet.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We may also gather, even by the
commandment of Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:14;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420905&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
9:5; 10:11,) that this was a token of cursing among the Jews. For it is not to
be thought that Christ meant to have his [disciples] use an unknown sign,
forasmuch as it was his purpose to terrify the gross and professed condemners of
his doctrine. Furthermore, he meant by this means to declare that God doth so
detest the wicked, that we must take meat heed that we have no fellowship with
them, lest we be infected with their uncleanness. All the wicked are said,
indeed, to pollute the ground whereon they tread; but the Lord did never command
that any, save only the condemners of his word, should be so rejected with such
execration. If any adulterer or whoremonger, if any perjured person, if any
drunkard,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F855</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
were to be excommunicate, this sign was not used. Therefore, it appeareth how
intolerable the contempt of the word of God is in his sight; because, when as he
commandeth that the dust of the feet be shaken off, it is as much as if he
should pronounce that they are the bond-slaves of Satan, men past hope, and
worthy to be banished
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">F856</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
from off the earth. Wherefore, let this so great;, severity teach us to
reverence the gospel. Also the ministers of the word are taught with how great
ferventness of zeal they must maintain the majesty of the word, that they do not
coldly dissemble and wink at the contempt thereof.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>52.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
The disciples were filled with joy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This
member may be expounded two manner of ways; That they were filled with joy and
the Spirit, by <i>hypallage, </i>thus, With joy of the Spirit, or (which is all
one) with spiritual joy; because there is no quietness, peace, or joy of
conscience, but it cometh of the Spirit of God, in which respect Paul saith that
the kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Spirit,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:17;) or that the word </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit
</i></font><font face="Palatino">may contain under it other virtues and gifts.
Yet this pleaseth me better, that they were filled with joy; because the grace
of the Holy Spirit reigned in them, which alone doth so make us glad, truly and
perfectly, that we are carried up above the whole world. For we must mark
Luke&#8217;s drift, that the faithful were so far from being troubled and shaken
with those stumbling-blocks, how great soever they were, with the reproach of
their teachers, with the disquieting of the city, with terrors and threatenings,
also with fear and dangers hanging over their heads, that they did with the
loftiness of their faith despise valiantly the gorgeousness, as well of their
reigned holiness as of their power. And assuredly, if our faith shall be well
grounded in God, and shall be thoroughly rooted in his word; and, finally,
if&#8217; it shall be well fortified with the aid of the Spirit as it, ought,
it; shall nourish peace and joy spiritual in our minds, though all the world be
in an
uproar.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">FOOTNOTES</font><br></div>
