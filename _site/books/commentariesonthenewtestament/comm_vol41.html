PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The extraordinary ability and skill displayed by
CALVIN, in his COMMENTARIES on the Inspired Writings, have been set forth by
almost all the Translators of this Series. I have always thought, and am happy
to have the support of his latest Editor, Dr. Tholuck, that he is more
successful in expounding the EPISTLES OF PAUL than in any other portion of
Scripture. This might arise in part from having studied them with uncommon ardor
and perseverance. The times in which he lived held out strong inducements to
examine the great peculiarities of the Christian Faith. And where were these so
likely to be found as in the writings of an Apostle whom the Spirit of God
employed, more than all the others, in unfolding to the Church &#8220;the
unsearchable riches of Christ?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How far that success might be promoted by the
resemblance of character which an able and eloquent writer 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> asserts
to have existed between the great Apostle and the Reformer, I leave
undetermined. But the chief cause unquestionably lay in his singularly clear
perception of that scheme of doctrine which Paul was honored to declare. This
enabled him to penetrate the design of the Apostle, and to follow closely the
course of his argument. In discussions of the greatest intricacy he seldom loses
his way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Various authors, who cannot be named without
awakening gratitude, and to whom it would be impossible to do justice in this
brief sketch, have supplied the materials of valuable NOTES to this volume. From
their pages it would have been easy to select many a warm tribute to the GENEVAN
REFORMER, to whom they were deeply indebted, and whose writings were consulted
by them with acknowledged deference. The greatest lights of our age have not
superseded the labors of CALVIN, and ablest divines vie with each other in doing
homage to his great sagacity as an interpreter of the Holy
Scriptures.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To my younger brethren in the ministry may I take the
liberty of recommending these COMMENTARIES as an excellent model for expounding
the inspired Epistles? The frequent mention of Popery does not lessen the value
of this recommendation. How far it may be necessary, at all times, to fortify
our hearers against the attacks of the &#8220;man of sin,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;530203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 2:3,) I do not now stay to inquire. But as a skillful, natural,
and impressive application of divine truth to the controversies of the day, the
warnings against Popery deserve careful study. They are appropriately
introduced, and serve to illustrate more fully the mind of the
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In describing them as models, it may be proper to
mention that they are strictly what their title bears, Commentaries,
unaccompanied by those illustrations which, in public instruction, are
indispensably necessary. To devout minds they will have many attractions. They
are imbued with the ardent piety and that copious use of the language of
Scripture by which all the writings of CALVIN are so eminently
distinguished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b><i>ACHTEBARDER,</i></b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b><i>6<sup>th</sup>
September 1854.</i></b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS
PRINCE</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHRISTOPER,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>DUKE OF WIRTEMBERG, EARL OF
MONTEBELIARD, ETC.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THOUGH personally unknown to you, most illustrious
Prince, I venture unhesitatingly 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to
dedicate to you one of my productions. It may be thought that so bold a step
will be censured by some persons as rash, and therefore demands an apology.
Nothing is more easy. A few words shall suffice. My motives to address you are
chiefly two.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">You have hitherto, indeed, pursued the right course
with great spirit and energy. Yet I thought that it might not be altogether
unnecessary to excite you, by a direct appeal, to the perusal of a work not a
little fitted to strengthen your resolutions. One advantage you possess, in the
kind providence of God, above most princes of the present day. Having enjoyed an
early and liberal education in the Latin language, you are enabled to employ
your leisure in reading profitable and religious books. If ever there was a time
when the consolations derived from religious instruction were necessary, what
other resource is left to the most heroic minds by the present distress of the
Church, and by greater and heavier distresses which appear to be approaching?
Whoever, therefore, wishes to remain unmoved to the last, let him rely entirely
on this support; whoever desires to have a sure protection, let him learn to
betake himself to this refuge. Besides, in these four EPISTLES,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa3</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of which
I now present to you my EXPOSITIONS, you will find, noble Prince, many subjects
of consolation exceedingly adapted to the present times; but to which I do not
now more particularly refer, because they will occur to yourself with much
better effect in their own places.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I come now to my second reason for dedicating to you
this work. During the present confusion of affairs, while some are shaken, and
others are entirely thrown down, you have preserved an astonishing composure and
moderation, accompanied by a remarkable steadfastness, amidst all the storms
which have arisen. I consider, therefore, that it is highly advantageous to the
whole Church, to hold out in you, as in a bright mirror, an example which all
may imitate. For, while the Son of God enjoins on all his followers, without
exception, that they shall choose rather to fight under the banner of his cross
than to triumph with the world, yet very few are found who are ready to engage
in that kind of warfare. It is the more necessary that all should be stimulated
and taught, by such uncommon examples as yours, to correct their
effeminacy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Of my COMMENTARIES I shall only say, that they
perhaps contain more than it would become me to acknowledge. On this point,
however, I wish you to read and judge for yourself. Farewell, most illustrious
Prince. May the Lord Jesus long preserve you for himself and his Church, and
guide you by HIS SPIRIT!</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">THE ARGUMENT</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>OF</b></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE EPISTLE OF
PAUL TO THE GALATIANS.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What part of Asia was inhabited by the GALATIANS, and
what were the boundaries of their country, is well known; but whence they
originally came 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is not
agreed among historians. It is universally admitted that they were Gauls, and,
on that account, were denominated Gallo-Grecians. But from what part of Gaul
they came it is more difficult to determine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Strabo thought that the Tectosages came from Gallia
Narbonensis, and that the remainder were Celtae;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and this
opinion has been generally adopted. But, as Pliny enumerates the Ambiani 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> among
the Tectosagi, and as it is universally agreed that they were allied to the
Tolistobogi, who dwelt on the banks of the Rhine, I think it more probable that,
they were Belgians, whose territory extended from a very distant part of the
course of the Rhine to the English Channel. The Tolistobogi inhabited that part
which receives from its present inhabitants the names of Cleves and
Brabant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The mistake originated, I think, in this way. A band
of Tectosagi, who had made all irruption into Gallia Narbonensis, retained their
own name, and gave it to the country which they had conquered. This is intimated
by Ausonius, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa7</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who
says, &#8220;As far as the Teutosagi, whose original name was Belgians;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for he
calls them Belgians, and says that they were first called Teutosagi, and
afterwards Tectosagi. Caesar, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> indeed,
places the Tectosagi in the Hercynian 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> forest;
but I consider this to have been in consequence of their emigration, which
indeed appears from that very passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But more than enough has now been said as to the
origin of the nation, so far as relates to the present passage. Pliny informs us
that the GALATIANS, who inhabited that part of Asia to which they gave their
name, were divided into three chief nations, Tectosagi, Tolistobogi, and Trocmi,
and accordingly occupied three chief cities. So great was the power which they
at one time swayed over their unwarlike neighbors, that they received tribute
from a great part of Lesser Asia. Losing at length their ancient valor, and
giving themselves up to pleasure and luxury, they were vanquished in war and
subdued, with little difficulty, by Cneius Manlius, a Roman
consul.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the time of the Apostle Paul they were under the
dominion of the Romans. He had purely and faithfully instructed them in the
Gospel; but false apostles had entered, during his absence, and had corrupted
the true seed by false and erroneous doctrines. They taught that the observation
of ceremonies was still necessary. This might appear to be a trivial matter; but
Paul very properly contends as for a fundamental article of the Christian faith.
It is no small evil to quench the light of the Gospel, to lay a snare for
consciences, and to remove the distinction between the Old and New Testaments.
He perceived that these errors were also connected with a wicked and dangerous
opinion as to the manner in which justification is obtained. This is the reason
why he fights with so much earnestness and vehemence; and, having learned from
him the important and serious nature of the controversy, it is our duty to read
with greater attention.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">One who forms his views of the subject from the
Commentaries of Origen and Jerome, will be astonished that Paul should take so
deep an interest in external rites; but whoever goes to the fountain will
acknowledge that there was abundant reason for all this sharpness of reproof.
The GALATIANS had allowed themselves to be drawn aside from the right course by
excessive credulity, or rather by lightness and folly. He therefore censures
them more severely; for I do not agree with those who attribute the harshness of
his language to their slowness of apprehension. The EPHESIANS and COLOSSIANS had
been subjected to the same temptations. If they had lent as ready an ear to the
tale of the impostors, do we imagine that Paul would have treated them with
greater gentleness? This boldness of rebuke was not suggested by the disposition
of the people, but extorted by the baseness of their conduct.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having ascertained what was the design of writing the
EPISTLE, let us attend to the order in which it is treated. In the <i>first</i>
and <i>second </i>Chapters (Galatians 1 and Galatians 2) he maintains the
authority of his Apostleship, except that, towards the close of the second
chapter, he touches incidentally on his main point, the question of Man&#8217;s
Justification, which, however, is avowedly and directly argued in the
<i>third</i> Chapter, Galatians 3. Although he appears in those two Chapters to
have many objects in view, yet his sole object is to prove that He is equal to
the highest apostles, and that there is no reason why he should not be
considered to hold an equally honorable rank with any of them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is of importance to know why he labors so hard
in establishing his own claim to respect. Provided that Christ reigns, and that
the purity of doctrine remains uncontaminated, what matters it whether he is
higher or lower than Peter, or whether they are all on a footing of equality? If
all must &#8220;decrease,&#8221; that Christ alone may &#8220;increase,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430330&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:30,) it is idle to dispute about human ranks. Besides, it may be asked, why
does he draw a comparison between himself and other apostles? What dispute had
he with Peter, and James, and John? What good purpose did it serve to bring into
collision those who were united in sentiment, and in the closest
friendship?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I reply, the false apostles, who had deceived the
GALATIANS, endeavored to obtain favor by pretending that they had received a
commission from the Apostles. Their chief influence arose from insinuating the
belief that they represented the Apostles, and delivered their message. To PAUL,
on the other hand, they refused the name and authority of an Apostle. They
objected that he had not been chosen by our Lord as one of the Twelve; that he
had never been acknowledged as such by the college of the Apostles; that he did
not receive his doctrine from Christ, or even from the Apostles themselves. All
this tended not only to lower Paul&#8217;s authority, but to rank him with the
ordinary members of the Church, and therefore to place him far below those
persons who made these insinuations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If this had been merely a personal matter, it would
have given no uneasiness to PAUL to be reckoned an ordinary disciple. But when
he saw that his doctrine was beginning to lose its weight and authority, he was
not entitled to be silent. It became his duty to make a bold resistance. When
Satan does not venture openly to attack doctrine, his next stratagem is to
diminish its influence by indirect attacks. Let us remember, then, that in the
person of Paul the truth of the Gospel was assailed; for, if he had allowed
himself to be stripped of the honor of apostleship, it followed that he had
hitherto claimed what he had no title to enjoy; and this false boasting would
have made him liable to suspicion in other matters. The estimation in which his
doctrine was held depended on the question, whether it came, as some had begun
to think, from an ordinary disciple, or from an apostle of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He was overwhelmed, on the other hand, by the lustre
of great names. Those who referred, in a boastful manner, to PETER, and JAMES,
and JOHN, pretended to apostolical authority. If PAUL had not manfully resisted
this boasting, he would have given way to falsehood, and would have allowed the
truth of God 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to
suffer again in his own person. He therefore contends earnestly for both points:
that he was appointed by the Lord to be an apostle, and that he was in no
respect inferior to the rest, but enjoyed the same title, and was equal to them
in authority and rank. He might, indeed, have denied that those men were either
sent, or hold any commission from Peter and his associates. But he takes far
higher ground, that he does not yield to the Apostles themselves; and if he had
declined doing so, he would have been supposed to have distrusted his
cause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">JERUSALEM was, at that time, the Mother of all the
Churches; for the Gospel had spread from it over the whole world, and it might
be said to be the principal seat of the kingdom of Christ. Any one who came from
it into other churches was received with due respect. But many were foolishly
elated with the thought that they had enjoyed the friendship of the Apostles, or
at least had been taught in their school; and therefore nothing pleased them but
what they had seen at Jerusalem. Every custom that had not been practiced there
was not only disliked, but unsparingly condemned by them. This peevish manner
becomes highly pernicious, when the custom of a single church is attempted to be
enforced as a universal law. We are sometimes so devoted to an instructor or a
place, that, without exercising any judgment of our own, we make the opinion of
one man the standard for all men, and the customs of one place the standard for
every other place. Such attachment is ridiculous, if there be not always in it a
mixture of ambition; or rather we should say, excessive peevishness is always
ambitious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To return to those false apostles, if they had only
attempted, through wicked contention, to establish everywhere the use of those
ceremonies, which they had seen observed at Jerusalem, that would have been no
slight offense; for, when a custom is forthwith converted into a law, injustice
is perpetrated. But a more serious evil was involved in the wicked and dangerous
doctrine, which held consciences to be bound to them by religious
considerations, which made justification to depend on the observation of them.
Such were the reasons why PAUL defended his Apostleship with so much
earnestness, and why he contrasted himself with the rest of the
Apostles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He pursues this subject to the end of the
<i>second</i> Chapter, Galatians 2, when he proceeds to argue the doctrine, that
we are justified in the sight of God by Free Grace, and not by the Works of the
Law. His argument is this: If Ceremonies have not the power of bestowing
Justification, the observation of them is therefore unnecessary. We must remark,
however, that he does not confine himself entirely to Ceremonies, but argues
generally about Works, otherwise the whole discussion would be
trifling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any person thinks that we are thus straining the
matter too far, let him attend to the two following reasons. First, the question
could not be settled without assuming the general principle, that we are
justified by the free grace of God; and this principle sets aside not only
ceremonies, but every other kind of works. Secondly, Paul did not attach so much
importance to Ceremonies as to the wicked doctrine of obtaining Salvation by
Works. Let it be observed, therefore, that Paul had good reasons for recurring
to first principles. It was necessary to go to the fountain, and to warn his
readers that the controversy related, not to some insignificant trifle, but to
the most important of all matters &#8212; the method of obtaining
salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is a mistake, therefore, to suppose that the
Apostle confined himself wholly to the special question about Ceremonies, a
subject which did not admit of being settled by itself. A similar instance
occurs in history.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:2.) Strife and contention had arisen out of the question, whether or not
Ceremonies were necessary to be observed. In the course of the discussion, the
Apostles dwell largely on the intolerable yoke of the Law, and on the
Forgiveness of Sins through Free Grace. What was the object of this? It appears
to be a foolish departure from the point in hand; but the contrary is the fact,
for a particular error cannot be satisfactorily refuted without assuming a
universal principle. As, for instance, if I am called to dispute about,
forbidding the use of flesh, I shall not speak merely about the different kinds
of food, but shall arm myself with the general doctrine: What authority have the
Traditions of men for binding the conscience? I shall quote the declaration,
that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;There is one
Lawgiver, who has power to save and to destroy.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;590412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">James
4:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, Paul here argues negatively from general to
particular propositions, which is the ordinary and most natural method of
reasoning. By what evidences and arguments he proves this principle, that we are
justified by the grace of God alone, we shall see when we come to the passage.
He pursues this topic till the end of the <i>third </i>Chapter, Galatians
3.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the commencement of the <i>fourth </i>Chapter,
Galatians 4, he inquires into the proper use of Ceremonies, and the reason why
they were appointed; shewing, at the same time, that they are now abolished. It
became necessary to meet this silly objection, which might occur to some minds.
What, then, was the purpose of Ceremonies? Were they useless? Were the Fathers
idly employed in observing them? He illustrates briefly two statements, that in
their own time they were not superfluous, and that they have now been abolished
by the coming of Christ, because He is the truth and end of them; and therefore
he shews that we must abide by Him. Glancing briefly at the difference between
our condition and that of the Fathers, he infers that the doctrine of the false
apostles is wicked and dangerous, because it darkens the clearness of the gospel
by ancient shadows. The Apostle&#8217;s doctrine is now intermingled with some
affecting exhortations. Towards the close of the Chapter his argument is
enlivened by a beautiful allegory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the <i>fifth</i> Chapter, Galatians 5, he exhorts
them to hold fast the Liberty which has been obtained by the blood of Christ,
that they may not surrender their consciences to be ensnared by the opinions of
men. But he reminds them, at the same time, in what manner Liberty may be
lawfully used. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He then
takes occasion to point out the proper employments of Christians, that they may
not uselessly spend their time in Ceremonies, and neglect matters of real
importance.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Paul, an
apostle</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the salutations with which he
commenced his Epistles, Paul was accustomed to claim the title of &#8220;an
Apostle.&#8221; His object in doing so, as we have remarked on former occasions,
was to employ the authority of his station, for the purpose of enforcing his
doctrine. This authority depends not on the judgment or opinion of men, but
exclusively on the calling of God; and therefore he demands a hearing on the
ground of his being &#8220;an Apostle.&#8221; Let us always bear this in mind,
that in the church we ought to listen to God alone, and to Jesus Christ, whom he
has appointed to be our teacher. Whoever assumes a right to instruct us, must
speak in the name of God or of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as the calling of Paul was more vehemently
disputed among the Galatians, he asserts it more strongly in his address to that
church, than in his other Epistles; for he does not simply affirm that he was
called by God, but states expressly that it was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not either from men or by
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This statement, be it observed, applies
not to the office which he held in common with other pastors, but to the
apostleship. The authors of the calumnies which he has in his eye did not
venture to deprive him altogether of the honor of the Christian ministry. They
merely refused to allow him the name and rank of an apostle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are now speaking of the apostleship in the
strictest sense; for the word is employed in two different ways. Sometimes, it
denotes preachers of the Gospel, to whatever class they might belong; but here
it bears a distinct reference to the highest rank in the church; so that Paul is
equal to Peter and to the other twelve.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The first clause, that he was called <i>not from
men</i>, he had in common with all the true ministers of Christ. As no man ought
to &#8220;take this honor unto himself,&#8221; (Hebrews 5:4,) so it is not in
the power of men to bestow it on whomsoever they choose. It belongs to God alone
to govern his church; and therefore the calling cannot be lawful, unless it
proceed from Him. So far as the church is concerned, a man who has been led to
the ministry, not by a good conscience, but by ungodly motives, may happen to be
regularly called. But Paul is here speaking of a call ascertained in so perfect,
a manner, that nothing farther can be desired.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It will, perhaps, be objected &#8212; Do not the
false apostles frequently indulge in the same kind of boasting? I admit they do,
and in a more haughty and disdainful style than the servants of the Lord venture
to employ; but they want that actual call from Heaven to which Paul was entitled
to lay claim.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The second clause, that he was called <i>not by
man</i>, belonged in a peculiar manner to the apostles; for in an ordinary
pastor, this would have implied nothing wrong. Paul himself, when travelling
through various cities in company with Barnabas, &#8220;ordained elders in every
church,&#8221; by the votes of the people,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441423&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
14:23;) and he enjoins Titus and Timothy to proceed in the same work.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 5:17
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;560105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:5.) Such is the ordinary method of electing pastors; for we are not entitled
to wait until God shall reveal from heaven the names of the persons whom he has
chosen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if human agency was not improper, if it was even
commendable, why does Paul disclaim it in reference to himself? I have already
mentioned that something more was necessary to be proved than that Paul was a
pastor, or that he belonged to the number of the ministers of the Gospel; for
the point in dispute was the apostleship. It was necessary that the apostles
should be elected, not in the same manner as other pastors, but by the direct
agency of the Lord himself. Thus, Christ himself
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:1) called the Twelve; and when a successor was to be appointed in the room of
Judas, the church does not venture to choose one by votes, but has recourse to
<i>lot</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440126&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
1:26.) We are certain that the lot was not employed in electing pastors. Why was
it resorted to in the election of Matthias? To mark the express agency of God
for it was proper that the apostles should be distinguished from other
ministers. And thus Paul, in order to shew that he does not belong to the
ordinary rank of ministers, contends that his calling proceeded immediately from
God.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa13</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But how does Paul affirm that he was <i>not</i>
called <i>by men</i>, while Luke records that Paul and Barnabas were called by
the church at Antioch? Some have replied, that he had previously discharged the
duties of an apostle, and that, consequently, his apostleship was not founded on
his appointment by that church. But here, again, it may be objected, that this
was his first designation to be the apostle of the Gentiles, to which class the
Galatians belonged. The more correct, and obvious reply is, that he did not
intend here to set aside entirely the calling of that church, but merely to shew
that his apostleship rests on a higher title. This is true; for even those who
laid their hands on Paul at Antioch did so, not of their own accord, but in
obedience to express revelation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;As they ministered to the Lord,
and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work
whereunto I have called them. And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid
their hands on them, they sent them away.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Acts
13:2,3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since, therefore, he was called by Divine revelation,
and was also appointed and declared by the Holy Spirit to be the apostle of the
Gentiles, it follows, that he was not brought forward <i>by men</i>, although
the customary rite of ordination was afterwards added. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa14</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It will, perhaps, be thought that an indirect
contrast between Paul and the false apostles is here intended. I have no
objection to that view; for they were in the habit of glorying in the name of
men. His meaning will therefore stand thus: &#8220;Whoever may be the persons by
whom others boast that they have been sent, I shall be superior to them; for I
hold my commission from God and Christ.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By Jesus Christ and God the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He asserts that God the Father and
Christ had bestowed on him his apostleship. Christ is first named, because it is
his prerogative to send, and because we are his ambassadors. But to make the
statement more complete, the Father is also mentioned; as if he had said,
&#8220;If there be any one whom the name of Christ is not sufficient to inspire
with reverence, let him know that I have also received my office from God the
Father.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who raised him from the
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The resurrection of Christ is the
commencement of his reign, and is therefore closely connected with the present
subject. It was a reproach brought by them against Paul that he had held no
communication with Christ, while he was on the earth. He argues, on the other
hand, that, as Christ was glorified by his resurrection, so he has actually
exercised his authority in the government of his church. The calling of Paul is
therefore more illustrious than it would have been, if Christ, while still a
mortal, had ordained him to the office. And this circumstance deserves
attention; for Paul intimates that the attempt to set aside his authority,
involved a malignant opposition to the astonishing power of God, which was
displayed in the resurrection of Christ; because the same heavenly Father, who
raised Christ from the dead, commanded Paul to make known that exertion of his
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And all the brethren who are with
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. &#8212; He appears to have usually written
in the name of many persons, judging that, if those to whom he wrote should
attach less weight to a solitary individual, they might listen to a greater
number, and would not despise a whole congregation. His general practice is, to
insert the salutations from brethren at the conclusion, instead of introducing
them at the commencement as joint authors of the epistle: at least, he never
mentions more than two names, and those very well known. But here he includes
all the brethren; and thus adopts, though not without good reason, an opposite
method. The concurrence of so many godly persons must have had some degree of
influence in softening the minds of the Galatians, and preparing them to receive
instruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the churches of
Galatia</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was an extensive country, and
therefore contained many churches scattered through it. But is it not wonderful
that the term &#8220;Church&#8221;, which always implies unity of faith, should
have been applied to the Galatians, who had almost entirely revolted from
Christ? I reply, so long as they professed Christianity, worshipped one God,
observed the sacraments, and enjoyed some kind of Gospel ministry, they retained
the external marks of a church. We do not always find in churches such a measure
of purity as might be desired. The purest have their blemishes; and some are
marked, not by a few spots, but by general deformity. Though the doctrines and
practices of any society may not, in all respects, meet our wishes, we must not
instantly pronounce its defects to be a sufficient reason for withholding from
it the appellation of a Church. Paul manifests here a gentleness of disposition
utterly at variance with such a course. Yet our acknowledgment of societies to
be churches of Christ must be accompanied by an explicit condemnation of
everything in them that is improper or defective; for we must not imagine, that,
wherever there is some kind of church, everything in it that ought to be desired
in a church is perfect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I make this observation, because the Papists, seizing
on the single word <i>Church</i>, think that whatever they choose to force upon
us is sanctioned; though the condition and aspect of the Church of Rome are
widely different from what existed in Galatia. If Paul were alive at the present
day, he would perceive the miserable and dreadfully shattered remains of a
church; but he would perceive no building. In short, the word Church is often
applied by a figure of speech in which a part is taken for the whole, to any
portion of the church, even though it may not fully answer to the
name.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Grace be to you and
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This form of salutation, which occurred
in the other epistles, has received an explanation, to which I still adhere.
Paul wishes for the Galatians a state of friendship with God, and, along with
it, all good things; for the favor of God is the source from which we derive
every kind of prosperity. He presents both petitions to Christ, as well as to
the Father; because without Christ neither grace, nor any real prosperity, can
be obtained.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who gave himself for our
sins</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He begins with commending the grace of
Christ, in order to recall and fix on Him the attention of the Galatians; for,
if they had justly appreciated this benefit of redemption, they would never have
fallen into opposite views of religion. He who knows Christ in a proper manner
beholds him earnestly, embraces him with the warmest affection, is absorbed in
the contemplation of him, and desires no other object. The best remedy for
purifying our minds from any kind of errors or superstitions, is to keep in
remembrance our relation to Christ, and the benefits which he has conferred upon
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who gave himself for our
sins</i></font><font face="Palatino">, were intended to convey to the Galatians
a doctrine of vast importance; that no other satisfactions can lawfully be
brought into comparison with that sacrifice of himself which Christ offered to
the Father; that in Christ, therefore, and in him alone, atonement for sin, and
perfect righteousness, must be sought; and that the manner in which we are
redeemed by him ought to excite our highest admiration. What Paul here ascribes
to Christ is, with equal propriety, ascribed in other parts of Scripture to God
the Father; for, on the one hand, the Father, by an eternal purpose, decreed
this atonement, and gave this proof of his love to us, that he &#8220;spared not
his only-begotten Son,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450832&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:32,) but delivered him up for us all;&#8221; and Christ, on the other hand,
offered himself a sacrifice in order to reconcile us to God. Hence it follows,
that his death is the satisfaction for sins. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa15</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he might deliver
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He likewise declares the design of our
redemption to be, that Christ, by his death, might purchase us to be his own
property. This takes place when we are separated from the world; for so long as
we are of the world, we do not belong to Christ. The word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aiw&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>age</i>,) is here put for the corruption which is in the world; in the same
manner as in the first Epistle of John,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 5:19) where it is said that &#8220;the whole world lieth in the wicked
one,&#8221; and in his Gospel,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
17:15,) where the Savior says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I pray not that
thou shouldst take them out of the
world,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">but that thou shouldst keep
them from the evil;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for there it signifies the present
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What then is meant by the word &#8220;World&#8221; in
this passage? Men separated from the kingdom of God and the grace of Christ. So
long as a man lives to himself, he is altogether condemned. The World is,
therefore, contrasted with regeneration, as nature with grace, or the flesh with
the spirit. Those who are born of the world have nothing but sin and wickedness,
not by creation, but by
corruption.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa16</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Christ, therefore, died for our sins, in order to redeem or separate us from the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From the present wicked
age.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By adding the epithet
&#8220;wicked&#8221;, he intended to shew that he is speaking of the corruption
or depravity which proceeds from sin, and not of God&#8217;s creatures, or of
the bodily life. And yet by this single word, as by a thunderbolt, he lays low
all human pride; for he declares, that, apart from that renewal of the nature
which is bestowed by the grace of Christ, there is nothing in us but unmixed
wickedness. We are of the world; and, till Christ take us out of it, the world
reigns in us, and we live to the world. Whatever delight men may take in their
fancied excellence, they are worthless and depraved; not indeed in their own
opinion, but in the judgment of our Lord, which is here pronounced by the mouth
of Paul, and which ought to satisfy our minds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the
will</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He points out the original fountain of
grace, namely, the purpose of God;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;for God so loved
the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
3:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it deserves notice, that Paul is accustomed to
represent the decree of God as setting aside all compensation or merit on the
part of men, and so <i>Will</i> denotes here what is commonly called &#8220;good
pleasure.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
meaning is, that Christ suffered for us, not because we were worthy, or because
anything done by us moved him to the act, but because such was the purpose of
God. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of God and our
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is of the same import as if he had said,
&#8220;Of God who is our Father.&#8221;

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To whom be
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this sudden exclamation of
thanksgiving, he intends to awaken powerfully in his readers the contemplation
of that invaluable gift which they had received from God, and in this manner to
prepare their minds more fully for receiving instruction. It must at the same
time be viewed as a general exhortation. Every instance in which the mercy of
God occurs to our remembrance, ought to be embraced by us as an occasion of
ascribing glory to God.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino">He commences by administering a rebuke, though
a somewhat milder one than they deserved; but his greatest severity of language
is directed, as we shall see, against the false apostles. He charges them with
turning aside, not only from his gospel, but from Christ; for it was impossible
for them to retain their attachment to Christ, without acknowledging that he has
graciously delivered us from the bondage of the law. But such a belief cannot be
reconciled with those notions respecting the obligation of ceremonial observance
which the false apostles inculcated. They were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>removed
from</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Christ; not that they entirely rejected
Christianity, but that the corruption of their doctrines was such as to leave
them nothing more than an imaginary Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus, in our own times, the Papists, choosing to have
a divided and mangled Christ, have none, and are therefore &#8220;removed from
Christ.&#8221; They are full of superstitions, which are directly at variance
with the nature of Christ. Let it be carefully observed, that we are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>removed from
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, when we fall into those views which are
inconsistent with his mediatorial office; for light can have no fellowship with
darkness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the same principle, he calls it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>another
gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, a gospel different from the
true one. And yet the false apostles professed that they preached the gospel of
Christ; but, mingling with it their own inventions, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by
which its principal efficacy was destroyed, they held a false, corrupt, and
spurious gospel. By using the present tense, (&#8220;ye are removed&#8221;) he
appears to say that they were only in the <i>act</i> of failing. As if he had
said, &#8220;I do not yet say that ye have been removed; for then it would be
more difficult to return to the right path. But now, at the critical moment, do
not advance a single step, but instantly retreat.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From Christ, who called you by
grace.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Others read it, &#8220;from him who
called you by the grace of Christ,&#8221; understanding it to refer to the
Father; but the reading which we have followed is more simple. When he says that
they were called by Christ through grace, this tends to heighten the criminality
of their ingratitude. To revolt from the Son of God under any circumstances, is
unworthy and disgraceful; but to revolt from him, after being invited to partake
salvation by grace, is more eminently base. His goodness to us renders our
ingratitude to him more dreadfully heinous.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>soon</i></font><font face="Palatino">
they had discovered a want of steadfastness, their guilt is still further
heightened. A proper season, indeed, for departing from Christ cannot be
imagined. But the fact, that no sooner had Paul left them than the Galatians
were led away from the truth, inferred still deeper blame. As the consideration
of the grace by which they had been called was adduced to aggravate their
ingratitude, so the circumstance of the time when they were removed is now
adduced to aggravate their levity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa20</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Some
explain it thus, &#8220;though there is not another gospel;&#8221; as if it were
a sort of correction of the Apostle&#8217;s language, to guard against the
supposition that there were more gospels than one. So far as the explanation of
the words is concerned, I take a more simple view of them; for he speaks
contemptuously of the doctrine of the false apostles, as being nothing else than
a mass of confusion and destruction. As if he had said, &#8220;What do those
persons allege? On what grounds do they attack the doctrine which I have
delivered? They merely trouble you, and subvert the gospel. They do nothing
more.&#8221; But it amounts to the same meaning; for this, too, I acknowledge,
is a correction of the language he had used about
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>another
gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He declares that it is not a gospel,
but a mere disturbance. All I intended to say was, that, in my opinion, the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>another</i></font><font face="Palatino">
means </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>another
thing</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It resembles strongly the expression in

deceive.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And wish to
pervert.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He charges them with the additional
crime of doing an injury to Christ, by endeavoring to subvert his gospel.
Subversion is an enormous crime. It is worse than corruption. And with good
reason does he fasten on them this charge. When the glow of justification is
ascribed to another, and a snare is laid for the consciences of men, the Savior
no longer occupies his place, and the doctrine of the gospel is utterly
ruined.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The gospel of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. To know what are the leading points of
the gospel, is a matter of unceasing importance. When these are attacked, the
gospel is destroyed. When he adds the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, this may be explained in two ways;
either that it has come from Christ as its author, or that it purely exhibits
Christ. The apostle&#8217;s reason for employing that expression unquestionably
was to describe the true and genuine gospel, which alone is worthy of the
name.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But though
we</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As he proceeds in defending the authority
of his doctrine, his confidence swells. First of all, he declares that the
doctrine which he had preached is the only gospel, and that the attempt to set
it aside is highly criminal. But then he was aware, the false apostles might
object: &#8220;We will not yield to you in our desire to maintain the gospel, or
in those feelings of respect for it which we are accustomed to cherish.&#8221;
Just as, at the present day, the Papists describe in the strongest terms the
sacredness with which they regard the gospel, and kiss the very name with the
deepest reverence, and yet, when brought to the trial, are found to persecute
fiercely the pure and simple doctrine of the gospel. Accordingly, Paul does not
rest satisfied with this general declaration, but proceeds to define what the
gospel is, and what it contains, and declares boldly that his doctrine is the
true gospel; so as to resist all further inquiry.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Of what avail was it to profess respect for the
gospel, and not to know what it meant? With Papists, who hold themselves bound
to render <i>implicit faith</i>, that might be perfectly sufficient; but with
Christians, where there is no knowledge, there is no faith. That the Galatians,
who were otherwise disposed to obey the gospel, might not wander hither and
thither, and &#8220;find no rest for the sole of their foot,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010809&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
8:9,) Paul enjoins them to stand steadfastly by his doctrine. He demands such
unhesitating belief of his preaching, that he pronounces a curse on all who
dared to contradict it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And here it is not a little remarkable, that he
begins with himself; for thus he anticipates a slander with which his enemies
would have loaded him. &#8220;You wish to have everything which comes from you
received without hesitation, because it is your own.&#8221; To show that there
is no foundation for such a statement, he instantly surrenders the right of
advancing anything against his own doctrine. He claims no superiority, in this
respect, over other men, but justly demands from all, equally with himself,
subjection to the word of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Or an angel from
heaven.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In order to destroy more completely the
pretensions of the false apostles, he rises so high as to speak of angels; and,
on the supposition that they taught a different doctrine, he does not satisfy
himself with saying that they were not entitled to be heard, but declares that
they ought to be held accursed. Some may think, that it was absurd to engage in
a controversy with angels about his doctrine; but a just view of the whole
matter will enable any one to perceive, that this part of the apostle&#8217;s
proceedings was proper and necessary. It is impossible, no doubt, for angels
from heaven to teach anything else than the certain truth of God. But when the
credit due to doctrines which God had revealed concerning the salvation of men
was the subject of controversy, he did not reckon it enough to disclaim the
judgment of men, without declining, at the same time, the authority of
angels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And thus, when he pronounces a curse on angels who
should teach any other doctrine 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> though
his argument is derived from an impossibility, it is not superfluous. This
exaggerated language must, have contributed greatly to strengthen the confidence
in Paul&#8217;s preaching. His opponents, by employing the lofty titles of men,
attempted to press hard on him and on his doctrine. He meets them by the bold
assertion, that even angels are unable to shake his authority. This is no
disparagement to angels. To promote the glory of God by every possible means was
the design of their creation. He who endeavors, in a pious manner, to accomplish
this object, by an apparently desrespectful mention of their name, detracts
nothing from their high rank. This language not only exhibits, in an impressive
manner, the majesty of the word of God, but yields, also, a powerful
confirmation to our faith while, in reliance on that word, we feel ourselves at
liberty to treat even angels with defiance and scorn. When he says, &#8220;let
him be accursed,&#8221; the meaning must be, &#8220;let him be held by you as
accursed.&#8221; In expounding 1 Corinthians 12:3, we had occasion to speak of
the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajna&gt;qema.</font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa22</font></sup><font face="Palatino">. Here
it denotes cursing, and answers to the Hebrew word,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;rh</font><font face="Palatino">
(hherem.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
As we said before</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Leaving out, in this
instance, the mention of himself and of angels, he repeats the former assertion,
that it is unlawful for any man to teach anything contrary to what they had
learned. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa23</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Observe
the expression &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye have
received</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for he uniformly insists, that they
must not regard the gospel as something unknown, existing in the air, or in
their own imaginations. He exhorts them to entertain a firm and serious
conviction, that the doctrine which they had received and embraced is the true
gospel of Christ. Nothing can be more inconsistent with the nature of faith than
a feeble, wavering assent. What, then, must be the consequence, if ignorance of
the nature and character of the gospel shall lead to hesitation? Accordingly he
enjoins them to regard as devils those who shall dare to bring forward a gospel
different from his, &#8212; meaning by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>another
gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino">, one to which the inventions of other
men are added; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for the
doctrine of the false apostles was not entirely contrary, or even different,
from that of Paul, but corrupted by false additions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To what poor subterfuges do the Papists resort, in
order to escape from the Apostle&#8217;s declaration! First, they tell us, that
we have not in our possession the whole of Paul&#8217;s preaching, and cannot
know what it contained, unless the Galatians who heard it shall be raised from
the dead, in order to appear as witnesses. Next, they assert, that it is not
every kind of addition which is forbidden, but that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>other
gospels</i></font><font face="Palatino"> only are condemned. What Paul&#8217;s
doctrine was, so far as it concerns us to know, may be learned with sufficient
clearness from his writings. Of this gospel, it is plain, the whole of Popery is
a dreadful perversion. And from the nature of the case, we remark in conclusion,
it is manifest that any spurious doctrine whatever is at variance with
Paul&#8217;s preaching; so that these cavils will avail them
nothing.</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">Having extolled so confidently his own preaching,
he now shows that this was no idle or empty boast. He supports his assertion by
two arguments. The first is, that he was not prompted by ambition, or flattery,
or any similar passion, to accommodate himself to the views of men. The second
and far stronger argument is, that he was not the author of the gospel, but
delivered faithfully what he had received from God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">10.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For do I now persuade according
to men or according to God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> The
ambiguity of the Greek construction in this passage, has given rise to a variety
of expositions. Some render it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do I now persuade men or
God?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Others
interpret the words &#8220;God&#8221; and &#8220;men,&#8221; as meaning divine
and human concerns. This sense would agree very well with the context, if it
were not too wide a departure from the words. The view which I have preferred is
more natural; for nothing is more common with the Greeks than to leave the
preposition
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kata&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>according to</i>, to be understood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul is speaking, not about the subject of his
preaching, but about the purpose of his own mind, which could not refer so
properly to men as to God. The disposition of the speaker, it must be owned, may
have some influence on his doctrine. As corruption of doctrine springs from
ambition, avarice, or any other sinful passion, so the truth is maintained in
its purity by an upright conscience. And so he contends that his doctrine is
sound, because it is not modified so as to gratify men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Or, do I seek to please
men?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This second clause differs not much, and
yet it differs somewhat from the former; for the desire of obtaining favor is
one motive for speaking &#8220;according to men.&#8221; When there reigns in our
hearts such ambition, that we desire to regulate our discourse so as to obtain
the favor of men, our instructions cannot be sincere. Paul therefore declares,
that he is in no degree chargeable with this vice; and, the more boldly to repel
the calumnious insinuation, he employs the interrogative form of speech; for
interrogations carry the greater weight, when our opponents are allowed an
opportunity of replying, if they have anything to say. This expresses the great
boldness which Paul derived from the testimony of a good conscience; for he knew
that he had discharged his duty in such a manner as not to be liable to any
reproach of that kind.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

Corinthians 1:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If I yet pleased
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This is a remarkable sentiment;
that ambitious persons, that is, those who hunt after the applause of men,
cannot serve Christ. He declares for himself, that he had freely renounced the
estimation of men, in order to devote himself entirely to the service of Christ;
and, in this respect, he contrasts his present position with that which he
occupied at a former period of life. He had been regarded with the highest
esteem, had received from every quarter loud applause; and, therefore, if he had
chosen to please men, he would not have found it necessary to change his
condition. But we may draw from it the general doctrine which I have stated,
that those who resolve to serve Christ faithfully, must have boldness to despise
the favor of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>men</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is here employed in a limited sense; for the ministers of Christ ought not to
labor for the express purpose of displeasing men. But there are various classes
of men. Those to whom Christ &#8220;is precious,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:7,) are men whom we should endeavor to please in Christ; while they who
choose that the true doctrine shall give place to their own passions, are men to
whom we must give no countenance. And godly, upright pastors, will always find
it necessary to contend with the offenses of those who choose that, on all
points, their own wishes shall be gratified; for the Church will always contain
hypocrites and wicked men, by whom their own lusts will be preferred to the word
of God. And even good men, either through ignorance, or through weak prejudice,
are sometimes tempted by the devil to be displeased with the faithful warnings
of their pastor. Our duty, therefore, is not to take alarm at any kind of
offenses, provided, at the same time, that we do not excite in weak minds a
prejudice against Christ himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Many interpret this passage in a different manner, as
implying an admission to the following effect: &#8220;If I pleased men,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>then I should not be the servant
of Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I own it, but who shall bring such a
charge against me? Who does not see that I do not court the favor of men?&#8221;
But I prefer the former view, that Paul is relating how large an amount of the
estimation of men he had relinquished, in order to devote himself to the service
of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now I make known to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the most powerful argument, the
main hinge on which the question turns, that he has not received the gospel from
men, but that it has been revealed to him by God. As this might be denied, he
offers a proof, drawn from a narrative of facts. To give his declaration the
greater weight, he sets out with stating that the matter is not doubtful, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa26</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but one
which he is prepared to prove; and thus introduces himself in a manner well
adapted to a serious subject. He affirms that it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not according to
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that it savours of nothing human, or, that
it was not of human contrivance; and in proof of this he afterwards adds, that
he had not been instructed by any earthly teacher.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa27</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I neither received it from
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What then? shall the authority of the word
be diminished, because one who has been instructed by the instrumentality of men
shall afterwards become a teacher? We must take into account, all along, the
weapons with which the false apostles attacked him, alleging that his gospel was
defective and spurious; that he had obtained it from an inferior and incompetent
teacher; and that his imperfect education led him to make unguarded statements.
They boasted, on the other hand, that they had been instructed by the highest
apostles, with whose views they were most intimately acquainted. It was
therefore necessary that Paul should state his doctrine in opposition to the
whole world, and should rest it on this ground, that he had acquired it not in
the school of any man, but by revelation from God. In no other way could he have
set aside the reproaches of the false apostles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The objection, that Ananias
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440910&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
9:10) was his teacher, may be easily answered. His divine instruction,
communicated to him by immediate inspiration, did not render it improper that a
man should be employed in teaching him, were it only to give weight to his
public ministry. In like manner, we have already shown, that he had a direct
call from God by revelation, and that he was ordained by the votes and the
solemn approbation of men. These statements are not inconsistent with each
other.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For ye have heard of my
conversation</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The whole of this narrative was
added as a part of his argument. He relates that, during his whole life, he had
such an abhorrence of the gospel, that he was a mortal enemy of it, and a
destroyer of the name of Christianity. Hence we infer that his conversion was
divine. And indeed he calls them as witnesses of a matter not at all doubtful,
so as to place beyond controversy what he is about to say.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">His
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>equals</i></font><font face="Palatino">
were those of his own age; for a comparison with older persons would have been
unsuitable. When he speaks of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
traditions of the fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means, not those
additions by which the law of God had been corrupted, but the law of God itself,
in which he had been educated from his childhood, and which he had received
through the hands of his parents and ancestors. Having been strongly attached to
the customs of his fathers, it would have been no easy matter to tear him from
them, had not the Lord drawn him by a miracle.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino">This is the second part of the narrative, and
relates to his miraculous conversion. He tells us, first, that he had been
called by the grace of God to preach Christ among the Gentiles; and, next, that
as soon as he had been called, without consulting the apostles, he
unhesitatingly proceeded to the performance of the work, which, he felt assured,
had been enjoined upon him by the appointment of God. In the construction of the
words, Erasmus differs from the Vulgate. He connects them in the following
manner: &#8220;When it pleased God that I should preach Christ among the
Gentiles, who called me for this purpose that he might reveal him <i>by
me</i>.&#8221; But I prefer the old translation; for Christ had been revealed to
Paul before he received a command to preach. Admitting that Erasmus were right
in translating </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn
ejmoi&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>by me</i>, still the clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that I might
preach</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is added for the purpose of describing
the kind of revelation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul&#8217;s reasoning does not, at first sight,
appear so strong; for although, when he had been converted to Christianity, he
instantly, and without consulting the apostles, entered into the office of
preaching the gospel, it does not thence follow that he had been appointed to
that office by the revelation of Christ. But the arguments which he employs are
various, and, when they are all collected, will be found sufficiently strong to
establish his conclusion. He argues, first, that he had been called by the grace
of God; next, that his apostleship had been acknowledged by the other apostles;
and the other arguments follow. Let the reader, therefore, remember to read the
whole narrative together, and to draw the inference, not from single parts, but
from the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who had separated
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This separation was the purpose of God, by
which Paul was appointed to the apostolic office, before he knew that he was
born. The calling followed afterwards at the proper time, when the Lord made
known his will concerning him, and commanded him to proceed to the work. God
had, no doubt, decreed, before the foundation of the world, what he would do
with regard to every one of us, and had assigned to every one, by his secret
counsel, his respective place. But the sacred writers frequently introduce those
three steps: the eternal predestination of God, the destination from the womb,
and the calling, which is the effect and accomplishment of
both.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah, though
expressed a little differently from this passage, has entirely the same
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Before I formed thee in the
belly, I knew thee; and before thou camest forth from the womb I sanctified
thee; a prophet to the nations have I made thee.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Jeremiah
1:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Before they even existed, Jeremiah had been set apart
to the office of a prophet, and Paul to that of an apostle; but he is said to
separate us from the womb, because the design of our being sent into the world
is, that he may accomplish, in us, what he has decreed. The calling is delayed
till its proper time, when God has prepared us for the office which he commands
us to undertake.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul&#8217;s words may therefore be read thus:
&#8220;When it pleased God to reveal his Son, by me, who called me, as he had
formerly separated me.&#8221; He intended to assert, that his calling depends on
the secret election of God; and that he was ordained an apostle, not because by
his own industry he had fitted himself for undertaking so high an office, or
because God had accounted him worthy of having it bestowed upon him, but
because, before he was born, he had been set apart by the secret purpose of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus, in his usual manner, he traces his calling to
the good pleasure of God. This deserves our careful attention; for it shows us
that we owe it to the goodness of God, not only that we have been elected and
adopted to everlasting life, but that he deigns to make use of our services, who
would otherwise have been altogether useless, and that he assigns to us a lawful
calling, in which we may be employed. What had Paul, before he was born, to
entitle him to so high an honor? In like manner we ought to believe, that it is
entirely the gift of God, and not obtained by our own industry, that we have
been called to govern the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The subtle distinctions into which some commentators
have entered in explaining the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>separated</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
are altogether foreign to the subject. God is said to <i>separate</i> us, not
because he bestows any peculiar disposition of mind which distinguishes us from
others, but because he appoints us by his own
purpose</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa28</font></sup><font face="Palatino">.
Although the apostle had most explicitly attributed his calling to the free
grace of God, when he pronounced that voluntary separation from the womb to be
the origin of it, yet he repeats the direct statement, both that, by his
commendation of Divine grace, he may take away all grounds of boasting, and that
he may testify his own gratitude to God. On this subject he is wont freely to
expatiate, even when he has no controversy with the false
apostles.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To reveal his Son to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. If we read it, &#8220;to reveal <i>by</i>
<i>me</i>,&#8221; it will express the design of the apostleship, which is to
make Christ known. And how was this to be accomplished? By preaching him among
the Gentiles, which the false apostles treated as a crime. But I consider the
Greek phrase </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn
emoi&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa29</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to be a
Hebrew idiom for <i>to me</i>; for the Hebrew particle
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">
(beth) is frequently redundant, as all who know that language are well aware.
The meaning will therefore be, that Christ was revealed <i>to</i> Paul, not that
he might alone enjoy, and silently retain in his own bosom the knowledge of
Christ, but that he might preach among the Gentiles the Savior whom he had
known.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Immediately I conferred
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">. To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>confer with flesh and
blood</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is to consult with flesh and blood. So
far as the meaning of these words is concerned, his intention was absolutely to
have nothing to do with any human counsels. The general expression, as will
presently appear from the context, includes all men, and all the prudence or
wisdom which they may possess. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He even
makes a direct reference to the apostles, for the express purpose of exhibiting,
in a stronger light, the immediate calling of God. Relying on the authority of
God alone, and asking nothing more, he proceeded to discharge the duty of
preaching the gospel.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither did I return to
Jerusalem.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What he had just written is now
explained, and more fully stated. As if he had said, &#8220;I did not ask the
authority of any man,&#8221; not even of the apostles themselves. It is a
mistake to suppose, that, because the apostles are now separately mentioned,
they are not included in the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh and
blood</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Nothing new or different is here added,
but merely a clearer explanation of what had been already said. And no
disrespect to the apostles is implied in that expression. For the purpose of
shewing that he did not owe his commission to man, the false boasting of
unprincipled men laid him under the necessity of contrasting. the authority of
the apostles themselves with the authority of God. When a creature is brought
into comparison with God, however contemptuous or humiliating may be the
language employed, he has no reason to complain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I went into
Arabia</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the Acts of the Apostles, Luke has
omitted these three years. In like manner, there are other passages of the
history which he does not touch; and hence the slander of those who seek to
build on this a charge of inconsistency in the narratives is ridiculous. Let
godly readers consider the severe temptation with which Paul was called to
struggle at the very commencement of his course. He who but yesterday, for the
sake of doing him honor, had been sent to Damascus with a magnificent retinue,
is now compelled to wander as an exile in a foreign land: but he does not lose
his courage.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then after three
years</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It was not till three years after he had
begun to discharge the apostolic office, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>went up to
Jerusalem</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Thus, he did not, at the outset,
receive the calling of men. But lest it should be supposed that he had separate
interests from theirs, and was desirous to avoid their society, he tells us that
he went up for the express
purpose</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> to see
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa31</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peter.
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa32</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Although he had not waited for their sanction before undertaking the office, yet
it was not against their will, but with their full consent and approbation, that
he held the rank of an apostle. He is desirous to shew that at no period was he
at variance with the apostles, and that even now he is in full harmony with all
their views. By mentioning the short time that he remained there, he shews that
he had come, not with a view to learn, but solely for mutual
intercourse.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I saw no other of the
apostles.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is added to make it evident that
he had but one object in his journey, and attended to nothing
else.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Except
James.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Who this James was, deserves inquiry.
Almost all the ancients are agreed that he was one of the disciples, whose
surname was &#8220;Oblias&#8221; and &#8220;The Just,&#8221; and that he
presided over the church at Jerusalem. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Yet
others think that he was the son of Joseph by another wife, and others (which is
more probable) that he was the cousin of Christ by the mother&#8217;s side: 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but as
he is here mentioned among the apostles, I do not hold that opinion. Nor is
there any force in the defense offered by Jerome, that the word Apostle is
sometimes applied to others besides the twelve; for the subject under
consideration is the highest rank of apostleship, and we shall presently see
that he was considered one of the chief <i>pillars</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
2:9.) It appears to me, therefore, far more probable, that the person of whom he
is speaking is the son of Alpheus.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa35</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The rest of the apostles, there is reason to believe,
were scattered through various countries; for they did not idly remain in one
place. Luke relates that Paul was brought by Barnabas to the apostles.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440927&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
9:27.) This must be understood to relate, not to the twelve, but to these two
apostles, who alone were at that time residing in
Jerusalem.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now the things which I write to
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This affirmation extends to the whole
narrative. The vast earnestness of Paul on this subject is evinced by his
resorting to an oath, which cannot lawfully be employed but on great and weighty
occasions. Nor is it wonderful that he insists with so much earnestness on this
point; for we have already seen to what expedients the impostors had recourse in
order to take from him the name and credit of an apostle. Now the modes of
swearing used by good men deserve our attention; for we learn from them that an
oath must be viewed simply as an appeal to the judgment-seat of God for the
integrity and truth of our words and actions; and such a transaction ought to be
guided by religion and the fear of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And was unknown by
face</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This appears to be added for the sake of
shewing more strongly the wickedness and malignity of his slanderers. If the
churches of Judea who <i>had only heard</i> respecting him, were led to give
glory to God for the astonishing change which he had wrought in Paul, how
disgraceful was it that those who had beheld the fruits of his amazing labors
should not have acted a similar part! If the mere report was enough for the
former, why did not the facts before their eyes satisfy the
latter?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which once he
destroyed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This does not mean that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> may
actually be destroyed, but that he lessened its influence on the minds of weak
men. Besides, it is the will, rather than the deed, that is here
expressed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they glorified God in
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa37</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
was an evident proof that his ministry was approved by all the churches of
Judea, and approved in such a manner, that they broke out into admiration and
praise of the wonderful power of God. Thus he indirectly reproves their malice,
by showing that their venom and slanders could have no other effect than to hide
the glory of God, which, as the apostles admitted and openly acknowledged, shone
brightly in the apostleship of Paul.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This reminds us of the light in which the saints of
the Lord ought to be regarded by us. When we behold men adorned with the gifts
of God, such is our depravity, or ingratitude, or proneness to superstition,
that we worship them as gods, unmindful of Him by whom those gifts were
bestowed. These words remind us, on the contrary, to lift up our eyes to the
Great Author, and to ascribe to Him what is his own, while they at the same time
inform us that an occasion of offering praise to God was furnished by the change
produced on Paul, from being an enemy to becoming a minister of
Christ.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fourteen years
after.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This cannot with certainty be affirmed
to be the same journey mentioned by Luke.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:2.) The connection of the history leads us rather to an opposite conclusion.
We find that Paul performed four journeys to Jerusalem. Of the first we have
already spoken. The second took place when, in company with Barnabas, he brought
the charitable contributions of the Greek and Asiatic Churches.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441525&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:25.) My belief that this second journey is referred to in the present passage
rests on various grounds. On any other supposition, the statements of Paul and
Luke cannot be reconciled. Besides, there is ground for conjecturing that the
rebuke was administered to Peter at Antioch while Paul was residing there. Now,
this happened before he was sent to Jerusalem by the Churches to settle the
dispute which had arisen about ceremonial observances.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:2.) It is not reasonable to suppose that Peter would have used such
dissimulation, if that controversy had been settled and the decree of the
Apostles published. But Paul writes that he came to Jerusalem, and afterwards
adds that he had rebuked Peter for an act of dissimulation, an act which Peter
certainly would not have committed except in matters that were doubtful. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa38</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, he would scarcely have alluded, at any time,
to that journey
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa39</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
undertaken with the consent of all the believers, without mentioning the
occasion of it, and the memorable decision which was passed. It is not even
certain at what time the Epistle was written, only that the Greeks conjecture
that it was sent from Rome, and the Latins from Ephesus. For my own part, I
think that it was written, not only before Paul had seen Rome, but before that
consultation had been held, and the decision of the Apostles given about
ceremonial observances. While his opponents were falsely pleading the name of
the apostles, and earnestly striving to ruin the reputation of Paul, what
carelessness would it have angered in him to pass by the decree universally
circulated among them, which struck at those very persons!
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa40</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Undoubtedly, this one word would have shut their mouth: &#8220;You bring against
me the authority of the apostles, but who does not know their decision? and
therefore I hold you convicted of unblushing falsehood. In their name, you
oblige the Gentiles to keep the law, but I appeal to their own writing, which
sets the consciences of men at liberty.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may likewise observe, that, in the commencement of
the Epistle, he reproved the Galatians for having so soon revolted from the
gospel which had been delivered to them. But we may readily conclude, that,
after they had been brought to believe the gospel, some time must have elapsed
before that dispute about the ceremonial law arose. I consider, therefore, that
the fourteen years are to be reckoned, not from one journey to another, but from
Paul&#8217;s conversion. The space of time between the two journeys was eleven
years.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I went up according to
revelation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He now
proceeds to prove his apostleship and his doctrine, not only by works, but also
by a Divine revelation. Since God directed that journey, which had for its
object the confirmation of his doctrine, the doctrine was confirmed, not by the
concurrence of men only, but likewise by the authority of God. This ought to
have been more than enough to overcome the obstinacy of those who blamed Paul by
holding up the names of the apostles. For although, up to this time, there had
been some room for debate, the communication of the mind of God put an end to
all discussion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I communicated to
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>communicated</i></font><font face="Palatino">
claims our first attention; for the apostles do not describe to him what he
ought to teach, but, after listening to his own account of his doctrine, express
their concurrence and approbation. But, as his opponents might allege that, by
cunning dissimulation on many points, he had gained the favor of the apostles,
he expressly states that he &#8220;communicated to them that doctrine which he
preacheth among the Gentiles;&#8221; which removes all suspicion of hypocrisy or
imposture. We shall see what followed; for the apostles did not take it amiss
that he had not waited to obtain their sanction. On the contrary, without
dispute or expostulation, they approved of his labors; and did so by the
direction of the same Spirit, under whose guidance Paul had performed his
journey to Jerusalem. Thus, he was not made an apostle by them, but acknowledged
to be an apostle. But this point will be treated more fully
afterwards.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest by any
means.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What then? Shall the word of God fall,
when it is unsupported by the testimony of men? Though the whole world were
unbelieving, yet the word of God remains firm and unshaken: and they who preach
the gospel by the command of God are not uselessly employed, even when no fruit
is produced by their labors. This is not Paul&#8217;s meaning; but, as the
consciences of men, so long as they doubt and hesitate, derive no benefit from
the ministry of the word, so a preacher is said, so far as men is concerned, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>run in
vain</i></font><font face="Palatino">, when his labors are ineffectual, and
unaccompanied by proper edification.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was, therefore, a formidable weapon for shaking
weak consciences, when the doctrine which Paul preached was falsely declared by
impostors to be at variance with the doctrine of the apostles. Multitudes in
this manner fell away. The certainty of faith, indeed, does not depend on the
agreement of human opinions; but, on the contrary, it is our duty to rest in the
naked truth of God, so that neither men nor all the angels together, could shake
our faith. Yet ignorant persons, who have imperfectly understood, and never have
cordially embraced, sound doctrine, feel the temptation to be almost
irresistible, while teachers of acknowledged eminence are found to entertain
opposite views. Nay, strong believers are sometimes powerfully affected by this
stratagem of Satan, when he holds out to their view the &#8220;strife and
divisions&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:3) of those who ought to have been</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;perfectly joined
together in the same mind and in the same judgment.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 1:10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is hard to tell how many were driven from the
gospel, how many had their faith shaken, by the mournful controversy about the
bodily presence of Christ in the Lord&#8217;s Supper, because, on a question of
the highest moment, very distinguished men were observed to take opposite
sides.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the other hand, the agreement of all who teach in
the Church is a powerful aid for the confirmation of faith. Since, therefore,
Satan was laboring so insidiously to hinder the progress of the gospel, Paul
resolved to meet him. When he had succeeded in demonstrating that he held the
same views with all the apostles, every hinderance was removed. Weak disciples
were no longer perplexed by the inquiry, whom they ought to follow. His meaning
may be thus summed up: &#8220;That my former labors might not be thrown away and
rendered useless, I have set at rest the question which disturbed many minds,
whether I or Peter deserved your confidence; for in all that I had ever taught
we were perfectly at one.&#8221; If many teachers in our own day were as
heartily desirous as Paul was to edify the Church, they would take more pains to
be agreed among themselves.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But neither
Titus</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is an additional argument to prove
that the Apostles held the same views with himself; for he had brought to them
an uncircumcised man, whom they did not hesitate to acknowledge as a brother.
The reason is assigned why he was not circumcised; for circumcision, being a
matter of indifference, might be neglected or practiced as edification required.
Our invariable rule of action is, that, if &#8220;all things are lawful for
us,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461023&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:23) we ought to inquire what is expedient. He circumcises
Timothy,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
16:3,) in order to take away a ground of offense from weak minds; for he was at
that time dealing with weak minds, which it was his duty to treat with
tenderness. And he would gladly have done the same thing with Titus, for he was
unwearied in his endeavors to &#8220;support
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442035&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
20:35) the weak;&#8221; but the case was different. For some false brethren were
watching for an opportunity of slandering his doctrine, and would immediately
have spread the report: &#8220;See how the valiant champion of liberty, when he
comes into the presence of the apostles, lays aside the bold and fierce aspect
which he is wont to assume among the ignorant!&#8221; Now, as it is our duty to
&#8220;bear the infirmities of the weak,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:1,) so concealed foes, who purposely watch for our liberty, must, be
vigorously resisted. The duties of love to our neighbor ought never to be
injurious to faith; and therefore, in matters of indifference, the love of our
neighbour will be our best guide, provided that faith shall always receive our
first regard.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that because of false
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This may mean either that false
brethren made it the subject of wicked accusation, and endeavored to compel him;
or that Paul purposely did not circumcise him, because he saw that they would
immediately make it an occasion of slander. They had insinuated themselves into
Paul&#8217;s company with the hope of gaining one of two objects. Either he
would treat with open scorn the ceremonial law, and then they would rouse the
indignation of the Jews against him; or he would refrain entirely from the
exercise of his liberty, and in that case they would exult over him among the
Gentiles as one who, overwhelmed with shame, had retracted his
doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I prefer the second interpretation, that Paul, having
discovered the snares laid for him, determined not to circumcise Titus. When he
says that he was not &#8220;compelled,&#8221; the reader is led to understand
that circumcision is not condemned as a bad thing in itself, but that the
obligation to observe it was the subject of dispute. As if he had said, &#8220;I
would have been prepared to circumcise Titus if higher matters had not been
involved.&#8221; Their intention was to lay down a law; and to such compulsion
he would not
yield.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.
To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an
hour</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This steadiness was the seal of
Paul&#8217;s doctrine. For when false brethren, who wished nothing more than a
ground of accusation against him, exerted themselves to the utmost, and he stood
firm, there could no longer be any room for doubt. It cannot now be insinuated
that he deceived the apostles. He asserts that he did not for a moment <i>give
place</i> to them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by
subjection</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, by such a mode of yielding
as would have implied that his liberty had been crushed. In every other respect,
he was prepared, to the very close of his life, to exercise mildness and
forbearance toward all men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the truth of the
gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There was no danger that Paul would be
deprived of his liberty even by yielding to them; but the example would have
done harm to others, and therefore he prudently inquired what was expedient.
This shows us how far offenses must be avoided, and points us to edification as
the object which ought to be kept in view in all matters of indifference. The
amount, is this: &#8220;We are the servants of the brethren, but still keeping
in view that we all serve the Lord, and that the liberty of our conscience shall
remain unimpaired.&#8221; When false brethren wished to bring the saints in to
bondage, it was their duty not to yield to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The truth of the
gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino"> denotes its genuine purity, or, which
means the same thing, its pure and entire doctrine. For the false apostles did
not altogether set aside the gospel, but mixed up with it their own notions, so
as to give it a false and disguised aspect, which it always has when we make the
smallest departure &#8220;from the simplicity that is in Christ.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 11:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With what effrontery then will the Papists boast that
they possess the gospel, which is not only corrupted by many inventions, but
more than adulterated by many wicked doctrines? Let us remember that it is not
enough to retain the name of the gospel, and some kind of summary of its
doctrines, if its solid purity do not remain untouched. Where are the men who,
by pretended moderation, endeavor to bring about a reconciliation between us and
the Papists? as if the doctrine of religion, like a matter affecting money or
property, could be compromised. With what abhorrence would such a transaction
have been regarded by Paul, who affirms that it is not the true gospel, if it is
not pure!</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa42</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Paul is
not yet satisfied, without making the Galatians understand that he had learned
nothing from Peter and the apostles. Hence Porphyry and Julian
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> accuse
the holy man of pride, because he claims so much for himself that he cannot
endure to learn anything from others; because he boasts of having become a
teacher without any instruction or assistance; and because he labors so hard not
to appear in an inferior character. But any one who will consider how necessary
that boasting was, will acknowledge that it was holy boasting, and worthy of the
highest praise; for, if he had yielded this point to his opponents, that he had
profited under the apostles, he would have furnished them with two charges
against him. They would immediately have said, &#8220;And so you made some
progress; you corrected your past errors, and did not repeat your former
rashness.&#8221; Thus, in the first place, the whole doctrine which he had
hitherto taught would have fallen under suspicion; and, secondly, he would ever
afterwards have possessed less authority, because he would have been reckoned
but an ordinary disciple. We find, therefore, that it was not on his own
account, but by the necessity under which he lay to establish the doctrine, that
he was led to this holy boasting. The controversy has no reference to
individuals, and therefore cannot be a struggle of ambition; but Paul&#8217;s
determination was that no man, however eminent, should throw into the shade his
apostleship, on which the authority of his doctrine depended. If this be not
enough to silence those dogs, their barking is sufficiently
answered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whatsoever they
were</i></font><font face="Palatino">. These words must be read as a separate
clause; for the parenthesis was intended to assure his opponents that he did not
concern himself with the opinions of men. This passage has been variously
interpreted. Ambrose thinks that it is a passing reference to the folly of
attempting to lower Paul by holding up the apostles; and represents him as
saying; &#8220;As if I were not equally at liberty to object that they were
poor, illiterate men, while I, from my early years, enjoyed a liberal education
under the care of Gamaliel. But I pass over all this, because I know that there
is no respect of persons with God.&#8221; Chrysostom and Jerome take a harsher
view of the words, as an indirect threatening of the most distinguished
apostles. &#8220;Whatsoever they may be, if they swerve from duty, they shall
not escape the judgment of God; neither the dignity of their office, nor the
estimation of men, shall protect them.&#8221; But another interpretation appears
to me more simple, and more agreeable to Paul&#8217;s design. He admits that
they were first in the order of time, but contends that this did not prevent him
from being their equal in rank. He does not say that it is of no consequence to
him what they are at present; but he is speaking of a period now past, when they
were already apostles, and when he was opposed to the faith of Christ. In short,
he does not choose that what is past shall decide the matter; and refuses to
admit the proverb, that he who comes first has the best right.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No man&#8217;s
person</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Besides the interpretations which I
have mentioned, a third is not unworthy of notice, &#8212; that in the
government of the world distinctions of rank are admitted, but in the spiritual
kingdom of Christ they can have no place. There is plausibility in the
statement, but it is in reference to worldly government, that it is
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Ye shall not
respect persons in
judgment,.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;050117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
1:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I do not enter into that argument, for it does
not affect this passage. Paul simply means, that the honorable rank which the
apostles had attained did not prevent him from being called by God, and raised,
all at once, from the lowest condition to be their equal. The difference between
them, though great, is of no value in the sight of God, who does not accept
persons, and whose calling is not influenced by any prejudices. But this view
may likewise appear liable to objection; for, granting it to be true, and a
truth which must be carefully maintained, that in our intercourse with God there
is no respect of persons, how does this apply to Peter and his fellow-apostles,
who were venerable, not merely for their rank, but for true holiness and
spiritual gifts?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>person</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is contrasted with the fear of God and a good conscience; and this is its
ordinary acceptation in Scripture.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441034&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
10:34,35
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:17.) But piety, zeal, holiness, and other similar graces, were the
principal grounds of the esteem and respect in which the apostles were held;
while Paul speaks contemptuously of them, as if they had possessed nothing but
the outward forms.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I reply: Paul is not discussing the real worth of the
apostles, but the idle boasting of his adversaries. In order to support their
own unfounded pretensions, they talked in lofty terms of Peter, and James, and
John, and took advantage of the veneration with which they were regarded by the
Church, for accomplishing their earnest desire of degrading Paul. His object is
not to inquire what the apostles are, or what opinion must be formed respecting
them when controversy is laid aside, but to tear off the disguises which the
false apostles wore. As in a subsequent part of the Epistle he treats of
circumcision, not in its real character, but in the false and impious notion
attached to it by those impostors, so he now declares that the apostles were in
the sight of God disguises, by which those persons attempted to shine in the
world; and this is evident from the words. Why did they prefer them to Paul?
because they were his predecessors in office. This was a mere disguise. In any
other point of view, they would have been highly esteemed, and the gifts of God
manifested in them would have been warmly admired by one so singularly modest as
the apostle Paul, who elsewhere acknowledges that he was &#8220;the least of the
apostles,&#8221; and unworthy to occupy so exalted a station.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I am the least of
the apostles, and not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the
Church of
God.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 15:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They communicated nothing to
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It might also be rendered, &#8220;they
communicated nothing with me;&#8221; for it is the same word which he formerly
used twice.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But the
meaning is the same. When the apostles had heard Paul&#8217;s gospel, they did
not on the other side bring forward their own, (as is commonly done when
something better and more perfect is desired,) but were satisfied with his
explanation, and simply and unhesitatingly embraced his doctrine, so that not
even on the most doubtful point did a single word of debate pass between them.
Nor are we to suppose that Paul, presuming on his superiority, took the lead in
the discussion, and dictated to his brethren. On the contrary, his faith, about
which unfavourable rumors had been spread, was fully explained by him, and
sanctioned by their appropation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But, on the
contrary.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> They immediately <i>gave him the
right hand of fellowship</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
2:9.) Consequently they gave their testimony to his doctrine, and without any
exception; for they produced nothing on the other side, as is commonly done on
debated points, but acknowledged that he held the same gospel in common with
them, and was therefore entitled to the honors and rank of an associate. Now,
one condition of this <i>fellowship</i> was, that they distributed the provinces
among themselves. They were therefore equal, and there was no subjection on the
part of Paul. To &#8220;give the right hands of fellowship&#8221; means here, to
have a partnership settled by mutual agreement.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When they saw that the gospel of
the uncircumcision was committed to me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He
asserts that he was not indebted to the apostles for the favor of being made an
apostle by their consent and approbation, but that, in conceding to him the
apostleship, they only refused to take away what God had given. He constantly
urges that he was made an apostle by the gift and appointment of God, but adds
here that he was acknowledged as such by the apostles themselves. Hence it
followed, that those unprincipled men were attempting, what the apostles durst
not have attempted, to oppose the election of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And here he begins to claim what belonged to himself
in preference to others, the apostleship of the uncircumcision. For Paul and
Barnabas differed from the rest in this respect, that they had been appointed to
be apostles of the Gentiles.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:2.) That had been done by a Divine revelation, which the apostles not only
did not oppose, but determined to ratify, because not to obey it, would have
been impious. This shows us in what manner they arranged their respective
duties, in compliance with a Divine revelation, namely, that Paul and Barnabas
should be the apostles of the Gentiles, and that the others should be the
apostles of the Jews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this appears to be at variance with the command
of Christ, which enjoins that the twelve shall</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;go unto all the
world, and preach the gospel to every creature.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;411615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Mark
16:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I reply, that command was not intended to apply
specifically to each individual, but describes in general terms the design of
the apostolic office, which was, that salvation must be proclaimed to all
nations by the doctrine of the gospel. For the apostles evidently did not travel
over the whole world; nay, it is probable that not one of the twelve ever passed
into Europe. What they allege about Peter may, for aught I know, be fabulous,
and is, at all events, quite uncertain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">All of them, it will be objected, had still a
commission both to Gentiles and to Jews. I own they had, as occasion offered.
Each apostle, I grant, was entrusted with the publication of the gospel both
among Gentiles and Jews; for the distribution was not of such a nature as to
assign them fixed boundaries, like those of kingdoms, principalities, and
provinces, which could not lawfully be passed. We see that Paul, wherever he
went, uniformly offered his labors and services, in the first instance, to the
Jews. As he had a right, while living among the Gentiles, to offer himself as an
apostle and teacher to the Jews; so the others were at liberty, wherever they
had it in their power, to bring Gentiles to Christ; and we find Peter exercising
this privilege with regard to Cornelius and others.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441001&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
10:1.) But as there were other apostles in that district, which was almost
wholly inhabited by Jews, Paul traveled through Asia, Greece, and other distant
parts, and on this occasion was specially ordained to be an apostle to the
Gentiles. Nay, when the Lord first commanded him to be set apart, he directed
him to leave Antioch and Syria, and perform voyages to distant countries for the
sake of the Gentiles. On ordinary occasions, therefore, he was the apostle of
the Gentiles, and on extraordinary occasions, he was the apostle of the Jews.
The other apostles, again, took the Jews for their own department, but with the
understanding that, when an opportunity occurred, they would be at liberty to
direct their ministrations to the Gentiles; this last, however, being in their
case an extraordinary service.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if Peter&#8217;s apostleship had a peculiar
reference to the Jews, let the Romanists see on what ground they derive from him
their succession to the primacy. If the Pope of Rome claims the primacy because
he is Peter&#8217;s successor, he ought to exercise it over the Jews. Paul is
here declared to be the chief apostle of the Gentiles, yet they affirm that he
was not bishop of Rome; and, therefore, if the Pope would establish any claim to
his primacy, let him gather churches from among the Jews. He who by a decree of
the Holy Spirit, and by the consent of the whole apostolic college, has been
solemnly declared to be one of the apostles, cannot but be acknowledged by us in
that character. Those who would transfer that right to Peter set aside all
ordination, both human and divine. It is unnecessary to explain here the
well-known metaphor in the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>circumcision</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and <i>uncircumcision</i>, as applied to Jews and
Gentiles.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
He that wrought effectually</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That the province
which had been assigned to him was truly his own, is proved by the exertion of
divine power during his ministry. Now, this manifestation of divine energy, as
we have frequently seen, is the seal by which his doctrine was attested, and his
office as a teacher sanctioned. Whether Paul refers God&#8217;s <i>effectual
working</i> to the success of his preaching, or to the graces of the Holy Spirit
which were then bestowed on believers, is doubtful. I do not understand it as
denoting the mere success, but the spiritual power and efficacy, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which
he has elsewhere mentioned.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:4.) The amount of the whole is, that it was no idle bargain which
the apostles had made among themselves, but a decision which God had
sealed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And when they perceived the
grace. </i></font><font face="Palatino">They who treated with contempt the grace
of God, by which the most eminent apostles had been led to admire and reverence
Paul, are charged with hateful and proud disdain. If they should allege that
they were ignorant of that which the apostles knew from the beginning, the
hypocritical pretense was not to be endured. This admonishes us to yield to the
grace of God, wherever it is perceived, unless we choose to contend with the
Holy Spirit, whose will it is that his gifts shall not remain unemployed. The
grace which the apostles perceived to have been given to Paul and Barnabas,
induced them to sanction their ministry by receiving them as their
associates.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>James and
Cephas</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I have already stated, that James was
the son of Alpheus. He could not be &#8220;the brother of John&#8221; who had
been lately put to death by Herod,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
12:2,) and to suppose that one of the disciples had been placed above the
apostles would be absurd. That he held the highest rank among the apostles, is
made evident by Luke, who ascribes to him the summing up and decision of the
cause in the council,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:13,) and afterwards mentions his having assembled &#8220;all the
elders&#8221; of the church of Jerusalem.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

quotes the general opinion, arguing from it, that what was done by such men
ought not to be lightly set aside. In a question relating to diversity of rank,

perhaps is, that he presided over the church at Jerusalem. As to the word

wherever he appears in his gifts; and as a people cannot want a pastor, so the
assemblies of pastors require a moderator. But in all cases let the rule be

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When Peter was
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Whoever will carefully examine all the
circumstances, will, I trust, agree with me in thinking, that this happened
before the apostles had decided that the Gentiles should receive no annoyance
about ceremonial observances.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441528&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:28.) For Peter would have entertained no dread of offending James, or those
sent by him, after that decision had been passed: but such was the dissimulation
of Peter, that, in opposing it, Paul was driven to assert &#8220;the truth of
the gospel.&#8221; At first he said, that the certainty of his gospel does not
in any degree depend on Peter and the apostles, so as to stand or fall by their
judgment. Secondly, he said, that it had been approved by all without any
exception or contradiction, and particularly by those who were universally
admitted to hold the highest place. Now, as I have said, he goes further, and
asserts that he had blamed Peter for leaning to the other side; and he proceeds
to explain the cause of the dispute. It was no ordinary proof of the strength of
his doctrine, that he not only obtained their cordial approbation, but firmly
maintained it in a debate with Peter, and came off victorious. What reason could
there now be for hesitating to receive it as certain and undoubted
truth?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, this is a reply to another calumny,
that Paul was but an ordinary disciple, far below the rank of an apostle: for
the reproof which he administered was an evidence that the parties were on an
equal footing. The highest, I acknowledge, are sometimes properly reproved by
the lowest, for this liberty on the part of inferiors towards their superiors is
permitted by God; and so it does not follow, that he who reproves another must
be his equal. But the nature of the reproof deserves notice. Paul did not simply
reprove Peter, as a Christian might reprove a Christian, but he did it
officially, as the phrase is; that is, in the exercise of the apostolic
character which he sustained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is another thunderbolt which strikes the Papacy
of Rome. It exposes the impudent pretensions of the Roman Antichrist, who boasts
that he is not bound to assign a reason, and sets at defiance the judgment of
the whole Church. Without rashness, without undue boldness, but in the exercise
of the power granted him by God, this single individual chastises Peter, in the
presence of the whole Church; and Peter submissively bows to the chastisement.
Nay, the whole debate on those two points was nothing less than a manifest
overthrow of that tyrannical primacy, which the Romanists foolishly enough
allege to be founded on divine right. If they wish to have God appearing on
their side, a new Bible must be manufactured; if they do not wish to have him
for an open enemy, those two chapters of the Holy Scriptures must be
expunged.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because he was worthy of
blame.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Greek participle,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kategnwsme&gt;nov</font><font face="Palatino">,
signifies Blamed, so that the words run, &#8220;because he was blamed;&#8221;
but I have no doubt whatever, that the word was intended to express, &#8220;one
who deserves just blame.&#8221; Chrysostom makes the meaning to be, that others
had previously indulged in complaint and accusation; but this is really
trifling. It was customary with the Greeks to give to their participles the
signification of nouns, which, every person must see, is applicable to this
passage. This will enable us to perceive the absurdity of the interpretation
given by Jerome and Chrysostom, who represent the whole transaction as a feigned
debate, which the apostles had previously arranged to take place in presence of
the people. They are not even supported by the phrase, &#8220;I withstood
him</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> to the
face</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kata&lt;
pro&gt;swpon</font><font face="Palatino">, which means that &#8220;to the
face,&#8221; or &#8220;being present,&#8221; Peter was chastised and struck
dumb. The observation of Chrysostom, that, for the sake of avoiding scandal,
they would have talked in private if they had any difference, is frivolous. The
less important must be disregarded in comparison of the most dangerous of all
scandals, that the Church would be rent, that Christian liberty was in danger,
that the doctrine of the grace of Christ was overthrown; and therefore this
public offense must be publicly corrected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The chief argument on which Jerome rests is
excessively trifling. &#8220;Why should Paul,&#8221; says he, &#8220;condemn in
another what he takes praise for in himself? for he boasts that &#8216;to the
Jews he became as a Jew.&#8217;&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460920&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 9:20.) I reply, that what Peter did is totally different. Paul
accommodated himself to the Jews no farther than was consistent with the
doctrine of liberty; and therefore he refused to circumcise Titus, that the
truth of the gospel might remain unimpaired. But Peter Judaized in such a manner
as to &#8220;compel the Gentiles&#8221; to suffer bondage, and at the same time
to create a prejudice against Paul&#8217;s doctrine. He did not, therefore,
observe the proper limit; for he was more desirous to please than to edify, and
more solicitous to inquire what would gratify the Jews than what would be
expedient for the whole body. Augustine is therefore right in asserting, that
this was no previously arranged plan, but that Paul, out of Christian zeal,
opposed the sinful and unseasonable dissimulation of Peter, because he saw that
it would be injurious to the Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For before that certain persons
came.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The state of the case is here laid down.
For the sake of the Jews, Peter had withdrawn himself from the Gentiles, in
order to drive them from the communion of the Church, unless they would
relinquish the liberty of the Gospel, and submit to the yoke of the Law. If Paul
had been silent here, his whole doctrine fell; all the edification obtained by
his ministry was ruined. It was therefore necessary that he should rise
manfully, and fight with courage. This shews us how cautiously we ought to guard
against giving way to the opinions of men, lest an immoderate desire to please,
or an undue dread of giving offense, should turn us aside from the right path.
If this might happen to Peter, how much more easily may it happen to us, if we
are not duly careful!</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But when I saw that they walked
not uprightly</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some apply these words to the
Gentiles, who, perplexed by Peter&#8217;s example, were beginning to give way;
but it is more natural to understand them as referring to Peter and Barnabas,
and their followers. The proper road to the truth of the gospel was, to unite
the Gentiles with the Jews in such a manner that the true doctrine should not be
injured. But to bind the consciences of godly men by an obligation to keep the
law, and to bury in silence the doctrine of liberty, was to purchase unity at an
exorbitant price.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The truth of the
gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is here used, by Paul, in the same sense
as before, and is contrasted with those disguises by which Peter and others
concealed its beauty. In such a case, the struggle which Paul had to maintain
must unquestionably have been serious. They were perfectly agreed about
doctrine; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa46</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
since, laying doctrine out of view, Peter yielded too submissively to the Jews,
he is accused of halting. There are some who apologize for Peter on another
ground, because, being the apostle of the circumcision, he was bound to take a
particular concern in the salvation of the Jews; while they at the same time
admit that Paul did right in pleading the cause of the Gentiles. But it is
foolish to defend what the Holy Spirit by the mouth of Paul has condemned. This
was no affair of men, but involved the purity of the gospel, which was in danger
of being contaminated by Jewish leaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before them
all</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This example instructs us, that those who
have sinned publicly must be publicly chastised, so far as concerns the Church.
The intention is, that their sin may not, by remaining unpunished, form a
dangerous example; and Paul elsewhere
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 5:20) lays down this rule expressly, to be observed in the case of
elders,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Them that sin
rebuke before all, that others also may fear;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">because the station which they hold renders their
example more pernicious. It was particularly advantageous, that the good cause,
in which all had an interest, should be openly defended in presence of the
people, that Paul might have a better opportunity of shewing that he did not
shrink from the broad light of day.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou, being a
Jew</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Paul&#8217;s address to Peter consists of
two parts. In the first, he expostulates with him for his injustice toward the
Gentiles, in compelling them to keep the law, from the obligations of which he
wished himself to be exempted. For, not to mention that every man is bound to
keep the law which he lays down for others, his conduct was greatly aggravated
by compelling the Gentiles to observe Jewish ceremonies, while he, being a Jew,
left himself at liberty. The law was given to Jews, not to Gentiles; so that he
argues from the less to the greater.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Next, it is argued, that, in a harsh and violent
manner, he </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>compelled the
Gentiles</i></font><font face="Palatino">, by withdrawing from their communion,
unless they chose to submit to the yoke of the law; and thus imposed on them an
unjust condition. And, indeed, the whole force of the reproof lies in this word,
which neither Chrysostom nor Jerome has remarked. The use of ceremonies was free
for the purposes of edification, provided that believers were not deprived of
their liberty, or laid under any restraint from which the gospel sets them
free.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We who are Jews by
nature</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some, I am aware, think that this is
stated in the form of an objection,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnqupofora&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">,)
anticipating what might be urged on the other side, that the Jews possessed
higher privileges; not that they would boast of exemption from the law, (for it
would have been highly absurd, that they to whom the Law was given should make
this their boast,) but that there was a propriety in retaining some points of
distinction between them and the Gentiles. I do not entirely reject, and yet, as
will afterwards appear, I do not altogether adopt this view. Some, again,
consider that it is Paul himself who uses this argument, &#8220;If you were to
lay upon the Jews the burden of the law, it would be more reasonable, because it
is theirs by inheritance.&#8221; But neither do I approve of this
view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He is now proceeding to the second part of his
speech, which commences with an anticipation. The Gentiles differed from them in
this respect, that they were &#8220;unholy and profane,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 1:9;) while the Jews, being holy, so far as God had chosen them for his
people, might contend for this superiority. Skilfully anticipating the
objection, Paul turns it to the opposite conclusion. Since the Jews themselves,
with all their advantages, were forced to betake themselves to the faith of
Christ, how much more necessary was it that the Gentiles should look for
salvation through faith? Paul&#8217;s meaning therefore is: &#8220;We, who
appear to excel others, &#8212; we, who, by means of the covenant, have always
enjoyed the privilege of being nigh to God,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;050407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
4:7,) have found no method of obtaining salvation, but by believing in Christ:
why, then, should we prescribe another method to the Gentiles? For, if the law
were necessary or advantageous for salvation to those who observed its
enactments, it must have been most of all advantageous to us to whom it was
given; but if we relinquished it, and betook ourselves to Christ, much less
ought compliance with it to be urged upon the Gentiles.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sinner</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
signifies here, as in many other places, a &#8220;profane person,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581216&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:16,) or one who is lost and alienated from God. Such were the Gentiles, who
had no intercourse with God; while the Jews were, by adoption, the children of
God, and therefore set apart to holiness.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By
nature</i></font><font face="Palatino">, does not mean that they were naturally
free from the corruption of the human race; for David, who was a descendant of
Abraham, acknowledges,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Behold, I was
shapen in iniquity,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and in sin did
my mother conceive me,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
51:5,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but the corruption of nature, to which they were
liable, had been met by the remedy of sanctifying grace. Now, as the promise
made the blessing hereditary, so this benefit is called natural; just as, in the
Epistle to the Romans, he says, that they were sprung from a &#8220;holy
root.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we are Jews by
nature,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> his meaning is, &#8220;We are born
holy: not certainly by our own merit, but because God hath chosen us to be his
people.&#8221; Well, then, we who were by nature Jews, what have we done?
&#8220;We have believed in Jesus Christ.&#8221; What was the design of our
believing? &#8220;That we might be justified by the faith of Christ.&#8221; For
what reason? Because we &#8220;know that a man is not justified by the works of
the law.&#8221; From the nature and effect of faith, he reasons that the Jews
are in no degree justified by the law. For, as they who</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;go about to
establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves to the
righteousness of God,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
10:3,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">so, on the contrary, they who believe in Christ,
confess that they are sinners, and renounce justification by works. This
involves the main question, or rather, in this single proposition nearly the
whole controversy is embodied. It is the more necessary to bestow some care on
the examination of this passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The first thing to be noticed is, that we must seek
justification by the faith of Christ, because we cannot be justified by works.
Now, the question is, what is meant by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the works of the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">? The Papists, misled by Origen and Jerome,
are of opinion, and lay it down as certain, that the dispute relates to shadows;
and accordingly assert, that by &#8220;the works of the law&#8221; are meant
ceremonies. As if Paul were not reasoning about the free justification which is
bestowed on us by Christ. For they see no absurdity in maintaining that
&#8220;no man is justified by the works of the law,&#8221; and yet that, by the
merit of works, we are accounted righteous in the sight of God. In short, they
hold that no mention is here made of the works of the moral law. But the context
clearly proves that the moral law is also comprehended in these words; for
almost everything which Paul afterwards advances belongs more properly to the
moral than to the ceremonial law; and he is continually employed in contrasting
the righteousness of the law with the free acceptance which God is pleased to
bestow.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is objected by our opponents, that the term
&#8220;works&#8221; must have been employed without any addition, if Paul had
not intended to limit it to a particular class. But I reply, there is the best
of all reasons for this mode of expression; for, though a man were to excel all
the angels in holiness, no reward is due to works, but on the footing of a
Divine promise. Perfect obedience to the law is righteousness, and has a promise
of eternal life annexed to it; but it derives this character from God, who
declares that &#8220;they who have fulfilled them shall live.&#8221; (Leviticus
18:5.) On this point we shall afterwards treat more fully in its own place.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa47</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Besides, the controversy with the Jews was about the law. Paul, therefore, chose
rather to bring the matter to an issue, by meeting them at once on their own
ground, than to adopt a more circuitous route, which might wear the aspect of
evading the subject, or distrusting his cause. Accordingly he resolves to have a
close debate about the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Their second objection is, that the whole question
raised was about ceremonies, which we readily allow. Why then, say they, would
the apostle pass suddenly from a particular department to the whole subject?
This was the sole cause of the mistake into which Origen and Jerome were
betrayed; for they did not think it natural that, while the false apostles were
contending about ceremonies alone, Paul should take in a larger field. But they
did not consider that the very reason for disputing so keenly was, that the
doctrine led to more serious consequences than at first view appeared. It would
not have given so much uneasiness to Paul that ceremonies should be observed, as
that the confident hope and the glory of salvation should be made to rest on
works; just as, in the dispute about forbidding flesh on certain days, we do not
look so much to the importance of the prohibition itself, as to the snare which
is laid for the consciences of men. Paul, therefore, does not wander from the
subject, when he enters into a controversy about the whole law, although the
arguments of the false apostles were confined wholly to ceremonies. Their object
in pressing ceremonies was, that men might seek salvation by obedience to the
law, which, they falsely maintained, was meritorious; and accordingly, Paul
meets them, not with the moral law, but with the grace of Christ alone. And yet
this extended discussion does not occupy the whole of the Epistle; he comes at
length to the specific question of ceremonies: but as the most serious
difficulty was, whether justification is to be obtained by works or by faith, it
was proper that this should be first settled. As the Papists of the present day
are uneasy when we extort from them the acknowledgment that men are justified by
faith alone, they reluctantly admit that &#8220;the works of the law&#8221;
include those of a moral nature. Many of them, however, by quoting
Jerome&#8217;s gloss, imagine that they have made a good defense; but the
context will show that the words relate also to the moral law. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa48</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But by the faith of Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He does not merely state that
ceremonies, or works of any kind, are insufficient without the assistance of
faith, but meets their denial by a statement admitting of no exception, as if he
had said, &#8220;Not by works, but by the Gift of Christ alone.&#8221; In any
other point of view, the sentiment would have been trivial and foreign to the
purpose; for the false apostles did not reject Christ nor faith, but demanded
that ceremonies should be joined with them. If Paul had admitted this claim,
they would have been perfectly at one, and he would have been under no necessity
to agitate the church by this unpleasant debate. Let it therefore remain
settled, that the proposition is so framed as to admit of no exception,
&#8220;that we are justified in no other way than by faith,&#8221; or,
&#8220;that we are not justified but by faith,&#8221; or, which amounts to the
same thing, &#8220;that we are justified by faith alone.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence it appears with what silly trifling the Papists
of our day dispute with us about the word, as if it had been a word of our
contrivance. But Paul was unacquainted with the theology of the Papists, who
declare that a man is justified by faith, and yet make a part of justification
to consist in works. Of such half-justification Paul knew nothing. For, when he
instructs us that we are justified by faith, because we cannot be justified by
works, he takes for granted what is true, that we cannot be justified through
the righteousness of Christ, unless we are poor and destitute of a righteousness
of our own. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa49</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Consequently, either nothing or all must be ascribed to faith or to works. As to
the word justification, and the manner in which faith is the cause of it, we
shall afterwards see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the works of the law shall no
flesh be justified</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He had already appealed to
the consciences of Peter and others, and now confirms it more fully by affirming
that such is the actual truth, that by the works of the law no mortal will
obtain justification. This is the foundation of a freely bestowed righteousness,
when we are stripped of a righteousness of our own. Besides, when he asserts
that no mortal is justified by the righteousness of the law, the assertion
amounts to this, that from such a mode of justification all mortals are
excluded, and that none can possibly reach it.</font><br></div>

If, while we seek to be justified</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now
returns to the Galatians. We must take care not to connect this verse with the
preceding one, as if it were a part of the speech addressed to Peter: for what
had Peter to do with this argument? It certainly has very little, if anything,
to do with the speech; but let every one form his own opinion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Chrysostom, and some other commentators, make the
whole passage to be an affirmation, and interpret it thus: &#8220;If, while we
seek to be justified by Christ, we are not yet perfectly righteous, but still
unholy, and if, consequently, Christ is not sufficient for our righteousness, it
follows that Christ is the minister of the doctrine which leaves men in
sin:&#8221; supposing that, by this absurd proposition, Paul insinuates a charge
of blasphemy against those who attribute a part of justification to the law. But
as the expression of indignant abhorrence immediately follows, which Paul is
never accustomed to employ but in answer to questions, I am rather inclined to
think that the statement is made for the purpose of setting aside an absurd
conclusion which his doctrine appeared to warrant. He puts a question, in his
usual manner, into the mouth of his antagonists. &#8220;If, in consequence of
the righteousness of faith, we, who are Jews and were &#8216;sanctified from the
womb,&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;240105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
1:5
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
1:15,) are reckoned guilty and polluted, shall we say that Christ makes sin to
be powerful in his own people, and that he is therefore the author of
sin?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This suspicion arose from his having said that Jews,
by believing in Christ, renounce the righteousness of the law; for, while they
are still at a distance from Christ, Jews, separated from the ordinary pollution
of the Gentiles, appear to be in some respects exempted from the appellation of
sinners. The grace of Christ places them on a level with the Gentiles; and the
remedy, which is common to both, shews that both had labored under the same
disease. This is the force of the particle also, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we ourselves
also</i></font><font face="Palatino">, &#8212; meaning not any description of
men, but the Jews, who stood highest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Far from
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He properly rejects that inference. Christ,
who discovers the sin which lay concealed, is not therefore the minister of sin;
as if, by depriving us of righteousness, he opened the gate to sin, or
strengthened its dominion. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Jews were mistaken in claiming any holiness for themselves apart from Christ,
while they had none. Hence arose the complaint: &#8220;Did Christ come to take
from us the righteousness of the law, to change saints into polluted men, to
subject us to sin and guilt?&#8221; Paul denies it, and repels the blasphemy
with abhorrence. Christ did not bring sin, but unveiled it; he did not take away
righteousness, but stripped the Jews of a false
disguise.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
For if I build again</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The reply consists of two
parts. This is the first part, and informs us that the supposition now made is
at variance with his whole doctrine, since he had preached the faith of Christ
in such a manner as to connect with it the ruin and destruction of sin. For, as
we are taught by John, that Christ came not to build up the kingdom of sin, but
&#8220;that he might destroy the works of the devil,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 3:8,) so Paul declares, that, in preaching the gospel, he had restoreth
true righteousness, in order that sin might be destroyed. It was, therefore, in
the highest degree improbable, that the same person who destroyed sin should
renew its power; and, by stating the absurdity, he repels the
calumny.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I through the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Now follows the direct reply, that we must
not ascribe to Christ that work which properly belongs to the law. It was not
necessary that Christ should destroy the righteousness of the law, for the law
itself slays its disciples. As if he had said, &#8220;You deceive wretched men
by the false notion, that they must live by the law; and, under that pretext,
you keep them in the law. And yet you bring it as a charge against the Gospel,
that it annihilates the righteousness which we have by the law. But it is the
law which forces us to die to itself; for it threatens our destruction, leaves
us nothing but despair, and thus drives us away from trusting to the
law.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage will be better understood by comparing
it with the seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. There Paul describes
beautifully, that no man lives to the law, but he to whom the law is dead, that
is, has lost all power and efficacy; for, as soon as the law begins to live in
us, it inflicts a fatal wound by which we die, and at the same time breathes
life into the man who is already dead to sin. Those who live to the law,
therefore, have never felt the power of the law, or properly understood what the
law means; for the law, when truly perceived, makes us die to itself, and it is
from this source, and not from Christ, that sin proceeds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To die to the
law,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> may either mean that we renounce it, and
are delivered from its dominion, so that we have no confidence in it, and, on
the other hand, that it does not hold us captives under the yoke of slavery; or
it may mean, that, as it allures us all to destruction, we find in it no life.
The latter view appears to be preferable. It is not to Christ, he tells us, that
it is owing that the law is more hurtful than beneficial; but the law carries
within itself the curse which slays us. Hence it follows, that the death which
is brought on by the law is truly deadly. With this is contrasted another kind
of death, in the life-giving fellowship of the cross of Christ. He says, that he
is crucified together with Christ, that he might live unto God. The ordinary
punctuation of this passage obscures the true meaning. It is this: &#8220;I
through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.&#8221; But the
context will read more smoothly thus: &#8220;I through the law am dead to the
law;&#8221; then, in a separate sentence, &#8220;That I might live to God, I am
crucified with Christ.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That I might live to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He shews that the kind of death, on which
the false apostles seized as a ground of quarrel, is a proper object of desire;
for he declares that we are dead to the law, not by any means that we may live
to sin, but that we may live to God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To live to
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> sometimes means to regulate our life
according to his will, so as to study nothing else in our whole life but to gain
his approbation; but here it means to live, if we may be allowed the expression,
the life of God. In this way the various points of the contrast are preserved;
for in whatever sense we are said to die to sin, in the same sense do we live to
God. In short, Paul informs us that this death is not mortal, but is the cause
of a better life; because God snatches us from the shipwreck of the law, and by
his grace raises us up to another life. I say nothing of other interpretations;
but this appears to be the apostle&#8217;s real
meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I am crucified with
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This explains the manner in which we,
who are dead to the law, live to God. Ingrafted into the death of Christ, we
derive from it a secret energy, as the twig does from the root. Again, the
handwriting of the law,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;which was contrary
to us, Christ has nailed to his cross.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Colossians
2:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Being then crucified with him, we are freed from all
the curse and guilt of the law. He who endeavors to set aside that deliverance
makes void the cross of Christ. But let us remember, that we are delivered from
the yoke of the law, only by becoming one with Christ, as the twig draws its sap
from the root, only by growing into one nature.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nevertheless I
live</i></font><font face="Palatino">. To the feelings of man, the word Death is
always unpleasant. Having said that we are &#8220;crucified with Christ,&#8221;
he therefore adds, &#8220;that this makes us alive.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet not I, but Christ liveth in
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This explains what he meant by
&#8220;living to God.&#8221; He does not live by his own life, but is animated
by the secret power of Christ; so that Christ may be said to live and grow in
him; for, as the soul enlivens the body, so Christ imparts life to his members.
It is a remarkable sentiment, that believers live out of themselves, that is,
they live in Christ; which can only be accomplished by holding real and actual
communication with him. Christ lives in us in two ways. The one life consists in
governing us by his Spirit, and directing all our actions; the other, in making
us partakers of his righteousness; so that, while we can do nothing of
ourselves, we are accepted in the sight of God. The first relates to
regeneration, the second to justification by free grace. This passage may be
understood in the latter sense; but if it is thought better to apply it to both,
I will cheerfully adopt that view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the life which I now live in
the flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is hardly a sentence here
which has not been torn by a variety of interpretations. Some understand by the
word <i>flesh</i>, the depravity of sinful nature; but Paul means by it simply
the bodily life, and it is to this that the objection applies. &#8220;You live a
bodily life; but while this corruptible body performs its functions, &#8212;
while it is supported by eating and drinking, this is not the heavenly life of
Christ. It is therefore an unreasonable paradox to assert, that, while you are
openly living after the ordinary manner of men, your life is not your
own.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul replies, that it consists in faith; which
intimates that it is a secret hidden from the senses of man. The life,
therefore, which we attain by faith is not visible to the bodily eye, but is
inwardly perceived in the conscience by the power of the Spirit; so that the
bodily life does not prevent us from enjoying, by faith, a heavenly
life.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He hath made us

<div><font face="Palatino">Paul&#8217;s writings are full of similar assertions,
that, while we live in the world, we at the same time live in heaven; not only
because our Head is there, but because, in virtue of union, we enjoy a life in

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431423&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
14:23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who loved
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is added to express the power of
faith; for it would immediately occur to any one, &#8212; whence does faith
derive such power as to convey into our souls the life of Christ? He accordingly
informs us, that the love of Christ, and his death, are the objects on which
faith rests; for it is in this manner that the effect of faith must be judged.
How comes it that we live by the faith of Christ? Because &#8220;he loved us,
and gave himself for us.&#8221; The love of Christ led him to unite himself to
us, and he completed the union by his death. By giving himself for us, he
suffered in our own person; as, on the other hand, faith makes us partakers of
every thing which it finds in Christ. The mention of love is in accordance with
the saying of the apostle John,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Not that we loved
God, but he anticipated us by his
love.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
John 4:10)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For if any merit of ours had moved him to redeem us,
this reason would have been stated; but now Paul ascribes the whole to love: it
is therefore of free grace. Let us observe the order: &#8220;He loved us, and
gave himself for us.&#8221; As if he had said, &#8220;He had no other reason for
dying, but because he loved us,&#8221; and that &#8220;when we were
enemies,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:10,) as he argues in another Epistle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He gave
himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> No words can properly express what
this means; for who can find language to declare the excellency of the Son of
God? Yet he it is who gave himself as a price for our redemption. Atonement,
cleansing, satisfaction, and all the benefits which we derive from the death of
Christ, are here represented. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa51</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
words </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">, are very emphatic. It will not be enough
for any man to contemplate Christ as having died for the salvation of the world,
unless he has experienced the consequences of this death, and is enabled to
claim it as his own.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa52</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I do not
reject.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is great emphasis in this
expression; for how dreadful is the ingratitude manifested in despising the
grace of God, so invaluable in itself, and obtained at such a price! Yet this
heinous offense is charged against the false apostles, who were not satisfied
with having Christ alone, but introduced some other aids towards obtaining
salvation. For, if we do not renounce all other hopes, and embrace Christ alone,
we reject the grace of God. And what resource is left to the man, who
&#8220;puts from him&#8221; the grace of God, &#8220;and judges himself unworthy
of everlasting life?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441346&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:46.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ is dead in
vain</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> There
would then have been no value in the death of Christ; or, Christ would have died
without any reward; for the reward of his death is, that he has reconciled us to
the Father by making an atonement for our sins. Hence it follows, that we are
justified by his grace, and, therefore, not by works. The Papists explain this
in reference to the ceremonial law; but who does not see that it applies to the
whole law? If we could produce a righteousness of our own, then Christ has
suffered in vain; for the intention of his sufferings was to procure it for us,
and what need was there that a work which we could accomplish for ourselves
should be obtained from another? If the death of Christ be our redemption, then
we were captives; if it be satisfaction, we were debtors; if it be atonement, we
were guilty; if it be cleansing, we were unclean. On the contrary, he who
ascribes to works his sanctification, pardon, atonement, righteousness, or
deliverance, makes void the death of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This argument, we shall perhaps be told, is of no
weight against those who propose to unite the grace of Christ with works; which,
it is universally admitted, was done by the false apostles. The two doctrines,
it is alleged, stand together, that righteousness is by the law, and that we are
redeemed by the death of Christ. True; supposing it were granted that a part of
our righteousness is obtained by works, and a part comes from grace. But such
theology, it may easily be proved, was unknown to Paul. His argument with his
opponents is either conclusive or inconclusive. If any blasphemer shall dare to
accuse him of bad reasoning, a powerful defense is at hand; for that
justification in the sight of God of which he treats, is not what men may
imagine to be sufficient, but what is absolutely perfect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we are not now called to plead in behalf of Paul
against blasphemers, who venture to speak in reproachful language of the Holy
Spirit himself. Our present business is with the Papists. They ridicule us, when
we argue with Paul that, if righteousness come by works, Christ is dead in vain.
They imagine it to be a beautiful reply, with which their sophists furnish them,
that Christ merited for us the first grace, that is, the opportunity of
meriting; and that the merit of his death concurs with the satisfactions of
works for the daily pardon of sins. Let them ridicule Paul, whose language we
quote. They must refute him before they can refute us. We know that he had to
deal with men, who did not entirely reject the grace of Christ, but ascribed the
half of salvation to works. In opposition to them he argues, that &#8220;if
righteousness is by the law, then Christ is dead in vain;&#8221; and by so
doing, he certainly does not allow to works one drop of righteousness. Between
those men and the Papists there is no difference; and therefore, in refuting
them, we are at liberty to employ Paul&#8217;s argument.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O foolish
Galatians</i></font><font face="Palatino">. An expostulation is here interwoven
&#8212; I should rather say, inserted &#8212; amidst his doctrinal statements.
Some will wonder that he did not delay it to the close of the Epistle, but the
very serious nature of the errors which he has brought forward unquestionably
roused him to a burst of passion. When we hear that the Son of God, with all his
benefits, is rejected, that his death is esteemed as nothing, what pious mind
would not break out into indignation? He therefore declares that those who
allowed themselves to be involved in so heinous a crime must have been
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajno&gt;htoi</font><font face="Palatino">,
that is, &#8220;disordered in mind.&#8221; He accuses them not only of having
suffered themselves to be deceived, but of having been carried away by some sort
of magical enchantment,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa54</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which
is a still more serious charge. He insinuates that their fall partook more of
madness than of folly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some think that Paul refers to the temper of the
nation, that, being sprung from barbarians, it was more difficult to train them;
but I rather think that he refers to the subject itself. It looks like something
supernatural, that, after enjoying the gospel in such clearness, they should be
affected by the delusions of Satan. He does not merely say that they were
&#8220;bewitched&#8221; and &#8220;disordered in mind,&#8221; because they did
not obey the truth; but because, after having received instruction so clear, so
full, so tender, and so powerful, they immediately fell away. Erasmus has chosen
to interpret the words, &#8220;that ye should not <i>believe</i> the
truth.&#8221; I am not quite prepared to set aside that rendering, but would
prefer the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>obey</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
because Paul does not charge them with having, from the outset, rejected the
gospel, but with not having persevered in obedience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before whose
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is intended, as I have already
hinted, to express an aggravation; for, the better opportunities they had of
knowing Christ, the more heinous was the criminality of forsaking him. Such, he
tells them, was the clearness of his doctrine, that it was not naked doctrine,
but the express, living image of Christ. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa55</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> They
had known Christ in such a manner, that they might be almost said to have seen
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus Christ hath been evidently
set forth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Augustine&#8217;s interpretation of
the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">proegra&gt;fh</font><font face="Palatino">,
(&#8220;hath been set forth,&#8221;) is harsh, and inconsistent with
Paul&#8217;s design. He makes it to signify that Christ was to be thrust out
from possession. Others propose a different phrase, (<i>proscriptus</i>,) which,
if used in the sense of &#8220;openly proclaimed,&#8221; would not be
inapplicable. The Greeks, accordingly, borrow from this verb the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">progra&gt;mmata</font><font face="Palatino">,
to denote boards on which property intended to be sold was published, so as to
be exposed to the view of all. But the participle, <i>painted</i>, is less
ambiguous, and, in my own opinion, is exceedingly appropriate. To shew how
energetic his preaching was, Paul first compares it to a picture, which
exhibited to them, in a lively manner, the image of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, not satisfied with this comparison, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ hath been crucified among
you,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> intimating that the actual sight of
Christ&#8217;s death could not have affected them more powerfully than his own
preaching. The view given by some, that the Galatians had &#8220;crucified to
themselves
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
6:6) the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame;&#8221; that they had
withdrawn from the purity of the gospel; or, at least, had lent their ear, and
given their confidence, to impostors who crucified him, &#8212; appears to me
overstrained. The meaning therefore is, that Paul&#8217;s doctrine had
instructed them concerning Christ in such a manner as if he had been exhibited
to them in a picture, nay, &#8220;crucified among them.&#8221; Such a
representation could not have been made by any eloquence, or by &#8220;enticing
words of man&#8217;s wisdom,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:4,) had it not been accompanied by that power of the Spirit, of
which Paul has treated largely in both the Epistles to the
Corinthians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let those who would discharge aright the ministry of
the gospel learn, not merely to speak and declaim, but to penetrate into the
consciences of men, to make them see Christ crucified, and feel the shedding of
his blood. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa56</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When
the Church has painters such as these, she no longer needs the dead images of
wood and stone, she no longer requires pictures; both of which, unquestionably,
were first admitted to Christian temples when the pastors had become dumb and
been converted into mere idols, or when they uttered a few words from the pulpit
in such a cold and careless manner, that the power and efficacy of the ministry
were utterly extinguished.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This one I wish to learn from
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now proceeds to support his cause by
additional arguments. The first is drawn from their experience, for he reminds
them in what manner the gospel was introduced among themselves. When they heard
the gospel, they received the Spirit. It was not to the law, therefore, but to
faith, that they owed the reception of this benefit. This same argument is
employed by Peter in the defense which he makes to his brethren for having
baptized uncircumcised persons.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441047&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
10:47.) Paul and Barnabas followed the same course in the debate which they
maintained at Jerusalem on this subject.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:2, 12.) There was therefore manifest ingratitude in not submitting to the
doctrine, by means of which they had received the Holy Spirit. The opportunity
which he gives them to reply is expressive not of doubt, but of greater
confidence: for their convictions, founded on their own experience, forced them
to acknowledge that it was true.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is here put, by a figure of speech, for the gospel, which is elsewhere called
&#8220;the law of faith,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450327&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:27,) because it exhibits to us the free grace of God in Christ, without any
merit of works. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"> means here, I think, the grace of
regeneration, which is common to all believers; though I have no objection to
understand it as referring to the peculiar gifts by which the Lord, at that
period, honored the preaching of the gospel. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa57</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be objected, that the Spirit was not, in this
respect, given to all. But, it was enough for Paul&#8217;s purpose, that the
Galatians knew that the power of the Holy Spirit in his Church had accompanied
Paul&#8217;s doctrine, and that believers were variously endowed with the gifts
of the Spirit for general edification. It may likewise be objected, that those
gifts were not infallible signs of adoption, and so do not apply to the present
question. I reply, that it was enough that the Lord had confirmed the doctrine
of Paul by the visible gifts of his Spirit. A still simpler view of the case is,
that they had been distinguished by the ordinary privilege of adoption, before
those impostors had brought forward their additions. &#8220;In whom,&#8221; says
he to the Ephesians,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;ye also trusted, after that ye
heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, after that
ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
1:13.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Are ye so
foolish?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Commentators are not agreed as to what

Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He alludes, in my opinion, to what he
had said about the Spirit. As if he had said, &#8220;As the doctrine of the
gospel brought to you the Holy Spirit, the commencement of your course was
spiritual; but now ye have fallen into a worse condition, and may be said to
have fallen from the Spirit into the flesh.&#8221; The flesh denotes either
outward and fading flyings, such as ceremonies are, particularly when they are
separated from Christ; or it denotes dead and fading doctrine. There was a
strange inconsistency between their splendid commencement and their future
progress.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have ye suffered so many
things?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is another argument. Having
suffered so many things in behalf of the gospel, would they now, in an instant,
lose it all? Nay, he puts it in the way of reproach, if they were willing to
lose the advantage of so many illustrious struggles which they had made for the
faith. If the true faith had not been delivered to them by Paul, it was rash to
suffer anything in defense of a bad cause; but they had experienced the presence
of God amidst their persecutions. Accordingly, he charges the false apostles
with ill-will in depriving the Galatians of such valuable ornaments. But to
mitigate the severity of this complaint, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if it be yet in
vain</i></font><font face="Palatino">; thus inspiring their minds with the
expectation of something better, and rousing them to the exercise of repentance.
For the intention of all chastisement is, not to drive men to despair, but to
lead them to a better course.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He therefore that
ministereth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He is not now speaking of the
grace of regeneration, but of the other gifts of the Spirit; for a subject
different from the preceding one is manifestly introduced. He warns them that
all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, in which they excelled, are the fruits of the
gospel, of that gospel which had been preached among them by his own lips. Their
new teachers deprived them of those gifts when they left the gospel, and fled to
another kind of doctrine. In proportion to the value which they attached to
those gifts, to which the apostle here adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>miracles</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
they ought the more carefully and resolutely to adhere to the
gospel.</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">Having appealed to facts and experience, he now
gives quotations from Scripture. And first, he brings forward the example of
Abraham. Arguments drawn from examples are not always so conclusive, but this is
one of the most powerful, because neither in the subject nor in the person is
there any ground of exception. There is no variety of roads to righteousness,
and so Abraham is called &#8220;the father of all them that believe,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:11,) because he is a pattern adapted to all; nay, in his person has been laid
down to us the universal rule for obtaining righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">6.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even as
Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We must here supply some such phrase
as <i>but rather</i>; for, having put a question, he resolved instantly to cut
off every ground of hesitation. At least the phrase
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>even
as</i></font><font face="Palatino">,&#8221;
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kaqw&lt;v</font><font face="Palatino">,)
refers only to the verse immediately preceding, to the &#8220;ministration of
the Spirit and of miracles by the hearing of faith;&#8221; as if he had said,
that, in the grace bestowed on them, a similarity might be found to the case of
Abraham.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Believed
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this quotation he proves both here, and
in the 4th chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, that men are justified by
faith, because the faith of Abraham
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>was accounted to him, for
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450403&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:3.) We must here inquire briefly, first, what Paul intends by <i>faith</i>;
secondly, what is <i>righteousness</i>; and thirdly, why faith is represented to
be a cause of justification. Faith does not mean any kind of conviction which
men may have of the truth of God; for though Cain had a hundred times exercised
faith in God when denouncing punishment against him, this had nothing to do with
obtaining righteousness. Abraham was justified by believing, because, when he
received from God a promise of fatherly kindness, he embraced it as certain.
Faith therefore has a relation and respect to such a divine promise as may
enable men to place their trust and confidence in God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
we must attend to the phraseology of Moses. When he says, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;he believed in the
Lord,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and he counted it to him for
righteousness,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;011506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
15:6,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he intimates that that person is righteous who is
reckoned as such in the sight of God. Now, since men have not righteousness
dwelling within themselves, they obtain this by imputation; because God holds
their faith as accounted for righteousness. We are therefore said to be
&#8220;justified by faith,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450328&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:28; 5:1,) not because faith infuses into us a habit or quality, but because we
are accepted by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why does faith receive such honor as to be
entitled a cause of our justification? First, we must observe, that it is merely
an instrumental cause; for, strictly speaking, our righteousness is nothing else
than God&#8217;s free acceptance of us, on which our salvation is founded. But
as the Lord testifies his love and grace in the gospel, by offering to us that
righteousness of which I have spoken, so we receive it by faith. And thus, when
we ascribe to faith a man&#8217;s justification, we are not treating of the
principal cause, but merely pointing out the way in which men arrive at true
righteousness. For this righteousness is not a quality which exists in men, but
is the mere gift of God, and is enjoyed by faith only; and not even as a reward
justly due to faith, but because we receive by faith what God freely gives. All
such expressions as the following are of similar import: We are &#8220;justified
freely by his grace.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:24.) Christ is our righteousness. The mercy of God is the cause of our
righteousness. By the death and resurrection of Christ, righteousness has been
procured for us. Righteousness is bestowed on us through the gospel. We obtain
righteousness by faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence appears the ridiculousness of the blunder of
attempting to reconcile the two propositions, that we are justified by faith,
and that we are justified at the same time by works; for he who is &#8220;just
by faith&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
2:4
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581038&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
10:38) is poor and destitute of personal righteousness, and relies on the grace
of God alone. And this is the reason why Paul, in the Epistle to the Romans,
concludes that Abraham, having obtained righteousness by faith, had no right to
glory before God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:2.) For it is not said that faith was imputed to him for a part of
righteousness, but simply for righteousness; so that his faith was truly his
righteousness. Besides, faith looks at nothing but the mercy of God, and a dead
and risen Christ. All merit of works is thus excluded from being the cause of
justification, when the whole is ascribed to faith. For faith, &#8212; so far as
it embraces the undeserved goodness of God, Christ with all his benefits, the
testimony of our adoption which is contained in the gospel, &#8212; is
universally contrasted with the law, with the merit of works, and with human
excellence. The notion of the sophists, that it is contrasted with ceremonies
alone, will presently be disproved, with little difficulty, from the context.
Let us therefore remember, that those who are righteous by faith, are righteous
out of themselves, that is, in Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence, too, we obtain a refutation of the idle
cavilling of certain persons who evade Paul&#8217;s reasoning. Moses they tell
us, gives the name of righteousness to goodness; and so means nothing more than
that Abraham was reckoned a good man, because he believed God. Giddy minds of
this description, raised up in our time by Satan, endeavor, by indirect
slanders, to undermine the certainty of Scripture. Paul knew that Moses was not
there giving lessons to boys in grammar, but was speaking of a decision which
God had pronounced, and very properly viewed the word righteousness in a
theological sense. For it is not in that sense in which goodness is mentioned
with approbation among men, that we are accounted righteous in the sight of God,
but only where we render perfect obedience to the law. Righteousness is
contrasted with the transgression of the law, even in its smallest point; and
because we have it not from ourselves, it is freely given to us by
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here the Jews object that Paul has completely
tortured the words of Moses to suit his own purpose; for Moses does not here
treat of Christ, or of eternal life, but only mentions an earthly inheritance.
The Papists are not very different from the Jews; for, though they do not
venture to inveigh against Paul, they entirely evade his meaning. Paul, we
reply, takes for granted, what Christians hold to be a first principle, that
whatever promises the Lord made to Abraham were appendages of that first
promise,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I am thy shield,

<div><font face="Palatino">he did not limit his view to that word, but included
it in the grace of adoption as a part of the whole, and, in the same manner,
every other promise was viewed by him as a testimony of God&#8217;s fatherly
kindness, which tended to strengthen his hope of salvation. Unbelievers differ
from the children of God in this respect, that, while they enjoy in common with
them the bounties of Providence, they devour them like cattle, and look no
higher. The children of God, on the other hand, knowing that all their blessings
have been sanctified by the promises, acknowledge God in them as their Father.
They are often directed, in this way, to the hope of eternal life; for they
begin with the faith of their adoption, which is the foundation of the whole.
Abraham was not justified merely because he believed that God would
&#8220;multiply his seed,&#8221;

that those &#8220;are of faith,&#8221; who have relinquished all confidence in
works, and rely on the promise of God alone. It is on the authority of Paul
himself that we give this interpretation; for in the Epistle to the Romans he
thus writes:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;To him that worketh is the reward
not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth
on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is accounted for
righteousness.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">To be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">, therefore, is to rest their
righteousness and hope of salvation on the mercy of God. That such are the
children of God he concludes from the preceding statement; for if Abraham was
justified by faith those who wish to be his children must likewise abide firmly
by faith. He has omitted one remark, which will be readily supplied, that there
is no place in the church for any man who is not a son of
Abraham.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The scripture
foreseeing</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What he had said in a general
manner is now applied expressly to the Gentiles; for the calling of the Gentiles
was a new and extraordinary occurrence. Doubts existed as to the manner in which
they should be called. Some thought that they were required &#8220;to be
circumcised and to keep the law,&#8221; (Acts 15:24,) and that otherwise they
were shut out from having a share in the covenant. But Paul shews, on the other
hand, that by faith they arrive at the blessing, and by faith they must be
&#8220;in grafted&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
11:17, 24,) into the family of Abraham. How does he prove this? Because it is
said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In thee shall all nations
be blessed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. These words unquestionably recall
that all must be blessed in the same manner as Abraham; for he is the model,
nay, the rule, to be universally observed. Now, he obtained the blessing by
faith, and in the same manner must it be obtained by
all.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Faithful
Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This expression is very emphatic. They
<i>are blessed</i>, not with Abraham as circumcised, nor as entitled to boast of
the works of the law, nor as a Hebrew, nor as relying on his own excellence, but
with Abraham, who by faith alone obtained the blessing; for no personal quality
is here taken into the account, but faith alone. The word Blessing is variously
employed in Scripture: but here it signifies Adoption into the inheritance of
eternal life.</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For as many as are of the works
of the law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The argument is drawn from the
contradictory nature of the two schemes; for the same fountain does not yield
both hot and cold. The law holds all living men under its curse; and from the
law, therefore, it is in vain to expect a blessing. They are declared to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the works of the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino"> who place their trust for salvation in
those works; for such modes of expression must always be interpreted by the
state of the question. Now, we know that the controversy here relates to
righteousness. All who wish to be justified by the works of the law are declared
to be liable to the curse. But how does he prove this? The sentence of the law
is, that all who have transgressed any part of the law are cursed. Let us now
see if there be any living man who fulfils the law. But no such person, it is
evident, has been, or ever can be found. All to a man are here condemned. The
minor and the conclusion are wanting, for the entire syllogism would run thus:
&#8220;Whoever has come short in any part of the law is cursed; all are held
chargeable with this guilt; therefore all are cursed.&#8221; This argument of
Paul would not stand, if we had sufficient strength to fulfill the law; for
there would then be a fatal objection to the minor proposition. Either Paul
reasons badly, or it is impossible for men to fulfill the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">An antagonist might now object: &#8220;I admit that
all transgressors are accursed; what then? Men will be found who keep the law;
for they are free to choose good or evil.&#8221; But Paul places here beyond
controversy, what the Papists at this day hold to be a detestable doctrine, that
men are destitute of strength to keep the law. And so he concludes boldly that
all are cursed, because all have been commanded to keep the law perfectly; which
implies that in the present corruption of our nature the power of keeping it
perfectly is wanting. Hence we conclude that the curse which the law pronounces,
though, in the phrase of logicians, it is <i>accidental</i>, is here perpetual
and inseparable from its nature. The blessing which it offers to us is excluded
by our depravity, so that the curse alone
remains.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But that no man, is justified by
the law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again argues from a comparison of
contradictory schemes. &#8220;If we are justified by faith, it is not by the
law: but we are justified by faith therefore it is not by the law.&#8221; The
minor is proved by a passage from Habakkuk, which is also quoted in the Epistle
to the Romans.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;350204&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Habakkuk
2:4;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:17.) The major is proved by the difference in the methods of justification.
The law justifies him who fulfils all its precepts, while faith justifies those
who are destitute of the merit of works, and who rely on Christ alone. To be
justified by our own merit, and to be justified by the grace of another, are two
schemes which cannot be reconciled: one of them must be overturned by the other.
Such is the amount of the argument: let us now attend to the separate
clauses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The just shall live by
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As we had occasion to expound this
passage where it occurs in the Epistle to the Romans, it will be unnecessary to
repeat the exposition of it here. The prophet evidently describes a proud
confidence in the flesh as contrasted with true faith. He declares, that
&#8220;the just shall live;&#8221; by which he means, not that they are
supported for a short period, and liable to be overwhelmed by an approaching
storm; but that they shall continue to live, and that, even amidst the most
imminent danger, their life shall be preserved. There is therefore no weight in
the scornful reproaches of our adversaries, who allege that the prophet there
employs the word Faith in a wider acceptation than Paul does in this passage. By
Faith he evidently means the exercise of a calm, steady conscience, relying on
God alone; so that Paul&#8217;s quotation is properly
applied.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the law is not of
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The law evidently is not contrary to
faith; otherwise God would be unlike himself; but we must return to a principle
already noticed, that Paul&#8217;s language is modified by the present aspect of
the case. The contradiction between the law and faith lies in the matter of
justification. You will more easily unite fire and water, than reconcile these
two statements, that men are justified by faith, and that they are justified by
the law. &#8220;The law is not of faith;&#8221; that is, it has a method of
justifying a man which is wholly at variance with faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the man who shall do these
things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The difference lies in this, that man,
when he fulfils the law, is reckoned righteous by a legal righteousness, which
he proves by a quotation from Moses.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
18:5.) Now, what is the righteousness of faith? He defines it in the Epistle to
the Romans,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;If thou shalt confess with thy
mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him
from the dead,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">thou shalt be
saved.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451009&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
10:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And yet it does not follow from this, that faith is
inactive, or that it sets believers free from good works. For the present
question is not, whether believers ought to keep the law as far as they can,
(which is beyond all doubt,) but whether they can obtain righteousness by works,
which is impossible. But since God promises life to the doers of the law, why
does Paul affirm that they are not righteous? The reply to this objection is
easy. There are none righteous by the works of the law, because there are none
who do those works. We admit that the doers of the law, if there were any such,
are righteous; but since that is a conditional agreement, all are excluded from
life, because no man performs that righteousness which he ought. We must bear in
memory what I have already stated, that to do the law is not to obey it in part,
but to fulfill everything which belongs to righteousness; and all are at the
greatest distance from such
perfection.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ hath redeemed
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The apostle had made all who are under the
law subject to the curse; from which arose this great difficulty, that the Jews
could not free themselves from the curse of the law. Having stated this
difficulty, he meets it, by shewing that Christ hath made us free, which still
farther aids his purpose. If we are saved, because we have been freed from the
curse of the law, then righteousness is not by the law. He next points out the
manner in which we are made free.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is written, Cursed is every one
that hangeth on a tree</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Now, Christ hung upon
the cross, therefore he fell under that curse. But it is certain that he did not
suffer that punishment on his own account. It follows, therefore, either that he
was crucified in vain, or that our curse was laid upon him, in order that we
might be delivered from it. Now, he does not say that Christ was cursed, but,
which is still more, that he was <i>a curse</i>, &#8212; intimating, that the
curse &#8220;of all men
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa59</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was
laid upon him&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
53:6.) If any man think this language harsh, let him be ashamed of the cross of
Christ, in the confession of which we glory. It was not unknown to God what
death his own Son would die, when he pronounced the law, &#8220;He that is
hanged is accursed of God.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
21:23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But how does it happen, it will be asked, that a
beloved Son is cursed by his Father? We reply, there are two things which must
be considered, not only in the person of Christ, but even in his human nature.
The one is, that he was the unspotted Lamb of God, full of blessing and of
grace; the other is, that he placed himself in our room, and thus became a
sinner, and subject to the curse, not in himself indeed, but in us, yet in such
a manner, that it became necessary for him to occupy our place. He could not
cease to be the object of his Father&#8217;s love, and yet he endured his wrath.
For how could he reconcile the Father to us, if he had incurred his hatred and
displeasure? We conclude, that he &#8220;did always those things that
pleased&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430829&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
8:29) his Father. Again, how would he have freed us from the wrath of God, if he
had not transferred it from us to himself? Thus, &#8220;he was wounded for our
transgressions,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
53:5,) and had to deal with God as an angry judge. This is the foolishness of
the cross,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:18,) and the admiration of angels,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:12,) which not only exceeds, but swallows up, all the wisdom of the
world.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the blessing of
Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Having said that &#8220;Christ hath
redeemed us from the curse of the law&#8221; he now applies that statement more
closely to his purpose. The promised blessing of Abraham is founded on this, and
flows from it to the Gentiles. If the Jews must be delivered from the law, in
order to become the heirs of Abraham, what shall hinder the Gentiles from
obtaining the same benefit? And if that blessing is found in Christ alone, it is
faith in Christ which alone brings it into our possession.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The promise of the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"> appears to me to mean, agreeably to a
Hebrew idiom, a spiritual promise. Although that promise relates to the New
Testament, &#8220;I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;290228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joel
2:28,) yet, in this passage, Paul refers to another subject. The spirit is here
contrasted with all outward things, not with ceremonies merely, but with lineal
descent, so as to leave no room for diversity of rank. From the nature of the
promise, he proves that Jews differ nothing from Gentiles; because, if it is
spiritual, it is received by faith alone.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I speak after the manner of
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this expression he intended to put them
to the blush. It is highly disgraceful and base that the testimony of God should
have less weight with us than that of a mortal man. In demanding that the sacred
covenant of God shall receive not less deference than is commonly yielded to
ordinary human transactions, he does not place God on a level with men. The
immense distance between God and men is still left for their
consideration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Though it be but a man&#8217;s
covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is an argument from the less to
the greater. Human contracts are admitted on all hands to be binding: how much
more what God has established? The Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diaqh&gt;kh</font><font face="Palatino">,
here used, signifies more frequently, what the Latin versions here render it,
(<i>testamentum</i>,) a<i> testament</i>; but sometimes too, a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
though in this latter sense the plural number is more generally employed. It is
of little importance to the present passage, whether you explain it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covenant</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or <i>testament</i>. The case is different with the Epistle to the Hebrews,
where the apostle unquestionably alludes to testaments,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
9:16, 17;) but here I prefer to take it simply for the covenant which God made.
The analogy from which the apostle argues, would not apply so strictly to a
testament as to a covenant. The apostle appears to reason from human bargains to
that solemn covenant into which God entered with Abraham. If human bargains be
so firm that they can receive no addition, how much more must this covenant
remain inviolable?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now to Abraham, and his
seed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Before pursuing his argument, he
introduces an observation about the substance of the covenant, that it rests on
Christ alone. But if Christ be the foundation of the bargain, it follows that it
is of free grace; and this too is the meaning of the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>promise</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
As the law has respect to men and to their works, so the promise has respect to
the grace of God and to faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He saith not, And to
seeds.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To prove that in this place God speaks
of Christ, he calls attention to the singular number as denoting some particular
seed. I have often been astonished that Christians, when they saw this passage
so perversely tortured by the Jews, did not make a more determined resistance;
for all pass it slightly as if it were an indisputed territory. And yet there is
much plausibility in their objection. Since the word <i>seed</i> is a collective
noun, Paul appears to reason inconclusively, when he contends that a single
individual is denoted by this word, under which all the descendants of Abraham
are comprehended in a passage already quoted, &#8220;In multiplying I will
multiply thy seed,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">[rz</font><font face="Palatino">

the sea-shore.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:17.) Having, as they imagine, detected the fallacy of the argument, they
treat us with haughty triumph.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I am the more surprised that our own writers should
have been silent on this head, as we have abundant means of repelling their
slander. Among Abraham&#8217;s own sons a division began, for one of the sons
was cut off from the family. &#8220;In Isaac shall thy seed be called.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
21:12.) Consequently Ishmael is not included in the reckoning. Let us come a
step lower. Do the Jews allow that the posterity of Esau are the blessed seed?
nay, it will be maintained that their father, though the first-born, was struck
off. And how many nations have sprung from the stock of Abraham who have no
share in this &#8220;calling?&#8221; The twelve patriarchs, at length, formed
twelve heads, not because they were descended from the line of Abraham, but
because they had been appointed by a particular election of God. Since the ten
tribes were carried away, (Hosa 9:17,) how many thousands have so degenerated
that they no longer hold a name among the seed of Abraham? Lastly, a trial was
made of the tribe of Judah, that the real succession to the blessing might be
transmitted among a small people. And this had been predicted by
Isaiah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Though thy people
Israel be as the sand of the
sea,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">yet a remnant of them shall
return.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231022&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
10:22.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hitherto I have said nothing which the Jews
themselves do not acknowledge. Let them answer me then; how comes it that the
thirteen tribes sprung from the twelve patriarchs were the seed of Abraham, in
preference to Ishmaelites and Edomites? Why do they exclusively glory in that
name, and set aside the others as a spurious seed? They will, no doubt, boast
that they have obtained it by their own merit; but Scripture, on the contrary,
asserts that all depends on the calling of God; for we must constantly return to
the privilege conveyed in these words, &#8220;In Isaac shall thy seed be
called.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
21:12.) The uninterrupted succession to this privilege must have been in force
until Christ; for, in the person of David, the Lord afterwards brought back by
recovery, as we might say, the promise which had been made to Abraham. In
proving, therefore, that this prediction applies to a single individual, Paul
does not make his argument rest on the use of the singular number. He merely
shews that the word <i>seed</i> must denote one who was not only descended from
Abraham according to the flesh, but had been likewise appointed for this purpose
by the calling of God. If the Jews deny this, they will only make themselves
ridiculous by their obstinacy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as Paul likewise argues from these words, that a
covenant had been made in Christ, or to Christ, let us inquire into the force of
that expression,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;In thy seed shall
all the nations of the earth be
blessed.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
22:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Jews taunt the apostle with making a comparison,
as if the seed of Abraham were to be quoted as an example in all disastrous
omens and prayers; while, on the contrary, to curse in Sodom or Israel is to
employ the name of Sodom or Israel in forms of cursing. This, I own, is
sometimes the case, but not always; for to bless one&#8217;s self in God has
quite a different meaning, as the Jews themselves admit. Since, therefore, the
phrase is ambiguous, denoting sometimes a cause and sometimes a comparison,
wherever, it occurs, it must be explained by the context. We have ascertained,
then, that we are all cursed by nature, and that the blessing of Abraham has
been promised to all nations. Do all indiscriminately reach it? Certainly not,
but those only who are &#8220;gathered&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;236608&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
66:8) to the Messiah; for when, under His government and direction, they are
collected into one body, they then become one people. Whoever then, laying
disputing aside, shall inquire into the truth, will readily acknowledge that the
words here signify not a mere comparison but a cause; and hence it follows that
Paul had good ground for saying, that the covenant was made in Christ, or in
reference to Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The law which was four hundred
and thirty years after</i></font><font face="Palatino">. If we listen to Origen
and Jerome and all the Papists, there will be little difficulty in refuting this
argument. Paul reasons thus: &#8220;A promise was given to Abraham four hundred
and thirty years before the publication of the law; therefore the law which came
after could not disannul the promise; and hence he concludes that ceremonies are
not necessary.&#8221; But it may be objected, the sacraments were given in order
to preserve the faith, and why should Paul separate them from the promise? He
does so separate them, and proceeds to argue on the matter. The ceremonies
themselves are not so much considered by him as something higher, &#8212; the
effect of justification which was attributed to them by false apostles, and the
obligation on the conscience. From ceremonies, accordingly, he takes occasion to
discuss the whole subject of faith and works. If the point in dispute had no
connection with obtaining righteousness, with the merit of works, or with
ensnaring the conscience, ceremonies would be quite consistent with the
promise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, then, is meant by this <i>disannulling</i> of
the promise, against which the apostle contends? The impostors denied that
salvation is freely promised to men, and received by faith, and, as we shall
presently see, urged the necessity of works in order to merit salvation. I
return to Paul&#8217;s own language. &#8220;The law,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is
later than the promise, and therefore does not revoke it; for a covenant once
sanctioned must remain perpetually binding.&#8221; I again repeat, if you do not
understand that the promise is free, there will be no force in the statement;
for the law and the promise are not at variance but on this single point, that
the law justifies a man by the merit of works, and the promise bestows
righteousness freely. This is made abundantly clear when he calls it a
<i>covenant</i> founded on Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here we shall have the Papists to oppose us, for
they will find a ready method of evading this argument. &#8220;We do not
require,&#8221; they will say, &#8220;that the old ceremonies shall be any
longer binding; let them be laid out of the question; nevertheless a man is
justified by the moral law. For this law, which is as old as the creation of
man, went before God&#8217;s covenant with Abraham; so that Paul&#8217;s
reasoning is either frivolous, or it holds against ceremonies alone.&#8221; I
answer, Paul took into account what was certainly true, that, except by a
covenant with God, no reward is due to works. Admitting, then, that the law
justifies, yet before the law men could not merit salvation by works, because
there was no covenant. All that I am now affirming is granted by the scholastic
theologians: for they maintain that works are meritorious of salvation, not by
their intrinsic worth, but by the acceptance of God, (to use their own phrase,)
and on the ground of a covenant. Consequently, where no divine covenant, no
declaration of acceptance is found, &#8212; no works will be available for
justification: so that Paul&#8217;s argument is perfectly conclusive. He tells
us that God made two covenants with men; one through Abraham, and another
through Moses. The former, being founded on Christ, was free; and therefore the
law, which came after, could not enable men to obtain salvation otherwise than
by grace, for then, &#8220;it would make the promise of none effect.&#8221; That
this is the meaning appears clearly from what immediately
follows.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If the inheritance be of the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. His opponents might still reply, that
nothing was farther from their intention than to weaken or disannul God&#8217;s
covenant. To deprive them of every kind of subterfuge, he comes forward with the
assertion, that salvation by the law, and salvation by the promise of God, are
wholly inconsistent with each other. Who will dare to explain this as applying
to ceremonies alone, while Paul comprehends under it whatever interferes with a
free promise? Beyond all doubt, he excludes works of every description.
&#8220;For,&#8221; says he to the Romans,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;if they which are
of the law be heirs, faith is made
void,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and the promise made of none
effect.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
4:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why so? Because salvation would be suspended on the
condition of satisfying the law; and so he immediately
concludes:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Therefore it is of
faith, that it might be by grace, in order that the promise might be sure to all
the seed.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
4:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us carefully remember the reason why, in
comparing the promise with the law, the establishment of the one overturns the
other. The reason is, that the promise has respect to faith, and the law to
works. Faith receives what is freely given, but to works a reward is paid. And
he immediately adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God gave it
to Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino">, not by requiring some sort of
compensation on his part, but by free promise; for if you view it as
conditional, the word <i>gave</i>,

would be utterly inapplicable.</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino">When we are told that the law has no influence in
obtaining justification, various suggestions immediately arise, that it must be
either useless, or opposed to God&#8217;s covenant, or something of that sort.
Nay, it might occur, why should we not say of the law, what Jeremiah says of the
New Testament,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;243131&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:31,) that it was given at a later period, in order to supply the weakness of
the former doctrine? Objections of this kind must be answered, if Paul wished to
satisfy the Galatians. First, then, he inquires, &#8212; what is the use of the
law? Having come after the promise, it appears to have been intended to supply
its defects; and there was room at least for doubting, whether the promise would
have been effectual, if it had not been aided by the law. Let it be observed,
that Paul does not speak of the moral law only, but of everything connected with
the office held by Moses. That office, which was peculiar to Moses, consisted in
laying down a rule of life and ceremonies to be observed in the worship of God,
and in afterwards adding promises and threatenings. Many promises, no doubt,
relating to the free mercy of God and to Christ, are to be found in his
writings; and these promises belong to faith. But this must be viewed as
accidental, and altogether foreign to the inquiry, so far as a comparison is
made between the law and the doctrine of grace. Let it be remembered, that the
amount of the question is this: When a promise had been made, why did Moses
afterwards add that new condition, &#8220;If a man do, he shall live in
them;&#8221; and, &#8220;Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this
law to do them?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;031805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Leviticus
18:5;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;052726&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
27:26.) Was it to produce something better and more perfect?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">19.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because of
transgressions</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The law has manifold uses, but
Paul confines himself to that which bears on his present subject. He did not
propose to inquire in how many ways the law is of advantage to men. It is
necessary to put readers on their guard on this point; for very many, I find,
have fallen into the mistake of acknowledging no other advantage belonging to
the law, but what is expressed in this passage. Paul himself elsewhere speaks of
the precepts of the law as profitable for doctrine and exhortations.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 3:16.) The definition here given of the use of the law is not complete,
and those who refuse to make any other acknowledgment in favor of the law do
wrong. Now, what is the import of the phrase, <i>because of transgressions</i>?
It agrees with the saying of philosophers, that &#8220;The law was made for
restraining evil-doers,&#8221; and with the old proverb, &#8220;From bad manners
have sprung good laws.&#8221; But Paul&#8217;s meaning is more extensive than
the words may seem to convey. He means that the law was published in order to
make known transgressions, and in this way to compel men to acknowledge their
guilt. As men naturally are too ready to excuse themselves, so, until they are
roused by the law, their consciences are asleep.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Until the
law,&#8221; says Paul, &#8220;sin was in the
world:</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">but sin is not imputed where
there is no law.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
5:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The law came and roused the sleepers, for this is the
true preparation for Christ. &#8220;By the law is the knowledge of sin.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450320&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:20.) Why?</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;That Sin by the
commandment might become exceeding sinful.&#8221; (Romans
7:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus, &#8220;the law was added because of
transgressions,&#8221; in order to reveal their true character, or, as he tells
the Romans, that it might make them to abound.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage has tortured the ingenuity of Origen,
but to no purpose. If God summon consciences to his tribunal, that those
qualities in their transgression, which would otherwise give them pleasure, may
humble them by a conviction of guilt, &#8212; if he shake off the listlessness
which overwhelmed all dread of his judgment-seat, &#8212; if he drag to light;
sin, which lurked like a thief in the den of hypocrisy, &#8212; what is there in
all this that can be reckoned absurd? But it may be objected: &#8220;As the law
is the rule of a devout and holy life, why is it said to be added &#8216;because
of transgressions,&#8217; rather than &#8216;because of obedience?&#8217;&#8221;
I answer, however much it may point out true righteousness, yet, owing to the
corruption of our nature, its instruction tends only to increase transgressions,
until the Spirit of regeneration come, who writes it on the heart; and that
Spirit is not given by the law, but is received by faith. This saying of Paul,
let the reader remember, is not of a philosophical or political character, but
expresses a purpose of the law, with which the world had been always
unacquainted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Till the seed should
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">. If it has respect <i>to seed</i>, it must
be to that on which the blessing has been pronounced, and therefore it does not
interfere with the promise. The word till,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">a]criv
ou=</font><font face="Palatino">,) signifies <i>so long as</i> the seed is
expected: and hence it follows, that it must have been intended to occupy not
the highest, but a subordinate rank. It was given in order to rouse men to the
expectation of Christ. But was it necessary that it should last only until the
coming of Christ? For if so, it follows that it is now abolished. The whole of
that administration, I reply, was temporal, and was given for the purpose of
preserving among the ancient people an attachment to the faith of Christ. And
yet I do not admit that, by the coming of Christ, the whole law was abolished.
The apostle did not intend this, but merely that the mode of administration,
which for a time had been introduced, must receive its accomplishment in Christ,
who is the fulfillment of the promise. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But on
this subject we shall have occasion to speak more fully
afterwards.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ordained by
angels</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The circumstance, that it was delivered
through angels, tends to the commendation of the law. This is declared by
Stephen
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440753&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
7:53) also, who says, that they had &#8220;received the law,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv diataga&lt;v
ajgge&gt;lwn</font><font face="Palatino">,) into the dispositions of
angels.&#8221; The interpretation given by some, that Moses and Aaron, and the
priests, are the angels here meant, is more ingenious than solid. Nor is it
wonderful that angels, by whom God bestows on us some of the smallest of his
blessings, should have been intrusted also with this office of attending as
witnesses at the promulgation of the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the hand of a
Mediator</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hand</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">usually signifies ministration; but as angels were
ministers in giving the law, I consider &#8220;the hand of the Mediator&#8221;
to denote the highest rank of service. The Mediator was at the head of the
embassy, and angels were united with him as his companions. Some apply this
expression to Moses, as marking a comparison between Moses and Christ; but I
agree rather with the ancient expositors, who apply it to Christ himself. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa61</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
view, it will be found, agrees better with the context, though I differ from the
ancients likewise as to the meaning of the word.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mediator</i>

<div><font face="Palatino">&#8212; but an ambassador employed in promulgating a
law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are thus to understand, that, since the beginning
of the world, God has held no intercourse with men, but through the agency of
his eternal Wisdom or Son. Hence Peter says, that the holy prophets spake by the
&#8220;Spirit of Christ,&#8221; (1 Peter 1:11,) and Paul makes him the leader of
the people in the wilderness.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 10:4.) And certainly the Angel who appeared to Moses,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;020302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
3:2,) can be no other person; for he claims to himself the peculiar and
essential name of God, which is never applied to creatures. As he is the
Mediator of reconciliation, by whom we are accepted of God, &#8212; the Mediator
of intercession, who opens up for us a way to &#8220;call on the Father,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600117&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:17,) &#8212; so he has always been the Mediator of all doctrine, because
by him God has always revealed himself to men. And this he intended to state
expressly, for the purpose of informing the Galatians, that he who is the
foundation of the covenant of grace, held also the highest rank in the giving of
the law.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now, a mediator is not a
mediator of one.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some are disposed to
philosophize on this expression, and would make Paul&#8217;s meaning to be, that
the twofold nature of Christ is not one in essence. But that Paul is here
speaking of the contracting parties, no man of sound judgment entertains a
doubt. And so they commonly expound it, that there is no room for a Mediator,
unless when one of the parties has a matter to transact with the other. But why
that statement should have been introduced they leave undetermined, though the
passage manifestly deserves the most careful attention. There may, perhaps, be
an Anticipation
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pro&gt;lhyiv</font><font face="Palatino">)
of some wicked thought that might arise about a change of the divine purpose.
Some one might say, &#8220;As men, when they change their mind about their
covenants, are wont to retract them, so has it happened with the covenants of
God.&#8221; If you take this to be the meaning, then, in the former clause, Paul
would acknowledge that men, who occupy one side of this contract, are unsteady
and changeable, while God nevertheless remains the same, is consistent with
himself, and partakes not of the unsteadiness of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when I take a closer view of the whole subject, I
rather think that it marks a difference between Jews and Gentiles. Christ is not
the Mediator of one, because, in respect of outward character, there is a
diversity of condition among those with whom, through his mediation, God enters
into covenant. But Paul asserts that we have no right to judge in this manner of
the covenant of God, as if it contradicted itself, or varied according to the
diversities of men. The words are now clear. As Christ formerly reconciled God
to the Jews in making a covenant, so now he is the Mediator of the Gentiles. The
Jews differ widely from the Gentiles; for circumcision and ceremonies have
erected &#8220;the middle wall of partition between them.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:14.) They were &#8220;nigh&#8221; to God,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:13,) while the Gentiles were &#8220;afar off;&#8221; but still God is
consistent with himself. This becomes evident, when Christ brings those who
formerly differed among themselves to one God, and makes them unite in one body.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God is

made.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa62</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is the law then against the
promises of God?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The certainty and steadiness
of the divine purpose being admitted, we are bound equally to conclude that its
results are not contrary to each other. Still there was a difficulty to be
resolved, arising from the apparent contradiction between the Law and the
covenant of grace. This is, perhaps, an exclamation. Dreading no farther
contradiction, now that the point is settled, Paul concludes, that the former
arguments have placed it beyond a doubt, and exclaims: &#8220;Who will now dare
to imagine a disagreement between the law and the promises?&#8221; And yet this
does not prevent Paul from proceeding to remove the difficulties that might
still arise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Before answering the question, he expresses, in his
usual manner, a high disdain of such folly; thus intimating the strong
abhorrence with which pious men must regard whatever brings reproach on the
Divine character. But another instance of high address, which claims our notice,
is found in this turn of expression. He charges his adversaries with the offense
of making God contradict himself. For from him the Law and the promises have
evidently proceeded: whoever then alleges any contradiction between them
blasphemes against God: but they do contradict each other, if the Law justifies.
Thus does Paul most dexterously retort upon his adversaries the charge which
they falsely and calumniously brought against him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For if there had been a law
given</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The reply is (what is called) indirect,
and does not plainly assert an agreement between the law and the promises, but
contains all that is necessary to remove the contradiction. At first sight, you
would say that this sentence departs from the context, and has nothing to do
with the solution of the question; but this is not the case. The law would be
opposed to the promises, if it had the power of justifying; for there would be
two opposite methods of justifying a man, two separate roads towards the
attainment of righteousness. But Paul refuses to the law such a power; so that
the contradiction is removed. I would admit, says he, that righteousness is
obtained by the law, if salvation were found in it. But
what?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Scripture hath
concluded</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the word Scripture is chiefly
intended the law itself. It &#8220;hath concluded all under sin,&#8221; and
therefore, instead of giving, it takes away righteousness from all. The
reasoning is most powerful. &#8220;You seek righteousness in the law: but the
law itself, with the whole of Scripture, leaves nothing to men but condemnation;
for all men, with their works, are pronounced to be unrighteous: who then shall
live by the law?&#8221; He alludes to these words,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He who shall do
these things, shall live in them.&#8221; (Leviticus 18:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Shut out by it, says he, from life through guilt, in
vain should we seek salvation by the law. &#8212; The word translated <i>all</i>
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ta&lt;
pa&gt;nta</font><font face="Palatino">) signifies <i>all things</i>, and conveys
more than if he had said <i>all men</i>; for it embraces not only men, but every
thing which they possess or can accomplish.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the promise by
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is no remedy but to throw away the
righteousness of works, and betake ourselves to the faith of Christ. The result
is certain. If works come into judgment, we are all condemned; therefore we
obtain, by the faith of Christ, a free righteousness. This sentence is full of
the highest consolation. It tells us that, wherever we hear ourselves condemned
in Scripture, there is help provided for us in Christ, if we betake ourselves to
him. We are lost, though God were silent: why then does he so often pronounce
that we are lost? It is that we may not perish by everlasting destruction, but,
struck and confounded by such a dreadful sentence, may by faith seek Christ,
through whom we &#8220;pass from death into life.&#8221;

<div><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before faith
came</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The question proposed is now more fully
defined. He explains at great length the use of the law, and the reason why it
was temporal; for otherwise it would have appeared to be always unreasonable
that a law should be delivered to the Jews, from which the Gentiles were
excluded. If there be but one church consisting of Jews and Gentiles, why is
there a diversity in its government? Whence is this new liberty derived, and on
what authority does it rest, since the fathers were under subjection to the law?
He therefore informs us, that the distinction is such as not to interrupt the
union and harmony of the church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must again remind the reader that Paul does not
treat exclusively of ceremonies, or of the moral law, but embraces the whole
economy by which the Lord governed his people under the Old Testament. It became
a subject of dispute whether the form of government instituted by Moses had any
influence in obtaining righteousness. Paul compares this law first to a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prison</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and next to a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>schoolmaster</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Such was the nature of the law, as both comparisons plainly show, that it could
not have been in force beyond a certain time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">
denotes the full revelation of those things which, during the darkness of the
shadows of the law, were dimly seen; for he does not intend to say that the
fathers, who lived under the law, did not possess faith. The faith of Abraham
has already come under our notice, and other instances are quoted by the author
of the Epistle to the Hebrews. (Hebrews 11.) The doctrine of faith, in short, is
attested by Moses and all the prophets: but, as faith was not then clearly
manifested, so the <i>time of faith</i> is an appellation here given, not in an
absolute, but in a comparative sense, to the time of the New Testament. That
this was his meaning is evident from what he immediately adds, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shut up under the faith which
should afterwards be revealed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for this
implies that those who were under the custody of the law were partakers of the
same faith. The law did not restrain them from faith; but, that they might not
wander from the fold of faith, it kept possession of themselves. There is an
elegant allusion, too, to what he had formerly said, that &#8220;the scripture
hath concluded all under sin.&#8221; They were besieged on every hand by the
curse, but this siege was counteracted by an imprisonment which protected them
from the curse; so that the imprisonment by the law is here proved to have been
highly generous in its character.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Faith was not
yet</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
revealed</i></font><font face="Palatino">, not because the fathers wanted light,
but because they had less light than we have. The ceremonies might be said to
shadow out an absent Christ, but to us he is represented as actually present,
and thus while they had the mirror, we have the substance. Whatever might be the
amount of darkness under the law, the fathers were not ignorant of the road in
which they ought to walk. Though the dawn is not equal to the splendor of noon,
yet, as it is sufficient to direct a journey, travelers do not wait till the sun
is fully risen. Their portion of light resembled the dawn, which was enough to
preserve them from all error, and guide them to everlasting
blessedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore the law was our
schoolmaster</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is the second comparison,
which still more clearly expresses Paul&#8217;s design. A schoolmaster is not
appointed for the whole life, but only for childhood, as the etymology of the
Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">paidagwgo&gt;v</font><font face="Palatino">
implies. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa63</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Besides, in training a child, the object is to prepare him, by the instructions
of childhood, for maturer years. The comparison applies in both respects to the
law, for its authority was limited to a particular age, and its whole object was
to prepare its scholars in such a manner, that, when its elementary instructions
were closed, they might make progress worthy of manhood. And so he adds, that it
was our schoolmaster (</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv
Cristo&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unto
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The grammarian, when he has trained a
boy, delivers him into the hands of another, who conducts him through the higher
branches of a finished education. In like manner, the law was the grammar of
theology, which, after carrying its scholars a short way, handed them over to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to be completed. Thus, Paul compares the Jews to children, and us to advanced
youth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a question arises, what was the instruction or
education of this schoolmaster? First, the law, by displaying the justice of
God, convinced them that in themselves they were unrighteous; for in the
commandments of God, as in a mirror, they might see how far they were distant
from true righteousness. They were thus reminded that righteousness must be
sought in some other quarter. The promises of the law served the same purpose,
and might lead to such reflections as these: &#8220;If you cannot obtain life by
works but by fulfilling the law, some new and different method must be sought.
Your weakness will never allow you to ascend so high; nay, though you desire and
strive ever so much, you will fall far short of the object.&#8221; The
threatenings, on the other hand, pressed and entreated them to seek refuge from
the wrath and curse of God, and gave them no rest till they were constrained to
seek the grace of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Such too, was the tendency of all the ceremonies; for
what end did sacrifices and washings serve but to keep the mind continually
fixed on pollution and condemnation? When a man&#8217;s uncleanness is placed
before his eyes, when the unoffending animal is held forth as the image of his
own death, how can he indulge in sleep? How can he but be roused to the earnest
cry for deliverance? Beyond all doubt, ceremonies accomplished their object, not
merely by alarming and humbling the conscience, but by exciting them to the
faith of the coming Redeemer. In the imposing services of the Mosaic ritual,
every thing that was presented to the eye bore an impress of Christ. The law, in
short, was nothing else than an immense variety of exercises, in which the
worshippers were led by the hand to Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That we might be justified by
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He has already said that the law is not
perfect, when he compared it to the training of childhood; but it would make men
perfect if it bestowed upon them righteousness. What remains but that faith
shall take its place? And so it does, when we, who are destitute of a
righteousness of our own, are clothed by it with the righteousness of Christ.
Thus is the saying accomplished, &#8220;he hath filled the hungry with good
things.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420153&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
1:53.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But after that faith is
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This phrase has been already considered.
It denotes the brighter revelation of grace after that &#8220;the vail of the
temple was rent in twain,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402751&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
27:51,) which, we know, was effected by the manifestation of Christ. He affirms
that, under the reign of Christ, there is no longer any childhood which needs to
be placed under a schoolmaster, and that, consequently, the law has resigned its
office, &#8212; which is another application of the comparison. There were two
things which he had undertaken to prove, &#8212; that the law is a preparation
for Christ, and that it is temporal. But here the question is again put, Is the
law so abolished that we have nothing to do with it? I answer, the law, so far
as it is a rule of life, a bridle to keep us in the fear of the Lord, a spur to
correct the sluggishness of our flesh, &#8212; so far, in short, as it
is</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;profitable for doctrine, for
reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that believers may be
instructed in every good work,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Timothy 3:16, 17,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8212; is as much in force as ever, and remains
untouched.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In what respect, then, is it abolished? Paul, we have
said, looks at the law as possessing certain qualities, and those qualities we
shall enumerate. It annexes to works a reward and a punishment; that is, it
promises life to those who keep it, and curses all transgressors. Meanwhile, it
requires from man the highest perfection and most exact obedience. It makes no
abatement, gives no pardon, but calls to a severe reckoning the smallest
offenses. It does not openly exhibit Christ and his grace, but points him out at
a distance, and only when hidden by the covering of ceremonies. All such
qualities of the law, Paul tells us, are abolished; so that the office of Moses
is now at an end, so far as it differs in outward aspect from a covenant of
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For ye are all the children of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It would be unjust, and in the highest
degree unreasonable, that the law should hold believers in perpetual slavery.
This is proved by the additional argument, that they are the children of God. It
would not be enough to say that we are no longer children, unless it were added
that we are freemen; for in slaves age makes no alteration. The fact of their
being the children of God proves their freedom. How?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By faith in Christ
Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;</i> for</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;as many as
received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that
believe on his
name.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
1:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since, then, by faith we have obtained adoption, by
faith likewise we have obtained our
freedom.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As many of you as have been
baptized</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The greater and loftier the privilege
is of being the children of God, the farther is it removed from our senses, and
the more difficult to obtain belief. He therefore explains, in a few words, what
is implied in our being united, or rather, made one with the Son of God; so as
to remove all doubt, that what belongs to him is communicated to us. He employs
the metaphor of a garment, when he says that the Galatians
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have put on
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but he means that they are so closely
united to him, that, in the presence of God, they bear the name and character of
Christ, and are viewed in him rather than in themselves. This metaphor or
similitude, taken from garments, occurs frequently, and has been treated by us
in other places.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the argument, that, because they have been
baptized, they have put on Christ, appears weak; for how far is baptism from
being efficacious in all? Is it reasonable that the grace of the Holy Spirit
should be so closely linked to an external symbol? Does not the uniform doctrine
of Scripture, as well as experience, appear to confute this statement? I answer,
it is customary with Paul to treat of the sacraments in two points of view. When
he is dealing with hypocrites, in whom the mere symbol awakens pride, he then
proclaims loudly the emptiness and worthlessness of the outward symbol, and
denounces, in strong terms, their foolish confidence. In such cases he
contemplates not the ordinance of God, but the corruption of wicked men. When,
on the other hand, he addresses believers, who make a proper use of the symbols,
he then views them in connection with the truth &#8212; which they represent. In
this case, he makes no boast of any false splendor as belonging to the
sacraments, but calls our attention to the actual fact represented by the
outward ceremony. Thus, agreeably to the Divine appointment, the truth comes to
be associated with the symbols.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But perhaps some person will ask, Is it then possible
that, through the fault of men, a sacrament shall cease to bear a figurative
meaning? The reply is easy. Though wicked men may derive no advantage from the
sacraments, they still retain undiminished their nature and force. The
sacraments present, both to good and to bad men, the grace of God. No falsehood
attaches to the promises which they exhibit of the grace of the Holy Spirit.
Believers receive what is offered; and if wicked men, by rejecting it, render
the offer unprofitable to themselves, their conduct cannot destroy the
faithfulness of God, or the true meaning of the sacrament. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa64</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> With
strict propriety, then, does Paul, in addressing believers, say, that when they
were baptized, they &#8220;put on Christ;&#8221; just as, in the Epistle to the
Romans, he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;that we have been
planted together into his death,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">so
as to be also partakers of his
resurrection.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
6:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this way, the symbol and the Divine operation are
kept distinct, and yet the meaning of the sacraments is manifest; so that they
cannot be regarded as empty and trivial exhibitions; and we are reminded with
what base ingratitude they are chargeable, who, by abusing the precious
ordinances of God, not only render them unprofitable to themselves, but turn
them to their own destruction!</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is neither Jew nor
Greek</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The meaning is, that there is no
distinction of persons here, and therefore it is of no consequence to what
nation or condition any one may belong: nor is circumcision any more regarded
than sex or civil rank. And why? Because Christ makes them all one. Whatever may
have been their former differences, Christ alone is able to unite them all.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye are
one</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>:</i> the distinction is now removed. The
apostle&#8217;s object is to shew that the grace of adoption, and the hope of
salvation, do not depend on the law, but are contained in Christ alone, who
therefore is all. Greek is here put, as usual, for Gentile, and one department
for the whole class.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then are ye Abraham&#8217;s
seed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is not intended to convey the idea,
that to be a child of Abraham is better than to be a member of Christ, &#8212;
but to repress the pride of the Jews, who gloried in their privilege, as if they
alone were the people of God. They reckoned no distinction higher than to belong
to the race of Abraham; and this very distinction he makes to be common to all
who believe in Christ. The conclusion rests on this argument, that Christ is the
blessed seed, in whom, as we have said, all the children of Abraham are united.
He proves this by the universal offer of the inheritance to them all, from which
it follows, that the promise includes them among the children. It deserves
notice, that, wherever faith is mentioned, it is always his relation to the
promise.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now I
say</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Whoever made the division into chapters
has improperly separated this paragraph from the preceding, as it is nothing
else than the concluding section,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpexergasi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">,)
in which Paul explains and illustrates the difference that exists between us and
the ancient people. He does so by introducing a third comparison, drawn from the
relation which a person under age bears to his tutor. The young man, though he
is free, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>though he is lord of
all</i></font><font face="Palatino"> his father&#8217;s family, still resembles
a slave; for he is under the government of tutors. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa65</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But the
period of guardianship lasts only &#8220;until the time appointed by the
father&#8221; after which he enjoys his freedom. In this respect the fathers
under the Old Testament, being the sons of God, were free; but they were not in
possession of freedom, while the law held the place of their tutor, and kept
them under its yoke. That slavery of the law lasted as long as it pleased God,
who put an end to it at the coming of Christ. Lawyers enumerate various methods
by which the tutelage or guardianship is brought to a close; but of all these
methods, the only one adapted to this comparison is that which Paul has
selected, &#8220;the appointment of the father.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now examine the separate clauses. Some apply
the comparison in a different manner to the case of any man whatever, whereas
Paul is speaking of two nations. What they say, I acknowledge, is true; but it
has nothing to do with the present passage. The elect, though they are the
children of God from the womb, yet, until by faith they come to the possession
of freedom, remain like slaves under the law; but, from the time that they have
known Christ, they no longer require this kind of tutelage. Granting all this, I
deny that Paul here treats of individuals, or draws a distinction between the
time of unbelief and the calling by faith. The matters in dispute were these.
Since the church of God is one, how comes it that our condition is different
from that of the Israelites? Since we are free by faith, how comes it that they,
who had faith in common with us, were not partakers with us of the same freedom?
Since we are all equally the children of God, how comes it that we at this day
are exempt from a yoke which they were forced to bear? On these points the
controversy turned, and not on the manner in which the law reigns over each of
us before we are freed by faith from its slavery. Let this point be first of all
settled, that Paul here compares the Israelitish church, which existed under the
Old Testament, with the Christian church, that thus we may perceive in what
points we agree and in what we differ. This comparison furnishes most abundant
and most profitable instruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, we learn from it that our hope at the present
day, and that of the fathers under the Old Testament, have been directed to the
same inheritance; for they were partakers of the same adoption. According to the
dreams of some fanatics, and of Servetus among others, the fathers were divinely
elected for the sole purpose of prefiguring to us a people of God. Paul, on the
other hand, contends that they were elected in order to be together with us the
children of God, and particularly attests that to them, not less than to us,
belonged the spiritual blessing promised to Abraham.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Secondly, we learn that, notwithstanding their
outward slavery, their consciences were still free. The obligation to keep the
law did not hinder Moses and Daniel, all the pious kings, priests, and prophets,
and the whole company of believers, from being free in spirit. They bore the
yoke of the law upon their shoulders, but with a free spirit they worshipped
God. More particularly, having been instructed concerning the free pardon of
sin, their consciences were delivered from the tyranny of sin and death. Hence
we ought to conclude that they held the same doctrine, were joined with us in
the true unity of faith, placed reliance on the one Mediator, called on God as
their Father, and were led by the same Spirit. All this leads to the conclusion,
that the difference between us and the ancient fathers lies in accidents, not in
substance. In all the leading characters of the Testament or Covenant we agree:
the ceremonies and form of government, in which we differ, are mere additions.
Besides, that period was the infancy of the church; but now that Christ is come,
the church has arrived at the estate of manhood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning of Paul&#8217;s words is clear, but has
he not some appearance of contradicting himself? In the Epistle to the Ephesians
he exhorts us to make daily progress</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;till we come to a
perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
4:13.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the first Epistle to the Corinthians he says,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:2,)</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I have fed you
with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither
yet now are ye able;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and shortly after this he compares the Galatians to
children.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480419&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:19) In those passages, I reply, the apostle speaks of particular men, and of
their faith as individuals; but here he speaks generally of two bodies without
regard to persons. This reply will assist us in resolving a much greater
difficulty. When we look at the matchless faith of Abraham, and the vast
intelligence of the holy prophets, with what effrontery shall we dare to talk of
such men as our inferiors? Were not they rather the heroes, and we the children?
To say nothing of ourselves, who among the Galatians would have been found equal
to any of those men?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here, as I have already said, the apostle
describes not particular persons, but the universal condition of both nations.
Some men were endowed with extraordinary gifts; but they were few, and the whole
body did not share with them. Besides, though they had been numerous, we must
inquire not what they inwardly were, but what was that kind or government under
which God had placed them; and that was manifestly a school,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">paidagwgi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
a system of instruction for children. And what are we now? God has broken those
chains, governs his church in a more indulgent manner, and lays not upon us such
severe restraint. At the same time, we may remark in passing, that whatever
amount of knowledge they might attain partook of the nature of the period; for a
dark cloud continually rested on the revelation which they enjoyed. And hence
that saying of our Savior,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Blessed are the eyes which see
the things that ye see: for I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired
to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those
things which ye hear, and have not heard them.&#8221; (Luke 10: 23,
24.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now understand in what respect we are preferred to
those who were greatly our superiors; for the statements are not applied to
persons, but relate entirely to the economy of the Divine
administration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage will prove a most powerful battery for
destroying the pageantry of ceremonies, which constitutes the entire splendor of
the Papal system. For what else is it that dazzles the eyes of simple people, so
as to lead them to regard the dominion of the Pope, if not with admiration, at
least with some degree of reverence, but the magnificent army of ceremonies,
rites, gesticulations, and equipage of every description, contrived for the
express purpose of amazing the ignorant? From this passage it appears that they
are false disguises, by which the true beauty of the church is impaired. I do
not now speak of greater and more frightful corruptions, such as, that they hold
them out for divine worship, imagine them to possess the power of meriting
salvation, and enforce with more rigid severity the observation of those trifles
than the whole law of God. I only advert to the specious pretext under which our
modern contrivers apologize for such a multitude of abominations. What though
they object that the ignorance of the multitude prevails to a greater extent
than it formerly did among the Israelites, and that many assistances are
therefore required? They will never be able in this way to prove that the people
must be placed under the discipline or a school similar to what existed among
the people of Israel; for I shall always meet them with the declaration, that
the appointment of God is totally different.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If they plead expediency, I ask, are they better
judges of what is expedient than God himself? Let us entertain the firm
conviction that the highest advantage, as well as the highest propriety, will be
found in whatever God has determined. In aiding the ignorant, we must employ not
those methods which the fancy of men may have been pleased to contrive, but
those which had been fixed by God themself, who unquestionably has left out
nothing that was fitted to assist their weakness. Let this shield suffice for
repelling any objections: &#8220;God has judged otherwise, and his purpose
supplies to us the place of all arguments; unless it be supposed that men are
capable of devising better aids than those which God had provided, and which he
afterwards threw aside as useless.&#8221; Let it be carefully observed, Paul
does not merely say that the yoke which had been laid upon the Jews is removed
from us, but expressly lays down a distinction in the government which God has
commanded to be observed. I acknowledge that we are now at liberty as to all
outward matters, but only on the condition that the church shall not be burdened
with a multitude of ceremonies, nor Christianity confounded with Judaism. The
reason of this we shall afterwards consider in the proper
place.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Under the elements of the world.
Elements</i></font><font face="Palatino"> may either mean, literally, outward
and bodily things, or, metaphorically, rudiments. I prefer the latter
interpretation. But why does he say that those things which had a spiritual
signification were </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">? We did not, he says, enjoy the truth in
a simple form, but involved in earthly figures; and consequently, what was
outward must have been &#8220;of the world,&#8221; though there was concealed
under it a heavenly mystery.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the fullness of the time was
come</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He proceeds with the comparison which he
had adduced, and applies to his purpose the expression which has already
occurred, &#8220;the time appointed by the Father,&#8221; &#8212; but still
shewing that the time which had been ordained by the providence of God was
proper and seasonable. That season is the most fit, and that mode of acting is
the most proper, which the providence of God directs. At what time it was
expedient that the Son of God should be revealed to the world, it belonged to
God alone to judge and determine. This consideration ought to restrain all
curiosity. Let no man presume to be dissatisfied with the secret purpose of God,
and raise a dispute why Christ did not appear sooner. If the reader desires more
full information on this subject, he may consult what I have written on the
conclusion of the Epistle to the Romans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God sent forth his
Son</i></font><font face="Palatino">. These few words contain much instruction.
The Son, who was sent, must have existed before he was sent; and this proves his
eternal Godhead. Christ therefore is the Son of God, sent from heaven. Yet this
same person was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made of a
woman</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because he assumed our nature, which
shews that he has two natures. Some copies read <i>natum</i> instead of
<i>filium</i>; but the latter reading is more generally followed, and, in my
opinion, is preferable. But the language was also expressly intended to
distinguish Christ from other men, as having been formed of the substance of his
mother, and not by ordinary generation. In any other sense, it would have been
trifling, and foreign to the subject. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>woman</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is here put generally for the female sex.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Subjected under the
law.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The literal rendering is,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Made under the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">; but in my version I have preferred another
word, which expresses more plainly the fact that he was placed in subjection to
the law. Christ the Son of God, who might have claimed to be exempt from every
kind of subjection, became subject to the law. Why? He did so in our room, that
he might obtain freedom for us. A man who was free, by constituting himself a
surety, redeems a slave: by putting on himself the chains, he takes them off
from the other. So Christ chose to become liable to keep the law, that exemption
from it might be obtained for us; otherwise it would have been to no purpose
that he should come under the yoke of the law, for it certainly was not on his
own account that he did so.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To redeem them that were under the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We must
here observe, the exemption from the law which Christ has procured for us does
not imply that we no longer owe any obedience to the doctrine of the law, and
may do whatever we please; for the law is the everlasting rule of a good and
holy life. But Paul speaks of the law with all its appendages. From subjection
to that law we are redeemed, because it is no longer what it once was.
&#8220;The vail being rent,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402751&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
27:51,) freedom is openly proclaimed, and this is what he immediately
adds.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That we might receive the
adoption</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The fathers, under the Old Testament,
were certain of their adoption, but did not so fully as yet enjoy their
privilege.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Adoption</i></font><font face="Palatino">,

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450823&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:23,) is here put for actual possession. As, at the last day, we receive the
fruit of our redemption, so now we receive the fruit of adoption, of which the
holy fathers did not partake before the coming of Christ; and therefore those
who now burden the church with an excess of ceremonies, defraud her of the just
right of adoption.</font><br></div>

proved to belong to the Galatians by the following argument. This adoption must
have preceded the testimony of adoption given by the Holy Spirit; but the effect
is the sign of the cause. In venturing, he says, to call God your Father, you
have the advice and direction of the Spirit of Christ; therefore it is certain
that you are the sons of God. This agrees with what is elsewhere taught by him,
that the Spirit is the earnest and pledge of our adoption, and gives to us a
well-founded belief that God regards us with a father&#8217;s
love.</font><br></div>

opinion of himself which any man may entertain, but to the testimony of a pious
conscience which accompanies the new birth. This argument can have no weight but
in the case of believers, for ungodly men have no experience of this certainty;
as our Lord himself declares.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Let it be observed, that Paul ascribes this
universally to all Christians; for where this pledge of the Divine love towards
us is wanting, there is assuredly no faith. Hence it is evident what sort of
Christianity belongs to Popery, since any man who says, that he has the Spirit
of God, is charged by them with impious presumption. Neither the Spirit of God,
nor certainty, belongs to their notion of faith. This single tenet held by them
is a remarkable proof that, in all the schools of the Papists, the devil, the
father of unbelief, reigns. I acknowledge, indeed, that the scholastic divines,
when they enjoin upon the consciences of men the agitation of perpetual doubt,
are in perfect agreement with what the natural feelings of mankind would
dictate. It is the more necessary to fix in our minds this doctrine of Paul,
that no man is a Christian who has not learned, by the teaching of the Holy
Spirit, to call God his Father.</font><br></div>

longer exists, but the condition of the children is free. In what respect the
fathers under the law were slaves, we have already inquired; for their freedom
was not yet revealed, but was hidden under the coverings and yoke of the law.
Our attention is again directed to the distinction between the Old and New
Testaments. The ancients were also sons of God, and heirs through Christ, but we
hold the same character in a different manner; for we have Christ present with
us, and in that manner enjoy his
blessings.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>

argument; and indeed he had already proved his point so fully, that no doubt
remained, and the rebuke which was now to be administered could not be evaded.
His object is to make their fall appear more criminal, by comparing it with past
events. It is not wonderful, he says, that formerly
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye did service to them which by
nature are no gods</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for, wherever ignorance of
God exists, there must be dreadful blindness. You were then wandering in
darkness, but how disgraceful is it that in the midst of light you should fall
into such gross errors! The main inference is, that the Galatians were less
excusable for corrupting the gospel than they had formerly been for idolatry.
But here it ought to be observed, that, till we have been enlightened in the
true knowledge of one God, we always serve idols, whatever pretext we may throw
over the false religion. The lawful worship of God, therefore, must be preceded
by just views of his character</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.
By nature</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, in reality,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>they are no

contrive is a creature of their own imagination. In the opinion of men idols may
be gods, but in reality they are
nothing.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

What is it but to forsake, of our own accord, the light, the life, the fountain

<div><font face="Palatino">Still farther to heighten the blame, he corrects his
language, and says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>or rather

grace of God is towards us, our guilt in despising it must be the heavier. Paul
reminds the Galatians whence they had derived the knowledge of God. He affirms
that they did not obtain it by their own exertions, by the acuteness or industry
of their own minds, but because, when they were at the farthest possible remove
from thinking of him, God visited them in his mercy. What is said of the
Galatians may be extended to all; for in all are fulfilled the words of
Isaiah,</font><br></div>

ceremonies which they had never practiced. The expression is figurative, and
merely denotes, that to fall again into wicked superstition, as if they had
never received the truth of God, was the height of folly. When he calls the
ceremonies </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>beggarly
elements</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he views them as out of Christ, and,
what is more, as opposed to Christ. To the fathers they were not only profitable
exercises and aids to piety, but efficacious means of grace. But then their
whole value lay in Christ, and in the appointment of God. The false apostles, on
the other hand, neglecting the promises, endeavored to oppose the ceremonies to
Christ, as if Christ alone were not sufficient. That they should be regarded by
Paul as worthless trifles, cannot excite surprise; but of this I have already
spoken. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bondage</i></font><font face="Palatino">
conveys a reproof for submitting to be slaves. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa68</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Ye observe days</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He adduces as an instance one
description of &#8220;elements,&#8221; the observance of days. No condemnation
is here given to the observance of dates in the arrangements of civil society.
The order of nature out of which this arises, is fixed and constant. How are
months and years computed, but by the revolution of the sun and moon? What
distinguishes summer from winter, or spring from harvest, but the appointment of
God, &#8212; an appointment which was promised to continue to the end of the
world?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
8:22.) The civil observation of days contributes not only to agriculture and to
matters of politics, and ordinary life, but is even extended to the government
of the church. Of what nature, then, was the observation which Paul reproves? It
was that which would bind the conscience, by religious considerations, as if it
were necessary to the worship of God, and which, as he expresses it in the
Epistle to the Romans, would make a distinction between one day and another.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451405&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
14:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When certain days are represented as holy in
themselves, when one day is distinguished from another on religious grounds,
when holy days are reckoned a part of divine worship, then days are improperly
observed. The Jewish Sabbath, new moons, and other festivals, were earnestly
pressed by the false apostles, because they had been appointed by the law. When
we, in the present age, intake a distinction of days, we do not represent them
as necessary, and thus lay a snare for the conscience; we do not reckon one day
to be more holy than another; we do not make days to be the same thing with
religion and the worship of God; but merely attend to the preservation of order
and harmony. The observance of days among us is a free service, and void of all
superstition.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest I have bestowed upon you
labor in vain</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The expression is harsh, and
must have filled the Galatians with alarm; for what hope was left to them, if
Paul&#8217;s labor had been in vain? Some have expressed astonishment that Paul
should be so powerfully affected by the observance of days, as almost to
designate it a subversion of the whole gospel. But if we carefully weigh the
whole, we shall see that there was just reason; and that the false apostles not
only attempted to lay the yoke of Jewish bondage on the neck of the church, but
filled their minds with wicked superstitions. To bring back Christianity to
Judaism, was in itself no light evil; but far more serious mischief was done,
when, in opposition to the grace of Christ, they set up holidays as meritorious
performances, and pretended that this mode of worship would propitiate the
divine favor. When such doctrines were received, the worship of God was
corrupted, the grace of Christ made void, and the freedom of conscience
oppressed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Do we wonder that Paul should be afraid that he had
labored in vain, that the gospel would henceforth be of no service? And since
that very description of impiety is now supported by Popery, what sort of Christ
or what sort of gospel does it retain? So far as respects the binding of
consciences, they enforce the observance of days with not less severity than was
done by Moses. They consider holidays, not less than the false apostles did, to
be a part of the worship of God, and even connect with them the diabolical
notion of merit. The Papists must therefore be held equally censurable with the
false apostles; and with this addition in aggravation, that, while the former
proposed to keep those days which had been appointed by the law of God, the
latter enjoin days, rashly stamped with their own seal, to be observed as most
holy.</font><br></div>

to adopt a milder strain. The former harshness had been more than justified by
the heinousness of the offense; but as he wished to do good, he resolves to
adopt a style of conciliation. It is the part of a wise pastor to consider, not
what those who have wandered may justly deserve, but what may be the likeliest
method of bringing them back to the right path. He must &#8220;be instant in
season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and
doctrine.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 4:2.) Following the method which he had recommended to Timothy, he
leaves off chiding, and begins to use entreaties.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I beseech
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he says, and calls
them</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">, to assure them that no bitterness had
mingled with his reproofs.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be as I
am</i></font><font face="Palatino">, refer to the affection of the mind. As he
endeavors to accommodate himself to them, so he wishes that they would do the
like by him in return. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I am
as ye are</i></font><font face="Palatino">. &#8220;As I have no other object in
view than to promote your benefit, so it is proper that you should be prevailed
on to adopt moderate views, and to lend a willing, obedient ear to my
instructions.&#8221; And here again pastors are reminded of their duty to come
down, as far as they can, to the people, and to study the various dispositions
of those with whom they have to deal, if they wish to obtain compliance with
their message. The proverb still holds: &#8220;to be loved, you must be
lovely.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have not injured me at
all</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is intended to remove the suspicion
which might have rendered his former reproofs more disagreeable. If we think
that a person is speaking under a sense of injury, or revenging a private
quarrel, we turn away our minds from him entirely, and are sure to torture
whatever he says into an unfavourable interpretation. Paul therefore meets the
rising prejudice by saying, &#8220;So far as respects myself, I have no cause to
complain of you. It is not on my own account, nor from any hostility to you,
that I feel warmly; and therefore, if I use strong language, it must arise from
some other cause than hatred or
anger.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye know that, through infirmity
of the flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He recalls to their recollection
the friendly and respectful manner in which they had received him, and he does
so for two reasons. First, to let them know that he loved them, and thus to gain
a ready ear to all that he says; and secondly, to encourage them, that, as they
had begun well, they would go on in the same course. This mention of past
occurrences, then, while it is an expression of his kind regards, is intended
likewise as an exhortation to act in the same manner as they had done at an
earlier period.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">
denotes his outward appearance, which the word infirmity describes to have been
contemptible. Such was Paul when he came among them, without show, without
pretense, without worldly honors or rank, without everything that could gain him
respect or estimation in the eyes of men. Yet all this did not prevent the
Galatians from giving him the most honorable reception. The narrative
contributes powerfully to his argument, for what was there in Paul to awaken
their esteem or veneration, but the power of the Holy Spirit alone? Under what
pretext, then, will they now begin to despise that power? Next, they are charged
with inconsistency, since no subsequent occurrence in the life of Paul could
entitle them to esteem him less than before. But this he leaves to be considered
by the Galatians, contenting himself with indirectly suggesting it as a subject
of consideration.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
temptation</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That is, &#8220;Though ye perceived
me to be, in a worldly point of view, a contemptible person, yet ye did not
reject me.&#8221; He calls it a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>temptation</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or trial, because it was a thing not unknown or hidden, and he did not himself
attempt to conceal it, as is usually done by ambitious men, who are ashamed of
anything about them that may lower them in public estimation. It frequently
happens that unworthy persons receive applause, before their true character has
been discovered, and shortly afterwards are dismissed with shame and disgrace.
But widely different was the case of Paul, who had used no disguise to impose on
the Galatians, but had frankly told them what he was.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As an angel of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In this light every true minister of
Christ ought to be regarded. As God employs the services of angels for
communicating to us his favors, so godly teachers are divinely raised up to
administer to us the most excellent of all blessings, the doctrine of eternal
salvation. Not without good reason are they, by whose hands God dispenses to us
such a treasure, compared to angels: for they too are the messengers of God, by
whose mouth God speaks to us. And this argument is used by
Malachi.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The priest&#8217;s lips should
keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth, <i>for he is the
messenger of the Lord of hosts</i>.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;390207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Malachi
2:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the apostle rises still higher, and adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>even as Christ
Jesus</i>;</font><font face="Palatino"> for the Lord himself commands that his
ministers shall be viewed in the same light as himself.</font><br></div>

10:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor is this wonderful; for it is in his name that
they discharge their embassy, and thus they hold the rank of him in whose room
they act. Such is the highly commendatory language which reveals to us at once
the majesty of the gospel, and the honorable character of its ministry. If it be
the command of Christ that his ministers shall be thus honored, it is certain
that contempt of them proceeds from the instigation of the devil; and indeed
they never can be despised so long as the word of God is esteemed. In vain do
the Papists attempt to hold out this pretext for their own arrogant pretensions.
As they are plainly the enemies of Christ, how absurd is it that they should
assume the garb, and take to themselves the character, of Christ&#8217;s
servants! If they wish to obtain the honors of angels, let them perform the duty
of angels: if they wish that we should listen to them as to Christ, let them
convey to us faithfully his pure
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where is there your
blessedness?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Paul had made them happy, and he
intimates that the pious affection with which they formerly regarded him was an
expression of their happiness. But now, by allowing themselves to be deprived of
the services of him to whom they ought to have attributed whatever knowledge
they possessed of Christ, they gave evidence that they were unhappy. This hint
was intended to produce keen reflection. &#8220;What? Shall all this be lost?
Will you forfeit all the advantage of having once heard Christ speaking by my
lips? Shall the foundation in the faith which you received from me be to no
purpose? Shall your falling away now destroy the glory of your obedience in the
presence of God?&#8221; In short, by despising the pure doctrine which they had
embraced, they throw away, of their own accord, the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blessedness</i></font><font face="Palatino">
which they had obtained, and draw down upon themselves the destruction in which
their unhappy career must terminate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I bear you
record</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is not enough that pastors be
respected, if they are not also loved; for both are necessary to make the
doctrine they preach be fully relished; and both, the apostle declares, had
existed among the Galatians. He had already spoken of their respect for him, and
he now speaks of their love. To be willing to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pluck out their own
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">, if it had been necessary, was an evidence
of very extraordinary love, stronger than the willingness to part with
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Am I therefore become your
enemy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> He now returns to speak about
himself. It was entirely their own fault, he says, that they had changed their
minds. Though it is a common remark, that truth begets hatred, yet, except
through the malice and wickedness of those who cannot endure to hear it, truth
is never hateful. While he vindicates himself from any blame in the unhappy
difference between them, he indirectly censures their ingratitude. Yet still his
advice is friendly, not to reject, on rash or light grounds, the apostleship of
one whom they had formerly considered to be worthy of their warmest love. What
can be more unbecoming than that the hatred of truth should change enemies into
friends? His aim then is, not so much to upbraid, as to move them to
repentance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>

and does more by silence to make them odious, than if he had given their names;
for we usually abstain from naming those whose very names produce in us dislike
and aversion. He mentions the immoderate ambition of those men, and warns the
Galatians not to be led astray by their appearance of zeal. The comparison is
borrowed from honorable love, as contrasted with those professions of regard
which arise from unhallowed desires. Jealousy, on the part of the false
apostles, ought not to impose upon them; for it proceeded not from right zeal,
but from an improper desire of obtaining reputation, &#8212; a desire most
unlike that holy jealousy of which Paul speaks to the
Corinthians.</font><br></div>

stratagem is frequently resorted to by all the ministers of Satan. By producing
in the people a dislike of their pastor, they hope afterwards to draw them to
themselves; and, having disposed of the rival, to obtain quiet possession. A
careful and judicious examination of their conduct will discover that in this
way they always begin.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>

<div><font face="Palatino">If it refers to Paul, the meaning will be: &#8220;I
confess that I also am jealous of you, but with a totally different design: and
I do so as much when I am absent as when I am present, because I do not seek my
own advantage.&#8221; But I am rather inclined to view it as referring to the
Galatians, though in this case it will admit of more than one interpretation. It
may mean: &#8220;They indeed attempt to withdraw your affections from me, that,
when you are thrown destitute, you may go over to them; but do you, who loved me
while I was present, continue to cherish the same regard for me when I am
absent.&#8221; But a more correct explanation is suggested by the opposite
senses which the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">zhlou~sqai</font><font face="Palatino">
bears. As, in the former verse, he had used the word <i>jealous</i> in a bad
sense, denoting an improper way of accomplishing an object, so here he uses it
in a good sense, denoting a zealous imitation of the good qualities of another.
By condemning improper jealousy, he now exhorts the Galatians to engage in a
different sort of competition, and that, too, while he was
absent.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>

he does not set aside the former birth, but says that they must be again
nourished in the womb, as if they had not yet been fully formed. That Christ
should be formed in us is the same thing with our being formed in Christ; for we
are born so as to become new creatures in him; and he, on the other hand, is
born in us, so that we live his life. Since the true image of Christ, through
the superstitions introduced by the false apostles, had been defaced, Paul
labors to restore that image in all its perfection and brightness. This is done
by the ministers of the gospel, when they give</font><br></div>

for that purpose, he is pleased to ascribe to them that work which Himself
performs, through the power of his Spirit, in co-operation with the labors of
man. Let us always attend to this distinction, that, when a minister is
contrasted with God, he is nothing, and can do nothing, and is utterly useless;
but, because the Holy Spirit works efficaciously by means of him, he comes to be
regarded and praised as an agent. Still, it is not what he can do in himself, or
apart from God, but what God does by him, that is there described. If ministers
wish to do anything, let them labor to form Christ, not to form themselves, in
their hearers. The writer is now so oppressed with grief, that he almost faints

the feelings, he follows up his former doctrine by an illustration of great
beauty. Viewed simply as an argument, it would not be very powerful; but, as a
confirmation added to a most satisfactory chain of reasoning, it is not unworthy
of attention.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To be under the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">, signifies here, to come under the yoke of
the law, on the condition that God will act toward you according to the covenant
of the law, and that you, in return, bind yourself to keep the law. In any other
sense than this, all believers are under the law; but the apostle treats, as we
have already said, of the law with its
appendages.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For it is
written</i></font><font face="Palatino">. No man who has a choice given him will
be so mad as to despise freedom, and prefer slavery. But here the apostle
teaches us, that they who are under the law are slaves. Unhappy men! who
willingly choose this condition, when God desires to make them free. He gives a
representation of this in the two sons of Abraham, one of whom, the son of a
slave, held by his mother&#8217;s condition; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa73</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> while
the other, the son of a free woman, obtained the inheritance. He afterwards
applies the whole history to his purpose, and illustrates it in an elegant
manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the first place, as the other party armed
themselves with the authority of the law, the apostle quotes the law on the
other side. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
law</i></font><font face="Palatino"> was the name usually given to the Five
Books of Moses. Again, as the history which he quotes appeared to have no
bearing on the question, he gives to it an allegorical interpretation. But as
the apostle declares that these things are <i>allegorized</i>,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajllhgorou&gt;mena</font><font face="Palatino">,)
Origen, and many others along with him, have seized the occasion of torturing
Scripture, in every possible manner, away from the true sense. They concluded
that the literal sense is too mean and poor, and that, under the outer bark of
the letter, there lurk deeper mysteries, which cannot be extracted but by
beating out allegories. And this they had no difficulty in accomplishing; for
speculations which appear to be ingenious have always been preferred, and always
will be preferred, by the world to solid doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With such approbation the licentious system gradually
attained such a height, that he who handled Scripture for his own amusement not
only was suffered to pass unpunished, but even obtained the highest applause.
For many centuries no man was considered to be ingenious, who had not the skill
and daring necessary for changing into a variety of curious shapes the sacred
word of God. This was undoubtedly a contrivance of Satan to undermine the
authority of Scripture, and to take away from the reading of it the true
advantage. God visited this profanation by a just judgment, when he suffered the
pure meaning of the Scripture to be buried under false
interpretations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Scripture, they say, is fertile, and thus produces a
variety of meanings. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa74</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I
acknowledge that Scripture is a most rich and inexhaustible fountain of all
wisdom; but I deny that its fertility consists in the various meanings which any
man, at his pleasure, may assign. Let us know, then, that the true meaning of
Scripture is the natural and obvious meaning; and let us embrace and abide by it
resolutely. Let us not only neglect as doubtful, but boldly set aside as deadly
corruptions, those pretended expositions, which lead us away from the natural
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what reply shall we make to Paul&#8217;s
assertion, that these things <i>are allegorical</i>? Paul certainly does not
mean that Moses wrote the history for the purpose of being turned into an
allegory, but points out in what way the history may be made to answer the
present subject. This is done by observing a figurative representation of the
Church there delineated. And a mystical interpretation of this sort
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnagwgh&gt;</font><font face="Palatino">)
was not inconsistent with the true and literal meaning, when a comparison was
drawn between the Church and the family of Abraham. As the house of Abraham was
then a true Church, so it is beyond all doubt that the principal and most
memorable events which happened in it are so many types to us. As in
circumcision, in sacrifices, in the whole Levitical priesthood, there was an
allegory, as there is an allegory at the present day in our sacraments, &#8212;
so was there likewise in the house of Abraham; but this does not involve a
departure from the literal meaning. In a word, Paul adduces the history, as
containing a figurative representation of the two covenants in the two wives of
Abraham, and of the two nations in his two sons. And Chrysostom, indeed,
acknowledges that the word <i>allegory</i> points out the present application to
be
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kata&gt;crhsiv</font><font face="Palatino">)</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa75</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
different from the natural meaning; which is perfectly
true.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But he who was of the bond
woman</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Both were sons of Abraham according to
the flesh; but in Isaac there was this peculiarity, that he had the promise of
grace. In Ishmael there was nothing besides nature; in Isaac there was the
election of God, signified in part by the manner of his birth, which was not in
the ordinary course, but miraculous. Yet there is an indirect reference to the
calling of the Gentiles, and the rejection of the Jews: for the latter boast of
their ancestry, while the former, without any human interference, are become the
spiritual offspring of Abraham.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These are the two
covenants</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I have thought it better to adopt
this translation, in order not to lose sight of the beauty of the comparison;
for Paul compares the two
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diaqh~kai</font><font face="Palatino">,
to two mothers, and to employ <i>testamentum</i>, (a testament,) which is a
neuter noun, for denoting a mother, would be harsh. The word<i> pactio</i> (a
covenant) appears to be, on that account, more appropriate; and indeed the
desire of obtaining perspicuity, as well as elegance, has led me to make this
choice.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa76</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The comparison is now formally introduced. As in the
house of Abraham there were two mothers, so are there also in the Church of God.
Doctrine is the mother of whom we are born, and is twofold, Legal and
Evangelical. The legal mother, whom Hagar
resembles,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> gendereth to
bondage</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Sarah again, represents the second,
which gendereth to freedom; though Paul begins higher, and makes our first
mother Sinai, and our second, Jerusalem. The two covenants, then, are the
mothers, of whom children unlike one another are born; for the legal covenant
makes slaves, and the evangelical covenant makes freemen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But all this may, at first sight, appear absurd; for
there are none of God&#8217;s children who are not born to freedom, and
therefore the comparison does not apply. I answer, what Paul says is true in two
respects; for the law formerly brought forth its disciples, (among whom were
included the holy prophets, and other believers,) to slavery, though not to
permanent slavery, but because God placed them for a time under the law as
&#8220;a schoolmaster.&#8221;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa77</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480325&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:25.) Under the vail of ceremonies, and of the whole economy by which they were
governed, their freedom was concealed: to the outward eye nothing but slavery
appeared. &#8220;Ye have not,&#8221; says Paul to the Romans, &#8220;received
the spirit of bondage again to fear.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:15.) Those holy fathers, though inwardly they were free in the sight of God,
yet in outward appearance differed nothing from slaves, and thus resembled their
mother&#8217;s condition. But the doctrine of the gospel bestows upon its
children perfect freedom as soon as they are born, and brings them up in a
liberal manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul does not, I acknowledge, speak of that kind of
children, as the context will show. By the children of Sinai, it will afterwards
be explained, are meant hypocrites, who are at length expelled from the Church
of God, and deprived of the inheritance. What, then, is the gendering to
bondage, which forms the subject of the present dispute? It denotes those who
make a wicked abuse of the law, by finding in it nothing but what tends to
slavery. Not so the pious fathers, who lived under the Old Testament; for their
slavish birth by the law did not hinder them from having Jerusalem for their
mother in spirit. But those who adhere to the bare law, and do not acknowledge
it to be &#8220;a schoolmaster to bring them to Christ,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:24,) but rather make it a hinderance to prevent their coming to him, are the
Ishmaelites born to slavery.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It will again be objected, why does the apostle say
that such persons are born of God&#8217;s covenant, and are considered to belong
to the Church? I answer, strictly speaking, they are not God&#8217;s children,
but are degenerate and spurious, and are disclaimed by God, whom they falsely
call their Father. They receive this name in the Church, not because they are
members of it in reality, but because for a time they presume to occupy that
place, and impose on men by the disguise which they wear. The apostle here views
the Church, as it appears in this world: but on this subject we shall afterwards
speak.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Agar is mount
Sinai</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa78</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> I shall
not waste time in refuting the expositions of other writers; for Jerome&#8217;s
conjecture, that Mount Sinai had two names, is trifling; and the disquisitions
of Chrysostom about the agreement of the names are equally unworthy of notice.
Sinai is called Hagar, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa79</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because
it is a type or figure, as the Passover was Christ. The situation of the
mountain is mentioned by way of contempt. It lies in Arabia, beyond the limits
of the holy land, by which the eternal inheritance was prefigured. The wonder
is, that in so familiar a matter they erred so egregiously.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And answers, on the other
hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Vulgate translates it, <i>is
joined</i> (conjunctus est) to Jerusalem; and Erasmus makes it, <i>borders
on</i> (confinis) Jerusalem; but I have adopted the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>on the other
hand,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> (ex adverso,) in order to avoid
obscurity. For the apostle certainly does not refer to nearness, or relative
position, but to resemblance, as respects the present comparison. The word,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">su&gt;stoica</font><font face="Palatino">,
which is translated <i>corresponding to</i>, denotes those things which are so
arranged as to have a mutual relation to each other, and a similar word,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">suatoici&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
when applied to trees and other objects, conveys the idea of their following in
regular order. Mount Sinai is said
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sustoicei~n</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>to correspond to</i> that which is now Jerusalem, in the same sense as
Aristotle says that Rhetoric is
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnti&gt;strofov</font><font face="Palatino">)
the <i>counterpart</i> to Logic, by a metaphor borrowed from lyric compositions,
which were usually arranged in two parts, so adapted as to be sung in harmony.
In short, the word,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sustoicei~</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>corresponds</i>, means nothing more than that it belongs to the same
class.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why does Paul compare the present Jerusalem with
Mount Sinai? Though I was once of a different opinion, yet I agree with
Chrysostom and Ambrose, who explain it as referring to the earthly Jerusalem,
and who interpret the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which now
is</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">th|~ nu~n 
Jierousalh&lt;m</font><font face="Palatino">, as marking the slavish doctrine
and worship into which it had degenerated. It ought to have been a lively image
of the new Jerusalem, and a representation of its character. But such as it now
is, it is rather related to Mount Sinai. Though the two places may be widely
distant from each other, they are perfectly alike in all their most important
features. This is a heavy reproach against the Jews, whose real mother was not
Sarah but the spurious Jerusalem, twin sister of Hagar; who were therefore
slaves born of a slave, though they haughtily boasted that they were the sons of
Abraham.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews

reflects the highest credit and the highest honor on the Church. But the Papists
are fools and twice children, who expect to give us uneasiness by producing
these words; for their mother is an adulteress, who brings forth to death the
children of the devil; and how foolish is the demand, that the children of God
should surrender themselves to her to be cruelly slain! Might not the synagogue
of Jerusalem at that time have assumed such haughty pretensions, with far higher
plausibility than Rome at the present day? and yet we see how Paul strips her of
every honorable distinction, and consigns her to the lot of
Hagar.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For it is
written</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The apostle proves, by a quotation
from Isaiah, that the lawful sons of the Church are born according to the
promise. The passage is in Isaiah 54 where the prophet speaks of the kingdom of
Christ and the calling of the Gentiles, and promises to the barren wife and the
widow a numerous offspring; for it is on this ground that he exhorts the Church
to &#8220;sing&#8221; and &#8220;rejoice.&#8221; The design of the apostle, let
it be carefully remarked, is to deprive the Jews of all claim to that spiritual
Jerusalem to which the prophecy relates. Isaiah proclaims, that her children
shall be gathered out of all the nations of the earth, and not by any
preparation of hers, but by the free grace and blessing of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He next concludes that we become the sons of God by
promise, after the example
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kata&lt; 
jIsaa&lt;k</font><font face="Palatino">) of Isaac, and that in no other way do
we obtain this honor. To readers little skilled or practiced in the examination
of Scripture, this reasoning may appear inconclusive; because they do not hold
the most undoubted of all principles, that all the promises, being founded on
the Messiah, are of free grace. It was because the apostle took this for
granted, that he so fearlessly contrasted the promise with the
law.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As then, he that was born after
the flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He denounces the cruelty of the
false apostles, who wantonly insulted pious persons that placed all their
confidence in Christ. There was abundant need that the uneasiness of the
oppressed should be soothed by consolation, and that the cruelty of their
oppressors should be severely checked. It is not wonderful, he says, that the
children of the law, at the present day, do what Ishmael their father at first
did, who, trusting to his being the first-born, persecuted Isaac the true heir.
With the same proud disdain do his posterity now, on account of outward
ceremonies, circumcision, and the various services of the law, molest and vaunt
over the lawful sons of God. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is again contrasted with the flesh, that
is, the calling of God with human appearance.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;091607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 16:7.) So the disguise is admitted to be possessed by the followers of
the Law and of works, but the reality is claimed for those who rely on the
calling of God alone, and depend upon his grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Persecuted.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
But persecution is nowhere mentioned, only Moses says that Ishmael was
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">qhxm</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>metzahek,</i>) <i>mocking</i>,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
21:9;) and by this participle he intimates that Ishmael ridiculed his brother
Isaac. The explanation offered by some Jews, that this was a simple smile, is
entirely inadmissible; for what cruelty would it have argued, that a harmless
smile should have been so fearfully revenged? There cannot then be a doubt that
he maliciously endeavored to provoke the child Isaac by reproachful
language.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But how widely distant is this from persecution? 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa80</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And yet
it is not idly or unguardedly that Paul enlarges on this point. No persecution
ought to distress us so much as to see our calling attempted to be undermined by
the reproaches of wicked men. Neither blows, nor scourging, nor nails, nor
thorns, occasioned to our Lord such intense suffering as that
blasphemy:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He trusted in God;
what availeth it to him?</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">for he is

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402743&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
27:43.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is more venom in this than in all persecutions;
for how much more alarming is it that the grace of Divine adoption shall be made
void, than that this frail life shall be taken from us? Ishmael did not
persecute his brother with the sword; but, what is worse, he treated him with
haughty disdain by trampling under foot the promise of God. All persecutions
arise from this source, that wicked men despise and hate in the elect the grace
of God; a memorable instance of which we have in the history of Cain and Abel.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
4:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This reminds us, that not only ought we to be filled
with horror at outward persecutions, when the enemies of religion slay us with
fire and sword; when they banish, imprison, torture, or scourge; but when they
attempt, by their blasphemies, to make void our confidence, which rests on the
promises of God; when they ridicule our salvation, when they wantonly laugh to
scorn the whole gospel. Nothing ought to wound our minds so deeply as contempt
of God, and reproaches cast upon His grace: nor is there any kind of persecution
more deadly than when the salvation of the soul is assailed. We who have escaped
from the tyranny of the Pope, are not called to encounter the swords of wicked
men. But how blind must we be, if we are not affected by that spiritual
persecution, in which they strive, by every method, to extinguish that doctrine,
from which we draw the breath of life! &#8212; when they attack our faith by
their blasphemies, and shake not a few of the less informed! For my own part, I
am far more grieved by the fury of the Epicureans than of the Papists. They do
not attack us by open violence; but, in proportion as the name of God is more
dear to me than my own life, the diabolical conspiracy which I see in operation
to extinguish all fear and worship of God, to root out the remembrance of
Christ, or to abandon it to the jeers of the ungodly, cannot but rack my mind
with greater anxiety, than if a whole country were burning in one
conflagration:</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But what saith the
Scripture</i></font><font face="Palatino">? There was some consolation in
knowing that we do but share the lot of our father Isaac; but it is a still
greater consolation, when he adds, that hypocrites, with all their boasting, can
gain nothing more than to be </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cast
out</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of the spiritual family of Abraham; and
that, to whatever extent they may harass us for a time, the inheritance will
certainly be ours. Let believers cheer themselves with this consolation, that
the tyranny of the Ishmaelites will not last for ever. They appear to have
reached the highest pre-eminence, and, proud of their birthright, look down upon
us with contempt; but they will one day be declared to be the descendants of
Hagar, the sons of a slave, and unworthy of the inheritance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us be instructed by this beautiful
passage,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;not to fret

<div><font face="Palatino">when they hold a temporary habitation and rank in the
Church, but patiently to look for the end which awaits them. There are many
pretended Christians, or strangers, who hold a place in the Church, but who
afterwards give evidence of their departure from the faith, as he who, proud of
his birthright, at first reigned, was cast out like a foreigner with the
posterity of Ishmael. Some censorious persons smile at Paul&#8217;s simplicity,
in comparing a woman&#8217;s passion, arising out of a trifling quarrel, to a
judgment of God. But they overlook the decree of God, which took effect in such
a manner, as to make it manifest that the whole transaction was directed by a
heavenly providence. That Abraham should have been commanded to humor his wife
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
21:12) entirely in the matter, is no doubt extraordinary, but proves that God
employed the services of Sarah for confirming his own promise. In a word, the
<i>casting out</i> of Ishmael was nothing else than the consequence and the
accomplishment of that promise, &#8220;In Isaac shall thy seed be called,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
21:12,) &#8212; not in Ishmael. Although, therefore, it was the revenging of a
woman&#8217;s quarrel, yet God did not the less make known his sentence by her
mouth as a type of the Church.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So then,
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now exhorts the Galatians to
prefer the condition of the children of Sarah to that of the children of Hagar;
and having reminded them that, by the grace of Christ, they were born to
freedom, he desires them to continue in the same condition. If we shall call the
Papists, Ishmaelites and Hagarites, and boast that we are the lawful children,
they will smile at us; but if the two subjects in dispute be fairly compared,
the most ignorant person will be at no loss to decide.</font><br></div>

cloak, our adversaries raise a prejudice against us among ignorant people, as if
the whole object of our pursuit were licentiousness, which is the relaxation of
all discipline. But wise and skillful persons are aware that this is one of the
most important doctrines connected with salvation. This is not a question
whether you shall eat this or that food, &#8212; whether you shall observe or
neglect a particular day, (which is the foolish notion entertained by many, and
the slander uttered by some,) but what is your positive duty before God, what is
necessary to salvation, and what cannot be omitted without sin. In short, the
controversy relates to the liberty of conscience, when placed before the
tribunal of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>liberty</i></font><font face="Palatino">

the same time, remember, that such liberty is only a part of that which Christ
has procured for us: for how small a matter would it be, if he had only freed us
from ceremonies? This is but a stream, which must be traced to a higher source.
It is because</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Christ was made a

<div><font face="Palatino">because he has revolted the power of the law&#8221;
so far as it held us liable to the judgment of God under the penalty of eternal
death; because, in a word, he has rescued us from the tyranny of sin, Satan, and
death. Thus, under one department is included the whole class; but on this
subject we shall speak more fully on the Epistle to the
Colossians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>liberty</i></font><font face="Palatino">
was procured for us by Christ on the cross: the fruit and possession of it are
bestowed upon us through the Gospel. Well does Paul, then, warn the Galatians,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not to be entangled again with
the yoke of bondage</i></font><font face="Palatino">, &#8212; that is, not to
allow a snare to be laid for their consciences. For if men lay upon our
shoulders an unjust burden, it may be borne; but if they endeavor to bring our
consciences into bondage, we must resist valiantly, even to death. If men be
permitted to bind our consciences, we shall be deprived of an invaluable
blessing, and an insult will be, at the same time, offered to Christ, the Author
of our freedom. But what is the force of the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>again</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
in the exhortation, &#8220;and be not entangled <i>again</i> with the yoke of
bondage?&#8221; for the Galatians had never lived under the law. It simply means
that they were not to be entangled, as if they had not been redeemed by the
grace of Christ. Although the law was given to Jews, not to Gentiles, yet, apart
from Christ, neither the one nor the other enjoys any freedom, but absolute
bondage.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I
Paul</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He could not have pronounced a severer
threatening than that it would exclude them entirely from the grace of Christ.
But what is the meaning of this, that Christ will
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>profit
nothing</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to all who are circumcised? Did Christ
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>profit
nothing</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to Abraham? Nay, it was in order that
Christ might profit him that he received circumcision. If we say that it was in
force till the coming of Christ, what reply shall we make to the case of
Timothy? We must observe, that Paul&#8217;s reasoning is directed not so
properly against the outward rite or ceremony, as against the wicked doctrine of
the false apostles, who pretended that it was a necessary part of the worship of
God, and at the same time made it a ground of confidence as a meritorious work.
These diabolical contrivances made Christ to <i>profit nothing</i>; not that the
false apostles denied Christ, or wished him to be entirely set aside, but that
they made such a division between his grace and the works of the law as to leave
not more than the half of salvation due to Christ. The apostle contends that
Christ cannot be divided in this way, and that he &#8220;profiteth
nothing,&#8221; unless he is wholly embraced.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And what else do our modern Papists but thrust upon
us, in place of circumcision, trifles of their own invention? The tendency of
their whole doctrine is to blend the grace of Christ with the merit of works,
which is impossible. Whoever wishes to have the half of Christ, loses the whole.
And yet the Papists think themselves exceedingly acute when they tell us that
they ascribe nothing to works, except through the influence of the grace of
Christ, as if this were a different error from what was charged on the
Galatians. They did not believe that they had departed from Christ, or
relinquished his grace; and yet they lost Christ entirely, when that important
part of evangelical doctrine was corrupted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The expression
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, I
Paul</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is very emphatic; for he places himself
before them, and gives his name, to remove all appearance of hesitation. And
though his authority had begun to be less regarded among the Galatians, he
asserts that it is sufficient to put down every
adversary.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I testify
again</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What he now advances is proved by the
contradiction involved in the opposite statement. He who is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a debtor to do the whole
law</i></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa82</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> will
never escape death, but will always continue to be held as guilty; for no man
will ever be found who satisfies the law. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa83</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Such
being the obligation, the man must unavoidably be condemned, and Christ can
render him no service. We see then the contradictory nature of the two
propositions, that we are partakers of the grace of Christ, and yet that we are
bound to fulfill the whole law. But will it not then follow, that none of the
fathers were saved? Will it not also follow that Timothy was ruined, since Paul
caused him to be circumcised?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

is inseparable from circumcision!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It ought to be observed that Paul is accustomed to
view circumcision in two different aspects, as every person who has best, owed a
moderate degree of attention on his writings will easily perceive. In the
Epistle to the Romans,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
4:11,) he calls it &#8220;a seal of the righteousness of faith;&#8221; and
there, under circumcision, he includes Christ and the free promise of salvation.
But here he contrasts it with Christ, and faith, and the gospel, and grace,
&#8212; viewing it simply as a legal covenant, founded on the merit of
works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The consequence is, as we have already said, that he
does not always speak about circumcision in the same way; but the reason of the
difference must be taken into account. When he views circumcision in its own
nature, he properly makes it to be a symbol of grace, because such was the
appointment of God. But when he is dealing with the false apostles, who abused
circumcision by making it an instrument for destroying the Gospel, he does not
there consider the purpose for which it was appointed by the Lord, but attacks
the corruption which has proceeded from men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A very striking example occurs in this passage. When
Abraham had received a promise concerning Christ, and justification by free
grace, and eternal salvation, circumcision was added, in order to confirm the
promise; and thus it became, by the appointment of God, a sacrament, which was
subservient to faith. Next come the false apostles, who pretend that it is a
meritorious work, and recommend the observance of the law, making a profession
of obedience to it to be signified by circumcision as an initiatory rite. Paul
makes no reference here to the appointment of God, but attacks the unscriptural
views of the false apostles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It will be objected, that the abuses, whatever they
may be, which wicked men commit, do not at all impair the sacred ordinances of
God. I reply, the Divine appointment of circumcision was only for a time. After
the coming of Christ, it ceased to be a Divine institution, because baptism had
suceeeded in its room. Why, then, was Timothy circumcised? Not certainly on his
own account, but for the sake of weak brethren, to whom that point was yielded.
To show more fully the agreement between the doctrine of the Papists and that
which Paul opposes, it must be observed, that the sacraments, when we partake of
them in a sincere manner, are not the works of men, but of God. In baptism or
the Lord&#8217;s supper, we do nothing but present ourselves to God, in order to
receive his grace. Baptism, viewed in regard to us, is a passive work: we bring
nothing to it but faith; and all that belongs to it is laid up in Christ. But
what are the views of the Papists? They contrive the <i>opus operatum</i>,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa84</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by
which men merit the grace of God; and what is this, but to extinguish utterly
the truth of the sacrament? Baptism and the Lord&#8217;s supper are retained by
us, because it was the will of Christ that the use of them should be perpetual;
but those wicked and foolish notions are rejected by us with the strong
abhorrence which they deserve.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ has become of no effect
unto you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. &#8220;If ye seek any part of
righteousness in the works of the law, Christ has no concern with you, and<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye are fallen from
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221; They were not so grossly mistaken
as to believe that by the observance of the law alone they were justified, but
attempted to mix Christ with the law. In any other point of view, Paul&#8217;s
threatenings would have utterly failed to produce alarm. &#8220;What are you
doing? You deprive yourselves of every advantage from Christ, and treat his
grace as if it were of no value whatever.&#8221; We see then that the smallest
part of justification cannot be attributed to the law without renouncing Christ
and his grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we through the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now anticipates an objection that,
might readily occur. &#8220;Will circumcision then be of no use?&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he replies, it <i>availeth</i> nothing.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
therefore, depends on faith, and is obtained, through the Spirit, without
ceremonies. To </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wait for the hope
of righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is to place our confidence in
this or that object, or, to decide from what quarter righteousness is to be
expected; though the words probably contain the exhortation, &#8220;Let us
continue steadfastly in the hope of righteousness which we obtain by
faith.&#8221; When he says that we obtain righteousness by faith, this applies
equally to us and to our fathers. All of them, as Scripture testifies,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:5,) &#8220;pleased God;&#8221; but their faith was concealed by the veil of
ceremonies, and therefore he distinguishes us from them by the word
<i>Spirit</i>, which is contrasted with outward shadows. His meaning therefore
is, that all that is now necessary for obtaining righteousness is a simple
faith, which declines the aid of splendid ceremonies, and is satisfied with the
spiritual worship of God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For in Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The reason why believers now wait for
the hope of righteousness through the Spirit is, that in Christ, that is, in the
kingdom of Christ, or in the Christian church, circumcision with its appendages
is abolished; for, by a figure of speech in which a part is taken for the whole,
the word Circumcision is put for ceremonies. While he declares that they no
longer possess any influence, he does not admit that they were always useless;
for he does not maintain that they were repealed till after the revelation of
Christ. This enables us to answer another question, Why does he here speak so
contemptuously of circumcision, as if it had been of no advantage? The rank
which circumcision once held as a sacrament is not now considered. The question
is not what was its value before it had been abolished. But under the kingdom of
Christ, he pronounces it to be on a level with uncircumcision, because the
coming of Christ has put an end to legal ceremonies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But faith, which worketh by
love.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The contrast here introduced, between
ceremonies and the exercise of love, was intended to prevent the Jews from
thinking too highly of themselves, and imagining that they were entitled to some
superiority; for towards the close of the Epistle, instead of this clause, he
uses the words, <i>a new creature</i>.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:15.) As if he had said, Ceremonies are no longer enjoined by Divine authority;
and, if we abound in the exercise of love, all is well. Meanwhile, this does not
set aside our sacraments, which are aids to faith but is merely a short
announcement of what he had formerly taught as to the spiritual worship of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There would be no difficulty in this passage, were it
not for the dishonest manner in which it has been tortured by the Papists to
uphold the righteousness of works. When they attempt to refute our doctrine,
that we are justified by faith alone, they take this line of argument. If the
faith which justifies us be that &#8220;which worketh by love,&#8221; then faith
alone does not justify. I answer, they do not comprehend their own silly talk;
still less do they comprehend our statements. It is not our doctrine that the
faith which justifies is alone; we maintain that it is invariably accompanied by
good works; only we contend that faith alone is sufficient for justification.
The Papists themselves are accustomed to tear faith after a murderous fashion,
sometimes presenting it out of all shape and unaccompanied by love, and at other
times, in its true character. We, again, refuse to admit that, in any case,
faith can be separated from the Spirit of regeneration; but when the question
comes to be in what manner we are justified, we then set aside all
works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With respect to the present passage, Paul enters into
no dispute whether love cooperates with faith in justification; but, in order to
avoid the appearance of representing Christians as idle and as resembling blocks
of wood, he points out what are the true exercises of believers. When you are
engaged in discussing the question of justification, beware of allowing any
mention to be made of love or of works, but resolutely adhere to the exclusive
particle. Paul does not here treat of justification, or assign any part of the
praise of it to love. Had he done so, the same argument would prove that
circumcision and ceremonies, at a former period, had some share in justifying a
sinner. As in Christ Jesus he commends faith accompanied by love, so before the
coming of Christ ceremonies were required. But this has nothing to do with
obtaining righteousness, as the Papists themselves allow; and neither must it be
supposed that love possesses any such influence.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye did run
well</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The censure which the apostle administers
for their present departure from the truth is mingled with approbation of their
former course, for the express purpose that, by being brought to a sense of
shame, they may return more speedily to the right path. The astonishment
conveyed in the question, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>who
hindered you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> was intended to produce a
blush. I have chosen to translate the Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pei&gt;qsqai</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>obey</i>, rather than <i>believe</i>, because, having once embraced the
purity of the gospel, they had been led away from a course of
obedience.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This persuasion cometh
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Having formerly combated them by
arguments, he at length pronounces, with a voice of authority, that their
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>persuasion</i></font><font face="Palatino">
came not from God. Such an admonition would not be entitled to much regard, were
it not supported by the authority of the speaker. But Paul, to whom the
Galatians had been indebted for the announcement of their Divine calling, was
well entitled to address them in this confident language. This is the reason why
he does not directly say, <i>from God</i>, but expresses it by a circumlocution,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>him that hath called
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> As if
he had said, &#8220;God is never inconsistent with himself, and he it is who by
my preaching called you to salvation. This new persuasion then has come from
some other quarter; and if you wish to have it thought that your calling is from
God, beware of lending an ear to those who thrust upon you their new
inventions.&#8221; Though the Greek participle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kalou~ntov</font><font face="Palatino">,
I acknowledge, is in the present tense, I have preferred translating, <i>who
hath called you</i>, in order to remove the
ambiguity.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A little
leaven</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This refers, I think, to doctrine, not
to men. It guards them against the mischievous consequences which arise from
corruption of doctrine, and warns them not to consider it, as is commonly done,
to be a matter attended by little or no danger. Satan&#8217;s stratagem is, that
he does not attempt an avowed destruction of the whole gospel, but he taints its
purity by introducing false and corrupt opinions. Many persons are thus led to
overlook the seriousness of the injury done, and therefore make a less
determined resistance. The apostle proclaims aloud that, after the truth of God
has been corrupted, we are no longer safe. He employs the metaphor of
<i>leaven</i>, which, however small in quantity, communicates its sourness to
the whole mass. We must exercise the utmost caution lest we allow any
counterfeit to be substituted for the pure doctrine of the
gospel.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have confidence in
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. All his fierceness is again directed
against the false apostles. To them the evil is traced, and on them the
punishment is threatened. Good hopes are expressed regarding the Galatians, that
they will quickly and readily return to a sincere belief. It gives us courage to
learn that good hopes are entertained about us; for we reckon it shameful to
disappoint those whose feelings towards us are kind and friendly. But to bring
back the Galatians to the pure doctrine of faith, from which they had turned
aside, was the work of God. The apostle says that he has confidence in them,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn
Kuri&gt;w|</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">, by which he reminds them that repentance
is a heavenly gift, and that they must ask it from God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that troubleth
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa86</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
sentiment which he had just delivered is confirmed by thus indirectly imputing
the greater part of the blame to those impostors by whom the Galatians had been
deceived. From the punishment denounced against <i>them</i>, the Galatians are
very nearly exempted. Let all who introduce confusion into churches, who break
the unity of faith, who destroy their harmony, lend an ear to this; and if they
have any right feeling, let them tremble at this word. God declares, by the
mouth of Paul, that none &#8220;through whom such offenses come&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;421701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
17:1) will pass unpunished. The phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whosoever he
be</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is emphatic; for the high sounding language
of the false apostles had terrified the ignorant multitude. It became necessary
for Paul to defend his doctrine with corresponding warmth and energy, and not to
spare any one who dared to raise his voice against it, however eminent or
however distinguished.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I,
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This argument, is drawn from the
final cause. &#8220;It would be completely in my power,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;to avoid the displeasure of men, and every kind of danger and
persecution, were I only to mix ceremonies with Christ. The earnestness with
which I oppose them is not on my own account, nor for my own advantage.&#8221;
But does it therefore follow that his doctrine is true? I answer, proper
feelings and pure conscience, when manifested by a teacher, have no small share
in obtaining confidence. Besides, it cannot be believed that any man would be so
mad as to take measures, of his own accord, for bringing distress upon himself.
Lastly, he throws upon his adversaries the suspicion, that, in preaching
circumcision, they were more disposed to consult their own ease than to be
faithful in the service of Christ. In short, Paul was at the farthest remove
from ambition, covetousness, or regard to personal interest, since he despised
favor and applause, and exposed himself to the persecutions and fury of the
multitude rather than swerve a hair&#8217;s-breadth from the purity of the
gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then is the offense of the cross
ceased</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Willingly does Paul, in speaking of the
gospel, call it the cross, or the preaching of the cross, when he wishes to
bring its poor, simple style, into contrast with the &#8220;great swelling
words&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;650116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jude
1:16) of human wisdom or righteousness. For the Jews, puffed up with an
ill-founded confidence in their righteousness, and the Greeks, with a foolish
belief of their wisdom, despised the meanness of the gospel. When therefore he
says that now, If the preaching of circumcision be admitted, the offense of the
cross will no longer exist, he means that the gospel will meet with no annoyance
from the Jews, but will be taught with their entire concurrence. And why?
Because they will no longer take offense at a pretended and spurious gospel,
gathered out of Moses and out of Christ, but will look with greater indulgence
on that mixture which will leave them in possession of their former
superiority.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Would that they were even cut
off</i></font><font face="Palatino">. His indignation proceeds still farther,
and he prays for destruction on those impostors by whom the Galatians had been
deceived. The word, &#8220;cut off,&#8221; appears to be employed in allusion to
the circumcision which they pressed. &#8220;They tear the church for the sake of
circumcision: I wish they were entirely cut off.&#8221; Chrysostom favors this
opinion. But how can such an imprecation be reconciled with the mildness of an
apostle, who ought to wish that all should be saved, and that not a single
person should perish? So far as men are concerned, I admit the force of this
argument; for it is the will of God that we should seek the salvation of all men
without exception, as Christ suffered for the sins of the whole world. But
devout minds are sometimes carried beyond the consideration of men, and led to
fix their eye on the glory of God, and the kingdom of Christ. The glory of God,
which is in itself more excellent than the salvation of men, ought to receive
from us a higher degree of esteem and regard. Believers earnestly desirous that
the glory of God should be promoted, forget men, and forget the world, and would
rather choose that the whole world should perish, than that the smallest portion
of the glory of God should be withdrawn.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us remember, however, that such a prayer as this
proceeds from leaving men wholly out of view, and fixing our attention on God
alone. Paul cannot be accused of cruelty, as if he were opposed to the law of
love. Besides, if a single man or a few persons be brought into comparison, how
immensely must the church preponderate! It is a cruel kind of mercy which
prefers a single man to the whole church. &#8220;On one side, I see the flock of
God in danger; on the other, I see a wolf &#8220;seeking,&#8221; like Satan,
&#8220;whom he may devour.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 5:8.) Ought not my care of the church to swallow up all my thoughts, and
lead me to desire that its salvation should be purchased by the destruction of
the wolf? And yet I would not wish that a single individual should perish in
this way; but my love of the church and my anxiety about her interests carry me
away into a sort of ecstasy, so that I can think of nothing else.&#8221; With
such zeal as this, every true pastor of the church will burn. The Greek word
translated &#8220;who <i>trouble</i> you,&#8221; signifies to remove from a
certain rank or station. By using the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kai&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>even</i>, he expresses more strongly his desire that the impostors should not
merely be degraded, but entirely separated and cut off.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have been called to
liberty</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now proceeds to show in what way
liberty must be used. In the course of expounding the First Epistle to the
Corinthians, we have pointed out that liberty is one thing, and that the use of
it is another thing. Liberty lies in the conscience, and looks to God; the use
of it lies in outward matters, and deals not with God only, but with men. Having
exhorted the Galatians to suffer no diminution of their liberty, he now enjoins
them to be moderate in the use of it, and lays down as a rule for the lawful
use, that it shall not be turned into pretext or occasion for licentiousness.
Liberty is not granted to the flesh, which ought rather to be held captive under
the yoke, but is a spiritual benefit, which none but pious minds are capable of
enjoying.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But by
love</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The method here explained of restraining
liberty from breaking out into wide and licentious abuse is, to have it
regulated <i>by love</i>. Let us always remember that the present question is
not, in what manner we are free before God, but in what manner we may use our
liberty in our intercourse with men. A good conscience submits to no slavery;
but to practice outward slavery, or to abstain from the use of liberty, is
attended by no danger. In a word, if &#8220;by love we serve one another,&#8221;
we shall always have regard to edification, so that we shall not grow wanton,
but use the grace of God for his honor and the salvation of our
neighbors.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For all the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is a contrast in this verse, though
not plainly stated, yet evidently to be understood, between Paul&#8217;s
exhortation and the doctrine of the false apostles. While they insisted on
ceremonies alone, Paul takes a passing glance of the actual duties and exercises
of Christians. The present commendation of love is intended to inform the
Galatians, that love forms the chief part of Christian perfection. But we must
inquire in to the reason why all the precepts of the law are included under
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
The law consists of two tables, the first of which instructs us concerning the
worship of God and the duties of piety, and the second instructs us concerning
the love of our neighbor; for it is ridiculous to make a part the same with the
whole. Some avoid this difficulty by reminding us that the first table contains
nothing more than to love God with our whole heart. But Paul makes express
mention of love to our neighbor, and therefore a more satisfactory solution must
be sought.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Piety to God, I acknowledge, ranks higher than love
of the brethren; and therefore the observance of the first table is more
valuable in the sight of God than the observance of the second. But as God
himself is invisible, so piety is a thing hidden from the eyes of men; and,
though the manifestation of it was the purpose for which ceremonies were
appointed, they are not certain proofs of its existence. It frequently happens,
that none are more zealous and regular in observing ceremonies than hypocrites.
God therefore chooses to make trial of our love to himself by that love of our
brother, which he enjoins us to cultivate. This is the reason why, not here
only, but in the Epistle to the Romans,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450808&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:8, 13:10,) love is called &#8220;the fulfilling of the law;&#8221; not that it
excels, but that it proves the worship of God to be real. God, I have said, is
invisible; but he represents himself to us in the brethren, and in their persons
demands what is due to himself. Love to men springs only from the fear and love
of God; and therefore we need not wonder if, by a figure of speech, in which a
part is taken for the whole, the effect include under it the cause of which it
is the sign. But it would be wrong in any person to attempt to separate our love
of God from our love of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt love thy
neighbor</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He who loves will render to every man
his right, will do injury or harm to no man, will do good, as far as lies in his
power, to all; for what else is included in the whole of the second table? This,
too, is the argument employed by Paul in his Epistle to the Romans
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:10.) The word,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>neighbor</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
includes all men living; for we are linked together by a common nature, as
Isaiah reminds us, &#8220;that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;235807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
58:7.) The image of God ought to be particularly regarded as a sacred bond of
union; but, for that very reason, no distinction is here made between friend and
foe, nor can the wickedness of men set aside the right of
nature.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;. The
love which men naturally cherish toward themselves ought to regulate our love of
our neighbor. All the doctors of the Sorbonne 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> are in
the habit of arguing that, as the rule is superior to what it directs, the love
of ourselves must always hold the first rank. This is not to interpret, but to
subvert our Lord&#8217;s words. They are asses, and have not even a spark of the
love of their neighhour; for if the love of ourselves were the rule, it would
follow that it is proper and holy, and is the object of the divine approbation.
But we shall never love our neighbors with sincerity, according to our
Lord&#8217;s intention, till we have corrected the love of ourselves. The two
affections are opposite and contradictory; for the love of ourselves leads us to
neglect and despise others, &#8212; produces cruelty, covetousness, violence,
deceit, and all kindred vices, &#8212; drives us to impatience, and arms us with
the desire of revenge. Our Lord therefore enjoins that it be changed into the
love of our neighbor.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if ye bite and devour one
another</i></font><font face="Palatino">. From the nature of the subject, as
well as from the language employed, we may conjecture that the Galatians had
disputes among themselves; for they differed about doctrine. The apostle now
demonstrates, from the result, how destructive such proceedings in the church
must ultimately prove to be. False doctrine was probably a judgment from heaven
upon their ambition, pride, and other offenses. This may be concluded from what
frequently happens in the divine dispensations, as well as from an express
declaration by the hand of Moses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Thou shalt not hearken unto the
words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams; for the Lord your God proveth
you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all
your soul.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;051303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
13:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By <i>biting and devouring</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
means, I think, slanders, accusations, reproaches, and every other kind of
offensive language, as well as acts of injustice arising either from fraud or
violence. And what is the end of them? To be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>consumed</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
while the tendency of brotherly love is to produce mutual protection and
kindness. I wish we could always remember, when the devil tempts us to disputes,
that the disagreement of members within the church can lead to nothing else than
the ruin and consumption of the whole body. How distressing, how mad is it, that
we, who are members of the same body, should be leagued together, of our own
accord, for mutual destruction!</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This I say
then</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Now follows the remedy. The ruin of the
church is no light evil, and whatever threatens it must be opposed with the most
determined resistance. But how is this to be accomplished? By not permitting the
flesh to rule in us, and by yielding ourselves to the direction of the Spirit of
God. The Galatians are indirectly told, that they are carnal, destitute of the
Spirit of God, and that the life which they lead is unworthy of Christians; for
whence did their violent conduct towards each other proceed, but from their
being guided by the lust of the flesh? This, he tells them, is an evidence that
they do not walk according to the Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye shall not
fulfill</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We ought to mark the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fulfill</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
by which he means, that, though the sons of God, so long as they groan under the
burden of the flesh, are liable to commit sin, they are not its subjects or
slaves, but make habitual opposition to its power. The spiritual man may be
frequently assaulted by the lusts of the flesh, but
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fulfill</i></font><font face="Palatino">
them, &#8212; he does not permit them to reign over him. &#8212; On this
subject, it will be proper to consult the eighth chapter of the Epistle to the
Romans.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the flesh
lusteth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The spiritual life maintained without
a struggle. We are here informed of the nature of the difficulty, which arises
from our natural inclinations being opposed to the Spirit. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
as we had occasion to observe, in expounding the Epistle to the Romans, denotes
the nature of man; for the limited application of it, which the sophists make to
the lower senses, as they are called, is refuted by various passages; and the
contrast between the two words puts an end to all doubt.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"> denotes the renewed nature, or the grace
of regeneration; and what else does the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">
mean, but &#8220;the old man?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:6
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:22
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:9.) Disobedience and rebellion against the Spirit of God pervade the whole
nature of man. If we would obey the Spirit, we must labor, and fight, and apply
our utmost energy; and we must begin with self-denial. The compliment paid by
our Lord to the natural inclinations of men, amounts to this, &#8212; that there
is no greater agreement between them and righteousness, than between fire and
water. Where, then, shall we find a drop of goodness in man&#8217;s free will?
unless we pronounce that to be good which is contrary to the Spirit of
God;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;because the carnal
mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
indeed can
be.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450807&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
8:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">All the thoughts of the flesh are acts of enmity
against God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So that ye cannot do the things
that ye would</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This refers, unquestionably, to
the regenerate. Carnal men have no battle with depraved lusts, no proper desire
to attain to the righteousness of God. Paul is addressing believers.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The things that ye
would</i></font><font face="Palatino"> must mean, not our natural inclinations,
but the holy affections which God bestows upon us by his grace. Paul therefore
declares, that believers, so long as they are in this life, whatever may be the
earnestness of their endeavors, do not obtain such a measure of success as to
serve God in a perfect manner. The highest result does not correspond to their
wishes and desires. I must again refer the reader, for a more extended view of
my sentiments on this subject, to the Exposition of the Epistle to the Romans,
(See Calvin on
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:15.)</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if ye be led by the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the way of the Lord believers are
apt to stumble. But let them not be discouraged, because they are unable to
satisfy the demands of the law. Let them listen to the consolatory declaration
of the apostle, which is also found in other parts of his writings,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450614&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:14,) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye are not under the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Hence it follows, that the performance of
their duties is not rejected on account of their present defects, but is
accepted in the sight of God, as if it had been in every respect perfect and
complete. Paul is still pursuing the controversy about freedom. The Spirit is
elsewhere
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:15) denominated by him, &#8220;the Spirit of adoption;&#8221; and when the
Spirit makes men free, he emancipates them from the yoke of the law. As if he
had said, &#8220;Is it your desire instantly to terminate the controversies in
which you are now engaged? Walk according to the Spirit. You will then be free
from the dominion of the law, which will act only in the capacity of a kind
adviser, and will no longer lay a restraint upon your consciences.&#8221;
Besides, when the condemnation of the law is removed, freedom from ceremonies
follows as a necessary consequence; for ceremonies mark the condition of a
slave.</font><br></div>

attainment of which they have been urged to make the most strenuous exertions.
In accordance with these views, he now draws a picture both of the flesh and of

declaration, for they are nothing but flesh; but such is the hypocrisy belonging
to our natural state, we never perceive our depravity till the tree has been

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ase&gt;lgeia</font><font face="Palatino">,

virtue or worth of that person, in itself considered, gives him uneasiness, but
because he would wish to be superior. The <i>envious</i> man has no desire to
excel, but is grieved at the excellence of other men. None, therefore, he tells
us, but low and mean persons indulge in envy, while emulation dwells in lofty
and heroic minds. Paul declares both to be diseases of the <i>flesh</i>. From
anger and hatred arise </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>variance,

and the renewed nature which we derive from Christ. As if he had said,
&#8220;Nothing but what is evil comes from man; nothing good comes but from the
Holy Spirit.&#8221; There have often appeared in unrenewed men remarkable
instances of gentleness, integrity, temperance, and generosity; but it is
certain that all were but specious disguises. Curius and Fabrieius were
distinguished for courage, Cato for temperance, Scipio for kindness and
generosity, Fabius for patience; but it was only in the sight of men, and as
members of civil society, that they were so distinguished. In the sight of God

<div><font face="Palatino">But if spiritual men are known by their works, what
judgment, it will be asked, shall we form of wicked men and idolaters, who
exhibited an illustrious resemblance of all the virtues? for it is evident from
their works that they were spiritual. I reply, as all the works of the flesh do
not appear openly in a carnal man, but his carnaltry is discovered by one or
another vice, so a single virtue will not entitle us to conclude that a man is
spiritual. Sometimes it will be made evident, by other vices, that sin reigns in
him; and this observation may be easily applied to all the cases which I have
enumerated.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Against such there is no
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some understand these words as meaning
simply that the law is not directed against good works, &#8220;from evil manners
have sprung good laws.&#8221; But Paul&#8217;s real meaning is deeper and less
obvious; namely, that, where the Spirit reigns, the law has no longer any
dominion. By moulding our hearts to his own righteousness, the Lord delivers us
from the severity of the law, so that our intercourse with himself is not
regulated by its covenant, nor our consciences bound by its sentence of
condemnation. Yet the law continues to teach and exhort, and thus performs its
own office; but our subjection to it is withdrawn by the Spirit of adoption. He
thus ridicules the false apostles, who, while they enforced subjection to the
law, were not less eager to release themselves from its yoke. The only way, he
tells us, in which this is accomplished, is, when the Spirit of God obtains
dominion, from which we are led to conclude that they had no proper regard to
spiritual righteousness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they that are
Christ&#8217;s</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He adds this, in order to show
that all Christians have renounced the flesh, and therefore enjoy freedom. While
he makes this statement, the apostle reminds the Galatians what true
Christianity is, so far as relates to the life, and thus guards them against a
false profession of Christianity. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>crucified</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">is employed to point out that the mortification of
the flesh is the effect of the cross of Christ. This work does not belong to
man. By the grace of Christ</font><br></div>

are buried with Christ, by true self-denial, and by the destruction of the old

indeed entirely destroyed; but it has no right to exercise dominion, and ought
to yield to the Spirit. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and its</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
lusts</i></font><font face="Palatino"> are a figure of speech of exactly the
same import with the <i>tree</i> and its <i>fruits</i>. The <i>flesh</i> itself
is the depravity of corrupt nature, from which all evil actions proceed.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
15:19;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;410721&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
7:21.) Hence it follows, that the members of Christ have cause to complain, if
they are still held to be in bondage to the law, from which all who have been
regenerated by his Spirit are set
free.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If we live in the
Spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> According to his usual custom, the
apostle draws from the doctrine a practical exhortation. The death of the flesh
is the life of the Spirit. If the Spirit of God lives in us, let him govern our
actions. There will always be many persons daring enough to make a false boast
of living in the Spirit, but the apostle challenges them to a proof of the fact.
As the soul does not remain idle in the body, but gives motion and rigour to
every member and part, so the Spirit of God cannot dwell in us without
manifesting himself by the outward effects. By the <i>life</i> is here meant the
inward power, and by the <i>walk</i> the outward actions. The metaphorical use
of the word <i>walk</i>, which frequently occurs, describes works as evidences
of the spiritual life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let us not be desirous of
vain-glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">, The special exhortations which were
addressed to the Galatians were not more necessary for them than they are
adapted to our own time. Of many evils existing in society at large, and
particularly in the church, ambition is the mother. Paul therefore directs us to
guard against it, for the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vain-glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kenodoxi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
of which he speaks is nothing else than <i>ambition</i>, (filimia,) or the
desire of honor, by which every one desires to excel all others. The heathen
philosophers do not condemn every desire of glory; but among Christians, whoever
is desirous of glory departs from true glory, and therefore is justly charged
with idle and foolish ambition. It is not lawful for us to glow but in God
alone. Every other kind of glorying is pure vanity. Mutual <i>provocations</i>
and <i>envyings</i> are the daughters of ambition. He who aspires to the highest
rank must of necessity envy all others, and disrespectful, biting, stinging
language is the unavoidable consequence.</font><br></div>

in any
fault</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa94</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Ambition is a serious and alarming evil. But hardly less injury is frequently
done by unseasonable and excessive severity, which, under the plausible name of
zeal, springs in many instances from pride, and from dislike and contempt of the
brethren. Most men seize on the faults of brethren as an occasion of insulting
them, and of using reproachful and cruel language. Were the pleasure they take
in upbraiding equalled by their desire to produce amendment, they would act in a
different manner. Reproof, and often sharp and severe reproof, must be
administered to offenders. But while we must not shrink from a faithful
testimony against sin, neither must we omit to mix oil with the
vinegar.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are here taught to correct the faults of brethren
in a mild manner, and to consider no rebukes as partaking a religious and
Christian character which do not breathe the spirit of meekness. To gain this
object, he explains the design of pious reproofs, which is<i>, to restore him
who is fallen,</i> to place him in his former condition. That design will never
be accomplished by violence, or by a disposition to accuse, or by fierceness of
manner or language; and consequently, we must display a gentle and meek spirit,
if we intend to heal our brother. And lest any man should satisfy himself with
assuming the outward form, he demands
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the spirit of
meekness</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for no man is prepared for chastising
a brother till he has succeeded in acquiring a gentle spirit. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa95</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Another argument for gentleness in correcting
brethren is contained in the expression, &#8220;if a man be
<i>overtaken</i>.&#8221; If he has been carried away through want of
consideration, or through the cunning arts of a deceiver, it would be cruel to
treat such a man with harshness. Now, we know that the devil is always lying in
wait, and has a thousand ways of leading us astray. When we perceive a brother
to have transgressed, let us consider that he has fallen into the snares of
Satan; let us be moved with compassion, and prepare our minds to exercise
forgiveness. But offenses and falls of this description must undoubtedly be
distinguished from deep seated crimes, accompanied by deliberate and obstinate
disregard of the authority of God. Such a display of wicked and perverse
disobedience to God must be visited with greater severity, for what advantage
would be gained by gentle treatment? The particle<i> if also</i>,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eja&lt;n
kai&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">,) implies that not only the weak who have
been tempted, but those who have yielded to temptation, shall receive
forbearance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye who are
spiritual</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is not spoken in irony; for,
however spiritual they might be, still they were not wholly filled with the
Spirit. It belongs to such persons to raise up the fallen. To what better
purpose can their superior attainments be applied than to promote the salvation
of the brethren? The more eminently any man is endowed with Divine grace, the
more strongly is he bound to consult the edification of those who have been less
favored. But such is our folly, that in our best duties we are apt to fail, and
therefore need the exhortation which the apostle gives to guard against the
influence of carnal views.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Considering
thyself</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is not without reason that the
apostle passes from the plural to the singular number. He gives weight to his
admonition, when he addresses each person individually, and bids him look
carefully into himself. &#8220;Whoever thou art that takest upon thee the office
of reproving others, look to thyself.&#8221; Nothing is more difficult than to
bring us to acknowledge or examine our own weakness. Whatever may be our
acuteness in detecting the faults of others, we do not see, as the saying is,
&#8220;the wallet that hangs behind our own back;&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa96</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
therefore, to arouse us to greater activity, he employs the singular
number.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These words may admit of two senses. As we
acknowledge that we are liable to sin, we more willingly grant that forgiveness
to others which, in our turn, we expect will be extended to us. Some interpret
them in this manner: &#8220;Thou who art a sinner, and needest the compassion of
thy brethren, oughtest not to show thyself fierce and implacable to
others.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa97</font></sup><font face="Palatino">  But I
would rather choose to expound them as a warning given by Paul, that, in
correcting others, we should not ourselves commit sin. There is a danger here
which deserves our most careful attention, and against which it is difficult to
guard; for nothing is more easy than to exceed the proper limits. The word
<i>tempt</i>, however, may very properly be taken in this passage as extended to
the whole life. Whenever we have occasion to pronounce censure, let us begin
with ourselves, and, remembering our own weakness, let us be indulgent to
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bear ye one another&#8217;s
burdens</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The weaknesses or sins, under which we
groan, are called <i>burdens</i>. This phrase is singularly appropriate in an
exhortation to kind behavior, for nature dictates to us that those who bend
under a burden ought to be relieved. He enjoins us to <i>bear</i> the burdens.
We must not indulge or overlook the sins by which our brethren are pressed down,
but relieve them, &#8212; which can only be done by mild and friendly
correction. There are many adulterers and thieves, many wicked and abandoned
characters of every description, who would willingly make Christ an accomplice
in their crimes. All would choose to lay upon believers the task of bearing
their burdens. But as the apostle had immediately before exhorted us to
<i>restore</i> a brother, the manner in which Christians are required to <i>bear
one another&#8217;s burdens</i> cannot be mistaken.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And so fulfill the law of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The word <i>law</i>, when applied here
to Christ, serves the place of an argument. There is an implied contrast between
the law of Christ and the law of Moses. &#8220;If you are very desirous to keep
a law, Christ enjoins on you a law which you are bound to prefer to all others,
and that is, to cherish kindness towards each other. He who has not this has
nothing. On the other hand, he tells us, that, when every one compassionately
assists his neighbor, the law of Christ is <i>fulfilled</i>; by which he
intimates that every thing which does not proceed from love is superfluous; for
the composition of the Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnaplhrw&gt;sate</font><font face="Palatino">,
conveys the idea of what is absolutely perfect. But as no man performs in every
respect what Paul requires, we are still at a distance from perfection. He who
comes the nearest to it with regard to others, is yet far distant with respect
to God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For if a man think
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is an ambiguity in the
construction, but Paul&#8217;s meaning is clear. The phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When he is
nothing</i></font><font face="Palatino">, appears at first view to mean,
&#8220;if any person, who is in reality nothing, claims to be something;&#8221;
as there are many men of no real worth who are elated by a foolish admiration of
themselves. But the meaning is more general, and may be thus expressed:
&#8220;Since all men are nothing, he who wishes to appear something, and
persuades himself that he is somebody, deceives himself.&#8221; First, then, he
declares that we are nothing, by which he means, that we have nothing of our own
of which we have a right to boast, but are destitute of every thing good: so
that all our glorying is mere vanity. Secondly, he infers that they who claim
something as their own deceive themselves. Now, since nothing excites our
indignation more than that others should impose upon us, it argues the height of
folly that we should willingly impose upon ourselves. This consideration will
render us much more candid to others. Whence proceeds fierce insult or haughty
sternness, but from this, that every one exalts himself in his own estimation,
and proudly despises others? Let arrogance be removed, and we shall all discover
the greatest modesty in our conduct towards each
other.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But let every man prove his own
work</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By a powerful blow, Paul has already
struck down the pride of man. But it frequently happens that, by comparing
ourselves with others, the low opinion which we form of them leads us to
entertain a high opinion of ourselves. Paul declares that no such comparison
ought to be allowed. Let no man, he says, measure himself by the standard of
another, or please himself with the thought, that others appear to him less
worthy of approbation. Let him lay aside all regard to other men, examine his
own conscience, and inquire what is <i>his own work</i>. It is not what we gain
by detracting from others, but what we have without any comparison, that can be
regarded as true praise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some consider Paul to be speaking in irony.
&#8220;Thou flatterest thyself by a comparison with the faults of others; but if
thou wilt consider who thou art, thou wilt then enjoy the praise which is justly
due to thee.&#8221; In other words, no praise whatever shall be thine; because
there is no man by whom the smallest portion of praise is really deserved. In
conformity with this view, the words that follow,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every man shall bear his own
burden</i></font><font face="Palatino">, are supposed to mean, that it is usual
for every man to bear his own burden. But the plain and direct sense of the
words agrees better with the apostle&#8217;s reasoning. &#8220;With respect to
thyself alone, and not by comparison with others, thou wilt have praise.&#8221;
I am well aware that the next sentence, which annihilates all the glory of man,
has been regarded as justifying the ironical interpretation. But the glorying of
which this passage treats, is that of a good conscience, in which the Lord
allows his people to indulge, and which Paul elsewhere expresses in very
animated language.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Paul earnestly beholding the
council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God
until this
day.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Acts
23:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is nothing more than an acknowledgment of Divine
grace, which reflects no praise whatever on man, but excites him to give God the
glory. Such a reason for glorying do the godly find in themselves; and they
ascribe it, not to their own merits, but to the riches of the grace of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;For our rejoicing is this, the
testimony of a good conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with
fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the
world.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">2
Corinthians 1:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our Lord himself instructs us:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;But thou, when thou prayest,
enter into thy closet; and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who

openly.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
6:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Strictly speaking, he makes no assertion, but leads
us to conclude, that, when a man is valued for his own worth, and not for the
baseness of others, the praise is just and substantial. The statement is
therefore conditional, and imports that none are entitled to be regarded as good
men, who are not found to be so, apart from the consideration of
others.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For every man shall bear his
own burdens</i></font><font face="Palatino">. To destroy sloth and pride, he
brings before us the judgment of God, in which every individual for himself, and
without a comparison with others, will give an account of his life. It is thus
that we are deceived; for, if a man who has but one eye is placed among the
blind, he considers his vision to be perfect; and a tawny person among negroes
thinks himself white. The apostle affirms that the false conclusions to which we
are thus conducted will find no place in the judgment of God; because there
every one will bear his own burden, and none will stand acquitted by others from
their own sins. This is the true meaning of the words.</font><br></div>

ministers of the word were at that time neglected. This shewed the basest
ingratitude. How disgraceful is it to defraud of their temporal support those by
whom our souls are fed! &#8212; to refuse an earthly recompense to those from
whom we receive heavenly benefits! But it is, and always has been, the
disposition of the world, freely to bestow on the ministers of Satan every
luxury, and hardly to supply godly pastors with necessary food. Though it does
not become us to indulge too much in complaint, or to be too tenacious of our
rights, yet Paul found himself called upon to exhort the Galatians to perform
this part of their duty. He was the more ready to do so, because he had no
private interest in the matter, but consulted the universal benefit of the
Church, without any regard to his own advantage. He saw that the ministers of
the word were neglected, because the word itself was despised; for if the word
be truly esteemed, its ministers will always receive kind and honorable
treatment. It is one of the tricks of Satan to defraud godly ministers of
support, that the Church may be deprived of such ministers.

should be set to their worldly enjoyments, or that they should revel in
superfluous abundance, but merely that none of the necessary supports of life
should be withheld. Ministers ought to be satisfied with moderate fare, and the
danger which attends pomp and luxury ought to be prevented. To supply their real
necessities, let believers cheerfully devote any part of their property that may
be required for the services of devout and holy teachers. What return will they
make for the invaluable treasure of eternal life, which is communicated to them
by the preaching of those men?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God is not

reply to the dishonest excuses which are frequently pleaded. One alleges that he
has a family to support, and another asserts that he has no superfluity of
wealth to spend in liberality or profusion. The consequence is, that, while such
multitudes withhold their aid, the few persons who do their duty are generally
unable to contribute the necessary support. These apologies Paul utterly
rejects, for a reason which the world little considers, that this transaction is
with God. The supply of a man&#8217;s bodily wants is not the sole question, but
involves the degree of our regard for Christ and his gospel. This passage
contains evidence that the custom of treating faithful ministers with scorn did
not originate in the present day; but their wicked taunts will not pass
unpunished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For whatsoever a man
soweth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Our liberality is restrained by the
supposition, that whatever passes into the hands of another is lost to
ourselves, and by the alarm we feel about our own prospects in life. Paul meets
these views by a comparison drawn from seed-time, which, he tells us, is a fit
representation of acts of beneficence. On this subject we had occasion to speak,
in expounding the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, where the same metaphor was
employed. Happy would it be for us, if this truth were deeply impressed upon our
minds. How &#8220;very gladly&#8221; would we &#8220;spend and be spent&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471215&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 12:15) for the good of our neighbours, encouraged by the hope of the
coming harvest! No operation is more cheerfully performed by husbandmen than
throwing the seed into the ground. They are enabled to wait with patience during
nine months of the year, by the expectation of reaping a corruptible harvest,
while our minds are not properly affected by the hope of a blessed
immortality.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>

of the present life, without any regard to a future life. They who do this will
gather fruit corresponding to the seed which they have sown, &#8212; will heap
up that which shall miserably perish. <i>To
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sow in the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">, (<i>seminare in carne</i>,) is supposed
by some to mean indulgence in the lusts of the flesh, and corruption to mean
destruction; but the former exposition agrees better with the context. In
departing from the old translation and from Erasmus, I have not acted rashly.
The Greek words, </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oJ spei&gt;rwn
eijv th&lt;n sa&gt;rka eJautou~</font><font face="Palatino">, literally signify,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he that soweth into his

so entirely devoted to the flesh, as to direct all our thoughts to its interests
or convenience?</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

which they are said to sow whose views are directed more to heaven than to
earth, and whose life is regulated by the desire of reaching the kingdom of God.
From their spiritual employments they will reap in heaven incorruptible fruit.
Those employments are denominated spiritual on account of their end, though in
some respects they are external and relate to the body, as in the very case now
under consideration of supporting pastors. If the Papists shall endeavor, in
their usual manner, to build upon these words the righteousness of works, we
have already shewn how easily their absurdities may be exposed. Though eternal
life is a reward, it does not follow either that we are justified by works, or
that works are meritorious of salvation. The undeserved kindness of God appears
in the very act of honoring the works which his grace has enabled us to perform,
by promising to them a reward to which they are not entitled.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Is a more complete solution of the question
demanded?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>1.</b></font><font face="Palatino">

Though a reward had been a thousand times promised to works, yet it is not due
but by fulfilling the condition of obeying the law perfectly; and how widely
distant are we all from that perfection!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let Papists now go and attempt to force their way
into heaven by the merit of works. We cheerfully concur with Paul and with the
whole Bible in acknowledging, that we are unable to do anything but by the free
grace of God, and yet that the benefits resulting from our works receive the
name of a
reward.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

Well-doing</i>
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kalo&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">)
does not simply mean doing our duty, but the performance of acts of kindness,
and has a reference to men. We are instructed
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not to be
weary</i></font><font face="Palatino"> in assisting our neighbours, in
performing good offices, and in exercising generosity. This precept is highly
necessary; for we are naturally reluctant to discharge the duties of brotherly
love, and many unpleasant occurrences arise by which the ardor of the best
disposed persons is apt to be cooled. We meet with many unworthy and many
ungrateful persons. The vast number of necessitous cases overwhelms us, and the
applications which crowd upon us from every quarter exhaust our patience. Our
warmth is abated by the coolness of other men. In short, the world presents
innumerable hinderances, which tend to lead us aside from the right path. Most
properly, therefore, does Paul admonish us not to relax through
weariness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If we faint
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That is, we shall reap the fruit which God
promises, if we &#8220;persevere to the end.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401022&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
10:22.) Those who do not persevere resemble indolent husbandmen, who, after
ploughing and sowing, leave the work unfinished, and neglect to take the
necessary precautions for protecting the seed from being devoured by birds, or
scorched by the sun, or destroyed by cold. It is to no purpose that we begin to
do good, if we do not press forward to the goal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In due

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa99</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let no
man, from a wish to gather the fruit in this life, or before its <i>proper
time</i>, deprive himself of the spiritual harvest. The desires of believers
must be both supported and restrained by the exercise of hope and
patience.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>While we have
opportunity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The metaphor is still pursued.
Every season is not adapted to tillage and sowing. Active and prudent husbandmen
will observe the proper season, and will not indolently allow it to pass
unimproved. Since, therefore, God has set apart the whole of the present life
for ploughing and sowing, let us avail ourselves of the season, lest, through
our negligence, it may be taken out of our power. Beginning with liberality to
ministers of the gospel, Paul now makes a wider application of his doctrine, and
exhorts us to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>do good to all
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but recommends to our particular regard
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the household of
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or believers, because they belong to the
same family with ourselves. This similitude is intended to excite us to that
kind of communication which ought to be maintained among the members of one
family. There are duties which we owe to all men arising out of a common nature;
but the tie of a more sacred relationship, established by God himself, binds us
to believers.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">i]dete</font><font face="Palatino">,
is so far doubtful that it may be taken either in the imperative or indicative
mood; but the force of the passage is little if at all affected. To convince the
Galatians more fully of his anxiety about them, and at the same time to ensure
their careful perusal, he mentions that this long Epistle had been written with
his own hand. The greater the toil to which he had submitted on their account,
the stronger were their inducements to read it, not in a superficial manner, but
with the closest attention.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As many as desire to make a fair
shew in the flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Such men pay no regard to
edification, but are guided by an ambitious desire to hunt after popular
applause. The Greek verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujproswph~sai</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa100</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is
highly expressive, and denotes the kind looks and address which were assumed for
the purpose of pleasing. He charges the false apostles with ambition. As if he
had said, &#8220;When those men lay circumcision upon you as a necessary burden,
do you wish to know what sort of persons they are, what are the objects of their
regard or pursuit? You are mistaken if you imagine that they are at all
influenced by godly zeal. To gain or preserve the favor of men is the object
they have in view in offering this bribe.&#8221; It was because they were Jews
that they adopted this method of retaining the good-will, or at least allaying
the resentment, of their own nation. It is the usual practice of ambitious men
meanly to fawn on those from whose favor they hope to derive advantage, and to
insinuate themselves into their good graces, that, when better men have been
displaced, they may enjoy the undivided power. This wicked design he lays open
to the Galatians, in order to put them on their guard.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Only lest they should suffer
persecution</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The pure preaching of the gospel
is again designated the cross of Christ. But there is likewise an allusion to
their favourite scheme of resolving to preach Christ without the cross. The
deadly rage by which the Jews were animated against Paul, arose from their being
unable to endure a neglect of ceremonies. To avoid persecution, those men
flattered the Jews. Yet after all, if they had themselves kept the law, their
conduct might have been suffered. On the contrary, they disturbed the whole
church for the sake of their personal ease, and scrupled not to lay a tyrannical
yoke on the consciences of men, that they might be entirely freed from bodily
uneasiness. A dread of the cross led them to corrupt the true preaching of the
cross.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For neither they who hold by
circumcision keep the law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The old version and
Erasmus translate thus: <i>who are circumcised</i>. But Paul appears to me to
refer to teachers only; and for this reason I would prefer to render the words,
<i>those who hold by circumcision,</i> which would not include all circumcised
persons, and thus would avoid ambiguity. The meaning is, &#8220;It is not from a
strong attachment to the law that they bind you with the yoke of ceremonies;
for, even with their own circumcision, they do not keep the law. It is no doubt
under the pretext of the law that they require you to be circumcised; but,
though they have themselves been circumcised, they do not perform what they
enjoin upon others.&#8221; When he says, indeed, that they do not <i>keep the
law</i>, it is doubtful whether he refers to the whole law, or to ceremonies.
Some understand him as saying that the law is an intolerable burden, and
therefore they do not satisfy its demands. But he rather insinuates against them
a charge of insincerity, because, except when it suited their own designs, they
found themselves at liberty to despise the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Even now this disease rages everywhere with
virulence. You will find many who are prompted more by ambition than by
conscience to defend the tyranny of the papal system. I speak of our courtly
apostles, who are attracted by the smell of a kitchen, and who pronounce, with
an air of authority, that the decrees of the holy Church of Rome must be
observed with reverence. And what is their own practice all the while! They pay
no more regard to any decisions of the Roman see than to the braying of an ass,
but they take care to avoid personal risk. In short, Paul had the same kind of
controversy with those impostors as we now have with hypocritical professors of
the gospel, who hold out to us a monstrous union between Christ and the Pope.
Paul therefore declares that they are not acting the part of honest men, and
that they have no other object in enjoining circumcision than to boast to the
Jews of the converts they have made. Such is the import of the
words,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that they may glory in
your flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. &#8220;They wish to triumph over
you, and to gratify their own desire of applause, by offering up your mutilated
flesh to the false zealots of the law, as a token of peace and
harmony.&#8221;</font><br></div>

salvation is held out to us in the cross of Christ, what does he think of his

the resurrection of Christ does not lead us away from the cross. And let it be

unquestionably contrasted with the <i>new creature</i>. Whatever is opposed to
the spiritual kingdom of Christ is the world, because it belongs to the old man;
or, in a word, <i>the world</i> is the object and aim of the old
man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The world is crucified to
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This exactly agrees with the language which
he employs on another occasion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;But what things were gain to me,
those I counted loss for Christ; yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord; for whom I have
suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win
Christ&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500307&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Philippians
3:7, 8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To crucify the world is to treat it with contempt and
disdain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and I unto the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this he means that he regarded
himself as unworthy to be taken into the account, and indeed as utterly
annihilated; because this was a matter with which a dead man had nothing to do.
At all events, he means, that by the mortification of the old man he had
renounced the world. Some take his meaning to be, &#8220;If the world looks upon
me as abhorred and excommunicated, I consider the world to be condemned and
accursed.&#8221; This appears to me to be overstrained, but I leave my readers
to judge.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For in Christ
Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The reason why he is crucified to the
world, and the world to him, is, that in Christ, to whom he is spiritually
united, nothing but a new creature is of any avail. Everything else must be
dismissed, must perish. I refer to those things which hinder the renewing of the
Spirit. &#8220;If any man be in Christ&#8221; says he, &#8220;let him be a new
creature.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:17.) That is, if any man wishes to be considered as belonging to
the kingdom of Christ, let him be created anew by the Spirit of God; let him not
live any longer to himself or to the world, but let him be raised up to
&#8220;newness of life.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:4.) His reasons for concluding that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is
of any importance, have been already considered. The truth of the gospel
swallows up, and brings to nought, all the shadows of the
law.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And as many as walk according to
this rule</i></font><font face="Palatino">. &#8220;May they enjoy all prosperity
and happiness!&#8221; This is not merely a prayer in their behalf, but a token
of approbation. His meaning therefore is, that those who teach this doctrine are
worthy of all esteem and regard, and those who reject it do not deserve to be
heard. The word <i>rule</i> denotes the regular and habitual course which all
godly ministers of the gospel ought to pursue. Architects employ a model in the
erection of buildings, to assist them in preserving the proper form and just
proportions. Such a <i>model
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kano&gt;na</font><font face="Palatino">)
does the apostle prescribe to the ministers of the word, who are to build the
church &#8220;according to the pattern shewn to them.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580805&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews

<div><font face="Palatino">Faithful and upright teachers, and all who allow
themselves to conform to this rule, must derive singular encouragement from this
passage, in which God, by the mouth of Paul, pronounces on them a blessing. We
have no cause to dread the thunders of the Pope, if God promises to us from
heaven <i>peace</i> and <i>mercy</i>. The word <i>walk</i> may apply both to a
minister and to his people, though it refers chiefly to ministers. The future
tense of the verb, (</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">o[soi
stoich&gt;sousin</font><font face="Palatino">,) as many as <i>shall walk</i>, is
intended to express perseverance.</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fa101</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
is an indirect ridicule of the vain boasting of the false apostles, who vaunted
of being the descendants of Abraham according to the flesh. There are two
classes who bear this name, a pretended Israel, which appears to be so in the
sight of men, &#8212; and the Israel of God. Circumcision was a disguise before
men, but regeneration is a truth before God. In a word, he gives the appellation
of the <i>Israel of God</i> to those whom he formerly denominated the children
of Abraham by faith,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480329&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:29,) and thus includes all believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, who were
united into one church. On the contrary, the name and lineage are the sole boast
of Israel according to the flesh; and this led the apostle to argue in the
Epistle to the Romans, that &#8220;they are not all Israel which are of Israel,
neither because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children.&#8221;

Imprisonment, chains, scourging, blows, stoning, and every kind of injurious
treatment which he had incurred in bearing testimony to the gospel. Earthly
warfare has its honors, in conferring which a general holds out to public view
the bravery of a soldier. So Christ our leader has his own marks, of which he
makes abundant use, for conferring on some of his followers a high distinction.
These marks, however, differ from the other in one important respect, that they
partake of the nature of the cross, and in the sight of the world are
disgraceful. This is suggested by the word translated <i>marks</i>,

for it literally denotes the <i>marks</i> with which barbarian slaves, or
fugitives, or malefactors, were usually branded. Paul, therefore, can hardly be
said to use a figure, when he boasts of shining in those marks with which Christ
is accustomed to honor his most distinguished soldiers,

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>END OF THE COMMENTARIES ON
THE</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>EPISTLE TO THE
GALATIANS.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE ARGUMENT</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Ephesus, which is familiarly known in history under a
great variety of names,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> was a
very celebrated city of Lesser Asia. The remarkable events connected with the
work of God in &#8220;forming there a people for himself,&#8221; (Isaiah 43:21,)
through the labors of Paul, together with the commencement and progress of that
church, are related by Luke in the Acts of the Apostles. At present, I shall do
nothing more than glance at what bears directly on the argument of the Epistle.
The Ephesians had been instructed by Paul in the pure doctrine of the gospel. At
a later period, while he was a prisoner at Rome, and perceiving that they needed
confirmation, he wrote to them, on that account, the present
Epistle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The first three chapters are chiefly occupied with
commending the grace of God. Immediately after the salutation in the
commencement of the first chapter, he treats of God&#8217;s free election. This
affords him an opportunity of stating that they were now called into the kingdom
of God, because they had been appointed to life before they were born. And here
occurs a striking display of God&#8217;s wonderful mercy, when the salvation of
men is traced to its true and native source, the free act of adoption. But as
the minds of men are ill fitted to receive so sublime a mystery, he betakes
himself to prayer, that God would enlighten the Ephesians in the full knowledge
of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the second chapter, by drawing two comparisons, he
places in a strong light the riches of divine grace. <b>1.</b> He reminds them
how wretched they were before they were called to Christ. We never become duly
sensible of our obligations to Christ, nor estimate aright his kindness towards
us, till we have been led to view, on the other side, the unhappy condition in
which we formerly were &#8220;without Christ.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:12.) <b>2.</b> The Gentiles were &#8220;aliens&#8221; from the promises of
eternal life, which God had been pleased to bestow on the Jews
alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the third chapter, he declares that he had been
appointed to be, in a peculiar manner, the Apostle of the Gentiles, because, for
a long period, they were &#8220;strangers and foreigners,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:19,) but are now included among the people of God. As this was an unusual
event, and as its very novelty produced uneasiness in many minds, he calls it
a</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">mystery
which in other ages was not made
known</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">to the sons of
men,</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
3:4,5,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but &#8220;the dispensation&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:2) of which had been intrusted to himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Towards the close of the chapter, he again prays that
God would grant to the Ephesians such an intimate knowledge of Christ, that they
would have no desire to know anything else. His object in doing so is not merely
to lead them to gratitude to God for so many favors, and to the expression of
that gratitude by entire devotion to his service, but still more to remove all
doubt about his own calling. Paul was probably afraid that the false apostles
would shake their faith by insinuating that they had been only half-instructed.
They had been Gentiles, and, when they embraced pure Christianity, had been told
nothing about ceremonies or circumcision. But all who enjoined on Christians the
observance of the law were loud in the avowal, that those who have not been
introduced into the church of God by circumcision must be held as profane
persons. This was their ordinary song, that no man who is not circumcised is
entitled to be reckoned among the people of God, and that all the rites
prescribed by Moses ought to be observed. Accordingly, they brought it as a
charge against Paul, that he exhibited Christ as equally the Savior of Gentiles
and of Jews. They asserted that his apostleship was a profanation of the
heavenly doctrine, because it threw open to wicked men, without discrimination,
a share in the covenant of grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That the Ephesians, when assailed by these calumnies,
might not give way, he resolved to meet them. While he argues so earnestly that
they were called to the gospel because they had been chosen before the creation
of the world, he charges them, on the other hand, not to imagine that the gospel
had been accidentally brought to them by the will of men, or that it flew to
them by chance;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for the
preaching of Christ among them was nothing else than the announcement of that
eternal decree. While he lays before them the unhappy condition of their former
life, he at the same time reminds them that the singular and astonishing mercy
of God appeared in rescuing them from so deep a gulf. While he sets before their
eyes his own commission as the apostle of the Gentiles, he confirms them in the
faith which they had once received, because they had been divinely admitted into
the communion of the church. And yet each of the sentences to which we have now
referred must be viewed as an exhortation fitted to excite the Ephesians to
gratitude.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the fourth chapter, he describes the manner in
which the Lord governs and protects his church, which is, by the gospel preached
by men. Hence it follows, that in no other way can its integrity be preserved,
and that the object at which it aims is true perfection. The apostle&#8217;s
design is, to commend to the Ephesians the ministry by which God reigns amongst
us. He afterwards details the fruits of this preaching, &#8212; a holy life and
all the duties of piety. Nor does he satisfy himself with describing in general
terms how Christians ought to live, but lays down particular exhortations
adapted to the various relations of society.</font><br></div>

least very little varied, is found in all the Epistles, it would be superfluous
to repeat here the observations which we have formerly made. He calls himself
&#8220;an apostle of Jesus Christ;&#8221; for all to whom has been given the
ministry of reconciliation are his ambassadors. The word Apostle, indeed,
carries something more; for it is not every minister of the gospel, as we shall
afterwards see,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:11,) that can be called an apostle. But this subject has been explained more
fully in my remarks on the Epistle to the Galatians. (See Calvin on
&#8220;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians

5:4,) but every man ought to wait for the calling of God, which alone makes
lawful ministers. He thus meets the jeers of wicked men by holding out the
authority of God, and removes every occasion of inconsiderate
strife.</font><br></div>

not also a saint; and, on the other hand, no man is a saint who is not a

The lofty terms in which he extolls the grace of God toward the Ephesians, are
intended to rouse their hearts to gratitude, to set them all on flame, to fill
them even to overflowing with this thought. They who perceive in themselves
discoveries of the Divine goodness, so full and absolutely perfect, and who make
them the subject of earnest meditation, will never embrace new doctrines, by
which the very grace which they feel so powerfully in themselves is thrown into
the shade. The design of the apostle, therefore, in asserting the riches of
divine grace toward the Ephesians, was to protect them against having their
faith shaken by the false apostles, as if their calling were doubtful, or
salvation were to be sought in some other way. He shews, at the same time, that
the full certainty of future happiness rests on the revelation of his love to us
in Christ, which God makes in the gospel. But to confirm the matter more fully,
he rises to the first cause, to the fountain, &#8212; the eternal election of
God, by which, ere we are born,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:11,) we are adopted as sons. This makes it evident that their salvation was
accomplished, not by any accidental or unlooked-for occurrence, but by the
eternal and unchangeable decree of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bless</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is here used in more than one sense, as referring to God, and as referring to
men. I find in Scripture four different significations of this word.<b> 1.</b>
We are said to bless God when we offer praise to him for his goodness.<b> 2.</b>
God is said to bless us, when he crowns our undertakings with success, and, in
the exercise of his goodness, bestows upon us happiness and prosperity; and the
reason is, that our enjoyments depend entirely upon his pleasure. Our attention
is here called to the singular efficacy which dwells in the very word of God,
and which Paul expresses in beautiful language.<b> 3.</b> Men bless each other
by prayer.<b> 4.</b> The priest&#8217;s blessing is not simply a prayer, but is
likewise a testimony and pledge of the Divine blessing; for the priests received
a commission to bless in the name of the Lord. Paul therefore blesses God,
because </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he hath blessed
us,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, hath enriched us with all blessing
and grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With all spiritual
blessings.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I have no objection to
Chrysostom&#8217;s remark, that the word
<i>spiritual</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">conveys an implied contrast between the blessing of
Moses and of Christ. The law had its blessings; but in Christ only is perfection
found, because he gives us a perfect revelation of the kingdom of God, which
leads us directly to heaven. When the body itself is presented to us, figures
are no longer needed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
heavenly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Whether we understand the meaning to
be, in heavenly Places, or in heavenly Benefits, is of little consequence. All
that was intended to be expressed is the superiority of that grace which we
receive through Christ. The happiness which it bestows is not in this world, but
in heaven and everlasting life. In the Christian religion, indeed, as we are
elsewhere taught,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540408&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:8,) is contained the &#8220;promise of the life that now is, and of
that which is to come;&#8221; but its aim is spiritual happiness, for the
kingdom of Christ is spiritual. A contrast is drawn between Christ and all the
Jewish emblems, by which the blessing under the law was conveyed; for where
Christ is, all those things are
superfluous.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According as he hath chosen
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The foundation and first cause, both of our
calling and of all the benefits which we receive from God, is here declared to
be his eternal election. If the reason is asked, why God has called us to enjoy
the gospel, why he daily bestows upon us so many blessings, why he opens to us
the gate of heaven, &#8212; the answer will be constantly found in this
principle, that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he hath chosen us
before the foundation of the world.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The very
time when the election took place proves it to be free; for what could we have
deserved, or what merit did we possess, before the world was made? How childish
is the attempt to meet this argument by the following sophism! &#8220;We were
chosen because we were worthy, and because God foresaw that we would be
worthy.&#8221; We were all lost in Adam; and therefore, had not God, through his
own election, rescued us from perishing, there was nothing to be foreseen. The
same argument is used in the Epistle to the Romans, where, speaking of Jacob and
Esau, he says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">For
the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the
purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that
calleth.</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450911&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
9:11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But though they had not yet acted, might a sophist of
the <i>Sorbonne</i> reply, God foresaw that they would act. This objection has
no force when applied to the depraved natures of men, in whom nothing can be
seen but materials for destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the second proof that the
election is free; for if we are chosen <i>in</i> Christ, it is <i>not of</i>
ourselves. It is not from a perception of anything that we deserve, but because
our heavenly Father has introduced us, through the privilege of adoption, into
the body of Christ. In short, the name of Christ excludes all merit, and
everything which men have of their own; for when he says that we
are</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> chosen in
Christ,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> it follows that in ourselves we are
unworthy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That we should be
holy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the immediate, but not the chief
design; for there is no absurdity in supposing that the same thing may gain two
objects. The design of building is, that there should be a house. This is the
immediate design, but the convenience of dwelling in it is the ultimate design.
It was necessary to mention this in passing; for we shall immediately find that
Paul mentions another design, the glory of God. But there is no contradiction
here; for the glory of God is the highest end, to which our sanctification is
subordinate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This leads us to conclude, that holiness, purity, and
every excellence that is found among men, are the fruit of election; so that
once more Paul expressly puts aside every consideration of merit. If God had
foreseen in us anything worthy of election, it would have been stated in
language the very opposite of what is here employed, and which plainly means
that all our holiness and purity of life flow from the election of God. How
comes it then that some men are religious, and live in the fear of God, while
others give themselves up without reserve to all manner of wickedness? If Paul
may be believed, the only reason is, that the latter retain their natural
disposition, and the former have been chosen to holiness. The cause, certainly,
is not later than the effect. Election, therefore, does not depend on the
righteousness of works, of which Paul here declares that it is the
cause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We learn also from these words, that election gives
no occasion to licentiousness, or to the blasphemy of wicked men who say,
&#8220;Let us live in any manner we please; for, if we have been elected, we
cannot perish.&#8221; Paul tells them plainly, that they have no right to
separate holiness of life from the grace of election; for</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">whom
he did predestinate, them he also called, and whom he called, them he also
justified.</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450830&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
8:30.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The inference, too, which the Catharists, Celestines,
and Donatists drew from these words, that we may attain perfection in this life,
is without foundation. This is the goal to which the whole course of our life
must be directed, and we shall not reach it till we have finished our course.
Where are the men who dread and avoid the doctrine of predestination as an
inextricable labyrinth, who believe it to be useless and almost dangerous? No
doctrine is more useful, provided it be handled in the proper and cautious
manner, of which Paul gives us an example, when he presents it as an
illustration of the infinite goodness of God, and employs it as an excitement to
gratitude. This is the true fountain from which we must draw our knowledge of
the divine mercy. If men should evade every other argument, election shuts their
mouth, so that they dare not and cannot claim anything for themselves. But let
us remember the purpose for which Paul reasons about predestination, lest, by
reasoning with any other view, we fall into dangerous errors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before him it
love.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Holiness <i>before God</i>
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">katenw&gt;pion
aujtou~</font><font face="Palatino">) is that of a pure conscience; for God is
not deceived, as men are, by outward pretense, but looks to faith, or, which
means the same thing, the truth of the heart. If we view the word <i>love</i> as
applied to God, the meaning will be, that the only reason why he chose us, was
his love to men. But I prefer connecting it with the latter part of the verse,
as denoting that the perfection of believers consists in love; not that God
requires love alone, but that it is an evidence of the fear of God, and of
obedience to the whole law.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath predestinated
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What follows is intended still further to
heighten the commendation of divine grace. The reason why Paul inculcated so
earnestly on the Ephesians the doctrines of free adoption through Christ, and of
the eternal election which preceded it, has been already considered. But as the
mercy of God is nowhere acknowledged in more elevated language, this passage
will deserve our careful attention. Three causes of our salvation are here
mentioned, and a fourth is shortly afterwards added. The efficient cause is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the good pleasure of the
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of God, the material cause is,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus
Christ,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and the final cause
is,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the praise of the glory of
his grace.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Let us now see what he says
respecting each.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the first belongs the whole of the following
statement <i>God hath predestinated us in himself, according to the good
pleasure of his will, unto the adoption of sons, and hath made us accepted by
his grace.</i> In the word</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>predestinate</i> we must again attend to the
order. We were not then in existence, and therefore there was no merit of ours.
The cause of our salvation did not proceed from us, but from God alone. Yet
Paul, not satisfied with these statements, adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Greek phrase is,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv
auJto&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">, and has the same meaning with
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn
auJtw|~</font><font face="Palatino">. By this he means that God did not seek a
cause out of himself, but predestinated us, because such was his
will.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this is made still more clear by what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the good pleasure of
his will.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word
<i>will</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">was enough, for Paul very frequently contrasts it
with all outward causes by which men are apt to imagine that the mind of God is
influenced. But that no doubt may remain, he employs the word <i>good
pleasure,</i> which expressly sets aside all merit. In adopting us, therefore,
God does not inquire what we are, and is not reconciled to us by any personal
worth. His single motive is the eternal good pleasure, by which he predestinated
us.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Why,
then, are the sophists not ashamed to mingle with them other considerations,
when Paul so strongly forbids us to look at anything else than the good pleasure
of God?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lest anything should still be wanting, he adds,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejcari&gt;twsen ejn
ca&gt;riti</font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
intimates, that, in the freest manner, and on no mercenary grounds, does God
bestow upon us his love and favor, just as, when we were not yet born, and when
he was prompted by nothing but his own will, he fixed upon us his choice.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb6</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The material cause both of eternal election, and of
the love which is now revealed, is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ, the
Beloved.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This name is given, to remind us that
by him the love of God is communicated to us. Thus he is the well-beloved, in
order that we may be reconciled by him. The highest and last end is immediately
added, the glorious praise of such abundant grace. Every man, therefore, who
hides this glory, is endeavoring to overturn the everlasting purpose of God.
Such is the doctrine of the sophists, which entirely overturns the doctrine of
Christ, lest the whole glory of our salvation should be ascribed undividedly to
God alone.</font><br></div>

<div><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In whom we have
redemption.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The apostle is still illustrating
the material cause, &#8212; the manner in which we are reconciled to God through
Christ. By his death he has restored us to favor with the Father; and therefore
we ought always to direct our minds to the blood of Christ, as the means by
which we obtain divine grace. After mentioning that, through the blood of
Christ, we obtain redemption, he immediately styles it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the forgiveness of
sins,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; to intimate that we are redeemed,
because our sins are not imputed to us. Hence it follows, that we obtain by free
grace that righteousness by which we are accepted of God, and freed from the
chains of the devil and of death. The close connection which is here preserved,
between our redemption itself and the manner in which it is obtained, deserves
our notice; for, so long as we remain exposed to the judgment of God, we are
bound by miserable chains, and therefore our exemption from guilt, becomes an
invaluable freedom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the riches of his
grace.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now returns to the efficient cause,
&#8212; the largeness of the divine kindness, which has given Christ to us as
our Redeemer.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Riches,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and the corresponding word <i>overflow,</i> in the following verse, are intended
to give us large views of divine grace. The apostle feels himself unable to
celebrate, in a proper manner, the goodness of God, and desires that the
contemplation of it would occupy the minds of men till they are entirely lost in
admiration. How desirable is it that men were deeply impressed with &#8220;the
riches of that grace&#8221; which is here commended! No place would any longer
be found for pretended satisfactions, or for those trifles by which the world
vainly imagines that it can redeem itself; as if the blood of Christ, when
unsupported by additional aid, had lost all its
efficacy.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb7</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In all
wisdom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now comes to the formal cause, the
preaching of the gospel, by which the goodness of God <i>overflows upon us.</i>
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It is
through faith that we receive Christ, by whom we come to God, and by whom we
enjoy the privilege of adoption. Paul gives to the gospel the magnificent
appellations of </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wisdom and
prudence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> for the purpose of leading the
Ephesians to despise all contrary doctrines. The false apostles insinuated
themselves, under the pretense of imparting views more elevated than the
elementary instructions which Paul conveyed. And the devil, in order to
undermine our faith, labors, as far as he can, to disparage the gospel. Paul, on
the other hand, builds up the authority of the gospel, that believers may rest
upon it with unshaken confidence.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All
wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"> means &#8212; full or perfect
wisdom.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having made known to us the
mystery of his will.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some were alarmed at the
novelty of his doctrine. With a view to such persons, he very properly
denominates it a <i>mystery of the divine will,</i> and yet a mystery which God
has now been pleased to reveal. As he formerly ascribed their election, so he
now ascribes their calling, to the good pleasure of God. The Ephesians are thus
led to consider that Christ has been made known, and the gospel preached to
them, not because they deserved any such thing, but because it pleased
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which he hath purposed in
himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> All is wisely and properly arranged.
What can be more just than that his purposes, with which men are unacquainted,
should be known to God alone, so long as he is pleased to conceal them, &#8212;
or, again, that it should be in his own will and power to fix the time when they
shall be communicated to men? The decree to adopt the Gentiles is declared to
have been till now hidden in the mind of God, but so hidden, that God reserved
it in his own power until the time of the revelation. Does any one now complain
of it as a new and unprecedented occurrence, that those who were formerly
&#8220;without God in the world,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:12,) should be received into the church? Will he have the hardihood to deny
that the knowledge of God is greater than that of
men?</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That in the dispensation of the
fullness of times.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That no man may inquire, why
one time rather than another was selected, the apostle anticipates such
curiosity, by calling the appointed period <i>the fullness of times,</i> the fit
and proper season, as he also did in a former epistle.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:4) Let human presumption restrain itself, and, in judging of the succession of
events, let it bow to the providence of God. The same lesson is taught by the
word <i>dispensation,</i> for by the judgment of God the lawful administration
of all events is regulated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he might gather together in
one.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In the old translation it is rendered
<i>(instaurare) restore;</i> to which Erasmus has added <i>(summatim)
comprehensively.</i> I have chosen to abide closely by the meaning of the Greek
word,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnakefalaiw&gt;sasqai</font><font face="Bwgrkl">,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because
it is more agreeable to the context. The meaning appears to me to be, that out
of Christ all things were disordered, and that through him they have been
restored to order. And truly, out of Christ, what can we perceive in the world
but mere ruins? We are alienated from God by sin, and how can we but present a
broken and shattered aspect? The proper condition of creatures is to keep close
to God. Such a <i>gathering together</i>
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnakefalai&gt;wsiv</font><font face="Palatino">)
as might bring us back to regular order, the apostle tells us, has been made in
Christ. Formed into one body, we are united to God, and closely connected with
each other. Without Christ, on the other hand, the whole world is a shapeless
chaos and frightful confusion. We are brought into actual unity by Christ
alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why are heavenly beings included in the number?
The angels were never separated from God, and cannot be said to have been
scattered. Some explain it in this manner. Angels are said to be <i>gathered
together,</i> because men have become members of the same society, are admitted
equally with them to fellowship with God, and enjoy happiness in common with
them by means of this blessed unity. The mode of expression is supposed to
resemble one frequently used, when we speak of a whole building as repaired,
many parts of which were ruinous or decayed, though some parts remained
entire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is no doubt true; but what hinders us from
saying that the angels also have been <i>gathered together?</i> Not that they
were ever scattered, but their attachment to the service of God is now perfect,
and their state is eternal. What comparison is there between a creature and the
Creator, without the interposition of a Mediator? So far as they are creatures,
had it not been for the benefit which they derived from Christ, they would have
been liable to change and to sin, and consequently their happiness would not
have been eternal. Who then will deny that both angels and men have been brought
back to a fixed order by the grace of Christ? Men had been lost, and angels were
not beyond the reach of danger. By <i>gathering</i> both into his own body,
Christ hath united them to God the Father, and established actual harmony
between heaven and earth.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Through whom also we have
obtained an inheritance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Hitherto he has spoken
generally of all the elect; he now begins to take notice of separate classes.
When he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>WE have
obtained,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he speaks of himself and of the Jews,
or, perhaps more correctly, of all who were the first fruits of Christianity;
and afterwards he comes to the Ephesians. It tended not a little to confirm the
faith of the Ephesian converts, that he associated them with himself and the
other believers, who might be said to be the first-born in the church. As if he
had said, &#8220;The condition of all godly persons is the same with yours; for
we who were first called by God owe our acceptance to his eternal
election.&#8221; Thus, he shews, that, from first to last, all have obtained
salvation by free grace, because they have been freely adopted according to
eternal election.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who worketh all
things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The circumlocution employed in
describing the Supreme Being deserves attention. He speaks of Him as the sole
agent, and as doing everything according to His own will, so as to leave nothing
to be done by man. In no respect, therefore, are men admitted to share in this
praise, as if they brought anything of their own. God looks at nothing out of
himself to move him to elect them,
for</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the counsel of his own
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is the only and actual cause of their
election. This may enable us to refute the error, or rather the madness, of
those who, whenever they are unable to discover the reason of God&#8217;s works,
exclaim loudly against his design.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That we should be to the praise
of his glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here again he mentions the
<i>final</i> cause of salvation; for we must eventually become illustrations of
the glory of God, if we are nothing but vessels of his mercy. The word
<i>glory,</i> by way of eminence,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kat j
ejxoch&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">) denotes, in a peculiar manner, that
which shines in the goodness of God; for there is nothing that is more
peculiarly his own, or in which he desires more to be glorified, than
goodness.</font><br></div>

also.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He associates the Ephesians with himself,
and with the rest of those who were the first fruits; for he says that they, in
like manner, trusted in Christ. His object is, to shew that both had the same
faith; and therefore we must supply the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trusted</i></font><font face="Palatino">
from the twelfth verse. He afterwards states that they were brought to that hope
by the preaching of the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Two epithets are here applied to the gospel, &#8212;

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the gospel of your
salvation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Both deserve our careful attention.
Nothing is more earnestly attempted by Satan than to lead us either to doubt or
to despise the gospel. Paul therefore furnishes us with two shields, by which we
may repel both temptations. In opposition to every doubt, let us learn to bring
forward this testimony, that the gospel is not only certain truth, which cannot
deceive, but is, by way of eminence,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kat j

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word of truth,</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">as if, strictly speaking, there were no truth but
itself. If the temptation be to contempt or dislike of the gospel, let us
remember that its power and efficacy have been manifested in bringing to us
salvation. The apostle had formerly declared that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">it
is the power of God to salvation to every one that
believeth,</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">

<div><font face="Palatino">but here he expresses more, for he reminds the
Ephesians that, having been made partakers of salvation, they had learned this
by their own experience. Unhappy they who weary themselves, as the world
generally does, in wandering through many winding paths, neglecting the gospel,
and pleasing themselves with wild romances, &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">or to find life! But happy they who have embraced the
gospel, and whose attachment to it is steadfast; for this, beyond all doubt, is
truth and life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In whom also, after that ye
believed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Having maintained that the gospel is
certain, he now comes to the proof. And what higher surety can be found than the
Holy Spirit? &#8220;Having denominated the gospel <i>the word of truth,</i> I
will not prove it by the authority of men; for you have the testimony of the
Spirit of God himself, who seals the truth of it in your hearts.&#8221; This
elegant comparison is taken from Seals, which among men have the effect of
removing doubt. Seals give validity both to charters and to testaments;
anciently, they were the principal means by which the writer of a letter could
be known; and, in short, a seal distinguishes what is true and certain, from
what is false and spurious. This office the apostle ascribes to the Holy Spirit,
not only here, but in another part of this Epistle,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490430&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:30,) and in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 1:22.) Our minds never become so firmly established in the truth of
God as to resist all the temptations of Satan, until we have been confirmed in
it by the Holy Spirit. The true conviction which believers have of the word of
God, of their own salvation, and of religion in general, does not spring from
the judgment of the flesh, or from human and philosophical arguments, but from
the sealing of the Spirit, who imparts to their consciences such certainty as to
remove all doubt. The foundation of faith would be frail and unsteady, if it
rested on human wisdom; and therefore, as preaching is the instrument of faith,
so the Holy Spirit makes preaching efficacious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But is it not the faith itself which is here said to
be sealed by the Holy Spirit? If so, faith goes before the sealing. I answer,
there are two operations of the Spirit in faith, corresponding to the two parts
of which faith consists, as it enlightens, and as it establishes the mind. The
commencement of faith is knowledge: the completion of it is a firm and steady
conviction, which admits of no opposing doubt. Both, I have said, are the work
of the Spirit. No wonder, then, if Paul should declare that the Ephesians, who
received by faith the truth of the gospel, were confirmed in that faith by the
seal of the Holy Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With that Holy Spirit of
promise.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This title is derived from the effect
produced; for to him we owe it that the promise of salvation is not made to us
in vain. As God promises in his word, &#8220;that he will be to us a
Father,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470618&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 6:18,) so he gives to us the evidence of having adopted us by the
Holy Spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which is the
earnest</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb10</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of our
inheritance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This phrase is twice used by Paul
in another Epistle.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 1:22; 5:5.) The metaphor is taken from bargains, in which, when a
pledge has been given and accepted, the whole is confirmed, and no room is left
for a change of mind. Thus, when we have received the Spirit of God, his
promises are confirmed to us, and no dread is felt that they will be revoked. In
themselves, indeed, the promises of God are not weak; but, until we are
supported by the testimony of the Spirit, we never rest upon them with unshaken
confidence. The Spirit, then, is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the earnest of our
inheritance</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of eternal life,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>until the
redemption,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, until the day of complete
redemption is arrived. So long as we are in this world, our warfare is sustained
by hope, and therefore this earnest is necessary; but when the possession itself
shall have been obtained, the necessity and use of the earnest will then
cease.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The significance of a pledge lasts no longer than
till both parties have fulfilled the bargain; and, accordingly, he afterwards
adds, <i>ye are</i> <i>sealed to the day of redemption,</i>
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490430&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:30,) which means the day of judgment. Though we are now redeemed by the blood
of Christ, the fruit of that redemption does not yet appear; for &#8220;every
creature groaneth, desiring to be delivered from the bondage of corruption. And
not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even
we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, <i>the
redemption</i> of our body;&#8221; for we have not yet obtained it, but by hope.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450821&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:21-23.) But we shall obtain it in reality, when Christ shall appear to
judgment. Such is the meaning of the word <i>redemption</i> in the passage now
quoted from the Epistle to the Romans, and in a saying of our
Lord,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Look
up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth
nigh.</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;422128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
21:28.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Peripoi&gt;hsiv</font><font face="Palatino">,
which we translate <i>the possession obtained,</i> is not the kingdom of heaven,
or a blessed immortality, but the Church itself. This is added for their
consolation, that they might not think it hard to cherish their hope till the
day of Christ&#8217;s coming, or be displeased that they have not yet obtained
the promised inheritance; for such is the common lot of the whole
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the praise of his
glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word <i>praise,</i> as in the
twelfth verse,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490112&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:12 signifies &#8220;making known.&#8221;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
glory of God may sometimes be concealed, or imperfectly exhibited. But in the
Ephesians God had given proofs of his goodness, that his glory might be
celebrated and openly proclaimed. Those persons, therefore, who slighted the
calling of the Ephesians, might be charged with envying and slighting the glory
of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The frequent mention of the glory of God ought not to
be regarded as superfluous, for what is infinite cannot be too strongly
expressed. This is particularly true in commendations of the Divine mercy, for
which every godly person will always feel himself unable to find adequate
language. He will be more ready to utter, than other men will be to hear, the
expression of praise; for the eloquence both of men and angels, after being
strained to the utmost, falls immeasurably below the vastness of this subject.
We may likewise observe, that there is not a more effectual method of shutting
the mouths of wicked men, than by shewing that our views tend to illustrate, and
theirs to obscure, the glory of God.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore I
also.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This thanksgiving was not simply an
expression of his ardent love to the Ephesians. He congratulated them before
God, that the opinion which he had formed respecting them was highly favorable.
Observe here, that under <i>faith and love</i> Paul includes generally the whole
excellence of Christian character. He uses the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith in the Lord
Jesus,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb12</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

ought to embrace all men, but here the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saints</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">are particularly mentioned; because love, when
properly regulated, begins with them, and is afterwards extended to all others.
If our love must have a view to God, the nearer any man approaches to God, the
stronger unquestionably must be his claims to our
love.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Making mention of
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To thanksgiving, as his custom is, he adds
prayer, in order to excite them to additional progress. It was necessary that
the Ephesians should understand that they had entered upon the proper course.
But it was equally necessary that they should not turn aside to any new scheme
of doctrine, or become indifferent about proceeding farther; for nothing is more
dangerous than to be satisfied with that measure of spiritual benefits which has
been already obtained. Whatever, then, may be the height of our attainments, let
them be always accompanied by the desire of something
higher.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>

these? Yes; but at the same time they needed increase, that, being endowed with
a larger measure of the Spirit, and being more and more enlightened, they might
more clearly and fully hold their present views. The knowledge of the godly is
never so pure, but that some dimness or obscurity hangs over their spiritual
vision. But let us examine the words in detail.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The God of our Lord Jesus

God of Christ, whose members we are. Let us remember, however, that this relates
to his human nature; so that his subjection takes nothing away from his eternal
godhead.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Father of
glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This title springs from the former; for
God&#8217;s glory, as a Father, consists in subjecting his Son to our condition,
that, through him, he might be our God. <i>The Father of glory</i> is a
well-known Hebrew idiom for <i>The glorious Father</i>. There is a mode of
pointing and reading this passage, which I do not disapprove, and which connects
the two clauses in this manner: <i>That God, the glorious Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, may give to you.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Spirit of wisdom and
revelation</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is here put, by a figure of speech,
(metonymy,) for the grace which the Lord bestows upon us by his own Spirit. But
let it be observed, that the gifts of the Spirit are not the gifts of nature.
Till the Lord opens them, <i>the eyes of our heart</i> are blind. Till the
Spirit has become our instructor, all that we know is folly and ignorance. Till
the Spirit of God has made it known to us by a secret revelation, the knowledge
of our Divine calling exceeds the capacity of our own minds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the knowledge of
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This might also be read, <i>In the</i>
<i>knowledge of himself</i>. Both renderings agree well with the context, for he
that knows the Son knows also the Father; but I prefer the former as more
natively suggested by the Greek pronoun,</font><font face="Bwgrkl">
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn ejpignw&gt;sei

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The eyes of your understanding
being enlightened.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> <i>The</i> <i>eyes of your
heart</i> is the rendering of the Vulgate, which is supported by some Greek
manuscripts. The difference is immaterial, for the Hebrews frequently employ it
to denote the rational powers of the soul, though more strictly, being the seat
of the affections, it means the will or desire; but I have preferred the
ordinary translation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And what the
riches.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> A comparison, suggested by its
excellence, reminds us how unfit we are to receive this elevated knowledge; for
the power of God is no small matter. This great power, he tells us, had been
exerted, and in a very extraordinary manner, towards the Ephesians, who were
thus laid under constant obligations to follow his calling. By thus extolling
the grace of God toward themselves, he intended to check every tendency to
despise or dislike the duties of the Christian life. But the splendid encomiums
which he pronounces on faith convey to us also this instruction, that it is so
admirable a work and gift of God, that no language can do justice to its
excellence. Paul is not in the habit of throwing out hyperboles without
discrimination; but when he comes to treat of a matter which lies so far beyond
this world as faith does, he raises our minds to the admiration of heavenly
power.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the
working.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some consider this clause as referring
solely to the word <i>believe</i>, which comes immediately before it; but I
rather view it as an additional statement, tending to heighten the greatness of
the power, as a demonstration, or, if you prefer it, an instance and evidence of
the efficacy of the power. The repetition of the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>power,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">duna&gt;mewv</font><font face="Palatino">)
has the appearance of being superfluous; but in the former case it is restricted
to one class, &#8212; in the next, it has a general application. Paul, we find,
never thinks that he can say enough in his descriptions of the Christian
calling. And certainly the power of God is wonderfully displayed, when we are
brought from death to life, and when, from being the children of hell, we become
the children of God and heirs of eternal life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Foolish men imagine that this language is absurdly
hyperbolical; but godly persons, who are engaged in daily struggles with inward
corruption, have no difficulty in perceiving that not a word is here used beyond
what is perfectly just. As the importance of the subject cannot be too strongly
expressed, so our unbelief and ingratitude led Paul to employ this glowing
language. We never form adequate conceptions of the treasure revealed to us in
the gospel; or, if we do, we cannot persuade ourselves that it is possible for
us to do so, because we perceive nothing in us that corresponds to it, but
everything the reverse. Paul&#8217;s object, therefore, was not only to impress
the Ephesians with a deep sense of the value of Divine grace, but also to give
them exalted views of the glory of Christ&#8217;s kingdom. That they might not
be cast down by a view of their own unworthiness, he exhorts them to consider
the power of God; as if he had said, that their regeneration was no ordinary
work of God, but was an astonishing exhibition of his power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the efficacy of the
power of his strength.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There are three words
here, on which we may make a passing remark. We may view

action.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">With the greatest propriety does he enjoin us to

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 12:9.) In what do we excel the children of the world but in this,
that our condition appears to be somewhat worse than theirs? Though sin does not
reign, it continues to dwell in us, and death is still strong. Our blessedness,
which lies in hope, is not perceived by the world. The power of the Spirit is a
thing unknown to flesh and blood. A thousand distresses, to which we are daily
liable, render us more despised than other men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Christ alone, therefore, is the mirror in which we
can contemplate that which the weakness of the cross hinders from being clearly
seen in ourselves. When our minds rise to a confident anticipation of
righteousness, salvation, and glory, let us learn to turn them to Christ. We
still lie under the power of death; but he, raised from the dead by heavenly
power, has the dominion of life. We labor under the bondage of sin, and,
surrounded by endless vexations, are engaged in a hard warfare,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 1:18;) but he, sitting at the right hand of the Father, exercises the
highest government in heaven and earth, and triumphs gloriously over the enemies
whom he has subdued and vanquished. We lie here mean and despised; but to him
has been &#8220;given a name&#8221; (Philippians 2:9,) which angels and men
regard with reverence, and devils and wicked men with dread. We are pressed down
here by the scantiness of all our comforts: but he has been appointed by the
Father to be the sole dispenser of all blessings. For these reasons, we shall
find our advantage in directing our views to Christ, that in him, as in a
mirror, we may see the glorious treasures of Divine grace, and the unmeasurable
greatness of that power, which has not yet been manifested in
ourselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And set him at his own right
hand.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This passage shews plainly, if any one
does, what is meant by <i>the right hand of God</i>. It does not mean any
particular place, but the power which the Father has bestowed on Christ, that he
may administer in his name the government of heaven and earth. It is idle,
therefore, to inquire why Stephen <i>saw him standing,</i> (Acts 7:55,) while
Paul describes him as <i>sitting</i> at God&#8217;s right hand. The expression
does not refer to any bodily posture, but denotes the highest royal power with
which Christ has been invested. This is intimated by what immediately follows,
<i>far above all principality and power:</i> for the whole of this description
is added for the purpose of explaining what is meant by<i> the right
hand.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God the Father is said to have raised Christ to
&#8220;his right hand,&#8221; because he has made him to share in his
government, because by him he exerts all his power; the metaphor being borrowed
from earthly princes, who confer the honor of sitting along with themselves on
those whom they have clothed with the highest authority. As the right hand of
God fills heaven and earth, it follows that the kingdom and power of Christ are
equally extensive. It is in vain, therefore, to attempt to prove that, because
Christ sitteth at the right hand of God, he dwells in heaven alone. His human
nature, it is true, resides in heaven, and not in earth; but that argument is
foreign to the purpose. The expression which follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in heavenly
places,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> does not at all imply that the right
hand of God is confined to heaven, but directs us to contemplate the heavenly
glory amidst which our Lord Jesus dwells, the blessed immortality which he
enjoys, and the dominion over angels to which he has been
exalted.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Far above all principality, and
power, and might, and dominion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> All these
names, there can be no doubt, are applied to angels, who are so denominated,
because, by means of them, God exercises his power, and might, and dominion. He
permits them to share, as far as is competent to creatures, what belongs to
himself, and even gives to them his own name; for we find that they are called
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">&#181;yhla</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>elohim,</i>) <i>gods</i>. From the diversity of names we conclude that there
are various orders of angels; but to attempt to settle these with exactness, to
fix their number, or determine their ranks, would not merely discover foolish
curiosity, but would be rash, wicked, and dangerous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why did he not simply call them Angels? I answer,
it was to convey exalted views of the glory of Christ that Paul employed those
lofty titles. As if he had said, &#8220;There is nothing so elevated or
excellent, by whatever name it may be named, that is not subject to the majesty
of Christ.&#8221; There was an ancient superstition, prevalent both among Jews
and Gentiles, falsely attributing to angels many things, in order to draw away
their minds from God himself, and from the true Mediator. Paul constantly labors
to prevent this imaginary lustre of angels from dazzling the eyes of men, or
obscuring the brightness of Christ; and yet his utmost exertions could not
prevent &#8220;the wiles of the
devil&#8221;(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:11) from succeeding in this matter. Thus we see how the world, through a
superstitious dread of angels, departed from Christ. It was indeed the
unavoidable consequence of the false opinions entertained respecting angels,
that the pure knowledge of Christ disappeared.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Above every name that is
named.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> <i>Name</i> is here taken for largeness,
or excellence; and <i>to be named</i> means to enjoy celebrity and praise.
<i>The age that is to come</i> is expressly mentioned, to point out that the
exalted rank of Christ is not temporal, but eternal; and that it is not limited
to this world, but shines illustriously in the kingdom of God. For this reason,
too, Isaiah calls him, (Isaiah 9:6,) <i>The Father of the future age</i>. In
short, the glories of men and angels are made to hold an inferior place, that
the glory of Christ, unequalled and unapproached, may shine above them
all.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And gave him to be the
head.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He was made the head of the Church, on
the condition that he should have the administration of all things. The apostle
shews that it was not a mere honorary title, but was accompanied by the entire
command and government of the universe. The metaphor of a
<i>head</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">denotes the highest authority. I am unwilling to
dispute about a name, but we are driven to it by the base conduct of those who
flatter the Romish idol. Since Christ alone is called &#8220;the head,&#8221;
all others, whether angels or men, must rank as members; so that he who holds
the highest place among his fellows is still one of the members of the same
body. And yet they are not ashamed to make an open avowal that the Church will
be
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajke&gt;falon</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>without a head</i>, if it has not another head on earth besides Christ. So
small is the respect which they pay to Christ, that, if he obtain undivided that
honor which his Father has bestowed upon him, the Church is supposed to be
disfigured. This is the basest sacrilege. But let us listen to the Apostle, who
declares that the Church is His body, and, consequently, that those who refuse
to submit to Him are unworthy of its communion; for on Him alone the unity of
the Church depends.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The fullness of him that
filleth all in all.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the highest honor
of the Church, that, until He is united to us, the Son of God reckons himself in
some measure imperfect. What consolation is it for us to learn, that, not until
we are along with him, does he possess all his parts, or wish to be regarded as
complete! Hence, in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, [1Co 12:12-31] when
the apostle discusses largely the metaphor of a human body, he includes under
the single name of Christ the whole Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That filleth all in
all.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is added to guard against the
supposition that any real defect would exist in Christ, if he were separated
from us. His wish to be filled, and, in some respects, made perfect in us,
arises from no want or necessity; for all that is good in ourselves, or in any
of the creatures, is the gift of his hand; and his goodness appears the more
remarkably in raising us out of nothing, that he, in like manner, may dwell and
live in us. There is no impropriety in limiting the word <i>all</i> to its
application to this passage; for, though all things are regulated by the will
and power of Christ, yet the subject of which Paul particularly speaks is the
spiritual government of the Church. There is nothing, indeed, to hinder us from
viewing it as referring to the universal government of the world; but to limit
it to the case in hand is the more probable interpretation.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpexergasi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">
of the former statements, that is, an exposition accompanied by an illustration.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb13</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> To
bring home more effectually to the Ephesians the general doctrine of Divine
grace, he reminds them of their former condition. This application consists of
two parts. &#8220;Ye were formerly lost; but now God, by his grace, has rescued
you from destruction.&#8221; And here we must observe, that, in laboring to give
an impressive view of both of these parts, the apostle makes a break in the
style by
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJperbato&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">)
a transposition. There is some perplexity in the language; but, if we attend
carefully to what the apostle says about those two parts, the meaning is clear.
As to the first, he says that they <i>were dead;</i> and states, at the same
time, the cause of the death &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trespasses and
sins.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He does
not mean simply that they were in danger of death; but he declares that it was a
real and present death under which they labored. As spiritual death is nothing
else than the alienation of the soul from God, we are all born as dead men, and
we live as dead men, until we are made partakers of the life of Christ, &#8212;
agreeably to the words of our Lord,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">The
hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of

(John</font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">5:25)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Papists, who are eager to seize every opportunity
of undervaluing the grace of God, say, that while we are out of Christ, we are
half dead. But we are not at liberty to set aside the declarations of our Lord
and of the Apostle Paul, that, while we remain in Adam, we are entirely devoid
of life; and that regeneration is a new life of the soul, by which it rises from
the dead. Some kind of life, I acknowledge, does remain in us, while we are
still at a distance from Christ; for unbelief does not altogether destroy the
outward senses, or the will, or the other faculties of the soul. But what has
this to do with the kingdom of God? What has it to do with a happy life, so long
as every sentiment of the mind, and every act of the will, is death? Let this,
then, be held as a fixed principle, that the union of our soul with God is the
true and only life; and that out of Christ we are altogether dead, because sin,
the cause of death, reigns in us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In which for some time ye
walked.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> From the effects or fruits, he draws a
proof that sin formerly reigned in them; for, until sin displays itself in
outward acts, men are not sufficiently aware of its power. When he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the course of this
world,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb15</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
intimates that the death which he had mentioned rages in the nature of man, and
is a universal disease. He does not mean that course of the world which God has
ordained, nor the elements, such as the heaven, and earth, and air, &#8212; but
the depravity with which we are all infected; so that sin is not peculiar to a
few, but pervades the whole world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the prince of the
power of the air.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now proceeds farther, and
explains the cause of our corruption to be the dominion which the devil
exercises over us. A more severe condemnation of mankind could not have been
pronounced. What does he leave to us, when he declares us to be the slaves of
Satan, and subject to his will, so long as we live out of the kingdom of Christ?
Our condition, therefore, though many treat it with ridicule, or, at least, with
little disapprobation, may well excite our horror. Where is now the free-will,
the guidance of reason, the moral virtue, about which Papists babble to much?
What will they find that is pure or holy under the tyranny of the devil? On this
subject, indeed, they are extremely cautious, and denounce this doctrine of Paul
as a grievous heresy. I maintain, on the contrary, that there is no obscurity in
the apostle&#8217;s language; and that all men who live <i>according to the
world,</i> that is, according to the inclinations of their flesh, are here
declared to fight under the reign of Satan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In accordance with the practice of the inspired
writers, the Devil is mentioned in the singular number. As the children of God
have one head, so have the wicked; for each of the classes forms a distinct
body. By assigning to him the dominion over all wicked beings, ungodliness is
represented as an unbroken mass. As to his attributing to the devil power over
the air, that will be considered when we come to the sixth chapter. At present,
we shall merely advert to the strange absurdity of the Manicheans, in
endeavoring to prove from this passage the existence of two principles, as if
Satan could do anything without the Divine permission. Paul does not allow him
the highest authority, which belongs to the will of God alone, but merely a
tyranny which God permits him to exercise. What is Satan but God&#8217;s
executioner to punish man&#8217;s ingratitude? This is implied in Paul&#8217;s
language, when he represents the success of Satan as confined to unbelievers;
for the children of God are thus exempted from his power. If this be true, it
follows that Satan does nothing but under the control of a superior: and that he
is not
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aujtokra&gt;twr</font><font face="Palatino">)
an unlimited monarch.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We may now draw from it also this inference, that
ungodly men have no excuse in being driven by Satan to commit all sorts of
crimes. Whence comes it that they are subject to his tyranny, but because they
are rebels against God? If none are the slaves of Satan, but those who have
renounced the service, and refuse to yield to the authority, of God, let them
blame themselves, for having so cruel a master.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
children of disobedience,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> according to a Hebrew
idiom, are meant obstinate persons. Unbelief is always accompanied by
disobedience; so that it is the source &#8212; the <i>mother</i> of all
stubbornness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Among whom also we all had our
conversation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Lest it should be supposed that
what he had now said was a slanderous reproach against the former character of
the Ephesians, or that Jewish pride had led him to treat the Gentiles as an
inferior race, he associates himself and his countrymen along with them in the
general accusation. This is not done in hypocrisy, but in a sincere ascription
of glory to God. It may excite wonder, indeed, that he should speak of himself
as having walked &#8220;in the lusts of the flesh,&#8221; while, on other
occasions, he boasts that his life had been throughout
irreproachable.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">I reply, the statement applies to all who have not
been regenerated by the Spirit of Christ. However praiseworthy, in appearance,
the life of some may be, because their lusts do not break out in the sight of
men, there is nothing pure or holy which does not proceed from the fountain of
all purity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fulfilling the desires of the flesh

<i>the mind</i> includes reason, such as it exists in men by nature; so that

the sensual part of man, but extend to the whole.</font><br></div>

excellence. <i>Children of wrath</i> are those who are lost, and who deserve
eternal death. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wrath</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">means the judgment of God; so that <i>the children
of wrath</i> are those who are condemned before God. Such, the apostle tells us,
had been the Jews, &#8212; such had been all the excellent men that were now in
the Church; and they were so<i> by nature,</i> that is, from their very
commencement, and from their mother&#8217;s womb.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable passage, in opposition to the
views of the Pelagians, and of all who deny original sin. What dwells naturally
in all is certainly original; but Paul declares that we are all naturally liable
to condemnation; therefore sin dwells naturally in us, for God does not condemn
the innocent. Pelagians were wont to object, that sin spread from Adam to the
whole human race, not by descent, but by imitation. But Paul affirms that we are
born with sin, as serpents bring their venom from the womb. Others who think
that it is not in reality sin, are not less at variance with Paul&#8217;s
language; for where condemnation is, there must unquestionably be sin. It is not
with blameless men, but with sin, that God is offended. Nor is it wonderful that
the depravity which we inherit from our parents is reckoned as sin before God;
for the seeds of sin, before they have been openly displayed, are perceived and
condemned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But one question here arises. Why does Paul represent
the Jews, equally with others, as subject to wrath and curse, while they were
the blessed seed? I answer, they have a common nature. Jews differ from Gentiles
in nothing but this, that, through the grace of the promise, God delivers them
from destruction; but that is a remedy which came after the disease. Another
question is, since God is the Author of nature, how comes it that no blame
attaches to God, if we are lost by nature? I answer, there is a twofold nature:
the one was produced by God, and the other is the corruption of it. This
condemnation therefore which Paul mentions does not proceed from God, but from a
depraved nature: for we are not born such as Adam was at first created, we are
not</font><br></div>

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Now
follows the second member of the sentence, the substance of which is, that God
had delivered the Ephesians from the destruction to which they were formerly
liable; but the words which he employs are different. <i>God, who is rich in
mercy, hath quickened you together with Christ.</i> The meaning is, that, there
is no other life than that which is breathed into us by Christ: so that we begin
to live only when we are ingrafted into him, and enjoy the same life with
himself. This enables us to see what the apostle formerly meant by death, for
that death and this resurrection are brought into contrast. To be made partakers
of the life of the Son of God, &#8212; to be quickened by one Spirit, is an
inestimable privilege.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On this ground he praises the <i>mercy</i> of God,
meaning by its <i>riches,</i> that it had been poured out in a singularly large
and abundant manner. The whole of our salvation is here ascribed to the mercy of
God. But he presently adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for
his great love wherewith he loved us.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is
a still more express declaration, that all was owing to undeserved goodness; for
he declares that God was moved by this single consideration.
&#8220;Herein,&#8221; says John, &#8220;is love, not that we loved God, but that
he loved us. &#8212; We love him because he first loved us.&#8221;

know not; but, as they are perfectly agreeable to the context, I am quite
willing to receive them as written by Paul. They show us that he always feels as
if he had not sufficiently proclaimed the riches of Divine grace, and
accordingly expresses, by a variety of terms, the same truth, that everything
connected with our salvation ought to be ascribed to God as its author. And
certainly he who duly weighs the ingratitude of men will not complain that this
parenthesis is superfluous.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hath raised us up
together.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The resurrection and sitting in
heaven, which are here mentioned, are not yet seen by mortal eyes. Yet, as if
those blessings were presently in our possession, he states that we have
received them; and illustrates the change which has taken place in our
condition, when we were led from Adam to Christ. It is as if we had been brought
from the deepest hell to heaven itself. And certainly, although, as respects
ourselves, our salvation is still the object of hope, yet in Christ we already
possess a blessed immortality and glory; and therefore, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in Christ
Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Hitherto it does not appear in the
members, but only in the head; yet, in consequence of the secret union, it
belongs truly to the members. Some render it, <i>through Christ;</i> but, for
the reason which has been mentioned, it is better to retain the usual rendering,
<i>in Christ.</i> We are thus furnished with the richest consolation. Of
everything which we now want, we have a sure pledge and foretaste in the person
of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That in the ages to
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The final and true cause &#8212; the
glory of God &#8212; is again mentioned, that the Ephesians, by making it the
subject of earnest study, might be more fully assured of their salvation. He
likewise adds, that it was the design of God to hallow, in all ages, the
remembrance of so great goodness. This exhibits still more strongly the hateful
character of those by whom the free calling of the Gentiles was attacked; for
they were endeavoring instantly to crush that scheme which was destined to be
remembered through all ages. But we, too, are instructed by it, that the mercy
of God, who was pleased to admit our fathers into the number of his own people,
deserves to be held in everlasting remembrance. The calling of the Gentiles is
an astonishing work of divine goodness, which ought to be handed down by parents
to children, and to their children&#8217;s children, that it may never be
forgotten or unacknowledged by the sons of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The riches of his grace in his
kindness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The love of God to us in Christ is
here proved, or again declared, to have had its origin in
mercy</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>. That he might

only, therefore, does he declare, that the love of God was free, but likewise
that God displayed in it the riches, &#8212; the extraordinary pre-eminent
riches of his grace. It deserves notice, also, that the name
of</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For by grace are ye
saved.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is an inference from the former
statements. Having treated of election and of effectual calling, he arrives at
this general conclusion, that they had obtained salvation by faith alone. First,
he asserts, that the salvation of the Ephesians was entirely the work, the
gracious work of God. But then they had obtained this grace by faith. On one
side, we must look at God; and, on the other, at man. God declares, that he owes
us nothing; so that salvation is not a reward or recompense, but unmixed grace.
The next question is, in what way do men receive that salvation which is offered
to them by the hand of God? The answer is,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by faith;</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">and hence he concludes that nothing connected with
it is our own. If, on the part of God, it is grace alone, and if we bring
nothing but faith, which strips us of all commendation, it follows that
salvation does not come from us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Ought we not then to be silent about free-will, and
good intentions, and fancied preparations, and merits, and satisfactions? There
is none of these which does not claim a share of praise in the salvation of men;
so that the praise of grace would not, as Paul shews, remain undiminished. When,
on the part of man, the act of receiving salvation is made to consist in faith
alone, all other means, on which men are accustomed to rely, are discarded.
Faith, then, brings a man empty to God, that he may be filled with the blessings
of Christ. And so he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not of
yourselves;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that claiming nothing for
themselves, they may acknowledge God alone as the author of their
salvation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not of
works.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Instead of what he had said, that their
salvation is of grace, he now affirms, that &#8220;it is the gift of God.&#8221;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Instead
of what he had said, <i>&#8220;</i>Not of yourselves,<i>&#8221;</i> he now says,
<i>&#8220;</i>Not of works.<i>&#8221;</i> Hence we see, that the apostle leaves
nothing to men in procuring salvation. In these three phrases, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not of
yourselves,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it is the gift of
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not of
works,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; he embraces the substance of his
long argument in the Epistles to the Romans and to the Galatians, that
righteousness comes to us from the mercy of God alone, &#8212; is offered to us
in Christ by the gospel, &#8212; and is received by faith alone, without the
merit of works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage affords an easy refutation of the idle
cavil by which Papists attempt to evade the argument, that we are justified
without works. Paul, they tell us, is speaking about ceremonies. But the present
question is not confined to one class of works. Nothing can be more clear than
this. The whole righteousness of man, which consists in works, &#8212; nay, the
whole man, and everything that he can call his own, is set aside. We must attend
to the contrast between God and man, &#8212; between grace and works. Why should
God be contrasted with man, if the controversy related to nothing more than
ceremonies?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Papists themselves are compelled to own that Paul
ascribes to the grace of God the whole glory of our salvation, but endeavor to
do away with this admission by another contrivance. This mode of expression,
they tell us, is employed, because God bestows the first grace. It is really
foolish to imagine that they can succeed in this way, since Paul excludes man
and his utmost ability, &#8212; not only from the commencement, but throughout,
&#8212; from the whole work of obtaining salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is still more absurd to overlook the
apostle&#8217;s inference,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> lest
any man should boast.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some room must always
remain for man&#8217;s boasting, so long as, independently of grace, merits are
of any avail. Paul&#8217;s doctrine is overthrown, unless the whole praise is
rendered to God alone and to his mercy. And here we must advert to a very common
error in the interpretation of this passage. Many persons restrict the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gift</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to faith alone. But Paul is only repeating in other words the former sentiment.
His meaning is, not that faith is the gift of God, but that salvation is given
to us by God, or, that we obtain it by the gift of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we are his
work.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By setting aside the contrary
supposition, he proves his statement, that <i>by grace we are saved,</i> &#8212;
that we have no remaining works by which we can merit salvation; for all the
good works which we possess are the fruit of regeneration. Hence it follows,
that works themselves are a part of grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says, that &#8220;we are the work of
God,&#8221; this does not refer to ordinary creation, by which we are made men.
We are declared to be new creatures, because, not by our own power, but by the
Spirit of Christ, we have been formed to righteousness. This applies to none but
believers. As the descendants of Adam, they were wicked and depraved; but by the
grace of Christ, they are spiritually renewed, and become new men. Everything in
us, therefore, that is good, is the supernatural gift of God. The context
explains his meaning. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We are his
work,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> because we have been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>created,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; not in Adam, but </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
Christ Jesus,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; not to every kind of
life, but to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good
works.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What remains now for free-will, if all the good works
which proceed from us are acknowledged to have been the gifts of the Spirit of
God? Let godly readers weigh carefully the apostle&#8217;s words. He does not
say that we are assisted by God. He does not say that the will is prepared, and
is then left to run by its own strength. He does not say that the power of
choosing aright is bestowed upon us, and that we are afterwards left to make our
own choice. Such is the idle talk in which those persons who do their utmost to
undervalue the grace of God are accustomed to indulge. But the apostle affirms
that we are God&#8217;s work, and that everything good in us is his creation; by
which he means that the whole man is formed by his hand to be good. It is not
the mere power of choosing aright, or some indescribable kind of preparation, or
even assistance, but the right will itself, which is his workmanship; otherwise
Paul&#8217;s argument would have no force. He means to prove that man does not
in any way procure salvation for himself, but obtains it as a free gift from
God. The proof is, that man is nothing but by divine grace. Whoever, then, makes
the very smallest claim for man, apart from the grace of God, allows him, to
that extent, ability to procure salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Created to good
works.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> They err widely from Paul&#8217;s
intention, who torture this passage for the purpose of injuring the
righteousness of faith. Ashamed to affirm in plain terms, and aware that they
could gain nothing by affirming, that we are not justified by faith, they
shelter themselves under this kind of subterfuge. &#8220;We are justified by
faith, because faith, by which we receive the grace of God, is the commencement
of righteousness; but we are made righteous by regeneration, because, being
renewed by the Spirit of God, we walk in good works.&#8221; In this manner they
make faith the door by which we enter into righteousness, but imagine that we
obtain it by our works, or, at least, they define righteousness to be that
uprightness by which a man is formed anew to a holy life. I care not how old
this error may be; but they err egregiously who endeavor to support it by this
passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must look to Paul&#8217;s design. He intends to
shew that we have brought nothing to God, by which he might be laid under
obligations to us; and he shews that even the good works which we perform have
come from God. Hence it follows, that we are nothing, except through the pure
exercise of his kindness. Those men, on the other hand, infer that the half of
our justification arises from works. But what has this to do with Paul&#8217;s
intention, or with the subject which he handles? It is one thing to inquire in
what righteousness consists, and another thing to follow up the doctrine, that
it is not from ourselves, by this argument, that we have no right to claim good
works as our own, but have been formed by the Spirit of God, through the grace
of Christ, to all that is good. When Paul lays down the cause of justification,
he dwells chiefly on this point, that our consciences will never enjoy peace
till they rely on the propitiation for sins. Nothing of this sort is even
alluded to in the present instance. His whole object is to prove,
that,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">by
the grace of God, we are all that we
are.</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461510&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 15:10)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which God hath
prepared</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Beware of applying this, as
the Pelagians do, to the instruction of the law; as if Paul&#8217;s meaning
were, that God commands what is just, and lays down a proper rule of life.
Instead of this, he follows up the doctrine which he had begun to illustrate,
that salvation does not proceed from ourselves. He says, that, before we were
born, the good works were prepared by God; meaning, that in our own strength we
are not able to lead a holy life, but only so far as we are formed and adapted
by the hand of God. Now, if the grace of God came before our performances, all
ground of boasting has been taken away. Let us carefully observe the word
<i>prepared.</i> On the simple ground of the order of events, Paul rests the
proof that, with respect to good works, God owes us nothing. How so? Because
they were drawn out of his treasures, in which they had long before been laid
up; for whom he called, them he justifies and regenerates.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore
remember.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The apostle never once loses sight of
his subject, marks it out clearly, and pursues it with increasing earnestness.
He again exhorts the Ephesians to remember what their character had been before
they were called. This consideration was fitted to convince them that they had
no reason to be proud. He afterwards points out the method of reconciliation,
that they might rest with perfect satisfaction on Christ alone, and not imagine
that other aids were necessary. The first clause may be thus summed up:
&#8220;Remember that, when ye were uncircumcised, ye were aliens from Christ,
from the hope of salvation, and from the Church and kingdom of God; so that ye
had no friendly intercourse with God.&#8221; The second may run thus: &#8220;But
now ingrafted into Christ, ye are at the same time reconciled to God.&#8221;
What is implied in both parts of the description, and what effect the
remembrance of it was fitted to produce on their minds, has been already
considered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gentiles in the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He first mentions that they had wanted
the marks of God&#8217;s people. <i>Circumcision</i> was a token by which the
people of God were marked out and distinguished from other men:
<i>Uncircumcision</i> was the mark of a profane person. Since, therefore, God
usually connects his grace with the sacraments, their want of the sacraments is
taken as an evidence that neither were they partakers of his grace. The
argument, indeed, does not hold universally, though it does hold as to
God&#8217;s ordinary dispensations. Hence we find the following
language:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">And
the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and
evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life,
and eat, and live for ever: therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the
garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. So he drove out the
man.</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010322&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
3:22,23)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though he had devoured the whole tree, he would not,
by merely eating it, have recovered the possession of life; but, by taking away
the sign, the Lord took from him also life itself. Uncircumcision is thus held
out to the Ephesians as a mark of pollution. By taking from the Ephesians the
token of sanctification, he deprives them also of the thing
signified.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some are of opinion, that all these observations are
intended to throw contempt on outward circumcision; but this is a mistake. At
the same time, I acknowledge, that the qualifying
clause</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, the Circumcision in the
flesh made by hands,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> points out a twofold
circumcision. The Jews were thus taught that they should no longer indulge in
foolish boasting about the literal circumcision. The Ephesians, on the other
hand, were instructed to abstain from all scruples on their own account, since
the most important privilege&#8212;nay, the whole truth expressed by the outward
sign&#8212;was in their possession. He calls it,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Uncircumcision in the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> because they bore the mark of
their pollution; but, at the same time, he suggests that their uncircumcision
was no hinderance to their being spiritually circumcised by
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The words may likewise be read in one clause,

in giving them this name, for he treated all the notions entertained respecting
false gods as nothing; and with the utmost propriety do godly persons regard all
idols as &#8220;nothing in the world.&#8221; (1 Corinthians 8:4.) Those who do
not worship the true God, whatever may be the variety of their worship, or the
multitude of laborious ceremonies which they perform, are without God: they
adore what they know not. (Acts 17:23.) Let it be carefully observed, that the

For he is our peace.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now includes Jews in
the privilege of reconciliation, and shows that, through one Messiah, all are
united to God. This consideration was fitted to repress the false confidence of
the Jews, who, despising the grace of Christ, boasted that they were the holy
people, and chosen inheritance, of God. If Christ <i>is our peace,</i> all who
are out of him must be at variance with God. What a beautiful title is this
which Christ possesses, &#8212; the peace between God and men! Let no one who
dwells in Christ entertain a doubt that he is reconciled to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath made both
one.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This distinction was necessary.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> All
intercourse with the Gentiles was held to be inconsistent with their own
superior claims.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> To
subdue this pride, he tells them that they and the Gentiles have been united
into one body. Put all these things together, and you will frame the following
syllogism: If the Jews wish to enjoy peace with God, they must have Christ as
their Mediator. But Christ will not be their peace in any other way than by
making them one body with the Gentiles. Therefore, unless the Jews admit the
Gentiles to fellowship with them, they have no friendship with
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And breaking down the middle wall
of partition.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To understand this passage, two
things must be observed. The Jews were separated, for a certain time, from the
Gentiles, by the appointment of God; and ceremonial observances were the open
and avowed symbols of that separation. Passing by the Gentiles, God had chosen
the Jews to be a peculiar people to himself. A wide distinction was thus made,
when the one class were &#8220;fellow-citizens and of the household&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:19) of the Church, and the other were foreigners. This is stated in the Song
of Moses:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">When
the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the
sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the
children of Israel: for the Lord&#8217;s portion is his people, Jacob is the lot
of his
inheritance.</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
32:8,9)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Bounds were thus fixed by God to separate one people
from the rest; and hence arose <i>the enmity</i> which is here mentioned. A
separation is thus made. The Gentiles are set aside. God is pleased to choose
and sanctify the Jewish people, by freeing them from the ordinary pollution of
mankind. Ceremonial observances were afterwards added, which, like walls,
enclosed the inheritance of God, prevented it from being open to all or mixed
with other possessions, and thus excluded the Gentiles from the kingdom of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But now, the apostle, says, the <i>enmity</i> is
removed, and the wall is broken down. By extending the privilege of adoption
beyond the limits of Judea, Christ has now made us all to be brethren. And so is
fulfilled the prophecy,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">God

Having abolished in his flesh the enmity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The
meaning of Paul&#8217;s words is now clear. <i>The middle wall of partition</i>
hindered Christ from forming Jews and Gentiles into one body, and therefore the
wall has been <i>broken down.</i> The reason why it is broken down is now added
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to abolish the
enmity</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> by the flesh of Christ. The Son
of God, by assuming a nature common to all, has formed in his own body a perfect
unity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even the law of commandments
contained in ordinances.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What had been
metaphorically understood by the word <i>wall</i> is now more plainly expressed.
The ceremonies, by which the distinction was declared, have been abolished
through Christ. What were circumcision, sacrifices, washings, and abstaining
from certain kinds of food, but symbols of sanctification, reminding the Jews
that their lot was different from that of other nations; just as the white and
the red cross distinguish the French of the present day from the inhabitants of
Burgundy. Paul declares not only that the Gentiles are equally with the Jews
admitted to the fellowship of grace, so that they no longer differ from each
other, but that the mark of difference has been taken away; for ceremonies have
been abolished. If two contending nations were brought under the dominion of one
prince, he would not only desire that they should live in harmony, but would
remove the badges and marks of their former enmity. When an obligation is
discharged, the <i>handwriting</i> is destroyed, &#8212; a metaphor which Paul
employs on this very subject in another Epistle.

<div><font face="Palatino">Some interpreters,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212;
though, in my opinion, erroneously, &#8212; connect the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
ordinances,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abolished</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
making the <i>ordinances</i> to be the act of abolishing the ceremonies. This is
Paul&#8217;s ordinary phrase for describing the ceremonial law, in which the
Lord not only enjoined upon the Jews a simple rule of life, but also bound them
by various statutes. It is evident, too, that Paul is here treating exclusively
of the ceremonial law; for the moral law is not a wall of partition separating
us from the Jews, but lays down instructions in which the Jews were not less
deeply concerned than ourselves. This passage affords the means of refuting an
erroneous view held by some, that circumcision and all the ancient rites, though
they are not binding on the Gentiles, are in force at the present day upon the
Jews. On this principle there would still be a middle wall of partition between
us, which is proved to be false.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he might make in
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino">. When the apostle says, <i>in
himself,</i> he turns away the Ephesians from viewing the diversity of men, and
bids them look for unity nowhere but in Christ. To whatever extent the two might
differ in their former condition, in Christ they are become one man. But he
emphatically adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>one new
man,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> intimating (what he explains at greater
length on another occasion) that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">neither
circumcision, nor uncircumcision, availeth

6:15,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">but that &#8220;a new creature&#8221; holds the first
and the last place. The principle which cements them is spiritual regeneration.
If then we are all renewed by Christ, let the Jews no longer congratulate
themselves on their ancient condition, but let them be ready to admit that, both
in themselves and in others, Christ is
all.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And that he might reconcile both.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The
reconciliation between ourselves which has now been described is not the only
advantage which we derive from Christ. We have been brought back into favor with
God. The Jews are thus led to consider that they have not less need of a
Mediator than the Gentiles. Without this, neither the Law, nor ceremonies, nor
their descent from Abraham, nor all their dazzling prerogatives, would be of any
avail. We are all sinners; and forgiveness of sins cannot be obtained but
through the grace of Christ. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in one
body,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to inform the Jews, that to cultivate
union with the Gentiles will be well-pleasing in the sight of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the
cross.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The word <i>cross</i> is added, to point
out the propitiatory sacrifice. Sin is the cause of enmity between God and us;
and, until it is removed, we shall not be restored to the Divine favor. It has
been blotted out by the death of Christ, in which he offered himself to the
Father as an expiatory victim. There is another reason, indeed, why the cross is
mentioned here, as it is through the cross that all ceremonies have been
abolished. Accordingly, he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>slaying the enmity
thereby.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These words, which unquestionably
relate to the cross, may admit of two senses, &#8212; either that Christ, by his
death, has turned away from us the Father&#8217;s anger, or that, having
redeemed both Jews and Gentiles, he has brought them back into one flock. The
latter appears to be the more probable interpretation, as it agrees with a
former clause, <i>abolishing in his flesh the enmity.</i>

<div><font face="Palatino">Salvation through the death of Christ is first
announced, and a description is afterwards given of the manner in which Christ
communicates to us himself and the benefit of his death. But here Paul dwells
chiefly on this circumstance, that Gentiles are united with Jews in the Kingdom
of God. Having already represented Christ as a Savior common to both, he now
speaks of them as companions in the gospel. The Jews, though they possessed the
law, needed the gospel also; and God had bestowed upon the Gentiles equal grace.

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470520&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:20) The faith of the gospel would be weak indeed, were we to look
no higher than to men. Its whole authority is derived from viewing men as
God&#8217;s instruments, and hearing Christ speak to us by their mouth. Observe
here, the gospel is the message of <i>peace,</i> by which God declares himself
to be reconciled to us, and makes known his paternal love. Take away the gospel,
and war and enmity continue to subsist between God and men; and, on the other
hand, the native tendency of the gospel is, to give peace and calmness to the
conscience, which would otherwise be tormented by distressing
alarm.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For through him we both have
access.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is an argument from the fact, that
we are permitted to draw near to God. But it may be viewed also as an
announcement of peace; for wicked men, lulled into a profound sleep, sometimes
deceive themselves by false notions of peace, but are never at rest, except when
they have learned to forget the Divine judgment, and to keep themselves at the
greatest possible distance from God. It was necessary, therefore, to explain the
true nature of evangelical peace, which is widely different from a stupefied
conscience, from false confidence, from proud boasting, from ignorance of our
own wretchedness. It is a settled composure, which leads us not to dread, but to
desire and seek, the face of God. Now, it is Christ who opens the door to us,
yea, who is himself <i>the door</i>. (John 10:9.) As this is a double door
thrown open for the admission both of Jews and Gentiles, we are led to view God
as exhibiting to both his fatherly kindness. He
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> by one
Spirit;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> who leads and guides us to Christ, and
&#8220;by whom we cry, Abba, Father,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:15,) for hence arises the boldness of approach. Jews had various means of
drawing near to God; now all have but one way, to be led by the Spirit of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Now therefore ye are no more strangers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The
Ephesians are now exclusively addressed. They were formerly <i>strangers from
the covenants of promise,</i> but their condition was now changed. They were
<i>foreigners,</i> but God had made them <i>citizens</i> of his church. The high
value of that honor which God had been pleased to bestow upon them, is expressed
in a variety of language. They are first called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fellow-citizens with the
saints,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; next,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the household of
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; and lastly, stones properly fitted
into the building of the temple of the Lord. The first appellation is taken from
the comparison of the church to a state, which occurs very frequently in
Scripture. Those who were formerly profane, and utterly unworthy to associate
with godly persons, have been raised to distinguished honor in being admitted to
be members of the same community with Abraham, &#8212; with all the holy
patriarchs, and prophets, and kings, &#8212; nay, with the angels themselves. To
be <i>of the household of God,</i> which is the second comparison, suggests
equally exalted views of their present condition. God has admitted them into his
own family; for the church is God&#8217;s
house.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And are
built</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The third comparison illustrates the
manner in which the Ephesians, and all other Christians are admitted to the
honor of being <i>fellow-citizens with the saints and of the household of
God.</i> They are </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>built on the
foundation,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; they are founded on the
doctrine, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the apostles and
prophets.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We are thus enabled to distinguish
between a true and a false church. This is of the greatest importance; for the
tendency to error is always strong, and the consequences of mistake are
dangerous in the extreme. No churches boast more loudly of the name than those
which bear a false and empty title; as may be seen in our own times. To guard us
against mistake, the mark of a true church is pointed out.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Foundation,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
in this passage, unquestionably means doctrine; for no mention is made of
patriarchs or pious kings, but only of those who held the office of teachers,
and whom God had appointed to superintend the edification of his church. It is
laid down by Paul, that the faith of the church ought to be founded on this
doctrine. What opinion, then, must we form of those who rest entirely on the
contrivances of men, and yet accuse us of revolt, because we embrace the pure
doctrine of God? But the manner in which it is founded deserves inquiry; for, in
the strict sense of the term, Christ is the only foundation. He alone supports
the whole church. He alone is the rule and standard of faith. But Christ is
actually the foundation on which the church is built by the preaching of
doctrine; and, on this account, the prophets and apostles are called builders.
(1 Corinthians 3:10.) Nothing else, Paul tells us, was ever intended by the
prophets and apostles, than to found a church on Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We shall find this to be true, if we begin with
Moses; for &#8220;Christ is the end of the law,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:4,) and the sum of the gospel. Let us remember, therefore, that if we wish to
be reckoned among believers, we must place our reliance on no other: if we wish
to make sure progress in the knowledge of the Scriptures, to him our whole
attention must be directed. The same lesson is taught, when we consult the word
of God as contained in the writings of the prophets and apostles. To shew us how
we ought to combine them, their harmony is pointed out; for they have a common
foundation, and labor jointly in building the temple of God. Though the apostles
have become our teachers, the instruction of the prophets has not been rendered
superfluous; but one and the same object is promoted by both.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have been led to make this remark by the conduct of
the Marcionites in ancient times, who expunged the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophets</i></font><font face="Palatino">
from this passage; and by that of certain fanatics in the present day, who,
following their footsteps, exclaim loudly that we have nothing to do with the
law and the prophets, because the gospel has put an end to their authority. The
Holy Spirit everywhere declares, that he has spoken to us by the mouth of the
prophets, and demands that we shall listen to him in their writings. This is of
no small consequence for maintaining the authority of our faith. All the
servants of God, from first to last, are so perfectly agreed, that their harmony
is in itself a clear demonstration that it is one God who speaks in them all.
The commencement of our religion must be traced to the creation of the world. In
vain do Papists, Mahometans, and other sects, boast of their antiquity, while
they are mere counterfeits of the true, the pure religion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jesus Christ, himself is the chief
corner-stone</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb25</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Those
who transfer this honor to Peter, and maintain that on him the church is
founded, are so void of shame, as to attempt to justify their error by quoting
this passage. They hold out that Christ is called <i>the chief corner-stone,</i>
by comparison with others; and that there are many stones on which the church is
founded. But this difficulty is easily solved. Various metaphors are employed by
the apostles according to the diversity of circumstances, but still with the
same meaning. In writing to the Corinthians, Paul lays down an incontestable
proposition, that &#8220;no other foundation can be laid.&#8221; (1 Corinthians
3:11.) He does not therefore mean, that Christ is merely a corner, or a part of
the foundation; for then he would contradict himself. What then? He means that
Jews and Gentiles were two separate walls, but are formed into one spiritual
building. Christ is placed in the middle of the corner for the purpose of
uniting both, and this is the force of the metaphor. What is immediately added
shews sufficiently that he is very far from limiting Christ to any one part of
the building.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In whom all the building
groweth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> If this be true, what will become of
Peter? When Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, speaks of Christ as a
&#8220;Foundation,&#8221; he does not mean that the church is begun by him and
completed by others, but draws a distinction arising out of a comparison of his
own labors with those of other men. It had been his duty to found the church at
Corinth, and to leave to his successors the completion of the
building.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">According
to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master-builder, I have laid
the foundation, and another buildeth on

<div><font face="Palatino">With respect to the present passage, he conveys the
instruction, that all who are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fitly framed together in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"> are the temple of the Lord. There is
first required a fitting together, that believers may embrace and accommodate
themselves to each other by mutual intercourse; otherwise there would not be a
building, but a confused mass. The chief part of the symmetry consists in unity
of faith. Next follows progress, or increase. Those who are not united in faith
and love, so as to <i>grow in the Lord,</i> belong to a profane building, which
has nothing in common with the temple of the Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Groweth unto an holy
temple.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Individual believers are at other times
called &#8220;temples of the Holy Ghost,&#8221; (1 Corinthians 6:19; 2
Corinthians 6:16,) but here all are said to constitute one temple. In both cases
the metaphor is just and appropriate. When God dwells in each of us, it is his
will that we should embrace all in holy unity, and that thus he should form one
temple out of many. Each person, when viewed separately, is a temple, but, when
joined to others, becomes a stone of a temple; and this view is given for the
sake of recommending the unity of the
church.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In whom ye also are builded
together,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or <i>in whom also</i> BE YE BUILDED
<i>together.</i> The termination of the Greek verb,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sunoikodomei~sqe</font><font face="Palatino">,
like that of the Latin, <i>cooedificamini,</i> does not enable us to determine
whether it is in the imperative or indicative mood. The context will admit
either, but I prefer the latter sense. It is, I think, an exhortation to the
Ephesians to grow more and more in the faith of Christ, after having been once
founded in it, and thus to form a part of that new temple of God, the building
of which through the gospel was then in progress in every part of the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Through the
Spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is again repeated for two reasons:
first, to remind them that all human exertions are of no avail without the
operation of the Spirit; and secondly, to point out the superiority of the
spiritual building to all Jewish and outward
services.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this
cause.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Paul&#8217;s imprisonment, which ought
to have been held as a confirmation of his apostleship, was undoubtedly
presented by his adversaries in an opposite light. He therefore points out to
the Ephesians that his chains served to prove and to declare his calling; and
that the only reason why he had been imprisoned was, that he had preached the
gospel to the Gentiles. His unshaken firmness was no small additional proof that
he had discharged his office in a proper manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The prisoner of Jesus
Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb26</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> To
strengthen his authority still more, he speaks in lofty terms of his prison. In
the presence of the world and of wicked men, this might have appeared to be
foolish boasting; but, in addressing godly persons, it was a dignified and
faithful manner. The glory of Christ not only overcomes the ignominy of the
chains, but converts what was in itself a reproach into the highest honor. If he
had merely said, &#8220;I am a prisoner,&#8221; this would not have conveyed the
idea of his being an ambassador. Imprisonment alone has no claim to this honor,
being usually the mark of wickedness and crime. But the crowns and sceptres of
kings, to say nothing of the imposing splendor of an ambassador, are less
honorable than the chains of a prisoner of Jesus Christ. Men might think
otherwise, but it is our duty to judge of the reasons. So highly ought the name
of Christ to be revered by us, that what men consider to be the greatest
reproach, ought to be viewed by us as the greatest honour.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For you
Gentiles.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Another circumstance greatly fitted
to interest the Ephesians was, that the persecutions of Paul were endured for
the Gentiles, &#8212; that his troubles and dangers were on their
account.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye have
heard.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is reason to believe, that, while
Paul was at Ephesus, he had said nothing on these subjects, no necessity for
doing so having arisen; for no controversy had taken place among them about the
calling of the Gentiles. If he had made any mention of them in his discourses,
he would have reminded the Ephesians of his former statements, instead of
referring generally, as he now does, to common report and to his own Epistle. He
did not, of his own accord, raise unnecessary disputes. It was only when the
wickedness of his adversaries made it necessary, that he reluctantly undertook
the defense of his ministry. <i>Dispensation</i>
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oikonomia</font><font face="Palatino">)
means here a divine order or command, or, as it is generally expressed, a
<i>commission</i>.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That by
revelation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some might imagine, that, in
attempting to discharge the office of an apostle, he had acted rashly, and was
now paying the penalty of his rashness. It was this that made him so earnest in
pleading the Divine authority for all his transactions. The present instance, on
account of its novelty, had few supporters; and therefore he calls it a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mystery.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
By this name he endeavors to remove the prejudice which the general displeasure
at the event was fitted to excite. His own personal interest in the matter was
less regarded than that of the Ephesians, who were deeply concerned in the
information, that, through the settled purpose of God, they had been called by
Paul&#8217;s ministry. Lest what is little known should forthwith become the
object of suspicion, the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mystery</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">places it in opposition to the perverse judgments
and opinions which were then prevalent in the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By revelation he made known to me
the mystery.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Paul draws the line of distinction
between himself and those fanatics, who ascribe to God and to the Holy Spirit
their own idle dreams. The false apostles boast of revelations, but it is a
false boast. Paul was persuaded that his revelation was true, could prove it to
others, and speaks of it as a fact of which no doubt could be
entertained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As I wrote a little
before.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This refers either to a rapid glance at
the same subject in the second chapter, or &#8212; which appears to be the
general opinion &#8212; to another Epistle. If the former exposition be adopted,
it will be proper to translate,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as I wrote before in few
words;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for the subject had received nothing
more than a passing notice; but the latter being, as I have said, the prevailing
opinion, I prefer translating, <i>as I wrote a little before.</i> The phrase,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn
ojli&gt;gw|</font><font face="Palatino">,) which Erasmus has translated <i>in a
few words,</i> appears rather to refer to time. On this supposition there would
be an implied comparison between the present and the former writings. But
nothing would be more unlike the fact, than to contrast them on the score of
brevity; for a more concise mode of expression than this passing glance can
hardly be imagined. The phrase, <i>a little before,</i> seems purposely to be
used as an appeal to their remembrance of a recent occurrence, though I do not
insist on this point. There is more difficulty in the next
verse.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>

translate </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnaginw&gt;skein
ti</font><font face="Palatino"> as signifying <i>to read</i> is, I think, at
variance with Greek syntax. I leave it as a subject of consideration, whether it
does not rather signify <i>to attend</i>. The participle would then be connected
with the preposition
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pro&lt;v</font><font face="Palatino">,
in the commencement of the verse, and the clause would run thus,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to which when ye attend, ye may
understand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> If, however, by viewing the
verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnaginw&gt;skontev</font><font face="Palatino">,
as disjoined from the preposition, you make it signify <i>reading,</i> the
meaning will still be, &#8220;by reading you may understand according to what I
have written;&#8221; taking the phrase
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pro&lt;v
o{</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>to which,</i> as equivalent to
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kaq j
o{</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>according to which;</i> but I suggest this
merely as a doubtful conjecture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If we adopt the view which is almost universally
approved, that the apostle had formerly written to the Ephesians, this is not
the only Epistle which we have lost. And yet there is no room for the sneers of
the ungodly, as if the Scriptures had been mutilated, or in any part had become
imperfect. If we duly consider Paul&#8217;s earnestness, &#8212; his
watchfulness and care, &#8212; his zeal and fervor, &#8212; his kindness and
readiness in assisting brethren, &#8212; we shall be led to regard it as highly
probable that he would write many epistles, both of a public and private nature,
to various places. Those which the Lord judged to be necessary for his church
have been selected by his providence for everlasting remembrance. Let us rest
assured, that what is left is enough for us, and that the smallness of the
remaining number is not the result of accident; but that the body of Scripture,
which is in our possession, has been adjusted by the wonderful counsel of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
knowledge.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The frequent mention of this point
shews the necessity that the calling of ministers should be firmly believed both
by themselves and by their people. But Paul looks more to others than to
himself. He had everywhere indeed given great offense by preaching the gospel
indiscriminately to Jews and Gentiles, but his solicitude was not chiefly on his
own account. There were not a few who, overwhelmed by the slanders of wicked
men, began to doubt of his apostleship, and whose faith was consequently shaken.
It was this that induced him so frequently to remind the Ephesians that he knew
the will and command of God who called him to the office.

Christ,</i></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which in other ages was not made
known.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He had simply called it a
<i>mystery,</i> but now calls it <i>a mystery of Christ,</i> because it was
necessary that it should remain hidden, until it was revealed by his coming;
just as the appellation of &#8220;prophecies of Christ&#8221; may be given to
those which relate to his kingdom. We must first explain the word
<i>mystery,</i> and then inquire why it is said to have remained unknown in all
ages. The <i>mystery</i> was,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">that
the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his
promise in Christ by the
gospel.</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(Verse
6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When this name is given to the gospel, it has other
meanings, which do not apply to the present passage. The calling of the
Gentiles, then, was a &#8220;mystery of Christ;&#8221; that is, it was to be
fulfilled under the reign of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why does he affirm that it was not known, when it
had been the subject of so many predictions? The prophets everywhere declare,
that people shall come from every nation in the world, to worship God; that an
altar shall be erected both in Assyria and in Egypt, and that all alike shall
speak the language of Canaan. (Isaiah 19:18.) It is intimated by these words,
that the worship of the true God, and the same profession of faith, will be
everywhere diffused. Of the Messiah it is predicted, that he shall have dominion
from east to west, and that all nations shall serve him.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;197208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
72:8,11.) We see also, that many passages to this purpose are quoted by the
apostles, not only from the later prophets, but from Moses. How could that be
hidden which had been proclaimed by so many heralds? Why are all without
exception pronounced to have been in ignorance? Shall we say, that the prophets
spake what they did not understand, and uttered sounds without
meaning?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I answer, the words of Paul must not be understood to
mean that there had been no knowledge at all on these subjects. There had always
been some of the Jewish nation who acknowledged that, at the advent of the
Messiah, the grace of God would be proclaimed throughout the whole world, and
who looked forward to the renovation of the human race. The prophets themselves,
though they spoke with the certainty of revelation, left the time and manner
undetermined. They knew that some communication of the grace of God would be
made to the Gentiles, but at what time, in what manner, and by what means it
should be accomplished, they had no information whatever. This ignorance was
exemplified in a remarkable way by the apostles. They had not only been
instructed by the predictions of the prophets, but had heard the distinct
statement of their Master, (John 10:16,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Other

<div><font face="Palatino">and yet the novelty of the subject prevented them
from understanding it fully. Nay, after they had received the
injunction,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Go

<div><font face="Palatino">they dreaded and recoiled from the calling of the
Gentiles as a proposal absolutely monstrous, because the manner of its
accomplishment was still unknown. Before the actual event arrived, they had dark
and confused apprehensions of our Savior&#8217;s words; for ceremonies
were</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">a

<div><font face="Palatino">With unquestionable propriety, therefore, does Paul
call this a <i>mystery,</i> and say, that it had been hidden; for the repeal of
the ceremonial law, which admitted them within the vail, was not
understood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As it is now
revealed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To lay claim to information which
none of the patriarchs, prophets, or holy kings, had possessed, might wear the
aspect of arrogance. To guard against this imputation, Paul reminds them, first,
that in this respect he was not alone, but shared the <i>revelation</i> with the
most eminent teachers of the church; and, secondly, that it was the gift of the
Holy Spirit, who has a right to bestow it on whom he pleases; for there is no
other limit of our knowledge but that which he assigns to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These few words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as it is now
revealed,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> throw additional light on the
admission of the Gentiles to be the people of God. It is on the condition that
they shall be placed on a level with the Jews, and form one body. That the
novelty might give no offense, he states that this must be accomplished
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the
gospel.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:6.) Now, the gospel was itself a novelty; for it had never till now been heard
of, and yet was acknowledged by all the godly to have come from heaven. Where,
then, was the wonder, if, in renewing the world, God should follow an unwonted
method?</font><br></div>

instrument employed in communicating grace to the Gentiles, he now adds, that he

general statements which had been made. But, to avoid claiming for himself more
than is proper, he affirms that it
is</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the gift of the grace of
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and that this gift was an exhibition of
divine <i>power.</i> As if he had said, &#8220;Inquire not what I have deserved;
for in the free exercise of kindness, the Lord made me an apostle of the
Gentiles, not for any excellence of mine, but by his own grace. Inquire not what
I formerly was; for it is the Lord&#8217;s prerogative to &#8216;exalt them of
low degree.&#8217;&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420152&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke

himself, and everything that belongs to him, in as humiliating a light as
possible, in order that the grace of God may be the more highly exalted. But
this acknowledgment had the additional effect of anticipating the objections
which his adversaries might bring against him. &#8220;Who is this man that God
should have raised him above all his brethren? What superior excellence did he
possess that he should be chosen in preference to all the others?&#8221; All
such comparisons of personal worth are set aside by the confession, that he
was</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the least of all the

<div><font face="Palatino">This is no hypocritical declaration. Most men are
ready enough to make professions of feigned humility, while their minds are
swelled with pride, and in words to acknowledge themselves inferior to every one
else, while they wish to be regarded with the highest esteem, and think
themselves entitled to the highest honor. Paul is perfectly sincere in admitting
his unworthiness; nay, at other times he speaks of himself in far more degrading
language.</font><br></div>

not prevent him from being appointed, while others were passed by, to be the
apostle of the Gentiles. <i>The grace of God given to me</i> is the expression
used by him, to intimate that it was a peculiar gift, as compared with what had
been bestowed on others. Not that he alone had been elected to discharge that
office, but that he held the highest rank among &#8220;the teachers of the

peculiar to himself.</font><br></div>

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians

God that his purpose, which had formerly been hidden, shall now be shared by
men. There is an appropriate metaphor in the words
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">fwti&gt;sai
pa&gt;ntav</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>to</i> <i>enlighten all men,</i>
&#8212; conveying the thought, that, in his apostleship, the grace of God shines

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which hath been hid in

the prejudice of novelty, &#8212; to oppose the rashness of men, who think it
improper that they should remain in ignorance of anything whatever. Who will
question the right which God has to keep his own purposes concealed, until he
shall be pleased to communicate them to men? What presumption, &#8212; yea, what
madness is it, not to admit that God is wiser than we! Let us remember,
therefore, that our rashness ought to receive a check, whenever the boundless
height of the Divine foreknowledge is presented to our view. This, too, is the
reason why he calls them <i>the unsearchable riches of Christ;</i> intimating
that this subject, though it exceeds our capacity, ought to be contemplated with
reverence and admiration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who created all things by Jesus
Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This cannot so properly be understood
of the first creation as of the spiritual renewal. It is, no doubt, true, and is
frequently declared in Scripture, that by the Word of God all things were
created; but the connection of the passage lays us under the necessity of
understanding by it that renewal which is comprehended in the blessing of
redemption. But it may, perhaps, be thought that the apostle is illustrating
this renewal, by an argument drawn from the creation. &#8220;By Christ, as God,
the Father created (John 1:3) all things; and why, then, should we wonder, if by
Christ, as Mediator, all the Gentiles are now brought back to one body?&#8221; I
have no objection to this view. A similar argument is used by him in another
Epistle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">For

<div><font face="Palatino">From the creation of the world he concludes, that it

Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That now to the principalities

words cannot apply to angels, because such ignorance, as is here supposed, could
not be found in those who are permitted to behold the brightness of God&#8217;s
countenance. They choose rather to refer them to devils, but without due
reflection; for what could have been regarded as extraordinary in the assertion,
that, by the preaching of the gospel and the calling of the Gentiles,
information was, for the first time, conveyed to devils? There can be no doubt
that the apostle labors to place in the strongest light the mercy of God toward
the Gentiles, and the high value of the gospel. For this purpose he declares,
that the preaching of the gospel exhibits the manifold grace of God, with which,
till now, the heavenly angels themselves were unacquainted. The wisdom of God,
therefore, which was manifested by uniting Jews and Gentiles in the fellowship
of the gospel, ought to be regarded by men with the highest
admiration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"> He calls it
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">polupoi&gt;kilon
sofi&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>manifold
wisdom,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> because men are accustomed to try it by
a false standard, confining their view to a particular department, and thus
forming a most inadequate conception of the whole. The Jews thought, for
example, that the dispensation under the law, with which they were acquainted
and familiar, was the only form in which the wisdom of God could be seen. But,
by making the gospel to be proclaimed to all men without exception, God has
brought forth to view another instance and proof of his wisdom. Not that it was
new wisdom, but that it was so large and <i>manifold,</i>
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb27</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as to
transcend our limited capacity. Let us rest assured that the knowledge, whatever
it may be, which we have acquired, is, after all, but a slender proportion. And
if the calling of the Gentiles draws the attention, and excites the reverence,
of angels in heaven, how shameful that it should be slighted or disdained by men
upon earth!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The inference which some draw from this passage, that
angels are present in our assemblies, and make progress along with ourselves in
knowledge, is a groundless speculation. We must always keep in view the purposes
for which God appointed the ministry of his word. If angels, who are permitted
to see the face of God, do not walk in faith, neither do they need the outward
administration of the word. The preaching of the gospel, therefore, is of no
service but to human beings, among whom alone the practice exists. Paul&#8217;s
meaning is this: &#8220;The church, composed both of Jews and Gentiles, is a
mirror, in which angels behold the astonishing wisdom of God displayed in a
manner unknown to them before. They see a work which is new to them, and the
reason of which was hid in God. In this manner, and not by learning anything
from the lips of men, do they make
progress.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the eternal

the objection, that the purpose of God has been changed! A third time, he
repeats that the decree was eternal and unchangeable, but must be carried into
effect by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ Jesus our
Lord,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> because in him it was made. Thus he
declares, that the proper time for publishing this decree belongs to the kingdom
of Christ. Literally the words run, &#8220;according to the eternal purpose
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">h{n
ejpoi&gt;hsoen</font><font face="Palatino">) <i>which he</i> <i>made.</i>&#8221;
But I consider the meaning to be,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which he
purposed;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> because the present discussion does
not relate solely to the execution of the decree, but to the appointment itself,
which, though it took place before all ages, was known to God only &#8212; till
the manifestation of Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Through whom we have
boldness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The honor of reconciling the Father
to the whole world must be given to Christ. From the effects of this grace its
excellence is demonstrated; for <i>faith,</i> which is possessed by Gentiles in
common with Jews, admits them into the presence of God. When the words,
<i>through Christ</i> and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the
faith of him,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> are used by Paul, in connection
with the name of God, there is always an implied contrast, which shuts up every
other approach, &#8212; which excludes every other method of obtaining Divine
fellowship. Most important and valuable instruction is here conveyed. The true
nature and power of faith, and the confidence which is necessary for calling
upon God, are beautifully expressed. That the consequences of faith, and the
duties which it performs, should be the subject of much controversy between us
and the Papists, is not surprising. They do not properly understand the meaning
of the word <i>Faith,</i> which they might learn from this passage, if they were
not blinded by prejudice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, Paul denominates it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the faith of
Christ;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> by which he intimates, that everything
which faith ought to contemplate is exhibited to us in Christ. Hence it follows,
that an empty and confused knowledge of Christ must not be mistaken for Faith,
but that knowledge which is directed to Christ, in order to seek God in Christ;
and this can only be done when the power and offices of Christ are
understood.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">
produces</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> confidence,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">which again, in its turn, produces
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>boldness.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
There are three stages in our progress. First, we believe the promises of God;
next, by relying on them, we obtain that <i>confidence,</i> which is accompanied
by holiness and peace of mind; and, last of all, comes <i>boldness,</i> which
enables us to banish fear, and to come with firmness and steadiness into the
presence of God.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>faith</i> from
<i>confidence</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">would be an attempt to take away heat and light
from the sun. I acknowledge, indeed, that, in proportion to the measure of
faith, confidence is small in some and greater in others; but faith will never
be found unaccompanied by these effects or fruits. A trembling, hesitating,
doubting conscience, will always be a sure evidence of unbelief; but a firm,
steady faith, will prove to be invincible against the gates of hell. To trust in
Christ as Mediator, and to entertain a firm conviction of our heavenly
Father&#8217;s love, &#8212; to venture boldly to promise to ourselves eternal
life, and not to tremble at death or hell, &#8212; is, to use a common phrase, a
holy presumption.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this
cause.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> His prayers for them are mentioned, not
only to testify his regard for them, but likewise to excite them to pray in the
same manner; for the seed of the word is scattered in vain, unless the Lord
render it fruitful by his blessing. Let pastors learn from Paul&#8217;s example,
not only to admonish and exhort their people, but to entreat the Lord to bless
their labors, that they may not be unfruitful. Nothing will be gained by their
industry and toil, &#8212; all their study and application will be to no
purpose, except so far as the Lord bestows his blessing. This ought not to be
regarded by them as an encouragement to sloth. It is their duty, on the
contrary, to labor earnestly in sowing and watering, provided they, at the same
time, ask and expect the increase from the Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are thus enabled to refute the slanders of the
Pelagians and Papists, who argue, that, if the grace of the Holy Spirit performs
the whole work of enlightening our minds, and forming our hearts to obedience,
all instruction will be superfluous. The only effect of the enlightening and
renewing influences of the Holy Spirit is, to give to instruction its proper
weight and efficacy, that we may not be blind to the light of heaven, or deaf to
the strains of truth. While the Lord alone acts upon us, he acts by his own
instruments. It is therefore the duty of pastors diligently to teach, &#8212; of
the people, earnestly to receive instruction, &#8212; and of both, not to weary
themselves in unprofitable exertions, but to look up for Divine
aid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I bow my
knees.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The bodily attitude is here put for the
religious exercise itself. Not that prayer, in all cases, requires the bending
of the knees, but because this expression of reverence is commonly employed,
especially where it is not an incidental petition, but a continued
prayer.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>

ou=</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>of whom,</i> may apply equally to the
Father and to the Son. Erasmus restricts it entirely to the Father. I do not
approve of this; for readers ought to have been allowed a liberty of choice;
nay, the other interpretation appears to be far more probable. The apostle
alludes to that relationship which the Jews had with each other, through their
father Abraham, to whom they trace their lineage. He proposes, on the contrary,
to remove the distinction between Jews and Gentiles; and tells them, not only
that all men have been brought into one family and one race through Christ, but
that they are enabled to claim kindred even with angels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To apply it to God the Father would not be equally
defensible, being liable to this obvious exception, that God formerly passed by
the Gentiles, and adopted the Jews as his peculiar people. But when we apply it
to Christ, the whole of Paul&#8217;s statement agrees with the facts; for all
come and blend together, as one family, and, related to one God the Father, are
mutually brethren. Let us therefore understand that, through the mediation of
Christ, a relationship has been constituted between Jews and Gentiles, because,
by reconciling us to the Father, he has made us all one. Jews have no longer any
reason to boast that they are the posterity of Abraham, or that they belong to
this or that tribe, &#8212; to despise others as profane, and claim the
exclusive honor of being a holy people. There is but one relationship which
ought to be reckoned, both in heaven and on earth, both among angels and among
men &#8212; a union to the body of Christ. Out of him all will be found
scattered. He alone is the bond by which we are
united.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he would give to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Paul wishes that the Ephesians should be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strengthened;</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and yet he had already bestowed on their piety no mean commendation. But
believers have never advanced so far as not to need farther growth. The highest
perfection of the godly in this life is an earnest desire to make progress. This
<i>strengthening,</i> he tells us, is the work of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit;</i></font><font face="Palatino">
so that it does not proceed from man&#8217;s own ability. The increase, as well
as the commencement, of everything good in us, comes from the Holy Spirit. That
it is the gift of Divine grace, is evident from the expression used,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he would give to
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This the Papists utterly deny. They
maintain that the <i>second</i> grace is bestowed upon us, according as we have
individually deserved it, by making a proper use of the <i>first</i> grace. But
let us unite with Paul in acknowledging that it is the &#8220;gift&#8221; of the
grace of God, not only that we have begun to run well, but that we advance; not
only that we have been born again, but that we grow from day to
day.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the riches of his
glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> These words are intended to express
still more strongly the doctrine of Divine grace. They may be explained in two
ways: either, <i>according to his glorious riches,</i> making the genitive,
agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, supply the place of an adjective, &#8212; or,
<i>according to his rich and abundant glory.</i> The word <i>glory</i> will thus
be put for <i>mercy,</i> in accordance with an expression which he had formerly
used, &#8220;to the praise of the glory of his grace.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:6) I prefer the latter view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the inner
man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By <i>the inner man,</i> Paul means the
soul, and whatever relates to the spiritual life of the soul; as the
<i>outward</i> man denotes the body, with everything that belongs to it, &#8212;
health, honors, riches, vigor, beauty, and everything of that nature.
&#8220;Though our outward man perish, yet our inward man is renewed day by
day;&#8221; that is, if in worldly matters we decay, our spiritual life becomes
more and more vigorous.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:16) The prayer of Paul, that the saints may be
<i>strengthened,</i> does not mean that they may be eminent and flourishing in
the world, but that, with respect to the kingdom of God, their minds may be made
strong by Divine power.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That Christ may

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Colossians
1:19,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">so he who has Christ dwelling in him can want
nothing. It is a mistake to imagine that the Spirit can be obtained without
obtaining Christ; and it is equally foolish and absurd to dream that we can
receive Christ without the Spirit. Both doctrines must be believed. We are
partakers of the Holy Spirit, in proportion to the intercourse which we maintain
with Christ; for the Spirit will be found nowhere but in Christ, on whom he is
said, on that account, to have rested; for he himself says, by the prophet
Isaiah, &#8220;The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me.&#8221; (Isaiah 61:1;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420418&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
4:18.) But neither can Christ be separated from his Spirit; for then he would be
said to be dead, and to have lost all his power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Justly, therefore, does Paul affirm that the persons
who are endowed by God with spiritual vigor are those in whom
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ
dwells.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He points to that part in which Christ
peculiarly dwells,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> in your
hearts,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; to show that it is not enough
if the knowledge of Christ dwell on the tongue or flutter in the
brain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>May dwell through
faith.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The method by which so great a benefit
is obtained is also expressed. What a remarkable commendation is here bestowed
on <i>faith,</i> that, by means of it, the Son of God becomes our own, and
&#8220;makes his abode with us!&#8221; (John 14:23.) By faith we not only
acknowledge that Christ suffered and rose from the dead on our account, but,
accepting the offers which he makes of himself, we possess and enjoy him as our
Savior. This deserves our careful attention. Most people consider fellowship
with Christ, and believing in Christ, to be the same thing; but the fellowship
which we have with Christ is the consequence of faith. In a word, faith is not a
distant view, but a warm embrace, of Christ, by which he dwells in us, and we
are filled with the Divine Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye may be rooted and grounded
in love.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Among the fruits of Christ&#8217;s
dwelling in us the apostle enumerates love and gratitude for the Divine grace
and kindness exhibited to us in Christ. Hence it follows, that this is true and
solid excellence; so that, whenever he treats of the perfection of the saints,
he views it as consisting of these two parts. The firmness and constancy which
our love ought to possess are pointed out by two metaphors. There are many
persons not wholly destitute of love; but it is easily removed or shaken,
because its roots are not deep. Paul desires that it should
be</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> rooted
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb31</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
and grounded,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; thoroughly fixed in our
minds, so as to resemble a well-founded building or deeply-planted tree. The
true meaning is, that our roots ought to be so deeply planted, and our
foundation so firmly laid in love, that nothing will be able to shake us. It is
idle to infer from these words, that love is the foundation and root of our
salvation. Paul does not inquire here, as any one may perceive, on what our
salvation is founded, but with what firmness and constancy we ought to continue
in the exercise of
love.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
May be able to comprehend.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The second fruit is,
that the Ephesians should perceive the greatness of Christ&#8217;s love to men.
Such an apprehension or knowledge springs from faith. By desiring that they
should comprehend it </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with all
saints,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he shows that it is the most excellent
blessing which they can obtain in the present life; that it is the highest
wisdom, to which all the children of God aspire. What follows is sufficiently
clear in itself, but has hitherto been darkened by a variety of interpretations.
Augustine is quite delighted with his own acuteness, which throws no light on
the subject. Endeavouring to discover some kind of mysterious allusion to the
figure of the cross, he makes the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>breadth</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to be love, &#8212; the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>height</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
hope, &#8212; the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>length,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
patience, and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>depth,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
humility. This is very ingenious and entertaining: but what has it to do with
Paul&#8217;s meaning? Not more, certainly, than the opinion of Ambrose, that the
allusion is to the figure of a sphere. Laying aside the views of others, I shall
state what will be universally acknowledged to be the simple and true
meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to know the love of
Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By those dimensions Paul means nothing
else than the love of Christ, of which he speaks afterwards. The meaning is,
that he who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knows</i></font><font face="Palatino">
it fully and perfectly is in every respect a wise man. As if he had said,
&#8220;In whatever direction men may look, they will find nothing in the
doctrine of salvation that does not bear some relation to this subject.&#8221;
The love of Christ contains within itself the whole of wisdom, so that the words
may run thus: </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that ye may be able
to comprehend the love of Christ, which is the length and breadth, and depth,
and height,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, the complete perfection of
all wisdom. The metaphor is borrowed from mathematicians, taking the parts as
expressive of the whole. Almost all men are infected with the disease of
desiring to obtain useless knowledge. It is of great importance that we should
be told what is necessary for us to know, and what the Lord desires us to
contemplate, above and below, on the right hand and on the left, before and
behind. The love of Christ is held out to us as the subject which ought to
occupy our daily and nightly meditations, and in which we ought to be wholly
plunged. He who is in possession of this alone has enough. Beyond it there is
nothing solid, nothing useful, &#8212; nothing, in short, that is proper or
sound. Though you survey the heaven and earth and sea, you will never go beyond
this without overstepping the lawful boundary of wisdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which surpasseth
knowledge.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> A similar expression occurs in
another Epistle:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the
peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and
minds through Christ
Jesus.</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">
</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Philippians
4:7)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">No man can approach to God without being raised above
himself and above the world. On this ground the sophists refuse to admit that we
can know with certainty that we enjoy the grace of God; for they measure faith
by the perception of the bodily senses. But Paul justly contends that this
wisdom exceeds all knowledge; for, if the faculties of man could reach it, the
prayer of Paul that God would bestow it must have been unnecessary. Let us
remember, therefore, that the certainty of faith is knowledge, but is acquired
by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, not by the acuteness of our own intellect.
If the reader desire a more full discussion of this subject, he may consult the
&#8220;Institutes of the Christian Religion.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye may be
filled.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Paul now expresses in one word what he
meant by the various dimensions. He who has Christ has everything necessary for
being made perfect in God; for this is the meaning of the
phrase,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the fullness of
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Men do certainly imagine that they have
entire completeness in themselves, but it is only when their pride is swelled
with empty trifles. It is a foolish and wicked dream, that by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fullness of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is meant the full Godhead, as if men were
raised to an equality with God.</font><br></div>

This refers to the future, and agrees with what we are taught concerning hope;
and indeed we cannot offer to God proper or sincere thanksgivings for favors
received, unless we are convinced that his goodness to us will be without end.
When he says that God is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>able</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he does not mean power viewed apart, as the phrase is, from the act, but power
which is exerted, and which we actually feel. Believers ought always to connect
it with the work, when the promises made to them, and their own salvation, form
the subject of inquiry. Whatever God can do, he unquestionably will do, if he
has promised it. This the apostle proves both by former instances, and by the
efficacy of the Spirit, which was at this very time exerted on their own
minds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the power that worketh
in us,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; according to what we feel within

stronger confidence for the

above all that we ask or think,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is a remarkable
expression, and bids us entertain no fear lest faith of a proper kind should go
to excess. Whatever expectations we form of Divine blessings, the infinite
goodness of God will exceed all our wishes and all our

<div><br><font face="Palatino">The three remaining chapters consist entirely of
practical exhortations. Mutual agreement is the first subject, in the course of
which a discussion is introduced respecting the government of the church, as
having been framed by our Lord for the purpose of maintaining unity among
Christians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I therefore, the prisoner of the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> His imprisonment, which might have been
supposed more likely to render him despised, is appealed to, as we have already
seen, for a confirmation of his authority. It was the seal of that embassy with
which he had been honored. Whatever belongs to Christ, though in the eyes of men
it may be attended by ignominy, ought to be viewed by us with the highest
regard. The apostle&#8217;s prison is more truly venerable than the splendid
retinue or triumphal chariot of kings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye may walk
worthy.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is a general sentiment, a sort of
preface, on which all the following statements are founded. He had formerly
illustrated </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the calling with
which they were called,
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
now reminds them that they must live in obedience to God, in order that they may
not be unworthy of such distinguished
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With all
humility</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now descends to particulars, and
first of all he mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>humility</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
The reason is, that he was about to enter on the subject of Unity, to which
humility is the first step. This again produces
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>meekness,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
which disposes us to bear with our brethren, and thus to preserve that unity
which would otherwise be broken a hundred times in a day. Let us remember,
therefore, that, in cultivating brotherly kindness, we must begin with humility.
Whence come rudeness, pride, and disdainful language towards brethren? Whence
come quarrels, insults, and reproaches? Come they not from this, that every one
carries his love of himself, and his regard to his own interests, to excess? By
laying aside haughtiness and a desire of pleasing ourselves, we shall become
meek and gentle, and acquire that moderation of temper which will overlook and
forgive many things in the conduct of our brethren. Let us carefully observe the
order and arrangement of these exhortations. It will be to no purpose that we
inculcate forbearance till the natural fierceness has been subdued, and mildness
acquired; and it will be equally vain to discourse of <i>meekness,</i> till we
have begun with <i>humility.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Forbearing one another in
love.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This agrees with what is elsewhere
taught, that &#8220;love suffereth long and is kind.&#8221; (1 Corinthians
13:4.) Where love is strong and prevalent, we shall perform many acts of mutual
forbearance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
With good reason does he recommend forbearance, as tending to promote the unity
of the Spirit. Innumerable offenses arise daily, which might produce quarrels,
particularly when we consider the extreme bitterness of man&#8217;s natural
temper. Some consider </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the unity
of the Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to mean that spiritual unity
which is produced in us by the Spirit of God. There can be no doubt that He
alone makes us &#8220;of one accord, of one mind,&#8221; (Philippians 2:2,) and
thus makes us one; but I think it more natural to understand the words as
denoting harmony of views. This unity, he tells us, is maintained by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the bond of
peace;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for disputes frequently give rise to
hatred and resentment. We must live at peace, if we would wish that brotherly
kindness should be permanent amongst
us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is one
body.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
proceeds to show more fully in how complete a manner Christians ought to be
united. The union ought to be such that we shall form <i>one body and one
soul.</i> These words denote the whole man. We ought to be united, not in part
only, but in body and soul. He supports this by a powerful argument,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as ye have been called in one
hope of your calling.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We are called to one
inheritance and one life; and hence it follows, that we cannot obtain eternal
life without living in mutual harmony in this world. One Divine invitation being
addressed to all, they ought to be united in the same profession of faith, and
to render every kind of assistance to each other. Oh, were this thought deeply
impressed upon our minds, that we are subject to a law which no more permits the
children of God to differ among themselves than the kingdom of heaven to be
divided, how earnestly should we cultivate brotherly kindness! How should we
dread every kind of animosity, if we duly reflected that all who separate us
from brethren, estrange us from the kingdom of God! And yet, strangely enough,
while we forget the duties which brethren owe to each other, we go on boasting
that we are the sons of God. Let us learn from Paul, that none are at all fit
for that inheritance who are not one body and one
spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In the first Epistle to the Corinthians,
he employs the word

to denote simply the government of God.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">There

Corinthians 12:5)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the present instance, as he shortly afterwards
makes express mention of the Father, he gives this appellation strictly to
Christ, who has been appointed by the Father to be <i>our Lord,</i> and to whose
government we cannot be subject, unless we are of one mind. The frequent
repetition of the word <i>one</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">is emphatic. <i>Christ</i> cannot be divided.
<i>Faith</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">cannot be rent. There are not various
<i>baptisms,</i> but one which is common to all. <i>God</i> cannot cease to be
<i>one,</i> and unchangeable. It cannot but be our duty to cherish holy unity,
which is bound by so many ties. Faith, and baptism, and God the Father, and
Christ, ought to unite us, so as almost to become one man. All these arguments
for unity deserve to be pondered, but cannot be fully explained. I reckon it
enough to take a rapid glance at the apostle&#8217;s meaning, leaving the full
illustration of it to the preachers of the gospel. The unity of <i>faith,</i>
which is here mentioned, depends on the one, eternal truth of God, on which it
is founded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One
baptism,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This does not mean that Christian
baptism is not to be administered more than once, but that one baptism is common
to all; so that, by means of it, we begin to form one body and one soul. But if
that argument has any force, a much stronger one will be founded on the truth,
that the Father, and Son, and Spirit, are one God; for it is one baptism, which
is celebrated in the name of the Three Persons. What reply will the Arians or
Sabellians make to this argument? Baptism possesses such force as to make us
one; and in baptism, the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit,
is invoked. Will they deny that one Godhead is the foundation of this holy and
mysterious unity? We are compelled to acknowledge, that the ordinance of baptism
proves the existence of Three Persons in one Divine
essence.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One God and Father of
all.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the main argument, from which all
the rest flow. How comes it that we are united by faith, by baptism, or even by
the government of Christ, but because God the Father, extending to each of us
his gracious presence, employs these means for gathering us to himself? The two
phrases, </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpi&lt; pa&gt;ntwn
kai&lt; dia&lt; pa&gt;ntwn</font><font face="Palatino">, may either mean,
<i>above all and through all</i> THINGS, or <i>above all</i> <i>and through
all</i> MEN. Either meaning will apply sufficiently well, or rather, in both
cases, the meaning will be the same. Although God by his power upholds, and
maintains, and rules, all things, yet Paul is not now speaking of the universal,
but of the spiritual government which belongs to the church. By the Spirit of
sanctification, God spreads himself through all the members of the church,
embraces all in his government, and dwells in all; but God is not inconsistent
with himself, and therefore we cannot but be united to him into one
body.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This spiritual unity is mentioned by our
Lord.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Holy Father, keep
through thine own name those whom thou hast, given me, that they may be one as
we
are.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(John</font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">17:11)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is true indeed, in a general sense, not only of
all men but of all creatures. &#8220;In him we live, and move, and have our
being.&#8221; (Acts 17:28.) And again, &#8220;Do not I fill heaven and earth,

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;242324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
23:24.) But we must attend to the connection in which this passage stands. Paul
is now illustrating the mutual relation of believers, which has nothing in
common either with wicked men or with inferior animals. To this relation we must
limit what is said about God&#8217;s government and presence. It is for this
reason, also, that the apostle uses the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father,</i></font><font face="Palatino">

and it is only by communicating with each other, that all enjoy what is

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore he

Paul has departed not a little from the true meaning of this quotation. Wicked
men charge him with having made an unfair use of Scripture. The Jews go still
farther, and, for the sake of giving to their accusations a greater air of
plausibility, maliciously pervert the natural meaning of this passage. What is
said of God, is applied by them to David or to the people. &#8220;David, or the
people,&#8221; they say, &#8220;ascended on high, when, in consequence of many
victories, they rose superior to their enemies.&#8221; But a careful examination
of the Psalm will convince any reader that the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he ascended up on
high,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> are applied strictly to God
alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The whole Psalm may be regarded as an
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpi&gt;nikion</font><font face="Palatino">,
a song of triumph, which David sings to God on account of the victories which he
had obtained; but, taking occasion from the narrative of his own exploits, he
makes a passing survey of the astonishing deliverances which the Lord had
formerly wrought for his people. His object is to shew, that we ought to
contemplate in the history of the Church the glorious power and goodness of God;
and among other things he says, <i>Thou hast ascended on high.</i>
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;196818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
68:18.) The flesh is apt to imagine that God remains idle and asleep, when he
does not openly execute his judgments. To the view of men, when the Church is
oppressed, God is in some manner humbled; but, when he stretches out his
avenging arm for her deliverance, he then appears to rouse himself, and to
ascend his throne of judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Then
the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by
reason of wine. And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts; he put them to a

78:65, 66.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This mode of expression is sufficiently common and
familiar; and, in short, the deliverance of the Church is here called the
<i>ascension</i> of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Perceiving that it is a song of triumph, in which
David celebrates all the victories which God had wrought for the salvation of
his Church, Paul very properly quoted the account given of God&#8217;s
ascension, and applied it to the person of Christ. The noblest triumph which God
ever gained was when Christ, after subduing sin, conquering death, and putting
Satan to flight, rose majestically to heaven, that he might exercise his
glorious reign over the Church. Hitherto there is no ground for the objection,
that Paul has applied this quotation in a manner inconsistent with the design of
the Psalmist. The continued existence of the Church is represented by David to
be a manifestation of the Divine glory. But no ascension of God more triumphant
or memorable will ever occur, than that which took place when Christ was carried
up to the right hand of the Father, that he might rule over all authorities and
powers, and might become the everlasting guardian and protector of his
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He led captivity
captive.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Captivity</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">is a collective noun for <i>captive enemies;</i>
and the plain meaning is, that God reduced his enemies to subjection, which was
more fully accomplished in Christ than in any other way. He has not only gained
a complete victory over the devil, and sin, and death, and all the power of
hell, &#8212; but out of rebels he forms every day &#8220;a willing
people,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B003&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
110:3,) when he subdues by his word the obstinacy of our flesh. On the other
hand, his enemies &#8212; to which class all wicked men belong &#8212; are held
bound by chains of iron, and are restrained by his power from exerting their
fury beyond the limits which he shall assign.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And gave gifts to
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is rather more difficulty in this
clause; for the words of the Psalm are, &#8220;thou hast <i>received</i> gifts
for men,&#8221; while the apostle changes this expression into
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gave
gifts,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and thus appears to exhibit an opposite
meaning. Still there is no absurdity here; for Paul does not always quote the
exact words of Scripture, but, after referring to the passage, satisfies himself
with conveying the substance of it in his own language. Now, it is clear that
the <i>gifts</i> which David mentions were not <i>received</i> by God for
himself, but for his people; and accordingly we are told, in an earlier part of
the Psalm, that &#8220;the spoil&#8221; had been &#8220;divided&#8221; among the
families of Israel.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;196812&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
68:12.) Since therefore the intention of <i>receiving</i> was to <i>give</i>
gifts, Paul can hardly be said to have departed from the substance, whatever
alteration there may be in the words.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, I am inclined to a different
opinion, that Paul purposely changed the word, and employed it, not as taken out
of the Psalm, but as an expression of his own, adapted to the present occasion.
Having quoted from the Psalm a few words descriptive of Christ&#8217;s
ascension, he adds, in his own language,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and gave
gifts,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; for the purpose of drawing a
comparison between the greater and the less. Paul intends to shew, that this
ascension of God in the person of Christ was far more illustrious than the
ancient triumphs of the Church; because it is a more honorable distinction for a
conqueror to dispense his bounty largely to all classes, than to gather spoils
from the vanquished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The interpretation given by some, that Christ
received from the Father what he would distribute to us, is forced, and utterly
at variance with the apostle&#8217;s purpose. No solution of the difficulty, in
my opinion, is more natural than this. Having made a brief quotation from the
Psalm, Paul took the liberty of adding a statement, which, though not contained
in the Psalm, is true in reference to Christ &#8212; a statement, too, by which
the ascension of Christ is proved to be more illustrious, and more worthy of
admiration, than those ancient manifestations of the Divine glory which David
enumerates.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Now that he ascended.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here again the slanderers
exclaim, that Paul&#8217;s reasoning is trifling and childish. &#8220;Why does
he attempt to make those words apply to a real ascension of Christ, which were
figuratively spoken about a manifestation of the Divine glory? Who does not know
that the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ascend</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is metaphorical? The conclusion,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he also descended first,</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">has therefore no weight.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I answer, Paul does not here reason in the manner of
a logician, as to what necessarily follows, or may be inferred, from the words
of the prophet. He knew that what David spake about God&#8217;s ascension was
metaphorical. But neither can it be denied, that the expression bears a
reference to some kind of humiliation on the part of God which had previously
existed. It is this humiliation which Paul justly infers from the declaration
that God had ascended. And at what time did God descend lower than when Christ
<i>emptied himself?</i> (</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue"> jAll j
eJauto&lt;n ejke&gt;nwse</font><font face="Palatino">, Philippians 2:7.) If ever
there was a time when, after appearing to lay aside the brightness of his power,
God ascended gloriously, it was when Christ was raised from our lowest condition
on earth, and received into heavenly glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, it is not necessary to inquire very
carefully into the literal exposition of the Psalm, since Paul merely alludes to
the prophet&#8217;s words, in the same manner as, on another occasion, he
accommodates to his own subject a passage taken from the writings of Moses.
&#8220;The righteousness which is of faith speaketh in this manner, Say not in
thine heart, who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from
above;) or, who shall descend into the deep (that is, to bring up Christ again
from the dead.&#8221;)
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:6,7
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
30:12.) But the appropriateness of the application which Paul makes of the
passage to the person of Christ is not the only ground on which it must be
defended. Sufficient evidence is afforded by the Psalm itself, that this
ascription of praise relates to Christ&#8217;s kingdom. Not to mention other
reasons which might be urged, it contains a distinct prophecy of the calling of
the Gentiles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Into the lower parts of the earth.
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb35</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
These words mean nothing more than the condition of the present life. To torture
them so as to make them mean purgatory or hell, is exceedingly foolish. The
argument taken from the comparative degree, &#8220;the <i>lower</i>
parts,&#8221; is quite untenable. A comparison is drawn, not between one part of
the earth and another, but between the whole earth and heaven; as if he had
said, that from that lofty habitation Christ descended into our deep
gulf.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ascended up far above all
heavens;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, beyond this created world.
When Christ is said to be in heaven, we must not view him as dwelling among the
spheres and numbering the stars. Heaven denotes a place higher than all the
spheres, which was assigned to the Son of God after his resurrection.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb36</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Not
that it is literally a place beyond the world, but we cannot speak of the
kingdom of God without using our ordinary language. Others, again, considering
that the expressions, <i>above all heavens,</i> and <i>ascension into
heaven,</i> are of the same import, conclude that Christ is not separated from
us by distance of place. But one point they have overlooked. When Christ is
placed above the heavens, or in the heavens, all that surrounds the earth
&#8212; all that lies beneath the sun and stars, beneath the whole frame of the
visible world &#8212; is excluded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he might fill all
things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> <i>To fill</i> often signifies to
Finish, and it might have that meaning here; for, by his ascension into heaven,
Christ entered into the possession of the authority given to him by the Father,
that he might rule and govern all things. But a more beautiful view, in my
opinion, will be obtained by connecting two meanings which, though apparently
contradictory, are perfectly consistent. When we hear of the ascension of
Christ, it instantly strikes our minds that he is removed to a great distance
from us; and so he actually is, with respect to his body and human presence. But
Paul reminds us, that, while he is removed from us in bodily presence, he
<i>fills all things</i> by the power of his Spirit. Wherever the right hand of
God, which embraces heaven and earth, is displayed, Christ is spiritually
present by his boundless power; although, as respects his body, the saying of
Peter holds true, that</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the
heaven must receive him until the times of restitution of all things, which God
hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world

<div><font face="Palatino">By alluding to the seeming contradiction, the apostle
has added not a little beauty to his language.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He

bounded by a little space, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>might

<div><br><font face="Palatino">He returns to explain the distribution of gifts,
and illustrates at greater length what he had slightly hinted, that out of this
variety arises unity in the church, as the various tones in music produce sweet
melody. The meaning may be thus summed up. &#8220;The external ministry of the
word is also commended, on account of the advantages which it yields. Certain
men appointed to that office, are employed in preaching the gospel. This is the
arrangement by which the Lord is pleased to govern his church, to maintain its
existence, and ultimately to secure its highest
perfection.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may excite surprise, that, when the gifts of the
Holy Spirit form the subject of discussion, Paul should enumerate offices
instead of gifts. I reply, when men are called by God, gifts are necessarily
connected with offices. God does not confer on men the mere name of Apostles or
Pastors, but also endows them with gifts, without which they cannot properly
discharge their office. He whom God has appointed to be an apostle does not bear
an empty and useless title; for the divine command, and the ability to perform
it, go together. Let us now examine the words in detail.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And he gave.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The government of the church, by
the preaching of the word, is first of all declared to be no human contrivance,
but a most sacred ordinance of Christ. The apostles did not appoint themselves,
but were chosen by Christ; and, at the present day, true pastors do not rashly
thrust themselves forward by their own judgment, but are raised up by the Lord.
In short, the government of the church, by the ministry of the word, is not a
contrivance of men, but an appointment made by the Son of God. As his own
unalterable law, it demands our assent. They who reject or despise this ministry
offer insult and rebellion to Christ its Author. It is himself who
<i>gave</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">them; for, if he does not raise them up, there will
be none. Another inference is, that no man will be fit or qualified for so
distinguished an office who has not been formed and moulded by the hand of
Christ himself. To Christ we owe it that we have ministers of the gospel, that
they abound in necessary qualifications, that they execute the trust committed
to them. All, all is his <i>gift.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Some,
apostles.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The different names and offices
assigned to different persons take their rise from that diversity of the members
which goes to form the completeness of the whole body, &#8212; every ground of
emulation, and envy, and ambition, being thus removed. If every person shall
display a selfish character, shall strive to outshine his neighbor, and shall
disregard all concerns but his own, &#8212; or, if more eminent persons shall be
the object of envy to those who occupy a lower place, &#8212; in each, and in
all of these cases, gifts are not applied to their proper use. He therefore
reminds them, that the gifts bestowed on individuals are intended, not to be
held for their personal and separate interests, but to be employed for the
benefit of the whole. Of the offices which are here enumerated, we have already
spoken at considerable length,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb38</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
shall now say nothing more than the exposition of the passage seems to demand.
Five classes of office-bearers are mentioned, though on this point, I am aware,
there is a diversity of opinion; for some consider the two last to make but one
office. Leaving out of view the opinions of others, I shall proceed to state my
own.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I take the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>apostles</i></font><font face="Palatino">
not in that general sense which the derivation of the term might warrant, but in
its own peculiar signification, for those highly favored persons whom Christ
exalted to the highest honor. Such were the twelve, to whose number Paul was
afterwards added. Their office was to spread the doctrine of the gospel
throughout the whole world, to plant churches, and to erect the kingdom of
Christ. They had not churches of their own committed to them; but the injunction
given to all of them was, to preach the gospel wherever they
went.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Next to them come the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Evangelists,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
who were closely allied in the nature of their office, but held an inferior
rank. To this class belonged Timothy and others; for, while Paul mentions them
along with himself in the salutations of his epistles, he does not speak of them
as his companions in the apostleship, but claims this name as peculiarly his
own. The services in which the Lord employed them were auxiliary to those of the
apostles, to whom they were next in rank.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To these two classes the apostle adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prophets.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
By this name some understand those persons who possessed the gift of predicting
future events, among whom was Agabus. (Acts 11:28; 21:10.) But, for my own part,
as doctrine is the present subject, I would rather define the word
<i>prophets,</i> as on a former occasion,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> to mean
distinguished interpreters of prophecies, who, by a remarkable gift of
revelation, applied them to the subjects which they had occasion to handle; not
excluding, however, the gift of prophecy, by which their doctrinal instruction
was usually accompanied.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pastors and
Teachers</i></font><font face="Palatino"> are supposed by some to denote one
office, because the apostle does not, as in the other parts of the verse, say,
<i>and some, pastors; and some, teachers;</i> but,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tou&lt;v de&lt;, poime&gt;nav
kai&lt; didaska&gt;louv</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and some, pastors and
teachers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Chrysostom and Augustine are
of this opinion; not to mention the commentaries of Ambrose, whose observations
on the subject are truly childish and unworthy of himself. I partly agree with
them, that Paul speaks indiscriminately of pastors and teachers as belonging to
one and the same class, and that the name
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>teacher</i></font><font face="Palatino">
does, to some extent, apply to all
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pastors.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
But this does not appear to me a sufficient reason why two offices, which I find
to differ from each other, should be confounded. Teaching is, no doubt, the duty
of all pastors; but to maintain sound doctrine requires a talent for
interpreting Scripture, and a man may be a <i>teacher</i> who is not qualified
to preach.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pastors,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
in my opinion, are those who have the charge of a particular flock; though I
have no objection to their receiving the name of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>teachers,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
if it be understood that there is a distinct class of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>teachers,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
who preside both in the education of pastors and in the instruction of the whole
church. It may sometimes happen, that the same person is both a pastor and a
teacher, but the duties to be performed are entirely different.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It deserves attention, also, that, of the five
offices which are here enumerated, not more than the last two are intended to be
perpetual. Apostles, Evangelists, and Prophets were bestowed on the church for a
limited time only, &#8212; except in those cases where religion has fallen into
decay, and evangelists are raised up in an extraordinary manner, to restore the
pure doctrine which had been lost. But without Pastors and Teachers there can be
no government of the church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Papists have some reason to complain, that their
primacy, of which they boast so much, is openly insulted in this passage. The
subject of discussion is the unity of the church. Paul inquires into the means
by which its continuance is secured, and the outward expressions by which it is
promoted, and comes at length to the government of the church. If he knew a
primacy which had a fixed residence, was it not his duty, for the benefit of the
whole church, to exhibit one ministerial head placed over all the members, under
whose government we are collected into one body? We must either charge Paul with
inexcusable neglect and foolishness, in leaving out the most appropriate and
powerful argument, or we must acknowledge that this primacy is at variance with
the appointment of Christ. In truth, he plainly rejects it as without
foundation, when he ascribes superiority to Christ alone, and represents the
apostles, and all the pastors, as indeed inferior to Him, but associated on an
equal level with each other. There is no passage of Scripture by which that
tyrannical hierarchy, regulated by one earthly head, is more completely
overturned. Paul has been followed by Cyprian, who gives a short and clear
definition of what forms the only lawful monarchy in the church. There is, he
says, one <i>bishoprick,</i> which unites the various parts into one whole. This
<i>bishoprick</i> he claims for Christ alone, leaving the administration of it
to individuals, but in a united capacity, no one being permitted to exalt
himself above others.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the renewing of the
saints.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In this version I follow Erasmus, not
because I prefer his view, but to allow the reader an opportunity of comparing
his version with the Vulgate and with mine, and then choosing for himself. The
old translation was, (<i>ad</i> <i>consummationem,</i>) <i>for the
completeness.</i> The Greek word employed by Paul is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">katartismo&gt;v</font><font face="Palatino">,
which signifies literally the <i>adaptation</i> of things possessing symmetry
and proportion; just as, in the human body, the members are united in a proper
and regular manner; so that the word comes to signify
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>perfection.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
But as Paul intended to express here a just and orderly arrangement, I prefer
the word (<i>constitutio</i>) <i>settlement</i> or <i>constitution,</i> taking
it in that sense in which a commonwealth, or kingdom, or province, is said to be
<i>settled,</i> when confusion gives place to the regular administration of
law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the work of the
ministry.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> God might himself have performed this
work, if he had chosen; but he has committed it to
the</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
ministry</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of men. This is intended to anticipate
an objection. &#8220;Cannot the church be constituted and properly arranged,
without the instrumentality of men?&#8221; Paul asserts that a <i>ministry</i>
is required, because such is the will of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the edifying of the body of
Christ.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the same thing with what he had
formerly denominated the <i>settlement</i>
or</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> perfecting of the
saints.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Our true completeness and perfection
consist in our being united in the one body of Christ. No language more highly
commendatory of the ministry of the word could have been employed, than to
ascribe to it this effect. What is more excellent than to produce the true and
complete perfection of the church? And yet this work, so admirable and divine,
is here declared by the apostle to be accomplished by the external ministry of
the word. That those who neglect this instrument should hope to become perfect
in Christ is utter madness. Yet such are the fanatics, on the one hand, who
pretend to be favored with secret revelations of the Spirit, &#8212; and proud
men, on the other, who imagine that to them the private reading of the
Scriptures is enough, and that they have no need of the ordinary ministry of the
church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If the edification of the church proceeds from Christ
alone, he has surely a right to prescribe in what manner it shall be edified.
But Paul expressly states, that, according to the command of Christ, no real
union or perfection is attained, but by the outward preaching. We must allow
ourselves to be ruled and taught by men. This is the universal rule, which
extends equally to the highest and to the lowest. The church is the common
mother of all the godly, which bears, nourishes, and brings up children to God,
kings and peasants alike; and this is done by the ministry. Those who neglect or
despise this order choose to be wiser than Christ. Woe to the pride of such men!
It is, no doubt, a thing in itself possible that divine influence alone should
make us perfect without human assistance. But the present inquiry is not what
the power of God can accomplish, but what is the will of God and the appointment
of Christ. In employing human instruments for accomplishing their salvation, God
has conferred on men no ordinary favor. Nor can any exercise be found better
adapted to promote unity than to gather around the common doctrine &#8212; the
standard of our General.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Till we all
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Paul had already said, that by the
ministry of men the church is regulated and governed, so as to attain the
highest perfection. But his commendation of the ministry is now carried farther.
The necessity for which he had pleaded is not confined to a single day, but
continues to the end. Or, to speak more plainly, he reminds his readers that the
use of the ministry is not temporal, like that of a school for children,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">paidagwgi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480324&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:24,) but constant, so long as we remain in the world. Enthusiasts dream that
the use of the ministry ceases as soon as we have been led to Christ. Proud men,
who carry their desire of knowledge beyond what is proper, look down with
contempt on the elementary instruction of childhood. But Paul maintains that we
must persevere in this course till all our deficiencies are supplied; that we
must make progress till death, under the teaching of Christ alone; and that we
must not be ashamed to be the scholars of the church, to which Christ has
committed our education.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the unity of the
faith.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But ought not the unity of the faith to
reign among us from the very commencement? It does reign, I acknowledge, among
the sons of God, but not so perfectly as to make them <i>come</i>
<i>together.</i> Such is the weakness of our nature, that it is enough if every
day brings some nearer to others, and all nearer to Christ. The expression,
<i>coming together,</i> denotes that closest union to which we still aspire, and
which we shall never reach, until this garment of the flesh, which is always
accompanied by some remains of ignorance and weakness, shall have been laid
aside.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And of the knowledge of the Son of
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This clause appears to be added for the
sake of explanation. It was the apostle&#8217;s intention to explain what is the
nature of true faith, and in what it consists; that is, when the Son of God is
known. To the Son of God alone faith ought to look; on him it relies; in him it
rests and terminates. If it proceed farther, it will disappear, and will no
longer be faith, but a delusion. Let us remember, that true faith confines its
view so entirely to Christ, that it neither knows, nor desires to know, anything
else.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Into a perfect
man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This must be read in immediate connection
with what goes before; as if he had said, &#8220;What is the highest perfection
of Christians? How is that perfection attained?&#8221; Full manhood is found in
Christ; for foolish men do not, in a proper manner, seek their perfection in
Christ. It ought to be held as a fixed principle among us, that all that is out
of Christ is hurtful and destructive. Whoever is a man in Christ, is, in every
respect, a perfect man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The AGE of
fullness</i></font><font face="Palatino"> means &#8212; full or mature age. No
mention is made of old age, for in the Christian progress no place for it is
found. Whatever becomes old has a tendency to decay; but the vigor of this
spiritual life is continually
advancing.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That we may be no more
children.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Having spoken of that perfect
manhood, towards which we are proceeding throughout the whole course of our
life, he reminds us that, during such a progress, we ought not to resemble
children. An intervening period is thus pointed out between childhood and
man&#8217;s estate. Those are &#8220;children&#8221; who have not yet advanced a
step in the way of the Lord, but who still hesitate, &#8212; who have not yet
determined what road they ought to choose, but move sometimes in one direction
and sometimes in another, always doubtful, always wavering. Those, again, who
are thoroughly founded in the doctrine of Christ, though not yet perfect, have
so much wisdom and vigor as to choose properly, and proceed steadily, in the
right course. Thus we find that the life of believers, marked by a constant
desire and progress towards those attainments which they shall ultimately reach,
bears a resemblance to youth. At no period of this life are we men. But let not
such a statement be carried to the other extreme, as if there were no progress
beyond childhood. After being born to Christ, we ought to grow, so as &#8220;not
to be children in understanding.&#8221; (1 Corinthians 14:20.) Hence it appears
what kind of Christianity the Popish system must be, when the pastors labor, to
the utmost of their power, to keep the people in absolute
infancy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tossed to and fro, and carried
about.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The distressing hesitation of those who
do not place absolute reliance on the word of the Lord, is illustrated by two
striking metaphors. The first is taken from small ships, exposed to the fury of
the billows in the open sea, holding no fixed course, guided neither by skill
nor design, but hurried along by the violence of the tempest. The next is taken
from straws, or other light substances, which are carried hither and thither as
the wind drives them, and often in opposite directions. Such must be the
changeable and unsteady character of all who do not rest on the foundation of
God&#8217;s eternal truth. It is their just punishment for looking, not to God,
but to men. Paul declares, on the other hand, that faith, which rests on the
word of God, stands unshaken against all the attacks of Satan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By every wind of
doctrine.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By a beautiful metaphor, all the
doctrines of men, by which we are drawn away from the simplicity of the gospel,
are called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>winds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
God gave us his word, by which we might have placed ourselves beyond the
possibility of being moved; but, giving way to the contrivances of men, we are
carried about in all directions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the cunning of
men.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There will always be impostors, who make
insidious attacks upon our faith; but, if we are fortified by the truth of God,
their efforts will be unavailing. Both parts of this statement deserve our
careful attention. When new sects, or wicked tenets, spring up, many persons
become alarmed. But the attempts of Satan to darken, by his falsehoods, the pure
doctrine of Christ, are at no time interrupted; and it is the will of God that
these struggles should be the trial of our faith. When we are informed, on the
other hand, that the best and readiest defense against every kind of error is to
bring forward that doctrine which we have learned from Christ and his apostles,
this surely is no ordinary consolation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With what awful wickedness, then, are Papists
chargeable, who take away from the word of God everything like certainty, and
maintain that there is no steadiness of faith, but what depends on the authority
of men! If a man entertain any doubt, it is in vain to bid him consult the word
of God: he must abide by their decrees. But we have embraced the law, the
prophets, and the gospel. Let us therefore confidently expect that we shall reap
the advantage which is here promised, &#8212; that all the impostures of men
will do us no harm. They will attack us, indeed, but they will not prevail. We
are entitled, I acknowledge, to look for the dispensation of sound doctrine from
the church, for God has committed it to her charge; but when Papists avail
themselves of the disguise of the church for burying doctrine, they give
sufficient proof that they have a diabolical synagogue.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kubei&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
which I have translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cunning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
is taken from players at dice, who are accustomed to practice many arts of
deception. The words, </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn
panourgi&gt;a|</font><font face="Palatino">, <i>by craftiness,</i> intimate that
the ministers of Satan are deeply skilled in imposture; and it is added, that
they keep watch, in order to insnare,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pro&lt;v th&lt;n meqodei&gt;an
th~v pla&gt;nhv</font><font face="Palatino">.) All this should rouse and sharpen
our minds to profit by the word of God. If we neglect to do so, we may fall into
the snares of our enemies, and endure the severe punishment of our
sloth.</font><br></div>

in the truth.</i>
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Though
we have not arrived at man&#8217;s estate, we ought at least, as we have already
said, to be advanced children. The truth of God ought to have such a firm hold
of us, that all the contrivances and attacks of Satan shall not draw us from our
course; and yet, as we have not hitherto attained full and complete strength, we
must make progress until death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He points out the design of this progress, that
Christ may be <i>the head</i>, &#8220;that in all things he may have the
pre-eminence,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:18,) and that in him alone we may grow in vigor or in stature. Again, we see
that no man is excepted; all are enjoined to be subject, and to take their own
places in the body.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What aspect then does Popery present, but that of a
crooked, deformed person? Is not the whole symmetry of the church destroyed,
when one man, acting in opposition to the head, refuses to be reckoned one of
the members? The Papists deny this, and allege that the Pope is nothing more
than a ministerial head. But such cavils do them no service. The tyranny of
their idol must be acknowledged to be altogether inconsistent with that order
which Paul here recommends. In a word, a healthful condition of the church
requires that Christ alone &#8220;must increase,&#8221; and all others
&#8220;must decrease.&#8221; (John 3:30.) Whatever increase we obtain must be
regulated in such a manner, that we shall remain in our own place, and
contribute to exalt the head.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he bids us give heed to the truth <i>in
love,</i> he uses the preposition <i>in</i>,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn</font><font face="Palatino">,)
like the corresponding Hebrew preposition
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino">,
(<i>beth</i>,) as signifying <i>with</i>, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>speaking the truth With
love</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If each
individual, instead of attending exclusively to his own concerns, shall desire
mutual intercourse, there will be agreeable and general progress. Such, the
Apostle assures us, must be the nature of this harmony, that men shall not be
suffered to forget the claims of truth, or, disregarding them, to frame an
agreement according to their own views. This proves the wickedness of the
Papists, who lay aside the word of God, and labor to force our compliance with
their decisions.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From whom the whole
body.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> All our increase should tend to exalt
more highly the glory of Christ. This is now proved by the best possible reason.
It is he who supplies all our wants, and without whose protection we cannot be
safe. As the root conveys sap to the whole tree, so all the vigor which we
possess must flow to us from Christ. There are three things here which deserve
our attention. The first is what has now been stated. All the life or health
which is diffused through the members flows from the head; so that the members
occupy a subordinate rank. The second is, that, by the distribution made, the
limited share of each renders the communication between all the members
absolutely necessary. The third is, that, without mutual love, the health of the
body cannot be maintained. Through the members, as canals, is conveyed from the
head all that is necessary for the nourishment of the body. While this
connection is upheld, the body is alive and healthy. Each member, too, has its
own proper share, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the effectual
working in the measure of every part.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lastly, he shows that by love the church is edified,
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the edifying of itself
in love.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This means that no increase is
advantageous, which does not bear a just proportion to the whole body. That man
is mistaken who desires his own separate growth. If a leg or arm should grow to
a prodigious size, or the mouth be more fully distended, would the undue
enlargement of those parts be otherwise than injurious to the whole frame? In
like manner, if we wish to be considered members of Christ, let no man be
anything for himself, but let us all be whatever we are for the benefit of each
other. This is accomplished by love; and where it does not reign, there is no
&#8220;edification,&#8221; but an absolute scattering of the
church.</font><br></div>

This I say therefore.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That government which
Christ has appointed for the edification of his church has now been considered.
He next inquires what fruits the doctrine of the gospel ought to yield in the
lives of Christians; or, if you prefer it, he begins to explain minutely the
nature of that edification by which doctrine ought to be
followed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye henceforth walk not in
vanity.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He first exhorts them to renounce the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vanity</i></font><font face="Palatino">
of unbelievers, arguing from its inconsistency with their present views. That
those who have been taught in the school of Christ, and enlightened by the
doctrine of salvation, should follow vanity, and in no respect differ from those
unbelieving and blind nations on whom no light of truth has ever shone, would be
singularly foolish. On this ground he very properly calls upon them to
demonstrate, by their life, that they had gained some advantage by becoming the
disciples of Christ. To impart to his exhortation the greater earnestness, he
beseeches them by the name of God, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this I say and testify in the
Lord,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb42</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212;
reminding them, that, if they despised this instruction, they must one day give
an account.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As other Gentiles
walk.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He means those who had not yet been
converted to Christ. But, at the same time, he reminds the Ephesians how
necessary it was that they should repent, since by nature they resembled lost
and condemned men. The miserable and shocking condition of other nations is held
out as the motive to a change of disposition. He asserts that believers differ
from unbelievers; and points out, as we shall see, the causes of this
difference. With regard to the former, he accuses their mind of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vanity:</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and let us remember, that he speaks generally of all who have not been renewed
by the Spirit of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the vanity of their
mind.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Now, <i>the mind</i> holds the highest
rank in the human constitution, is the seat of reason, presides over the will,
and restrains sinful desires; so that our theologians of the <i>Sorbonne</i> are
in the habit of calling her the Queen. But, Paul makes the <i>mind</i> to
consist of nothing else than vanity; and, as if he had not expressed his meaning
strongly enough, he gives no better title to her daughter, <i>the
understanding.</i> Such is my interpretation of the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dianoi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">;
for, though it signifies the thought, yet, as it is in the singular number, it
refers to the thinking faculty. Plato, about the close of his Sixth Book on a
Republic, assigns to
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dianoi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">
an intermediate place between
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">no&gt;hsiv</font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pi&gt;stiv</font><font face="Palatino">
but his observations are so entirely confined to geometrical subjects, as not to
admit of application to this passage. Having formerly asserted that men see
nothing, Paul now adds, that they are blind in reasoning, even on the most
important subjects.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let men now go and be proud of free-will, whose
guidance is here marked by so deep disgrace. But experience, we shall be told,
is openly at variance with this opinion; for men are not so blind as to be
incapable of seeing anything, nor so vain as to be incapable of forming any
judgment. I answer, with respect to the kingdom of God, and all that relates to
the spiritual life, the light of human reason differs little from darkness; for,
before it has pointed out the road, it is extinguished; and its power of
perception is little else than blindness, for ere it has reached the fruit, it
is gone. The true principles held by the human mind resemble sparks;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
these are choked by the depravity of our nature, before they have been applied
to their proper use. All men know, for instance, that there is a God, and that
it is our duty to worship him; but such is the power of sin and ignorance, that
from this confused knowledge we pass all at once to an idol, and worship it in
the place of God. And even in the worship of God, it leads to great errors,
particularly in the first table of the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the second objection, our judgment does indeed
agree with the law of God in regard to the mere outward actions; but sinful
desire, which is the source of everything evil, escapes our notice. Besides,
Paul does not speak merely of the natural blindness which we brought with us
from the womb, but refers also to a still grosser blindness, by which, as we
shall afterwards see, God punishes former transgressions. We conclude with
observing, that the reason and understanding which men naturally possess, make
them in the sight of God without excuse; but, so long as they allow themselves
to live according to their natural disposition, they can only wander, and fall,
and stumble in their purposes and actions. Hence it appears in what estimation
and value false worship must appear in the sight of God, when it proceeds from
the gulf of vanity and the maze of
ignorance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Being alienated from the life of

Spirit of regeneration. In both cases the meaning is the same. Our ordinary
life, as men, is nothing more than an empty image of life, not only because it
quickly passes, but also because, while we live, our souls, not keeping close to
God, are dead. There are three kinds of life in this world. The first is animal
life, which consists only of motion and the bodily senses, and which we have in
common with the brutes; the second is human life, which we have as the children
of Adam; and the third is that supernatural life, which believers alone obtain.
And all of them are from God, so that each of them may be called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the life of

Athens, says, (Acts 17:28,) &#8220;In him we live, and move, and have our

way of eminence, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the life of God,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">because then does God truly live in us, and we
enjoy his life, when he governs us by his Spirit. Of this life all men who are
not new creatures in Christ are declared by Paul to be destitute. So long, then,
as we remain in the flesh, that is, in ourselves, how wretched must be our
condition! We may now form a judgment of all the moral virtues, as they are
called; for what sort of actions will that life produce which, Paul affirms, is
not the life of God? Before anything good can begin to proceed from us, we must
first be renewed by the grace of Christ. This will be the commencement of a
true, and, as the phrase is, a <i>vital</i> life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On account of the ignorance that is
in them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We ought to attend to the reason which
is here assigned; for, as the knowledge of God is the true life of the soul, so,
on the contrary, ignorance is the death of it. And lest we should adopt the
opinion of philosophers, that ignorance, which leads us into mistakes, is only
an incidental evil, Paul shews that it has its root
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the blindness of their
heart,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> by which he intimates that it dwells in
their very nature. The first blindness, therefore, which covers the minds of
men, is the punishment of original sin; because Adam, after his revolt, was
deprived of the true light of God, in the absence of which there is nothing but
fearful darkness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who being past

natural depravity is followed by a description of the worst of all evils,
brought upon men by their own sinful conduct. Having destroyed the sensibilities
of the heart, and allayed the stings of remorse, they abandon themselves to all
manner of iniquity. We are by nature corrupt and prone to evil; nay, we are
wholly inclined to evil. Those who are destitute of the Spirit of Christ give
loose reins to self-indulgence, till fresh offenses, producing others in
constant succession, bring down upon them the wrath of God. The voice of God,
proclaimed by an accusing conscience, still continues to be heard; but, instead
of producing its proper effects, appears rather to harden them against all
admonition. On account of such obstinacy, they deserve to be altogether forsaken

<div><font face="Palatino">The usual symptom of their having been thus forsaken
is &#8212; the insensibility to pain, which is here described &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>being past
feeling</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Unmoved by the approaching judgment of
God, whom they offend, they go on at their ease, and fearlessly indulge without
restraint in the pleasures of sin. No shame is felt, no regard to character is
maintained. The gnawing of a guilty conscience, tormented by the dread of the
Divine judgment, may be compared to the porch of hell; but such hardened
security as this &#8212; is a whirlpool which swallows up and destroys. As
Solomon says,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Most properly, therefore, does Paul exhibit that

&#8212; in a word, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>being past
feeling, </i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8212; surrender themselves with
brutal violence to all wickedness. This is not universally the case. Many even
of the reprobate are restrained by God, whose infinite goodness prevents the
absolute confusion in which the world would otherwise be involved. The
consequence is, that such open lust, such unrestrained intemperance, does not
appear in all. It is enough that the lives of some present such a mirror, fitted
to awaken our alarm lest anything similar should happen to
ourselves.</font><br></div>

life, so as to make it evident how utterly inconsistent it is with the character
of a godly man to defile himself regardlessly with the abominations of the
Gentiles. Because the Gentiles walk in darkness, therefore they do not
distinguish between right and wrong; but those on whom the truth of God shines
ought to live in a different manner. That those to whom the vanity of the senses
is a rule of life, should yield themselves up to base lusts, is not surprising;
but the doctrine of Christ teaches us to renounce our natural dispositions. He
whose life differs not from that of unbelievers, has learned nothing of Christ;
for the knowledge of Christ cannot be separated from the mortification of the
flesh.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye have heard

the more, he not only tells them that they had

expression, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ye have been taught

had not been slightly pointed out, but faithfully delivered and
explained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the truth is in
Jesus.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This contains a reproof of that
superficial knowledge of the gospel, by which many are elated, who are wholly
unacquainted with newness of life. They think that they are exceedingly wise,
but the apostle pronounces it to be a false and mistaken opinion. There is a
twofold knowledge of Christ, &#8212; one, which is true and genuine, &#8212; and
another, which is counterfeit and spurious. Not that, strictly speaking, there
are two kinds; but most men falsely imagine that they know Christ, while they
know nothing but what is carnal. In another Epistle he says,</font><br></div>

repentance, or a new life, which he makes to consist of self-denial and the
regeneration of the Holy Spirit. Beginning with the first, he enjoins us to lay
aside, or </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>put
off</i></font><font face="Palatino"> the old man, employing the metaphor of
garments, which we have already had occasion to explain.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The old
man,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; as we have repeatedly stated, in
expounding the sixth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, and other passages
where it occurs, &#8212; means the natural disposition which we bring with us
from our mother&#8217;s womb. In two persons, Adam and Christ, he describes to
us what may be called two natures. As we are first born of Adam, the depravity
of nature which we derive from him is called the <i>Old</i> man; and as we are
born again in Christ, the amendment of this sinful nature is called the
<i>New</i> man. In a word, he who desires to put off the old man must renounce
his nature. To suppose that the words
<i>Old</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">and</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>New</i> contain an allusion to the Old and
New Testaments, is exceedingly unphilosophical.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Concerning the former
conversation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To make it more evident that this
exhortation to the Ephesians was not unnecessary, he reminds them of their
former life. &#8220;Before Christ revealed himself to your minds, the old man
reigned in you; and therefore, if you desire to lay him aside, you must renounce
your former life.&#8221; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which is
corrupted.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He describes the old man from the
fruits, that is, from the wicked desires, which allure men to destruction; for
the word, <i>corrupt,</i> alludes to old age, which is closely allied to
corruption. Let us beware of considering
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the deceitful
lusts,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as the Papists do, to mean nothing more
than the gross and visible lusts, which are generally acknowledged to be base.
The word includes also those dispositions which, instead of being censured, are
sometimes applauded, &#8212; such as ambition, cunning, and everything that
proceeds either from self-love or from want of confidence in
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And be renewed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The second part of the rule for
a devout and holy life is to live, not in our own spirit, but in the Spirit of
Christ. But what is meant by &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the spirit of your
mind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> I understand it simply to mean,
&#8212; <i>Be renewed,</i> not only with respect to the inferior appetites or
desires, which are manifestly sinful, but with respect also to that part of the
soul which is reckoned most noble and excellent. And here again, he brings
forward to view that Queen which philosophers are accustomed almost to adore.
There is an implied contrast between <i>the spirit of our mind</i> and the
Divine and heavenly Spirit, who produces in us another and a new mind. How much
there is in us that is sound or uncorrupted may be easily gathered from this
passage, which enjoins us to correct chiefly the reason or <i>mind,</i> in which
we are apt to imagine that there is nothing but what is virtuous and deserves
commendation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that ye put on the new
man.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> All that is meant is, &#8220;Be renewed in
the spirit, or, be renewed <i>within</i> or <i>completely,</i> &#8212; beginning
with the mind, which appears to be the part most free from all taint of
sin.&#8221; What is added about the creation, may refer either to the first
creation of man, or to the second creation, which is effected by the grace of
Christ. Both expositions will be true. Adam was at first created after the image
of God, and reflected, as in a mirror, the Divine righteousness; but that image,
having been defaced by sin, must now be restored in Christ. The regeneration of
the godly is indeed &#8212; as we have formerly explained
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb44</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> &#8212;
nothing else than the formation anew of the image of God in them. There is, no
doubt, a far more rich and powerful manifestation of Divine grace in this second
creation than in the first; but our highest perfection is uniformly represented
in Scripture as consisting in our conformity and resemblance to God. Adam lost
the image which he had originally received, and therefore it becomes necessary
that it shall be restored to us by Christ. The design contemplated by
regeneration is to recall us from our wanderings to that end for which we were
created.</font><br></div>

inclined to consider <i>holiness</i> as referring to the first table, and
<i>righteousness</i> to the second table, of the law, as in the song of
Zacharias,</font><br></div>

bears a reference to men. The genitive, <i>of truth</i>,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore, putting away
lying.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> From this head of doctrine, that is,
from the righteousness of the new man, all godly exhortations flow, like streams
from a fountain; for if all the precepts which relate to life were collected,
yet, without this principle, they would be of little value. Philosophers take a
different method; but, in the doctrine of godliness, there is no other way than
this for regulating the life. Now, therefore, he comes to lay down particular
exhortations, drawn from the general doctrine. Having concluded from the truth
of the gospel, that righteousness and holiness ought to be true, he now argues
from the general statement to a particular instance, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every man should speak truth with
his neighbour.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> Lying</i> is here put for
every kind of deceit, hypocrisy, or cunning; and
<i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">for honest dealing. He demands that every kind of
communication between them shall be sincere; and enforces it by this
consideration, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for we are members
one of another</i></font><font face="Palatino">. That
<i>members</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">should not agree among themselves, &#8212; that
they should act in a deceitful manner towards each other, is prodigious
wickedness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be ye angry, and sin
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Whether or not the apostle had in his eye
a part of the fourth Psalm is uncertain. The words used by him
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">jOrgi&gt;zesqe kai&lt; uh&lt;
aJmarta&gt;nete</font><font face="Palatino">) occur in the Greek translation,
though the word

which is translated, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be ye
angry,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is considered by some to mean
<i>tremble.
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
Hebrew verb
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">zgr</font><font face="Palatino">
(<i>ragaz</i>) signifies either to be agitated by anger, or, to tremble. As to
the passage of the Psalm, the idea of <i>trembling</i> will be quite
appropriate. &#8220;Do not choose to resemble madmen, who rush fearlessly in any
direction, but let the dread of being accounted foolhardy keep you in
awe.&#8221; The word sometimes signifies to <i>strive</i> or <i>quarrel</i>, as,
in that instance, (Genesis 45:24,) &#8220;See that ye <i>fall not out</i> by the
way;&#8221; and accordingly, the Psalmist adds, &#8220;Commune with your own
heart, and be still,&#8221; &#8212; abstain from furious
encounters.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In my opinion, Paul merely alludes to the passage
with the following view. There are three faults by which we offend God in being
angry. The first is, when our anger arises from slight causes, and often from no
cause whatever, or at least from private injuries or offenses. The second is,
when we go beyond the proper bounds, and are hurried into intemperate excesses.
The third is, when our anger, which ought to have been directed against
ourselves or against sins, is turned against our brethren. Most appropriately,
therefore, did Paul, when he wished to describe the proper limitation of anger,
employ the well-known passage</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, Be
ye angry, and sin not. </i></font><font face="Palatino">We comply with this
injunction, if the objects of our anger are sought, not in others, but in
ourselves, &#8212; if we pour out our indignation against our own faults. With
respect to others, we ought to be angry, not at their persons, but at their
faults; nor ought we to be excited to anger by private offenses, but by zeal for
the glory of the Lord. Lastly, our anger, after a reasonable time, ought to be
allowed to subside, without mixing itself with the violence of carnal
passions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let not the sun go
down.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is scarcely possible, however, but
that we shall sometimes give way to improper and sinful passion, &#8212; so
strong is the tendency of the human mind to what is evil. Paul therefore
suggests a second remedy, that we shall quickly suppress our anger, and not
suffer it to gather strength by continuance. The first remedy was,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be ye angry, and sin
not;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> but, as the great weakness of human nature
renders this exceedingly difficult, the next is &#8212; not to cherish wrath too
long in our minds, or allow it sufficient time to become strong. He enjoins
accordingly, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let not the sun go
down upon your wrath.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> If at any time we happen
to be angry, let us endeavor to be appeased before the sun has
set.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>27.</b>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the
devil.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I am aware of the interpretation which
some give of this passage. Erasmus, who translates it, &#8220;neither give place
to the Slanderer,&#8221; (<i>calumniatori,</i>) shews plainly that he understood
it as referring to malicious men. But I have no doubt, Paul&#8217;s intention
was, to guard us against allowing Satan to take possession of our minds, and, by
keeping in his hands this citadel, to do whatever he pleases. We feel every day
how impossible, or, at least, how difficult it is to cure long-continued hatred.
What is the cause of this, but that, instead of resisting the devil, we yield up
to him the possession of our heart? Before the poison of hatred has found its
way into the heart, anger must be thoroughly
dislodged.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>28.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let him that stole steal no
more.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This includes not merely the grosser
thefts which are punished by human laws, but those of a more concealed nature,
which do not fall under the cognizance of men, &#8212; every kind of depredation
by which we seize the property of others. But he does not simply forbid us to
take that property in an unjust or unlawful manner. He enjoins us to assist our
brethren, as far as lies in our power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he may have to give to him
that needeth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;Thou who formerly stolest
must not only obtain thy subsistence by lawful and harmless toil, but must give
assistance to others.&#8221; He is first required
<i>to</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> labor, working with his
hands,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that he may not supply his wants at the
expense of his brethren, but may support life by honorable labor. But the love
which we owe to our neighbor carries us much farther. No one must live to
himself alone, and neglect others. All must labor to supply each other&#8217;s
necessities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But a question arises, does Paul oblige all men to
labor with their hands? This would be excessively hard. I reply, the meaning is
plain, if it be duly considered. Every man is forbidden to steal. But many
people are in the habit of pleading want, and that excuse is obviated by
enjoining them</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> rather to

affections, such as joy and grief, are ascribed to the Holy Spirit.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb46</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Endeavour that the Holy Spirit may dwell cheerfully with you, as in a pleasant
and joyful dwelling, and give him no occasion for grief. Some take a different
view of it, that we grieve the Holy Spirit in others, when we offend by filthy
language, or, in any other way, godly brethren, who are led by the Spirit of
God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450814&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

Paul&#8217;s meaning was different appears from what follows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By whom ye are
sealed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As God has sealed us by his Spirit, we
grieve him when we do not follow his guidance, but pollute ourselves by wicked
passions. No language can adequately express this solemn truth, that the Holy
Spirit rejoices and is glad on our account, when we are obedient to him in all
things, and neither think nor speak anything, but what is pure and holy; and, on
the other hand, is grieved, when we admit anything into our minds that is
unworthy of our calling. Now, let any man reflect what shocking wickedness there
must be in grieving the Holy Spirit to such a degree as to compel him to
withdraw from us. The same mode of speaking is used by the prophet Isaiah, but
in a different sense; for he merely says, that they &#8220;vexed his Holy
Spirit,&#8221; (Isaiah 63:10.) in the same sense in which we are accustomed to
speak of vexing the mind of a man.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By whom ye are
sealed.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The Spirit of God is the seal, by which
we are distinguished from the wicked, and which is impressed on our hearts as a
sure evidence of adoption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unto the day of

us into the possession of the promised inheritance. That day is usually called

delivered out of all our afflictions. It is unnecessary to make any observations

may have a different meaning from that which it usually bears, &#8212; that God
has impressed his Spirit as his mark upon us, that he may recognize as his

exhortation the greater weight, he holds out the example of God, who has

leads us to admire the grace of Christ, it bears directly on the present

God. The doctrine of faith on this subject holds the highest rank. But the more

knowledge, he intimates that this was no doubtful matter. Some might think it
harsh, or inconsistent with the Divine goodness, that all who have incurred the
guilt of fornication or covetousness are excluded from the inheritance of the
kingdom of heaven. But the answer is easy. Paul does not say that those who have
fallen into those sins, and recovered from them, are not pardoned, but
pronounces sentence on the sins themselves. After addressing the Corinthians in
the same language, he adds:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">And
such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are
justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our
God.</font><font face="Palatino">&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(1
Corinthians</font><font face="Palatino">
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">6:11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When men have repented, and thus give evidence that
they are reconciled to God, they are no longer the same persons that they
formerly were. But let all fornicators, or unclean or covetous persons, so long
as they continue such, be assured that they have no friendship with God, and are
deprived of all hope of salvation. It is called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the kingdom of Christ and of
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> because God hath given it to his Son that
we may obtain it through him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Nor covetous man, who is an
idolater.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;Covetousness,&#8221; as he
says in another place, &#8220;is idolatry,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:5,) &#8212; not the idolatry which is so frequently condemned in Scripture,
but one of a different description. All covetous men must deny God, and put
wealth in his place; such is their blind greediness of wretched gain. But why
does Paul attribute to covetousness alone what belongs equally to other carnal
passions? In what respect is covetousness better entitled to this disgraceful
name than ambition, or than a vain confidence in ourselves? I answer, that this
disease is widely spread, and not a few minds have caught the infection. Nay, it
is not reckoned a disease, but receives, on the contrary, very general
commendation. This accounts for the harshness of Paul&#8217;s language, which
arose from a desire to tear from our hearts the false
view.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb51</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> by whom
the threatenings of the prophets were made the subject of merriment and
ridicule. We find such characters in our own day. In all ages, indeed, Satan
raises up sorcerers of this description, who endeavor by unholy scoffs to escape
the Divine judgment, and who actually exercise a kind of fascination over
consciences not sufficiently established in the fear of God. &#8220;This is a
trivial fault. Fornication is viewed by God as a light matter. Under the law of
grace God is not so cruel. He has not formed us so as to be our own
executioners. The frailty of nature excuses us.&#8221; These and similar
expressions are often used by the scoffers. Paul, on the contrary, exclaims that
we must guard against that sophistry by which consciences are ensnared to their
ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For because of these things cometh
the wrath of God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> If we consider the present
tense to be here used, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, for the future, these
words are a threatening of the last judgment. But I agree with those who take
the word </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>cometh</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">in an indefinite sense, &#8212; <i>the word of
God</i> usually <i>cometh,</i> &#8212; as reminding them of the ordinary
judgments of God which were executed before their own eyes. And certainly, if we
were not blind and slothful, there are sufficiently numerous examples by which
God testifies that he is the just avenger of such crimes, &#8212; examples of
the pouring out of divine indignation, privately against individuals, and
publicly against cities, and kings, and nations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Upon the children of
disobedience,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; upon <i>unbelievers</i>
or <i>rebels.</i> This expression must not be overlooked. Paul is now addressing
believers, and his object is not so much to present alarming views of their own
danger, as to rouse them to behold reflected in wicked men, as in mirrors, the
dreadful judgments of God. God does not make himself an object of terror to his
children, that they may avoid him, but does all that can be done in a fatherly
manner, to draw them to himself. They ought to learn this lesson, not to involve
themselves in a dangerous fellowship with the ungodly, whose ruin is thus
foreseen.</font><br></div>

derive greater weight from the motives with which they are mingled. Having
spoken of unbelievers, and warned the Ephesians not to become partakers of their
crimes and their destruction, he argues still further, that they ought to differ
widely from the life and conduct of those men. At the same time, in order to
guard them against ingratitude to God, he refreshes their remembrance of their
own past life. &#8220;You ought,&#8221; he says, &#8220;to be very different
persons from what you formerly were; for out of darkness God hath made you
light.&#8221; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Darkness</i>

nothing but fearful darkness.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Light,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
again, is the name given to those who are <i>enlightened</i> by the Spirit of
God; for immediately afterwards in the same sense, he calls them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children of
light,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and draws the inference, that they ought
to walk in light, because by the mercy of God they had been rescued from
darkness. Observe here, we are said to
be</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> light in the

is under the dominion of Satan, whom we know to be the Prince of

This parenthesis is introduced, to point out the road in which the <i>children
of light</i> ought to walk. A complete description is not given, but a few parts
of a holy and pious life are introduced by way of example. To give them a
general view of duty, their attention is again directed to the will of God.
Whoever desires to live in a proper and safe manner, let him resolve to obey
God, and to take his will as the rule. To regulate life entirely by his command
is, as he says in another Epistle, <i>a reasonable service,</i>
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:1,) or, as another inspired man expresses it, <i>To obey is better than
sacrifice.</i>

Samuel 15:22.) I wonder how the word Spirit

not affected; for in either case it will be this, that believers must walk in
the light, because they are &#8220;children of the light.&#8221; This is done,
when they do not live according to their own will, but devote themselves
entirely to obedience to God, &#8212; when they undertake nothing but by his
command. Besides, such obedience is testified by its fruits, such as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>goodness, righteousness, and
truth.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And have no fellowship.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As &#8220;the children

&#8220;a perverse and crooked generation,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053205&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:5,) &#8212; there is good reason for warning them to keep themselves apart
from wicked actions. It is not enough that we do not, of our own accord,
undertake anything wicked. We must beware of joining or assisting those who do
wrong. In short, we must abstain from giving any consent, or advice, or
approbation, or assistance; for in all these ways we <i>have fellowship.</i> And
lest any one should imagine that he has done his duty, merely by not conniving,
he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but rather reprove them.
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb53</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Such a course is opposed to all dissimulation. Where a manifest offense is
committed against God, every man will be eager to vindicate himself from any
share in the guilt, but very few will guard against connivance; nearly all will
practice some kind of dissimulation. But rather than the truth of God shall not
remain unshaken, let a hundred worlds perish.</font><br></div>

which is translated
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reprove,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
answers to the metaphor of darkness; for it literally signifies to drag forth to
the light what was formerly unknown. As ungodly men flatter themselves in their
vices,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
36:2,) and wish their crimes to be concealed, or to be reckoned virtues, Paul
enjoins that they shall be <i>reproved.</i> He calls them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unfruitful;</i></font><font face="Palatino">
because they not only do no good, but are absolutely
hurtful.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which are done by them in
secret.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This shews the advantage of reproving
the ungodly. If they do but escape the eyes of men, there is no crime, however
shocking to be mentioned, which they will not perpetrate. To use a common
proverb, &#8220;Night has no shame.&#8221; What is the reason of this? Sunk in
the darkness of ignorance, they neither see their own baseness, nor think that
it is seen by God and by angels. But let the torch of God&#8217;s word be
brought forward, and their eyes are opened. Then they begin to blush and be
ashamed. By their advices and reproofs the saints enlighten blind unbelievers,
and drag forth from their concealment to the light of day those who were sunk in
ignorance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When unbelievers keep the doors of their houses shut,
and withdraw from the view of men,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it is a shame even to speak

rush into all manner of licentiousness. Would they thus lay aside all shame, and
give loose reins to their passions, if darkness did not give them courage,
&#8212; if they did not entertain the hope that what is hidden will pass
unpunished? But do you, by reproving them, bring forward the light, that they
may be ashamed of their own baseness. Such shame, arising from an acknowledgment
of baseness, is the first step to repentance.</font><br></div>

Paul&#8217;s object is to shew that it will not be without advantage if the

voice, it admits either of a passive or active signification. It may be either
rendered, <i>that which is made manifest,</i> or <i>that which doth make
manifest.</i> If the passive signification, which is followed by the ancient
translator, be preferred, the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>light</i></font><font face="Palatino">
will denote, as formerly, <i>that which gives light,</i> and the meaning will
be, that evil works, which had been concealed, will stand out to public view,
when they have been </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>made
manifest</i></font><font face="Palatino"> by the word of God: If the participle
be taken actively, there will still be two ways of expounding it: 1. Whatever
manifests is light; 2. That which manifests anything or all things, is light;
taking the singular as put for the plural number. There is no difficulty, as
Erasmus dreaded, about the article; for the apostles are not in the habit of
adhering very strictly to rule about placing every article, and even among
elegant writers this mode of using it would be allowable. The context appears to
me to shew clearly that this is Paul&#8217;s meaning. He had exhorted them to
reprove the evil works of unbelievers, and thus to drag them out of darkness;
and he now adds, that what he enjoins upon them is the proper business of light
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to make

darkness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>

&#8220;Unbelievers,&#8221; Paul had said, &#8220;must be reproved, that, being
brought forth to the light, they may begin to acknowledge their

constantly heard in the preaching of the gospel,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Arise, thou that

the prophecies which relate to Christ&#8217;s kingdom; such as that of Isaiah

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Submit
yourselves.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> God has bound us so strongly to
each other, that no man ought to endeavor to avoid subjection; and where love
reigns, mutual services will be rendered. I do not except even kings and
governors, whose very authority is held for the <i>service</i> of the community.
It is highly proper that all should be exhorted to be subject to each other in
their turn.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as nothing is more irksome to the mind of man
than this mutual subjection, he directs us to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fear of Christ,</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">who alone can subdue our fierceness, that we may
not refuse the yoke, and can humble our pride, that we may not be ashamed of
serving our neighbors. It does not much affect the sense, whether we interpret
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the fear of
Christ,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> passively, thus, &#8212; let us submit
to our neighbors, because we fear Christ; or actively, &#8212; let us submit to
them, because the minds of all godly persons ought to be influenced by such fear
under the reign of Christ. Some Greek manuscripts read, &#8220;the fear <i>of
God.</i>&#8221; The change may have been introduced by some person, who thought
that the other phrase, <i>the fear of Christ,</i> though by far the most
appropriate, sounded a little harsh.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb59</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wives, submit
yourselves.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He comes now to the various
conditions of life; for, besides the universal bond of subjection, some are more
closely bound to each other, according to their respective callings. The
community at large is divided, as it were, into so many yokes, out of which
arises mutual obligation. There is, first, the yoke of marriage between husband
and wife; &#8212; secondly, the yoke which binds parents and children; &#8212;
and, thirdly, the yoke which connects masters and servants. By this arrangement
there are six different classes, for each of whom Paul lays down peculiar
duties. He begins with wives, whom he enjoins to be subject to their husbands,
in the same manner as to Christ, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as to the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Not that the authority is equal, but
wives cannot obey Christ without yielding obedience to their
husbands.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the husband is the head of
the wife.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the reason assigned why wives
should be obedient. Christ has appointed the same relation to exist between a
husband and a wife, as between himself and his church. This comparison ought to
produce a stronger impression on their minds, than the mere declaration that
such is the appointment of God. Two things are here stated. God has given to the
husband authority over the wife; and a resemblance of this authority is found in
Christ, who </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is the head of the
church,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as the husband is of the
wife.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he is the savior of the
body.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The pronoun HE
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aujto&gt;v</font><font face="Palatino">)
is supposed by some to refer to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ;</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and, by others, to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
husband.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It applies more naturally, in my
opinion, to Christ, but still with a view to the present subject. In this point,
as well as in others, the resemblance ought to hold. As Christ rules over his
church for her salvation, so nothing yields more advantage or comfort to the
wife than to be subject to her husband. To refuse that subjection, by means of
which they might be saved, is to choose
destruction.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But,</i> <i>as the church is
subject to Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The particle <i>but,</i> may
lead some to believe that the words, <i>he is the savior of the body,</i> are
intended to anticipate an objection. Christ has, no doubt, this peculiar claim,
that he is the Savior of the Church: nevertheless, let wives know, that their
husbands, though they cannot produce equal claims, have authority over them,
after the example of Christ. I prefer the former interpretation; for the
argument derived from the word <i>but,</i>
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajlla&gt;</font><font face="Palatino">,)
does not appear to me to have much
weight.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>25.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Husbands, love your
wives.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> From husbands, on the other hand, the
apostle requires that they cherish toward their wives no ordinary love; for to
them, also, he holds out the example of Christ, &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>even as Christ also loved the
church.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">If they are honored to bear his image,
and to be, in some measure, his representatives, they ought to resemble him also
in the discharge of duty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And gave himself for
it.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is intended to express the strong
affection which husbands ought to have for their wives, though he takes
occasion, immediately afterwards, to commend the grace of Christ. Let husbands
imitate Christ in this respect, that he scrupled not to die for his church. One
peculiar consequence, indeed, which resulted from his death, &#8212; that by it
he redeemed his church, &#8212; is altogether beyond the power of men to
imitate.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>26.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he might
sanctify,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; or, that he might separate it
to himself; for such I consider to be the meaning of the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctify</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
This is accomplished by the forgiveness of sins, and the regeneration of the
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Washing it with the washing of
water.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Having mentioned the inward and hidden
sanctification, he now adds the outward symbol, by which it is visibly
confirmed; as if he had said, that a pledge of that sanctification is held out
to us by baptism. Here it is necessary to guard against unsound interpretation,
lest the wicked superstition of men, as has frequently happened, change a
sacrament into an idol. When Paul says that we are washed by baptism, his
meaning is, that God employs it for declaring to us that we are washed, and at
the same time performs what it represents. If the truth &#8212; or, which is the
same thing, the exhibition of the truth &#8212; were not connected with baptism,
it would be improper to say that baptism is the washing of the soul. At the same
time, we must beware of ascribing to the sign, or to the minister, what belongs
to God alone. We must not imagine that washing is performed by the minister, or
that water cleanses the pollutions of the soul, which nothing but the blood of
Christ can accomplish. In short, we must beware of giving any portion of our
confidence to the element or to man; for the true and proper use of the
sacrament is to lead us directly to Christ, and to place all our dependence upon
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Others again suppose that too much importance is
given to the sign, by saying that baptism is the washing of the soul. Under the
influence of this fear, they labor exceedingly to lessen the force of the
eulogium which is here pronounced on baptism. But they are manifestly wrong;
for, in the first place, the apostle does not say that it is the sign which
washes, but declares it to be exclusively the work of God. It is God who washes,
and the honor of performing it cannot lawfully be taken from its Author and
given to the sign. But there is no absurdity in saying that God employs a sign
as the outward means. Not that the power of God is limited by the sign, but this
assistance is accommodated to the weakness of our capacity. Some are offended at
this view, imagining that it takes from the Holy Spirit a work which is
peculiarly his own, and which is everywhere ascribed to him in Scripture. But
they are mistaken; for God acts by the sign in such a manner, that its whole
efficacy depends upon his Spirit. Nothing more is attributed to the sign than to
be an inferior organ, utterly useless in itself, except so far as it derives its
power from another source.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Equally groundless is their fear, that by this
interpretation the freedom of God will be restrained. The grace of God is not
confined to the sign; so that God may not, if he pleases, bestow it without the
aid of the sign. Besides, many receive the sign who are not made partakers of
grace; for the sign is common to all, to the good and to the bad alike; but the
Spirit is bestowed on none but the elect, and the sign, as we have said, has no
efficacy without the Spirit. The Greek participle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kaqari&gt;sav</font><font face="Palatino">,
is in the past tense, as if he had said, &#8220;After having washed.&#8221; But,
as the Latin language has no active participle in the past tense, I chose rather
to disregard this, and to translate it (<i>mundans</i>)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>washing,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
instead of (<i>mundatam</i>) <i>having been</i> <i>washed;</i> which would have
kept out of view a matter of far greater importance, namely, that to God alone
belongs the work of cleansing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the word.
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb60</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This is very far from being a superfluous addition; for, if the <i>word</i> is
taken away, the whole power of the sacraments is gone. What else are the
sacraments but seals of the word? This single consideration will drive away
superstition. How comes it that superstitious men are confounded by signs, but
because their minds are not directed to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Word,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
which would lead them to God? Certainly, when we look to anything else than to
the word, there is nothing sound, nothing pure; but one absurdity springs out of
another, till at length the signs, which were appointed by God for the salvation
of men, become profane, and degenerate into gross idolatry. The only difference,
therefore, between the sacraments of the godly and the contrivances of
unbelievers, is found in the Word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Word</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is here meant the promise, which explains the value and use of the signs. Hence
it appears, that the Papists do not at all observe the signs in a proper manner.
They boast indeed, of having &#8220;the Word,&#8221; but appear to regard it as
a sort of enchantment; for they mutter it in an unknown tongue; as if it were
addressed to dead matter, and not to men. No explanation of the mystery is made
to the people; and in this respect, were there no other, the sacrament begins to
be nothing more than the dead element of
water.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> In the
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is equivalent to &#8220;By the

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he might present it to
himself.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He declares what is the design of
baptism and of our being washed. It is, that we may live in a holy and
unblamable manner before God. We are washed by Christ, not that we may return to
our pollution, but that we may retain through our life the purity which we have
once received. This is described in metaphorical language appropriate to his
argument.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not having spot or
wrinkle.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As the beauty of the wife produces
love in the husband, so Christ adorns the Church his bride with holiness as a
proof of his regard. This metaphor contains an allusion to marriage; but he
afterwards lays aside the figure, and says plainly, that Christ has reconciled
the church, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that it might be holy
and without blemish.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The true beauty of the
church consists in this conjugal chastity, that is, in holiness and
purity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>present</i></font><font face="Palatino">
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">parasth&gt;sh|</font><font face="Palatino">)
implies that the church ought to be holy, not only in the view of men, but in
the eyes of the Lord; for Paul says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that he might present it to
himself,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> not that he might shew it to others,
though the fruits of that hidden purity become afterwards evident in outward
works. Pelagians were wont to quote this passage in order to prove the
perfection of righteousness in this life, but have been successfully answered by
Augustine. Paul does not state what has been done, but for what purpose Christ
has cleansed his church. Now, when a thing is said to be done that another may
afterwards follow, it is idle to conclude that this latter thing, which ought to
follow, has been already done. We do not deny that the holiness of the church is
already begun; but, so long as there is daily progress, there cannot be
perfection.</font><br></div>

He that loveth his wife.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> An argument is now
drawn from nature itself, to prove that men ought to love their wives. Every
man, by his very nature, loves himself. But no man can love himself without
loving his wife. Therefore, the man who does not love his wife is a monster. The
minor proposition is proved in this manner. Marriage was appointed by God on the
condition that the two should be <i>one flesh;</i> and that this unity may be
the more sacred, he again recommends it to our notice by the consideration of
Christ and his church. Such is the amount of his argument, which to a certain
extent applies universally to human society. To shew what man owes to man,
Isaiah says, &#8220;hide not thyself from thine own flesh.&#8221; (Isaiah 58:7.)
But this refers to our common nature. Between a man and his wife there is a far
closer relation; for they not only are united by a resemblance of nature, but by
the bond of marriage have become one man. Whoever considers seriously the design
of marriage cannot but love his
wife.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>29.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Even as Christ the church.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He proceeds to
enforce the obligations of marriage by representing to us Christ and his Church;
for a more powerful example could not have been adduced. The strong affection
which a husband ought to cherish towards his wife is exemplified by Christ, and
an instance of that unity which belongs to marriage is declared to exist between
himself and the Church. This is a remarkable passage on the mysterious
intercourse which we have with
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>30.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we are members of his body,
of his flesh, and of his bones.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> First, this is
no exaggeration, but the simple truth. Secondly, he does not simply mean that
Christ is a partaker of our nature, but expresses something higher
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kai&lt;
ejmfatikw&gt;teron</font><font face="Palatino">) <i>and</i> <i>more
emphatic.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>31.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this
cause.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is an exact quotation from the
writings of Moses.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010224&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
2:24.) And what does it mean? As Eve was formed out of the substance of her
husband, and thus was a part of himself; so, if we are the true members of
Christ, we share his substance, and by this intercourse unite into one body. In
short, Paul describes our union to Christ, a symbol and pledge of which is given
to us in the ordinance of the supper. Those who talk about the torture exercised
on this passage to make it refer to the Lord&#8217;s supper, while no mention is
made of the supper, but of marriage, are egregiously mistaken. When they admit
that the death of Christ is commemorated in the supper, but not that such
intercourse exists as we assert from the words of Christ, we quote this passage
against them. Paul says that </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>we
are members of his flesh and of his bones.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Do
we wonder then, that in the Lord&#8217;s supper he holds out his body to be
enjoyed by us, and to nourish us unto eternal life? Thus we prove that the only
union which we maintain to be represented by the Lord&#8217;s supper is here
declared in its truth and consequences by the apostle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Two subjects are exhibited together; for the
spiritual union between Christ and his church is so treated as to illustrate the
common law of marriage, to which the quotation from Moses relates. He
immediately adds, that the saying is fulfilled in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ and the
church.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Every opportunity which presents itself
for proclaiming our obligations to Christ is readily embraced, but he adapts his
illustration of them to the present subject. It is uncertain whether Moses
introduces Adam as using these words, or gives them as an inference drawn by
himself from the creation of man. Nor is it of much consequence which of these
views be taken; for, in either case, we must hold it to be an announcement of
the will of God, enjoining the duties which men owe to their
wives.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He shall leave his father and
mother.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As if he had said, &#8220;Let him
rather <i>leave his father and mother</i> than not cleave to his wife.&#8221;
The marriage bond does not set aside the other duties of mankind, nor are the
commandments of God so inconsistent with each other, that a man cannot be a good
and faithful husband without ceasing to be a dutiful son. It is altogether a
question of degree. Moses draws the comparison, in order to express more
strongly the close and sacred union which subsists between husband and wife. A
son is bound by an inviolable law of nature to perform his duties towards his
father; and when the obligations of a husband towards his wife are declared to
be stronger, their force is the better understood. He who resolves to be a good
husband will not fail to perform his filial duties, but will regard marriage as
more sacred than all other ties.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And they two shall be one
flesh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> They shall be one man, or, to use a
common phrase, they shall constitute one person; which certainly would not hold
true with regard to any other kind of relationship. All depends on this, that
the wife was formed of the flesh and bones of her husband. Such is the union
between us and Christ, who in some sort makes us partakers of his substance.
&#8220;We are bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
2:23;) not because, like ourselves, he has a human nature, but because, by the
power of his Spirit, he makes us a part of his body, so that from him we derive
our life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>32.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is a great
mystery.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He concludes by expressing his
astonishment at the spiritual union between Christ and the church.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is a great
mystery;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> by which he means, that no language
can explain fully what it implies. It is to no purpose that men fret themselves
to comprehend, by the judgment of the flesh, the manner and character of this
union; for here the infinite power of the Divine Spirit is exerted. Those who
refuse to admit anything on this subject beyond what their own capacity can
reach, act an exceedingly foolish part. We tell them that the flesh and blood of
Christ are exhibited to us in the Lord&#8217;s supper. &#8220;Explain to us the
manner,&#8221; they reply, &#8220;or you will not convince us.&#8221; For my own
part, I am overwhelmed by the depth of this mystery, and am not ashamed to join
Paul in acknowledging at once my ignorance and my admiration. How much more
satisfactory would this be than to follow my carnal judgment, in undervaluing
what Paul declares to be a deep mystery! Reason itself teaches how we ought to
act in such matters; for whatever is supernatural is clearly beyond our own
comprehension. Let us therefore labor more to feel Christ living in us, than to
discover the nature of that intercourse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We cannot avoid admiring the acuteness of the
Papists, who conclude from the word

that marriage is one of seven sacraments, as if they had the power of changing
water into wine. They enumerate seven sacraments, while Christ has instituted no
more than two; and, to prove that matrimony is one of the seven, they produce
this passage. On what ground? Because the Vulgate has adopted the word
<i>Sacrament</i> (<i>sacramentum</i>) as a translation of the word
<i>Mystery,</i> which the apostle uses. As if Sacrament (<i>sacramentum</i>) did
not frequently, among Latin writers, denote <i>Mystery,</i> or as if
<i>Mystery</i> had not been the word employed by Paul in the same Epistle, when
speaking of the calling of the Gentiles. But the present question is, Has
marriage been appointed as a sacred symbol of the grace of God, to declare and
represent to us something spiritual, such as Baptism or the Lord&#8217;s Supper?
They have no ground for such an assertion, unless it be that they have been
deceived by the doubtful signification of a Latin word, or rather by their
ignorance of the Greek language. If the simple fact had been observed, that the
word used by Paul is <i>Mystery,</i> no mistake would ever have
occurred.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see then the hammer and anvil with which they
fabricated this sacrament. But they have given another proof of their indolence
in not attending to the correction which is immediately added,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I speak concerning Christ and
the church.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He intended to give express warning
that no man should understand him as speaking of marriage; so that his meaning
is more fully expressed than if he had uttered the former sentiment without any
exception. The </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>great
mystery</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is, that Christ breathes into the
church his own life and power. But who would discover here anything like a
sacrament? This blunder arose from the grossest
ignorance.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>33.</b>

subject, though the very digression aided his design, he adopts the method
usually followed in short precepts, by giving a brief summary of duties.
Husbands are required to love their wives, and wives to <i>fear</i>

their husbands, understanding by <i>fear</i> that

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Children,

<i>obey</i> instead of <i>honor,
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb62</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which has a greater extent of meaning? It is because <i>Obedience</i> is the
evidence of that <i>honor</i> which children owe to their parents, and is
therefore more earnestly enforced. It is likewise more difficult; for the human
mind recoils from the idea of subjection, and with difficulty allows itself to
be placed under the control of another. Experience shews how rare this virtue
is; for do we find one among a thousand that is obedient to his parents? By a
figure of speech, a part is here put for the whole, but it is the most important
part, and is necessarily accompanied by all the others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Besides the law of nature, which is
acknowledged by all nations, the obedience of children is enforced by the
authority of God. Hence it follows, that parents are to be obeyed, so far only
as is consistent with piety to God, which comes first in order. If the command
of God is the rule by which the submission of children is to be regulated, it
would be foolish to suppose that the performance of this duty could lead away
from God himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this is
right.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is added in order to restrain the
fierceness which, we have already said, appears to be natural to almost all men.
He proves it to be
<i>right</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
because God has commanded it; for we are not at liberty to dispute, or call in
question, the appointment of him whose will is the unerring rule of goodness and
righteousness. That <i>honor</i> should be represented as including
<i>obedience</i> is not surprising; for mere ceremony is of no value in the
sight of God. The precept, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>honor
thy father and mother,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> comprehends all the
duties by which the sincere affection and respect of children to their parents
can be expressed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which is the first commandment
with promise.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The promises annexed to the
commandments are intended to excite our hopes, and to impart a greater
cheerfulness to our obedience; and therefore Paul uses this as a kind of
seasoning to render the submission, which he enjoins on children, more pleasant
and agreeable. He does not merely say, that God has offered a reward to him who
obeys his father and mother, but that such an offer is peculiar to this
commandment. If each of the commandments had its own promises, there would have
been no ground for the commendation bestowed in the present instance. But this
is <i>the first commandment,</i> Paul tells us, which God has been pleased, as
it were, to seal by a remarkable promise. There is some difficulty here; for the
second commandment likewise contains a promise,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino">&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">I
am the Lord thy God, who shew mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and
keep my

20:5,6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this is universal, applying indiscriminately to
the whole law, and cannot be said to be annexed to that commandment.
Paul&#8217;s assertion still holds true, that no other commandment but that
which enjoins the obedience due by children to their parents is distinguished by
a promise.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That it may be well with
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The promise is &#8212; a long life; from
which we are led to understand that the present life is not to be overlooked
among the gifts of God. On this and other kindred subjects I must refer my
reader to the <i>Institutes of the Christian</i> <i>Religion;
</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb63</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
satisfying myself at present with saying, in a few words, that the reward
promised to the obedience of children is highly appropriate. Those who shew
kindness to their parents from whom they derived life, are assured by God, that
in this life it will <i>be well with them.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that thou mayest live long on
the earth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Moses expressly mentions the land of

<div><font face="Palatino">Beyond this the Jews could not conceive of any life
more happy or desirable. But as the same divine blessing is extended to the
whole world, Paul has properly left out the mention of a place, the peculiar

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And, ye

exhorted not to irritate their children by unreasonable severity. This would
excite hatred, and would lead them to throw off the yoke altogether.
Accordingly, in writing to the Colossians, he adds, &#8220;lest they be
discouraged.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510321&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians

instruction and reproof of the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is not
the will of God that parents, in the exercise of kindness, shall spare and
corrupt their children. Let their conduct towards their children be at once mild
and considerate, so as to guide them in the fear of the Lord, and correct them
also when they go astray. That age is so apt to become wanton, that it requires
frequent admonition and restraint.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Servants, be
obedient.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> His exhortation to servants is so
much the more earnest, on account of the hardship and bitterness of their
condition, which renders it more difficult to be endured. And he does not speak
merely of outward obedience, but says more about
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino">
willingly rendered; for it is a very rare occurrence to find one who willingly
yields himself to the control of another. The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>servants</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dou~loi</font><font face="Palatino">)
whom he immediately addresses were not hired servants, like those of the present
day, but <i>slaves,</i> such as were in ancient times, whose <i>slavery</i> was
perpetual, unless, through the favor of their masters, they obtained freedom,
&#8212; whom their masters bought with money, that they might impose upon them
the most degrading employments, and might, with the full protection of the law,
exercise over them the power of life and death. To such he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>obey your
masters,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> lest they should vainly imagine that
carnal freedom had been procured for them by the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as some of the worst men were compelled by the
dread of punishment, he distinguishes between Christian and ungodly servants, by
the feelings which they
cherished.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> With fear and
trembling;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, with the careful respect
which springs from an honest purpose. It can hardly be expected, however, that
so much deference will be paid to a mere man, unless a higher authority shall
enforce the obligation; and therefore he
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> as doing the will of
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> (Ver. 6.) Hence it follows, that it is not
enough if their obedience satisfy the eyes of men; for God requires truth and
sincerity of heart. When they serve their masters faithfully, they obey God. As
if he had said, &#8220;Do not suppose that by the judgment of men you were
thrown into slavery. It is God who has laid upon you this burden, who has placed
you in the power of your masters. He who conscientiously endeavors to render
what he owes to his master, performs his duty not to man only, but to
God.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With good will
doing service.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> (Ver. 7.) This is contrasted
with the suppressed indignation which swells the bosom of slaves. Though they
dare not openly break out or give signs of obstinacy, their dislike of the
authority exercised over them is so strong, that it is with the greatest
unwillingness and reluctance that they obey their masters.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whoever reads the accounts of the dispositions and
conduct of slaves, which are scattered through the writings of the ancients,
will be at no loss to perceive that the number of injunctions here given does
not exceed that of the diseases which prevailed among this class, and which it
was of importance to cure. But the same instruction applies to male and female
servants of our own times. It is God who appoints and regulates all the
arrangements of society. As the condition of servants is much more agreeable
than that of slaves in ancient times, they ought to consider themselves far less
excusable, if they do not endeavor, in every way, to comply with Paul&#8217;s
injunctions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Masters according to the
flesh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> (Ver. 5.) This expression is used to
soften the harsh aspect of slavery. He reminds them that their spiritual
freedom, which was by far the most desirable, remained
untouched.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Eye-service</i></font><font face="Palatino">
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ojfqalmodoulei&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
is mentioned; because almost all servants are addicted to flattery, but, as soon
as their master&#8217;s back is turned, indulge freely in contempt, or perhaps
in ridicule. Paul therefore enjoins godly persons to keep at the greatest
distance from such deceitful
pretences.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Knowing that whatsoever good
thing any man doeth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What a powerful
consolation! However unworthy, however ungrateful or cruel, their masters may
be, God will accept their services as rendered to himself. When servants take
into account the pride and arrogance of their masters, they often become more
indolent from the thought that their labor is thrown away. But Paul informs them
that their reward is laid up with God for services which appear to be ill
bestowed on unfeeling men; and that there is no reason, therefore, why they
should be led aside from the path of duty. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>whether bond or
free</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> No distinction is made between a
slave and a free man. The world is wont to set little value on the labors of
slaves; but God esteems them as highly as the duties of kings. In his estimate,
the outward station is thrown aside, and each is judged according to the
uprightness of his heart.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye
masters.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> In the treatment of their slaves, the
laws granted to masters a vast amount of power. Whatever had thus been
sanctioned by the civil code was regarded by many as in itself lawful. To such
an extent did their cruelty in some instances proceed, that the Roman emperors
were forced to restrain their tyranny. But though no royal edicts had ever been
issued for the protection of slaves, God allows to masters no power over them
beyond what is consistent with the law of love. When philosophers attempt to
give to the principles of equity their full effect in restraining the excess of
severity to slaves, they inculcate that masters ought to treat them in the same
manner as hired servants. But they never look beyond utility; and, in judging
even of that, they inquire only what is advantageous to the head of the family,
or conducive to good order. The Apostle proceeds on a very different principle.
He lays down what is lawful according to the Divine appointment, and how far
they, too, are debtors to their servants.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do the same things to
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;Perform the duty which on your
part you owe to them.&#8221; What he calls in another Epistle,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">to&lt; di&gt;kaion kai&lt;
th&lt;n ijso&gt;thta</font><font face="Palatino">) <i>that which is just and
equal,</i>
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb63a</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> is
precisely what, in this passage, he calls
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the same
things,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ta&lt;
aujta&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">.) And what is this but the law of
analogy? Masters and servants are not indeed on the same level; but there is a
mutual law which binds them. By this law, servants are placed under the
authority of their masters; and, by the same law, due regard being had to the
difference of their station, masters lie under certain obligations to their
servants. This analogy is greatly misunderstood; because men do not try it by
the law of love, which is the only true standard. Such is the import of
Paul&#8217;s phrase, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the same
things;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> for we are all ready enough to demand
what is due to ourselves; but, when our own duty comes to be performed, every
one attempts to plead exemption. It is chiefly, however, among persons of
authority and rank that injustice of this sort prevails.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Forbearing
threatenings.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Every expression of disdain,
arising from the pride of masters, is included in the single
word,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>threatenings.</i> They are charged not to
assume a lordly air or a terrific attitude, as if they were constantly
threatening some evil against their servants, when they have occasion to address
them. Threatenings, and every kind of barbarity, originate in this, that masters
look upon their servants as if they had been born for their sake alone, and
treat them as if they were of no more value than cattle. Under this one
description, Paul forbids every kind of disdainful and barbarous
treatment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Their Master and
yours.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> A very necessary warning. What is there
which we will not dare to attempt against our inferiors, if they have no ability
to resist, and no means of obtaining redress, &#8212; if no avenger, no
protector appears, none who will be moved by compassion to listen to their
complaints? It happens here, in short, according to the common proverb, that
Impunity is the mother of Licentiousness. But Paul here reminds them, that,
while masters possess authority over their servants, they have themselves the
same Master in heaven, to whom they must render an account.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And there is no respect of persons
with him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> A regard to
<i>persons</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">blinds our eyes, so as to leave no room for law or
justice; but Paul affirms that it is of no value in the sight of God. By
<i>person</i> is meant anything about a man which does not belong to the real
question, and which we take into account in forming a judgment. Relationship,
beauty, rank, wealth, friendship, and everything of this sort, gain our favor;
while the opposite qualities produce contempt and sometimes hatred. As those
absurd feelings arising from the sight of a <i>person</i> have the greatest
possible influence on human judgments, those who are invested with power are apt
to flatter themselves, as if God would countenance such corruptions. &#8220;Who
is he that God should regard him, or defend his interest against mine?&#8221;
Paul, on the contrary, informs masters that they are mistaken if they suppose
that their servants will be of little or no account before God, because they are
so before men. &#8220;God is no respecter of persons,&#8221; (Acts 10:34,) and
the cause of the meanest man will not be a whit less regarded by him than that
of the loftiest monarch.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Finally.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Resuming his general exhortations, he again enjoins them to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be
strong,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; to summon up courage and vigor;
for there is always much to enfeeble us, and we are ill fitted to resist. But
when our weakness is considered, an exhortation like this would have no effect,
unless <i>the Lord</i> were present, and stretched out his hand to render
assistance, or rather, unless he supplied us with all the power. Paul therefore
adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As if he had said, &#8220;&#8216;You have
no right to reply, that you have not the ability; for all that I require of you
is, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be strong in the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino">&#8221; To explain his meaning more fully,
he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the power of his
might,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> which tends greatly to increase our
confidence, particularly as it shews the remarkable assistance which God usually
bestows upon believers. If the Lord aids us by <i>his mighty power,</i> we have
no reason to shrink from the combat. But it will be asked, What purpose did it
serve to enjoin the Ephesians to be strong in the Lord&#8217;s mighty power,
which they could not of themselves accomplish? I answer, there are two clauses
here which must be considered. He exhorts them to be courageous, but at the same
time reminds them to ask from God a supply of their own deficiencies, and
promises that, in answer to their prayers, the power of God will be
displayed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Put on the whole armor.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> God has furnished us
with various defensive weapons, provided we do not indolently refuse what is
offered. But we are almost all chargeable with carelessness and hesitation in
using the offered grace; just as if a soldier, about to meet the enemy, should
take his helmet, and neglect his shield. To correct this security, or, we should
rather say, this indolence, Paul borrows a comparison from the military art, and
bids us </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>put on the whole armor of
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We ought to be prepared on all sides, so
as to want nothing. The Lord offers to us arms for repelling every kind of
attack. It remains for us to apply them to use, and not leave them hanging on
the wall. To quicken our vigilance, he reminds us that we must not only engage
in open warfare, but that we have a crafty and insidious foe to encounter, who
frequently lies in ambush; for such is the import of the apostle&#8217;s phrase,
THE WILES

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the
devil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we
wrestle</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fb65</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> To impress them still more deeply with
their danger, he points out the nature of the enemy, which he illustrates by a
comparative statement, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not
against flesh and blood.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The meaning is, that
our difficulties are far greater than if we had to fight with men. There we
resist human strength, sword is opposed to sword, man contends with man, force
is met by force, and skill by skill; but here the case is widely different. All
amounts to this, that our enemies are such as no human power can withstand. By
<i>flesh and blood</i> the apostle denotes men, who are so denominated in order
to contrast them with spiritual assailants. This is no bodily
struggle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us remember this when the injurious treatment of
others provokes us to revenge. Our natural disposition would lead us to direct
all our exertions against the men themselves; but this foolish desire will be
restrained by the consideration that the men who annoy us are nothing more than
darts thrown by the hand of Satan. While we are employed in destroying those
darts, we lay ourselves open to be wounded on all sides. To <i>wrestle with
flesh and blood</i> will not only be useless, but highly pernicious. We must go
straight to the enemy, who attacks and wounds us from his concealment, &#8212;
who slays before he appears.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But to return to Paul. He describes our enemy as
formidable, not to overwhelm us with fear, but to quicken our diligence and
earnestness; for there is a middle course to be observed. When the enemy is
neglected, he does his utmost to oppress us with sloth, and afterwards disarms
us by terror; so that, ere the engagement has commenced, we are vanquished. By
speaking of the power of the enemy, Paul labors to keep us more on the alert. He
had already called him <i>the devil,</i> but now employs a variety of epithets,
to make the reader understand that this is not an enemy who may be safely
despised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Against principalities, against
powers.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Still, his object in producing alarm is
not to fill us with dismay, but to excite us to caution. He calls them
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kosmokra&gt;torav</font><font face="Palatino">,
that is, <i>princes of the</i> <i>world;</i> but he explains himself more fully
by adding &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the darkness
of the world.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The devil reigns in the world,
because the world is nothing else than darkness. Hence it follows, that the
corruption of the world gives way to the kingdom of the devil; for he could not
reside in a pure and upright creature of God, but all arises from the sinfulness
of men. By <i>darkness,</i> it is almost unnecessary to say, are meant unbelief
and ignorance of God, with the consequences to which they lead. As the whole
world is covered with darkness, the devil is called &#8220;the prince of this
world.&#8221; (John 14:30.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By calling it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wickedness,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
he denotes the malignity and cruelty of the devil, and, at the same time,
reminds us that the utmost caution is necessary to prevent him from gaining an
advantage. For the same reason, the epithet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spiritual</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">is applied; for, when the enemy is invisible, our
danger is greater. There is emphasis, too, in the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
heavenly</i></font><font face="Palatino"> places; for the elevated station from
which the attack is made gives us greater trouble and
difficulty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">An argument drawn from this passage by the
<i>Manicheans,</i> to support their wild notion of two principles, is easily
refuted. They supposed the devil to be
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnti&gt;qeon</font><font face="Palatino">)
an <i>antagonist deity,</i> whom the righteous God would not subdue without
great exertion. For Paul does not ascribe to devils a <i>principality,</i> which
they seize without the consent, and maintain in spite of the opposition, of the
Divine Being, &#8212; but a
<i>principality</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">which, as Scripture everywhere asserts, God, in
righteous judgment, yields to them over the wicked. The inquiry is, not what
power they have in opposition to God, but how far they ought to excite our
alarm, and keep us on our guard. Nor is any countenance here given to the
belief, that the devil has formed, and keeps for himself, the middle region of
the air. Paul does not assign to them a fixed territory, which they can call
their own, but merely intimates that they are engaged in hostility, and occupy
an elevated station.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore take unto
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Though our enemy is so powerful, Paul does
not infer that we must throw away our spears, but that we must prepare our minds
for the battle. A promise of victory is, indeed, involved in the exhortation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that ye may be
able.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> If we only
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>put on the whole armor of
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and fight valiantly to the end, we shall
certainly
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>stand.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
On any other supposition, we would be discouraged by the number and variety of
the contests; and therefore he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the evil
day.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this expression he rouses them from
security, bids them prepare themselves for hard, painful, and dangerous
conflicts, and, at the same time, animates them with the hope of victory; for
amidst the greatest dangers they will be safe.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And having done
all.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> They are thus directed to cherish
confidence through the whole course of life. There will be no danger which may
not be successfully met by the power of God; nor will any who, with this
assistance, fight against Satan, fail in the day of battle.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Stand
therefore.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Now follows a description of the
arms which they were enjoined to wear. We must not, however, inquire very
minutely into the meaning of each word; for an allusion to military customs is
all that was intended. Nothing can be more idle than the extraordinary pains
which some have taken to discover the reason why
<i>righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">is made a
<i>breastplate</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
instead of a <i>girdle.</i> Paul&#8217;s design was to touch briefly on the most
important points required in a Christian, and to adapt them to the comparison
which he had already used.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Truth,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
which means sincerity of mind, is compared to a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>girdle.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Now, a girdle was, in ancient times, one of the most important parts of military
armor. Our attention is thus directed to the fountain of sincerity; for the
purity of the gospel ought to remove from our minds all guile, and from our
hearts all hypocrisy. Secondly, he recommends
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteousness,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and desires that it should be a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>breastplate</i></font><font face="Palatino">
for protecting the breast. Some imagine that this refers to a freely bestowed
righteousness, or the imputation of righteousness, by which pardon of sin is
obtained. But such matters ought not, I think, to have been mentioned on the
present occasion; for the subject now under discussion is a blameless life. He
enjoins us to be adorned, first, with integrity, and next with a devout and holy
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And your feet
shod.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The allusion, if I mistake not, is to the
military <i>greaves;</i> for they were always reckoned a part of the armor, and
were even used for domestic purposes. As soldiers covered their legs and feet to
protect them against cold and other injuries, so we must be shod
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with the
gospel,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> if we would pass unhurt through the
world. It is </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the gospel of
peace,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> and it is so called, as every reader
must perceive, from its effects; for it is the message of our reconciliation to
God, and nothing else gives peace to the conscience. But what is the meaning of
the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>preparation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i>
Some explain it as an injunction to be <i>prepared</i> for the gospel; but it is
the effect of the gospel which I consider to be likewise expressed by this term.
We are enjoined to lay aside every hinderance, and to be prepared both for
journey and for war. By nature we dislike exertion, and want agility. A rough
road and many other obstacles retard our progress, and we are discouraged by the
smallest annoyance. On these accounts, Paul holds out the gospel as the fittest
means for undertaking and performing the expedition. Erasmus proposes a
circumlocution, (<i>ut sitis parati</i>,) <i>that ye may be</i> <i>prepared;</i>
but this does not appear to convey the true
meaning.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>16.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Taking the shield of
faith.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Though
<i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">and <i>the</i> <i>word of God</i> are one, yet Paul
assigns to them two distinct offices. I call them one, because the word is the
object of faith, and cannot be applied to our use but by faith; as faith again
is nothing, and can do nothing, without the word. But Paul, neglecting so subtle
a distinction, allowed himself to expatiate at large on the military armor. In
the first Epistle to the Thessalonians he gives both to faith and to love the
name of a <i>breastplate,</i> &#8212; &#8220;putting on the breastplate of faith
and love,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 5:8.) All that was intended, therefore, was obviously this,
&#8212; &#8220; He who possesses the excellencies of character which are here
described is protected on every hand.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And yet it is not without reason that the most
necessary instruments of warfare &#8212; a sword and a shield &#8212; are
compared to faith, and to the word of God. In the spiritual combat, these two
hold the highest rank. By faith we repel all the attacks of the devil, and by
the word of God the enemy himself is slain. If the word of God shall have its
efficacy upon us through faith, we shall be more than sufficiently armed both
for opposing the enemy and for putting him to flight. And what shall we say of
those who take from a Christian people the word of God? Do they not rob them of
the necessary armor, and leave them to perish without a struggle? There is no
man of any rank who is not bound to be a soldier of Christ. But if we enter the
field unarmed, if we want our sword, how shall we sustain that
character?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherewith ye shall be able to
quench all the darts.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> But <i>quench</i> appears
not to be the proper word. Why did he not use, instead of it, <i>ward off</i> or
<i>shake off,</i> or some such word?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Quench</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">is far more expressive; for it is adapted to the
epithet applied to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>darts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
darts</i></font><font face="Palatino"> of Satan are not only sharp and
penetrating, but &#8212; what makes them more destructive &#8212; they are

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And take the helmet of

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;520508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Thessalonians 5:8,) &#8220;the <i>hope</i> of salvation&#8221; is said to be a
<i>helmet</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
which I consider to be in the same sense as this passage. The head is protected
by the best
<i>helmet</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
when, elevated by <i>hope,</i> we look up towards heaven to that
<i>salvation</i> which is promised. It is only therefore by becoming the object
of <i>hope</i> that <i>salvation</i> is a
<i>helmet.</i></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praying always with all
prayer.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Having instructed the Ephesians to put
on their armor, he now enjoins them to fight by prayer. This is the true method.
To call upon God is the chief exercise of faith and hope; and it is in this way
that we obtain from God every blessing.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Prayer</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>supplication</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">are not greatly different from each other, except
that <i>supplication</i> is only one branch of
<i>prayer</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With all
perseverance.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We are exhorted to persevere in
prayer. Every tendency to weariness must be counteracted by a cheerful
performance of the duty. With unabated ardor we must continue our prayers,
though we do not immediately obtain what we desire. If, instead of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with all
perseverance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> some would render it,
<i>with all</i> EARNESTNESS, I would have no objection to the
change.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what is the meaning of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>always?</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Having already spoken of continued application, does he twice repeat the same
thing? I think not. When everything flows on prosperously, &#8212; when we are
easy and cheerful, we seldom feel any strong excitement to prayer, &#8212; or
rather, we never flee to God, but when we are driven by some kind of distress.
Paul therefore desires us to allow no opportunity to pass, &#8212; on no
occasion to neglect prayer; so that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>praying
always</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is the same thing with praying both in
prosperity and in adversity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For all
saints.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> There is not a moment of our life at
which the duty of prayer may not be urged by our own wants. But unremitting
prayer may likewise be enforced by the consideration, that the necessities of
our brethren ought to move our sympathy. And when is it that some members of the
church are not suffering distress, and needing our assistance? If, at any time,
we are colder or more indifferent about prayer than we ought to be, because we
do not feel the pressure of immediate necessity, &#8212; let us instantly
reflect how many of our brethren are worn out by varied and heavy afflictions,
&#8212; are weighed down by sore perplexity, or are reduced to the lowest
distress. If reflections like these do not rouse us from our lethargy, we must
have hearts of stone. But are we to pray for believers only? Though the apostle
states the claims of the godly, he does not exclude others. And yet in prayer,
as in all other kind offices, our first care unquestionably is due to the
saints.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And for
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For himself, in a particular manner, he
enjoins the Ephesians to pray. Hence we infer that there is no man so richly
endowed with gifts as not to need this kind of assistance from his brethren, so
long as he remains in this world. Who will ever be better entitled to plead
exemption from this necessity than Paul? Yet he entreats the prayers of his
brethren, and not hypocritically, but from an earnest desire of their aid. And
what does he wish that they should ask for
him?</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> That utterance may be given
to me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What then? Was he habitually dumb, or
did fear restrain him from making an open profession of the gospel? By no means;
but there was reason to fear lest his splendid commencement should not be
sustained by his future progress. Besides, his zeal for proclaiming the gospel
was so ardent that he was never satisfied with his exertions. And indeed, if we
consider the weight and importance of the subject, we shall all acknowledge that
we are very far from being able to handle it in a proper manner. Accordingly he
adds,</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As I ought to
speak;</i></font><font face="Palatino"> meaning, that to proclaim the truth of
the gospel as it ought to be proclaimed, is a high and rare attainment. Every
word here deserves to be carefully weighed. Twice he uses the expression
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>boldly,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
&#8212; &#8220;that I may open my mouth <i>boldly,</i>&#8221; &#8220;that
therein I may speak <i>boldly.</i>&#8221; Fear hinders us from preaching Christ
openly and fearlessly, while the absence of all restraint and disguise in
confessing Christ is demanded from his ministers. Paul does not ask for himself
the powers of an acute debater, or, I should rather say, of a dexterous sophist,
that he might shield himself from his enemies by false pretences. It is, <i>that
I may open my mouth,</i> to make a clear and strong confession; for when the
mouth is half shut, the sounds which it utters are doubtful and confused. <i>To
open the mouth,</i> therefore, is to speak with perfect freedom, without the
smallest dread.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But does not Paul discover unbelief, when he
entertains doubts as to his own stedfastness, and implores the intercession of
others? No. He does not, like unbelievers, seek a remedy which is contrary to
the will of God, or inconsistent with his word. The only aids on which he relies
are those which he knows to be sanctioned by the Divine promise and approbation.
It is the command of God, that believers shall pray for one another. How
consoling then must it be to each of them to learn that the care of his
salvation is enjoined on all the rest, and to be informed by God himself that
the prayers of others on his behalf are not poured out in vain! Would it be
lawful to refuse what the Lord himself has offered? Each believer, no doubt,
ought to have been satisfied with the Divine assurance, that as often as he
prayed he would be heard. But if, in addition to all the other manifestations of
his kindness, God were pleased to declare that he will listen to the prayers of
others in our behalf, would it be proper that this bounty should be slighted, or
rather, ought we not to embrace it with open arms?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us therefore remember that Paul, when he resorted
to the intercessions of his brethren, was influenced by no distrust or
hesitation. His eagerness to obtain them arose from his resolution that no
privilege which the Lord had given him should be overlooked. How absurdly then
do Papists conclude from Paul&#8217;s example, that we ought to pray to the
dead! Paul was writing to the Ephesians, to whom he had it in his power to
communicate his sentintents. But what intercourse have we with the dead? As well
might they argue that we ought to invite angels to our feasts and
entertainments, because among men friendship is promoted by such kind
offices.</font><br></div>

know.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Uncertain or false reports frequently
produce uneasiness, chiefly, no doubt, in weak minds, but sometimes also in
thoughtful and steady persons. To prevent this danger, Paul sends Tychicus, from
whom the Ephesians would receive full information. The holy solicitude which
Paul felt about the interests of religion, or, to use his own language,
&#8220;the care of all the churches,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;471128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 11:28,) was thus strikingly evinced. When death stood constantly
before his eyes, neither the dread of death, nor anxiety about himself,
prevented him from making provision for the most distant churches. Another man
would have said, &#8220;My own affairs require all the attention I can give. It
would be more reasonable that all should run to my assistance, than that they
should expect from me the smallest relief.&#8221; But Paul acts a different
part, and sends in every direction to strengthen the churches which he had
founded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Tychicus is commended, that his statements may be
more fully believed. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A faithful
minister in the Lord.</i> </font><font face="Palatino">It is not easy to say,
whether this refers to the public ministry of the church, or to the private
attentions which Paul had received from Tychicus. This uncertainty arises from
these two expressions being connected,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a beloved brother and faithful
minister in the Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The former refers to
Paul, to whom the second may be supposed also to apply. I am more inclined,
however, to understand it as denoting the public ministry; for I do not think it
probable that Paul would have sent any man who did not hold such a rank in the
church, as would secure the respectful attention of the
Ephesians.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b>

immediately afterwards, Paul mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
I do not object to that interpretation, or rather, it agrees better with the
context. He wishes the Ephesians to be peaceable and quiet among themselves; and

<i>uncorruptedness,</i> which deserves attention on account of the beauty of the
metaphor. Paul intended to state indirectly, that, when the heart of man is free
from all hypocrisy, it will be free from all corruption. This prayer conveys to
us the instruction, that the only way of enjoying the light of the Divine
countenance is to love <i>sincerely</i> God&#8217;s own Son, in whom his love
toward us has been declared and confirmed. But let there be no hypocrisy; for
most men, while they are not unwilling to make some professions of religion,
entertain exceedingly low notions of Christ, and worship him with pretended
homage. I wish there were not so many instances in the present day to prove that

Jews?</font><br></div>

&#8220;From this portion of sacred history, we are not at liberty to conclude

differed from each other about doctrine. Unquestionably, so far as relates to
doctrine, Peter was of the same opinion with Paul on this subject, that it was
lawful for a Jew to live on terms of friendship with believing Gentiles. &#8212;

interpretibus,&#8217; (tortured by interpreters,) if it be true, as Winer
affirms, that there are no less than 250 modes of explanation, most of which are
stated and reviewed by Koppe, Berger, Keil, Bonitz, Weigand, and Scheft.&#8221;
&#8212; (Bloomfield.) Schott remarks, that the bare fact of upwards of 250
interpretations makes it impossible to deny that some obscurity attaches to the
Apostle&#8217;s language in this passage, arising chiefly from mere brevity of
style, but judiciously adds, that, had there not been many commentators more
eager to bring forward anything that has the appearance of novelty, than to
investigate the ordinary meaning of the terms, the scope of the passage, and the
doctrinal statements and reasonings contained in the writings of the Apostle
Paul, the interpretations would never have swelled to so large an amount.

is sufficient to obtain grace, let him be accursed. &#8212; Sessio vii. <i>De

observations, by the late Rev. Dr. Dick, on a phrase which appears to defy
translation. &#8220;This barbarous phrase <i>opus operatum</i>, which is utterly
unintelligible without an explanation, signifies the external celebration of the
sacraments. It has been defined by Popish writers to be the performance of the
external work without any internal motion; and sacraments have been said to
confer grace <i>ex opere operato</i>, because, besides the exhibition and
application of the sign, no good motion is necessary in the receiver. All that
is required is, that no obstacle shall be opposed to the reception of grace, and
the only obstacle is mortal sin.&#8221; &#8212; Lectares on Theology, volume

College of the <i>Sorbonne</i>, in Paris, takes its name from <i>Robert de
Serbonne</i>, who founded it in the middle of the thirteenth century. Its
reputation for theological learning, philosophy, classical literature, and all
that formerly constituted a liberal education, was deservedly high. In the
Doctors of the Sorbonne the Reformation found powerful adversaries. The very
name of this university, to which the greatest scholars in Europe were
accustomed to pay deference, would be regarded by the multitude with blind
veneration. If such men as Calvin, Beza, Melanchthon, and Luther, were prepared
by talents and acquirements of the first order to brave the terrors of that
name, they must have frequently lamented its influence on many of their hearers.
Yet our author meets undaunted this formidable array, and enters the field with
the full assurance of victory. Despising, as we naturally do, the weak
superstitions and absurd tenets held by the Church of Rome, we are apt to
underrate our obligations to the early champions of the Reformed faith, who
encountered, with success, those veteran warriors, and &#8216;contended
earnestly for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.&#8217;

The expression is general, though it seems to refer to those works of the flesh
of which he had made mention in the 19th and following verses of the foregoing
chapter. &#8216;If in any of these faults any person should happen to be
overtaken;&#8217; the last word seems to denote somewhat of a surprise, by which
a man might be drawn into a sin, without any previous deliberate purpose or
design; a sin committed through some extraordinary and sudden temptation. The
last words of the verse, &#8216;lest thou also be tempted,&#8217; seem plainly

thus it differs from a pledge, which is somewhat given for the security of a

&#8220;This is a pleasant kind of drunkenness, which stimulates you, not to
wanton dances or foolish songs, by which the Gentiles render homage to their

&#8220;One peculiarity in this injunction has been usually overlooked. What is
instructive on either side is not enforced, but what is necessary to direct and
hallow such an instinct is inculcated. The woman loves in deep, undying
sympathy; but, to teach her how this fondness should know and fill its
appropriate sphere, she is commanded to obey and honor. The man, on the other
hand, feels that his position is to govern; but, to shew him what should be the
essence and means of his government, he is enjoined to love.&#8221; &#8212;

&#8220;Plutarch tells us, (Symp. l. 2. page 638,) that wrestling was the most
artful and subtle of all the ancient games, and that the name of it
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pa&gt;lh</font><font face="Palatino">)
was derived from a word, which signifies to throw a man down by deceit and
craft. And it is certain that persons who understand this exercise have many
fetches, and turns, and changes of posture, which they make use of to supplant
and trip up their adversaries. And it is with great justice, that a state of
persecution is compared with it; since many are the arts, arising from the
terrors of worldly evil on the one hand, and the natural love which men have to
life, liberty, plenty, and the pleasures of life, on the other, that the devil
makes use of to circumvent and foil them.&#8221; &#8212;

agonistic metaphors; and here the agonistic is not less suitable than the
military. So in a similar passage of Max. Tyr. Diss. Version 9, volume 1 page
79, ed. Reisk, we have mention of Socrates wrestling with <i>Melitus,</i> with
bonds and poison; next, the philosopher Plato wrestling with a tyrant&#8217;s
anger, a rough sea, and the greatest dangers; then, Xenophon struggling with the
prejudices of Tissaphernes, the snares of Ariaeus, the treachery of Meno, and
royal machinations; and, lastly, Diogenes struggling with adversaries even more
formidable, namely, poverty, infamy, hunger, and cold.&#8221; &#8212;
