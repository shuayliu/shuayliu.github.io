<div><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">TRANSLATOR&#8217;S
PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">IT may be natural to inquire why the Epistles to
Timothy and Titus have been less copiously illustrated by popular Commentaries
than the other writings of the Apostle Paul. The reason probably is, that they
are addressed chiefly to office-bearers, and not to private members of the
Church; though they abound largely in those doctrinal statements and practical
instructions which every Christian ought carefully to study.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">While fewer expositors than might have been desired
have devoted their labors to this portion of the word of God, the leading
subject of it has been ably handled in a different form. Not to mention the
early Fathers, it is sufficient to name &#8220;The Pastoral <i>Care,&#8221;
</i>&#8220;The Reformed Pastor,&#8221; and other kindred works, which have taken
their rank among the standard volumes of Christian Theology. <i>Besides
</i>elaborate treatises, extending over the whole field of ministerial labor,
detached parts of it have been sometimes selected for separate illustration. Of
every collection of books fitted to make</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;the man of God
perfect, thoroughly prepared</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">for
every good work,&#8221; (2 Timothy 3:17)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">a goodly portion relates to the duties of the
pastorate. It has been of unspeakable importance to the interests of religion,
and ought to be recorded to the praise of divine grace, that the valuable
instructions on this subject to which readers have access derive additional
weight from the holy lives and devoted zeal of their authors, who have only
inculcated on others what they had faithfully practiced. To all whose views are
directed to the sacred office, or who have already been invested with it, the
perusal of such books must be exceedingly advantageous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet here, as in everything else, let us
appeal</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;to the law and to
the <i>testimony.&#8221;</i>(Isaiah 8:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The foundation of every code of rules for guiding the
ministers of Christ must be sought, not in the judgments of uninspired men,
however able and judicious, but in the Holy Scriptures, and chiefly in the
Epistles to Timothy and Titus, the accurate interpretation of which is therefore
unspeakably valuable. CALVIN has examined them with his usual skill, and will be
heard with profound attention. His candor appears to more than ordinary
advantage. Never does he press the words of the Holy Spirit beyond what appears
to him to be their natural meaning, or depart from the rigid discharge of his
task as an expositor for the sake of giving undue prominence to his peculiar
views. On this point it may be sufficient to refer to his remarks on the
authority which some ministers of the gospel appear to have exercised over
others, as a specimen of his unshaken determination to adhere to the sacred
records, and of his utter indifference to any use that might be made of such
statements by those whose views of church-government differed from his own.
Nowhere is his sterling honesty more conspicuous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The notes to the present volume are enriched by
numerous extracts from a rare work &#8212; the Author&#8217;s Sermons on the two
Epistles to Timothy But for the strong and general desire that posterity should
listen to this great preacher, those Sermons would never have seen the light.
They were written down, as they flowed from his lips, in the same manner as the
extemporaneous Latin expositions of which some account has been given
elsewhere.While they are Expository Discourses, leaving no part of the two
Epistles unexplored, they are addressed to the great body of the Christian
people, and are distinguished by those homely and striking appeals, and that
marvelous felicity of language, which even his biographer Audin reluctantly
ascribes to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>TO THE MOST NOBLE AND TRULY CHRISTIAN
PRINCE,</b></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">EDWARD, DUKE OF
SOMERSET,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>EARL OF HERTFORD, ETC. PROTECTOR OF
ENGLAND</b></font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>AND IRELAND, AND ROYAL
TUTOR,</b></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">JOHN
CALVIN</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>OFFERS HIS
SALUTATIONS.</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE brilliant reputation, most noble Prince, not only
of your other virtues, altogether heroic, but especially of your distinguished
piety,<sup> </sup>produces so warm a love of you in the hearts of all good men,
even of those to whom you are unknown by face, that you must unavoidably be
regarded with extraordinary affection and reverence by all right-minded persons
in the kingdom of England, on whom hath been bestowed the privilege, not only of
beholding with their eyes those benefits which are admired by others who only
hear of them, but likewise of reaping all the advantage which a most excellent
governor can confer on the whole body of the people, and on every one of its
members. Nor is there any reason why the praises bestowed on you should be
suspected of falsehood, as if they proceeded from flatterers; for a clear proof
of them is to be found in your actions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When a pupil belongs to private life, and his wealth
is moderate, the work of a tutor is attended by difficulty; but you hold the
office of tutor, not of the King only, but of a very large kingdom, and you
discharge that office with such wisdom and skill, that all are astonished at
your success. That your virtue might not shine merely amidst the laws, and in a
peaceful state of the commonwealth, God has exhibited it to view in war also,
which has hitherto been conducted by you with not less prosperity and
valor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet the great and numerous difficulties which every
person readily perceived that you had experienced did not hinder you from making
the restoration of religion your principal object. That consideration is
certainly not less advantageous to the public benefit of the kingdom than it is
worthy of a Prince; for then do kingdoms enjoy solid prosperity and faithful
guardianship, when he, on whom they were founded, and by whom they are preserved
&#8212; the Son of God himself &#8212; rules over them. Thus you could not have
established more firmly the kingdom of England than by banishing idols and
setting up there the pure worship of God; for the true doctrine of godliness,
which had too long been crushed and buried by the sacrilegious tyranny of the
Roman Antichrist, cannot but be restored; and what is that, but to place Christ
on his throne? And this act, which in itself is excellent, is so much the more
praiseworthy on account of the small number of rulers in the present day who own
the subjection of their high rank to the spiritual scepter of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was therefore a high advantage to this illustrious
King, that such a person, related to him by blood, was the guide of his youth;
for, although the noble character of his mind is universally applauded, yet, in
training him to habits of manly firmness, and in regulating the English Church,
so long as his tender age does not permit him to discharge these duties, such an
instructor was much needed. And I doubt not that even now he acknowledges that
you were given to him by the peculiar kindness of God, in order that he might
soon afterwards receive his affairs from your hands in excellent
condition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For my own part, neither the distance of place nor my
humble rank could prevent me from congratulating you on your distinguished
success in promoting the glory of Christ. And since it has pleased God to make
me one of those by whose labors and exertions he has, in the present day, given
to the world the doctrine of the gospel in greater purity than before, why
should I not, however widely I am separated from you, express as strongly as I
can my reverence for you, who have been appointed, through the extraordinary
kindness of God, to be the defender and protector of that very doctrine? And
since I had no other proof of it to give, I thought that, at least as an earnest
of my regard, it was my duty to offer to you my Commentaries on two of
Paul&#8217;s Epistles. Nor have I selected at random the gift that I should
offer, but, in the exercise of my judgment, have selected that which appeared to
me to be the most suitable. Here Paul admonishes his beloved Timothy by what
kind of doctrine he must edify the Church of God, what vices and enemies he must
resist, and how many annoyances he must endure. He exhorts him to give way to no
difficulties, to vanquish all dangers by courage, to restrain by authority the
licentiousness of wicked men, and not to bestow gifts through eagerness to
obtain their favor. In short, in these two Epistles we have the true government
of the Church set before us in a lively picture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, since in order to restore the English Church,
which, along with almost every other part of Christendom, had been miserably
corrupted by the shocking wickedness of Popery, you employ your strenuous
efforts under the direction of your King, and for that purpose have many
Timothys under your charge, neither they nor you can direct your holy
transactions in a more profitable manner than by taking the rule here laid down
by Paul for your pattern. For there is nothing in them that is not highly
applicable to our times, and hardly anything that is necessary in the building
of the Church that may not likewise be drawn from them. I trust that my labor
will, at least, afford some assistance; but I choose that this should be known
by experience rather than that I should boast of it in words. If you, most noble
Prince, shall approve of it, I shall have abundant reason for congratulating
myself; and your remarkable kindness does not permit me to doubt that you will
take in good part that service which I now perform.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">May the Lord, in whose hand are the ends of the
earth, long uphold the safety and prosperity of the kingdom of England, adorn
its illustrious King with the royal spirit, bestow on him a large measure of all
blessings, and grant to you grace to persevere happily in your noble course,
that through you his renown may be more and more widely
extended.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">GENEVA, <i>25th July </i>1556.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">THE ARGUMENT</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>ON</b></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE FIRST
EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THIS Epistle appears to me to have been written more
for the sake of others than for the sake of Timothy, and that opinion will
receive the assent of those who shall carefully consider the whole matter. I do
not, indeed, deny that Paul intended also to teach and admonish him; but my,
view of the Epistle is, that it contains many things which it would have been
superfluous to write, if he had had to deal with Timothy alone. He was a young
man, not yet clothed with that authority which would have been sufficient for
restraining the headstrong men that rose up against him. It is manifest, from
the words used by Paul, that there were at that time some who were prodigiously
inclined to ostentation, and for that reason would not willingly yield to any
person, and who likewise burned with such ardent ambition, that they would never
have ceased to disturb the Church, had not a greater than Timothy interposed. It
is likewise manifest, that there were many things to be adjusted at Ephesus, and
that needed the approbation of Paul, and the sanction of his name. Having
therefore intended to give advice to Timothy on many subjects, he resolved at
the same time to advise others under the name of Timothy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b><i>In the first chapter</i></b>, he attacks some
ambitious persons who made their boast of discussing idle questions. It may
readily be concluded that they were Jews, who, while they pretended to have zeal
for the law, disregarded edification, and attended only to frivolous disputes.
It is an intolerable profanation of the law of God, to draw out of it nothing
that is profitable, but merely to pick up materials for talking and to abuse the
pretense of it for the purpose of burdening the Church with contemptible
trifles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Longer shall enough have such corruptions prevailed
in Popery; for what else was the scholastic theology than a huge chaos of empty
and useless speculations? And in our own day there are many who in order to
display their acuteness in handling the word of God, allow themselves to sport
with it in the same manner as if it were profane philosophy. Paul undertakes to
support Timothy in the correction of this vice, and points out what is the
principal instruction to be derived from the Law; that it may be evident that
they who use the Law in a different manner are corrupters of
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Next, that his authority may not be despised, after
having acknowledged his unworthiness he, at the same time, asserts in lofty
terms what he became through the grace of God. At length he concludes the
chapter by a solemn threatening, by means of which he both confirms Timothy in
sound doctrine and a good conscience, and fills others with terror and alarm, by
holding out to them the example of Hymenaeus and Alexander.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b><i>In the second chapter</i></b>, he enjoins that
public prayers be offered to God for all men, and especially for princes and
magistrates; and here, in passing, he likewise makes a remark on the advantage
which the world derives from civil government. He then mentions the reason why
we ought to pray for all men; namely, that God, by exhibiting to all the gospel
and Christ the Mediator, shews that he wishes all men to be saved; and he
likewise confirms this statement by his own apostleship, which was specially
appointed to the Gentiles. Next, he invites all men, whatever may be their
country or place of abode, to pray to God; and takes occasion for inculcating
that modesty and subjection which females ought to maintain in the holy
assembly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b><i>In the third chapter</i></b>, after having
declared the excellence of the bishop&#8217;s office, he delineates a true
bishop, and enumerates the qualifications required in him Next, he describes the
qualifications of deacons, and of the wives both of deacons and of bishops. And
in order that Timothy may be more diligent and conscientious in observing all
things, he reminds him what it is to be employed in the government of &#8220;the
Church, which is the house of God, and the pillar of truth.&#8221; Finally, he
mentions the chief and fundamental point of all heavenly doctrine &#8212; that
which relates to the Son of God manifested in the flesh; in comparison of which
all things else, to which he perceived that ambitious men were wholly devoted,
should be reckoned of no value.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to what follows, in the beginning of <b><i>the
fourth chapter</i></b>, the false doctrines about forbidding marriage and
various kinds of food, and the absurd fables which are at variance with this
doctrine, are severely condemned by him. Next, he adds, that he and all good
men, who hold this doctrine, have none for their adversaries but those who
cannot endure that men shall place their trust in the living God. At the close
of the chapter, he again fortifies Timothy by a new
exhortation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b><i>In the fifth chapter</i></b>, after having
recommended modesty and gentleness in reproofs, he reasons about widows, Who at
that time were admitted into the service of the Church. He enjoins that they
shall not be received indiscriminately, but only those who, having been approved
throughout their whole life, are arrived at sixty years of age, and have no
domestic tic. Hence he passes on to the elder&#8217;s, and explains how they
ought to conduct themselves, both in their manner of life and in the exercise of
discipline. This doctrine the Apostle seals by a solemn oath, and again forbids
him to admit any one heedlessly into the office of the eldership. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
exhorts him to drink wine, instead of water, for the preservation of his health.
At the clove of the chapter, he exhorts him to defer pronouncing judgment on
concealed transgressions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b><i>In the sixth chapter</i></b>, he gives
instruction concerning the duty of servants, and takes occasion to make a
vehement attack on false teachers, who, by disputing about unprofitable
speculations, are more eager for gain than for edification, and shews that
covetousness is a most deadly plague. He then returns to a solemn charge similar
to the former, that the exhortations which he now gives to Timothy may not be
ineffectual. Lastly, after having taken a passing notice of riches, he again
forbids Timothy to entangle himself with useless doctrines.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the ordinary Greek inscription, which states
that this Epistle was written from Laodicea, I do not agree with it; for since
Paul, writing to the Colossians while he was a prisoner, affirms that he had
never seen the Laodiceans, those who hold the opinion, which I reject, are
constrained to make two Laodiceas in Asia Minor, though only one is mentioned by
historians. Besides, when Paul went into Macedonia, he left Timothy at Ephesus,
as he expressly declares. He wrote this Epistle either on the road, before he
arrived there, or after having returned from the journey. Now Laodicea is
evidently at a greater distance from Macedonia than Ephesus is; and it is not
probable that Paul, on his return, went to Laodicea, passing by Ephesus,
especially since there were many reasons that urged him to visit it; and
therefore I rather think that he wrote it from some other place. But this is not
a matter of so much importance that I should wish to debate it with those who
are of an opposite opinion. Let every person follow his own judgment. I only
point out what &#8212; at least in my opinion &#8212; is more
probable.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Paul an
apostle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If he had written to Timothy
alone, it would have been unnecessary to claim this designation, and to maintain
it in the manner that he does. Timothy would undoubtedly have been satisfied
with having merely the name; for he knew that Paul was an Apostle of Christ, and
had no need of proof to convince him of it, being perfectly willing, and having
been long accustomed, to acknowledge it. He has his eye, therefore, chiefly on
others, who were not so ready to listen to him, or did not so easily believe his
words. For the sake of such persons, that they may not treat lightly what he
writes, he affirms that he is
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an Apostle of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the Appointment of God
our Savior, and of the Lord Jesus Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He confirms his apostleship by the <i>appointment or </i>command of God; for
no man can make himself to bean apostle, but he whom God hath appointed is a
true apostle, and worthy of the honor. Nor does he merely say, that he owes his
apostleship to God the Father, but ascribes it to Christ also; and, indeed, in
the government of the Church, the Father does nothing, but through the Son, and
therefore they both act together.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Savior</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>a title which he is more
frequently accustomed to assign to time Son; but it belongs to the Father also,
because it is he who gave the Son to us. Justly, therefore, is the glory of our
salvation ascribed to him. For how comes it that we are saved? It is because the
Father loved us in such a manner that he determined to redeem and save us
through the Son. He calls Christ
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>our
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>and this appellation is strictly
applicable to him; for then do we begin to have good hope, when we look to
Christ, since in him alone dwells all teat on which our salvation
rests.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To Timothy my own
son</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This commendation expresses no
small praise. Paul means by it, that he owns Timothy to be a true and not a
bastard son, and wishes that others should acknowledge him to be such; and he
even applauds Timothy in the same manner as if he were another Paul. But how
does this agree with the injunction given by Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew

<div><font face="Palatino">Or how does it agree with the declaration of the
Apostle,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Though ye have

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa2</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I reply, while Paul claims for himself the
appellation of father, he does it in such a manner as not to take away or
diminish the smallest portion of the honor which is due to God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
12:9.) It is a common proverb &#8220;That which is placed below another is not
at variance with it.&#8221; The name father, applied to Paul, with reference to
God, belongs to this class. God alone is the Father of all in faith, because he
regenerates us all by his word, and by the power of his Spirit, and because none
but he bestows faith. But they whom he is graciously pleased to employ as his
ministers for that purpose, are likewise allowed to share with him in his honor,
while, at the same time, He parts with nothing that belongs to himself. Thus
God, and God alone, strictly speaking, was Timothy&#8217;s spiritual Father; but
Paul, who was God&#8217;s minister in begetting Timothy, lays claim to this
title, by what may be called a subordinate right.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Grace, mercy,
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">. So far as relates to the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he has departed from his ordinary custom in introducing it, moved, perhaps,
by his extraordinary affection for Timothy. Besides, he does not observe the
exact order; for he places first what ought to love been last, namely, the
<i>grace </i>which flows from mercy. For the reason why God at first receives us
into favor and why he loves us is, that he is merciful. But it is not unusual to
mention the cause after the effect, for the sake of explanation. As to the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grace

First, he reminds Timothy why he was besought to remain at Ephesus. It was with
great reluctance, and through hard necessity, that he parted with a companion so
dearly beloved and so faithful, in order that he might laboriously hold the part
of his deputy, which no other man would have been competent to fill; and,
therefore, Timothy must have been powerfully excited by this consideration, not
only not to throw away his time, but to conduct himself in an excellent and
distinguished manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I wish that thou shouldst forbid
any.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Thus, by way of inference, he
exhorts him to oppose the false teachers who corrupted pure doctrine. In the
injunction given to Timothy, to occupy his place at Ephesus, we ought to observe
the holy anxiety of the Apostle; for while he labored so much to collect many
churches he did not leave the former churches destitute of a pastor. And indeed,
as an ancient writer remarks, &#8220;To keep what has been gained is not a
smaller virtue than to make new acquisitions.&#8221; The word <i>forbid
</i>denotes power; for Paul wishes to arm him with power to restrain
others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not to teach
differently</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Greek word
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eJterodidaskalei~n</font><font face="Palatino">)
which Paul employs, is a compound, and, therefore, may either be translated,
&#8220;to teach differently,&#8221; or after a new method, or, &#8220;to teach a
different doctrine.&#8221; The translation given by Erasmus, <i>(sectari,)
&#8220;</i>to follow,&#8221; does not satisfy me; because it might be understood
to apply to the hearers. Now Paul means those who, for the sake of ambition,
brought forward a new doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If we read it, &#8220;to teach differently,&#8221;
the meaning will be more expensive; for by this expression he will forbid
Timothy to permit any new forms of teaching to be introduced, which do not agree
with the true and pure doctrine which he had taught. Thus, in the Second
Epistle, he recommends
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpotu&gt;pwsiv</font><font face="Palatino">,<b>
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
is, a lively picture of his doctrine.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 1:13.) For, as the truth of God is one, so is there but one plain manner
of teaching it, which is free from false ornament, and which partakes more of
the majesty of the Spirit than of the parade of human eloquence. Whoever departs
from that, disfigures and corrupts the doctrine itself; and, therefore,
&#8220;to teach differently,&#8221; must relate to the form.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If we read it, &#8220;to teach something
different,&#8221; it will relate to the matter. Yet it is worthy of observation,
that we give the name of another doctrine not only to that which is openly at
variance with the pure doctrine of the gospel, but to everything that either
corrupts the pure gospel by new and borrowed inventions, or obscures it by
ungodly speculations. For all the inventions of men are so many corruptions of
the gospel; and they who make sport of the Scriptures, as ungodly people are
accustomed to do, so as to turn Christianity into an act of display, darken the
gospel. His manner of teaching therefore, is entirely opposed to the word of
God, and to that purity &#8212; of doctrine in which Paul enjoins the Ephesians
to continue.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And not to give heed to
fables</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He applies the term
&#8220;fables,&#8221; in my opinion, not only to contrived falsehoods, but to
trifles or fooleries which have no solidity; for it is possible that something
which is not false may yet be fabulous. In this sense, Suetonius speaks of
fabulous history,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa5</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
Livy employs the word <i>fabulari</i>, &#8220;to relate fables,&#8221; as
denoting useless and foolish talk. And, undoubtedly, the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mu~qov</font><font face="Palatino">,
(which Paul here employs,) is equivalent to the Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">fluari&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>that is, &#8220;trifles.&#8221; Moreover, by bringing forward one class by
way of example, he has removed all doubt; for disputes about genealogies are
enumerated by him amongst fables, not because everything that can be said about
them is fictitious, but because it is useless and unprofitable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage, therefore, may thus be explained:
&#8212; &#8221;Let them not give heed to fables of that character and
description to which genealogies belong.&#8221; And that is actually the
fabulous history of which Suetonius speaks, and which even among grammarians,
has always been justly ridiculed by persons of sound judgment; for it was
impossible not to regard as ridiculous that curiosity which, neglecting useful
knowledge, spent the whole life in examining the genealogy of Achilles and Ajax,
and wasted its powers in reckoning up the sons of Priam. If this be not endured
in childish knowledge, in which there is room for that which affords pleasure,
how much more intolerable is it heavenly wisdom<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa6</font></sup><font face="Palatino">?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to genealogies haste have

labyrinth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which produce

fruit; for every tiling that does not edify ought to be rejected, although it
has no other fault; and everything that is of no avail but for raising
contentions, ought to be doubly condemned. And such are all the subtle questions
on which ambitious men exercise their faculties. Let us, therefore, remember,
that all doctrines must be tried by this rule, that those which contribute to
edification may be approved, and that those which give ground for unprofitable
disputes may be rejected as unworthy of the Church of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If this test had been applied during several
centuries, although religion had been stained by many errors, at least that
diabolical art of disputing, Which has obtained the appellation of Scholastic
Theology, would not have prevailed to so great an extent. For what does that
theology contain but contentions or idle speculations, from which no advantage
is derived? Accordingly, the more learned a man is in it, we ought to account
him the more wretched. I am aware of the plausible excuses by which it is
defended, but they will never make out that Paul has spoken falsely in
condemning, everything of the sort.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rather than the edification of
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa8</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Subtleties of this description edify in pride, and edify in vanity, but not in
God. I He calls it &#8220;the edification of God,&#8221; either because God
approves of it, or because it is agreeable to the nature of God.<b>

faith; and by this term he does not exclude the love of our neighbor, or the
fear of God, or repentance; for what are all these but fruits of
&#8220;faith&#8221; which always produces the fear of God? Knowing that all the
worship of God is founded on faith alone, he therefore reckoned it enough to
mention &#8220;faith,&#8221; on which all the rest depend.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Those unprincipled men with whom Timothy had to deal
boasted of having the law on their side, in consequence of which Paul
anticipates, and shews that the law gives them no support but was even opposed
to them, and that it agreed perfectly with the gospel which he had taught. The
defense set up by them was not unlike that which is pleaded by those who, in the
present day, subject the word of God to torture. They tell us that we aim at
nothing else than to destroy sacred theology, as if they alone nourished it in
their bosom. They spoke of the law in such a manner as to exhibit Paul in an
odious light. And what is his reply? In order to scatter those clouds of
smoke,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
comes frankly forward, by way of anticipation, and proves that his doctrine is
in perfect harmony with the law, and that the law is utterly abused by those who
employ it for any other purpose. In like manner, when we now define what is
meant by true theology, it is clearly evident that we desire the restoration of
that which had been wretchedly torn and disfigured by those triflers who, puffed
up by the empty title of theologians, are acquainted with nothing but vapid and
unmeaning trifles.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good
conscience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>it follows, on the other
hand, that they who turn the teaching of it into curious questions are wicked
expounders of the law. Besides, it is of no great importance whither the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>be regarded in this passage as relating, to both tables of the law, or only
to the second table. we are commanded to love God with our whole heart, and our
neighbors as ourselves; but when love is spoken of in Scripture, it is more
frequently limited to the second part. On the present occasion I should not
hesitate to understand by it the love both of God and of our neighbor, if Paul
had employed the word <i>love </i>alone; but when he adds, &#8220;faith, and a
good conscience, and a pure heart,&#8221; the interpretation which I am now to
give will not be at variance with his intention, and will agree well with the
scope of the passage. The sum of the law is this, that are may worship God with
true faith and a pure conscience, and that we may love one another. Whosoever
turns aside from this corrupts the law of God by twisting it to a different
purpose.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here arises a doubt, that Paul appears to prefer
&#8220;love&#8221; to &#8220;faith.&#8221; I reply, they who are of that opinion
reason in an excessively childish manner; for, if love is first mentioned, it
does not therefore hold the first rank of honor, since Paul shows also that it
springs front faith. Now the cause undoubtedly goes before its effect. And if we
carefully weights the whole context, what Paul says is of the same import as if
he had said, &#8220;The law was given to us for this purpose, that it might
instruct us in faith, which is the mother of a good conscience and of
lose.&#8221; Thus we must begin with faith, and not with love.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;A pure heart&#8221; and &#8220;a good
conscience&#8221; do not greatly differ from each other. Both proceed from
faith; for, as to a pure heart, it is said that &#8220;God purifieth hearts by
faith.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441509&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:9.) As to a good conscience, Peter declares that it is founded on the
resurrection of Christ.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600321&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 3:21.) From this passage we also learn that there is no true love where
there is not fear of God and uprightness of conscience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor is it unworthy of observation that to each of
them he adds an epithet;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa11</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
for, as nothing is more common, so nothing is more easy, than to boast of faith
and a good conscience. But how few are there who prove by their actions that
they are free from all hypocrisy! Especially it is proper to observe the epithet
Which he bestows on &#8220;faith,&#8221; when he calls it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unfeigned</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
by which he means that the profession of it is insincere, when we do not
perceive a good conscience, and when love is not manifested. Now since the
salvation of men rests on faith, and since the perfect worship of God rests on
faith and a good conscience and love, we need not wonder if Paul makes the sum
of the law to consist of them.</font><br></div>

seized on this shield for their defense &#8220;What then? Do you wish to have
the law buried, and blotted out of the remembrance of men?&#8221; In order to
repel this calumny, Paul acknowledges that &#8220;the law is good,&#8221; but
contends that we are required to make a lawful use of it. Here he argues from
the use of cognate terms; for the word <i>lawful </i>(legitimus) is derived from
the word <i>law </i>(<i>lex</i>). But he goes still further, and shews that the
law agrees excellently with the doctrine which it teaches; and he even directs
it against them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the law is not made for
a righteous man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. The </i>apostle did not
intend to argue about the whole office of the law, but views it in reference to
men. It frequently happens that they Who wish to be regarded as the greatest
zealots for the law, give evidence by their whole life that they are the
greatest despires of it. A remarkable and striking instance of this is found in
those who maintain the righteousness of works and defend free &#8212; will.
&#8216;They have continually in their mouth these words, &#8220;Perfect
holiness, merits, satisfactions;&#8221; but their whole life cries out against
them, that they are outrageously wicked and ungodly, that they provoke in every
possible way the wrath of God, and fearlessly set his judgment at naught They
extol in lofty terms the free choice of good and evil; but they openly shew, by
their actions, that they are the slaves of Satan, and are most firmly held by
him in the chains of slavery.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having such adversaries, in order to restrain their
haughty insolence, Paul remonstrates that the law is, as it were, the sword of
God to slay them; and that neither he nor any like him have reason for viewing
the law with dread or aversion; for it is not opposed to righteous persons, that
is, to the godly and to those who willingly obey God. I am well aware that some
learned men draw an ingenious sense. Out of these words; as if Paul were
treating theologically about the nature of &#8220;the law.&#8221; They argue
that the law has nothing to do with the sons of God, who have been regenerated
by the Spirit; because it was not given for righteous persons. But the
connection in which these words occur shuts me up to the necessity of giving a
more simple interpretation to this statement. He takes for granted the well
&#8212; known sentiment, that &#8220;from bad manners have sprung good
laws,&#8221; and maintains that the law of God was given in order to restrain
the licentiousness of wicked men; because they who are good of their own accord
do not need the authoritative injunction of the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A question now arises, &#8220;Is there any mortal man
who does not belong to this class?&#8221; I reply, in this passage Paul gives
the appellation &#8220;righteous&#8221; to those who are not absolutely perfect,
(for no such person will be found,) but who, With the strongest desire of their
heart, aim at what is good; so that godly desire is to them a kind of voluntary
law, without any motive or restraint from another quarter. He therefore wished
to repress the impudence of adversaries, who armed themselves with the name of
&#8220;the law&#8221; against godly men, whose whole life exhibits the actual
role of the law, since they had very great need of the law, and yet did not care
much about it; which is more clearly expressed by the opposite clause. If there
be any who refuse to admit that Paul brings an implied or indirect charge
against his adversaries as guilty of those wicked acts which lie enumerates,
still it will be acknowledged to be a simple repelling of the slander; and if
they were animated by a sincere and unfeigned zeal for the law, they ought
rather to have made use of their armor for carrying on war with offenses anal
crimes, instead of employing it as a pretext for their own ambition and silly
talking.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the unrighteous and

&#8220;unrighteous,&#8221; it would leave been better if translators had made
use of the word &#8220;lawless;&#8221; for the Greek word is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajno&gt;mouv</font><font face="Palatino">,
which does not differ much from the second word in the clause,
&#8220;disobedient.&#8221; By sinners he means wicked persons, or those who lead
a base and immoral life.</font><br></div>

employed by ancient writers to denote the carrying off or enticing the slave of
another man, or the false sale of a freeman. Those who wish to obtain more full
information on this subject may consult authors on the civil law, and especially
on the Flavian Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here Paul glances at several classes, which include
briefly every kind of transgressions. The root is obstinacy and rebellion; which
he describes by the first two words.

second table. To these he adds the profane and impure, or those who lead a base
and dissolute life. There being chiefly three ways in which men injure their
neighbors, namely, violence, dishonesty, and lust, he reproves successively
those three ways, as may be easily seen. First, he speaks of violence as
manifested by man &#8212; slayers and murderers of parents; secondly, he
describes shameful uncleanness; and thirdly, he comes down to dishonesty and
other crimes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If there is anything else that is

supports that very sentence which the Lord pronounced in his law, against

that they who depart from the gospel, do not adhere to the spirit of the law,

&#8212; of the apostleship, which Paul has claimed for himself; and he could
not, looking at his former life, be accounted at all worthy of so high an honor.
Accordingly, that he may not be accused of presumption, he comes unavoidably to
make mention of his own person, and at once frankly acknowledges his own
unworthiness, but nevertheless affirms that he is an Apostle by the grace of
God. But he goes further, and turns to his own advantage what appeared to lessen
his authority, declaring that the grace of God shines in him so much the more
brightly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To our Lord Jesus

he removes that dislike towards him which might have been entertained, and cuts
off all ground for putting this question, &#8220;Does he deserve, or does he not
deserve, so honorable an office?&#8221; for, although in himself he has no
excellence, yet it is enough that he was chosen by Christ. There are, indeed,
many who, under the same form of words, make a Show of humility, but are widely
different from the uprightness of Paul, whose intention was, not only to boast
courageously in the Lord, but to give up all the glory that was his own.<b>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By putting me into the

has been placed in the ministry; for thence he concludes that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>he hath been, accounted
faithful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Christ does not receive any in
the manner that is done by ambitious<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa17</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
people, but selects those only who are well qualified; and therefore all on whom
he bestows honor are acknowledged by us to be worthy. For is it inconsistent
with this, that Judas, according to the prediction,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A908&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
109:8) was elevated for a short time, that he might quickly fall. It was
otherwise with Paul, who obtained the honor for a different purpose, and on a
different condition, when Christ declared that he should be</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;a chosen vessel to
him.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440915&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Acts
9:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But in this manner Paul seems to say that
faithfulness, by which he had been previously distinguished, was the cause of
his calling. If it were so, the thanksgiving would be hypocritical and
contradictory; for he would owe his apostleship not only to God, but to his own
merit. I deny, therefore, that the meaning is, that he was admitted to the rank
of an apostle, because God had foreseen his faith; for Christ could not foresee
in him anything good but what the Father had bestowed on him. Still, therefore,
it continues to be true,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Ye have not chosen

you.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431516&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John

<div><font face="Palatino">On the contrary, he draws from it a proof of his
fidelity, that Christ had made him an Apostle; for he declares that they whom
Christ makes Apostles must be held to be pronounced faithful by his
decrees.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In a word, this judicial act is not traced by him to
foreknowledge, but rather denotes the testimony which is given to men; as if he
had said, &#8220;I give thanks to Christ, who, by calling me into the ministry,
has openly declared that he approves of my faithfulness.&#8221;<b>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath made me
powerful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now introduces the mention
of another act of the kindness of Christ, that he strengthened him, or
&#8220;made him powerful.&#8221; By this expression he does not only mean that
he was at first formed&#8221; by the hand of God, so as to be well qualified for
his office, but he likewise includes the continued bestowal of grace. For it
would not have been enough that he was once declared to be faithful, if Christ
had not strengthened him by the uninterrupted communication of aid. He
acknowledges, therefore, that he is indebted to the grace of Christ on two
accounts, because he was once elevated, and because he continues in his
office.</font><br></div>

Who was formerly a blasphemer and
Persecutor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>a<i> </i>blasphemer against
God, a persecutor and oppressor against the Church. We see how candidly he
acknowledges that it might be brought against him as a reproach, and how far he
is from extenuating his sins, and how, by willingly acknowledging his
unworthiness, he magnifies the greatness of the grace of God. Not satisfied with
having called himself a &#8220;persecutor,&#8221; he intended to express more
fully his rage and cruelty by an additional terns, <i>an</i>
<i>oppressor.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because I did it ignorantly in

ignorance;&#8221; for persecution and oppression were nothing else than the
fruits of unbelief.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he appears to insinuate that there is no room for
pardon, unless when ignorance can be pleaded in excuse. What then? Will God
never pardon any one who has sinned knowingly? I reply, we must observe the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unbelief</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<b>
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for
this term limits Paul&#8217;s statement to the first table of the law.
Transgressions of the second table, although they are voluntary, are forgiven;
but he who knowingly and willingly breaks the first table sins against the Holy
Spirit, because he is in direct opposition to God. He does not err through
weakness, but, by rushing wickedly against God, gives a sure proof of his
reprobation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And hence may be obtained a definition of the sin
against the Holy Ghost; first, that it is open rebellion against God in the
transgression of the first table; secondly, that it is a malicious rejection of
the truth; for, when the truth of God is not rejected through deliberate malice,
the Holy Spirit is not resisted. Lastly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unbelief
</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>is </i>here employed as a general term; and
malicious design, which is contrasted with ignorance, may be regarded as the
point of difference.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa20</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, they are mistaken who make the sin
against the Holy Ghost to consist in the transgression of the second table; and
they are also mistaken, who pronounce blind and thoughtless violence to be a
crime so heinous. For men commit the sin against the Holy Spirit, when they
undertake a voluntary war against God in order to extinguish that light of the
Spirit which has been offered to them. This is shocking wickedness and monstrous
hardihood. Nor is there room for doubting that, by an implied threatening, he
intended to terrify all who had been once enlightened, not to stumble against
truth which they knew; because such a fall is destructive and fatal; for if, on
account of ignorance, God forgave Paul his blasphemies, they who knowingly and
intentionally blaspheme ought not to expect any pardon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be thought that what he now says is to no
purpose; for unbelief, which is always blind, can never be unaccompanied by
ignorance. I reply, among unbelievers some are so blind that they are deceived
by a false imagination of the truth; and in others, while they are blinded, yet
malice prevails. Paul was not altogether free from a wicked disposition; but he
was hurried along by the thoughtless zeal, so as to think that what he did was
right. Thus he was an adversary of Christ, not from deliberate intention, but
through mistake and ignorance. The Pharisees, who through a bad conscience
slandered Christ, were not entirely free from mistake and ignorance; but they
were instigated by ambition, and base hatred of sound doctrine, and even by
furious rebellion against God, so that maliciously and intentionally, and not in
ignorance, they set themselves in opposition to Christ.<b>

the dislike of it and testifying his gratitude, but also to employ it as a
shield against the slanders of wicked men, whose whole design was to bring down
his apostleship to a lower level. When he says that it <i>abounded, </i>and
that, too, <i>beyond measure, </i>the statement implies that the remembrance of
past transactions was effaced, and so completely swallowed up, that it was no
disadvantage to him that God had formerly been gracious to good

God, in this sense, that God showed himself to be true, and gave a manifestation

simple interpretation, that &#8220;faith and love&#8221; are indications and
proofs of that grace which he had mentioned, that it might not be supposed that
he boasted needlessly or without good grounds. And, indeed, &#8220;faith&#8221;

the cruelty which he had exercised towards believers; as if he had said, that
God had so completely changed him, that he had become a totally different and

excellence of that grace which must obliterate the remembrance of his former

defended his ministry from slander and unjust accusations, not satisfied with
this, he turns to his own advantage what might have been brought against him by
his adversaries as a reproach. He shews that it was profitable to the Church
that he had been such a person as he actually was before he was called to the
apostleship, because Christ, by giving him as a pledge, invited all sinners to
the sure hope of obtaining pardon. For when he, who had been a fierce and savage
beast, was changed into a Pastor, Christ gave a remarkable display of his grace,
from which all might be led to entertain a firm belief that no sinner; how
heinous and aggravated so ever might have been his transgressions, had the gate
of salvation shut against him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That Christ Jesus came into the
world to save sinners</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He first brings
forward this general statement, and adorns it with a preface, as he is wont to
do in matters of vast importance. In the doctrine of religion, indeed, the main
point is, to come to Christ, that, being lost in ourselves, we may obtain
salvation from him. Let this preface be to our ears like the sound of a trumpet
to proclaim the praises of the grace of Christ, in order that we may believe it
with a stronger faith. Let it be to us as a seal to impress on our hearts a firm
belief of the forgiveness of sins, which otherwise with difficulty finds
entrance into the hearts of men.</font><br></div>

aroused attention by these words, but because men are always disputing with
themselves<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa22</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
about their salvation? For, although God the Father a thousand times offer to us
salvation, and although Christ himself preach about his own office, yet we do
not on that account cease to tremble, or at least to debate with ourselves if it
be actually so. Wherefore, whenever any doubt shall arise in our mind about the
forgiveness of sins, let us learn to repel it courageously with this shield,
that it is an undoubted truth, and deserves to be received without
controversy.</font><br></div>

is the office of Christ to save, have difficulty in admitting this thought, that
such a salvation belongs to &#8220;sinners.&#8221; Our mind is always impelled
to look at our worthiness; and as soon as our unworthiness is seen, our
confidence sinks. Accordingly, the more any one is oppressed by his sins, let
him the more courageously betake himself to Christ, relying on this doctrine,
that he came to bring salvation not to the righteous, but to
&#8220;sinners.&#8221; It deserves attention, also, that Paul draws an argument
from the general office of Christ, in order that what he had lately testified
about his own person might not appear to be on account of its
novelty.</font><br></div>

through ignorance of sound doctrine, and whose whole life, in even other
respect, was blameless before men, pronounce himself to be the chief of sinners?
I reply, these words inform us how heinous and dreadful a crime unbelief is
before God, especially when it is attended by obstinacy and a rage for
persecution.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians

zeal, all that Paul has acknowledged about himself; but God values more highly
the obedience of faith than to reckon unbelief, accompanied lay obstinacy, to he
a small crime.<b>

<div><font face="Palatino">We ought carefully to observe this passage, which
teaches us, that a man who, before the world, is not only innocent, but eminent
for distinguished virtues, and most praiseworthy for his life, yet because he is
opposed to the doctrine of the gospel, and on account of the obstinacy of his
unbelief, is reckoned one of the most heinous sinners; for hence we may easily
conclude of what value before God are all the pompous displays of hypocrites,

and lofty platform, that no one might doubt that he would obtain pardon,
provided that he approached to Christ by faith. And, indeed, the distrust
entertained by all of us is counteracted, when we thus behold in Paul a visible
model of that grace which we desire to see.</font><br></div>

him always, yet are admirably adapted to the present occasion. The Apostle calls
him the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>King
eternal</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>not liable to any change;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Invisible</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 6:16) he dwells in light that is inaccessible; and, lastly,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Only
Wise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because he renders foolish, and
condemns as vanity, all the wisdom of men. The whole agrees with that conclusion
at which he arrives:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;O the depth of the riches both of
the wisdom and knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his designs! How
unsearchable his ways!&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451133&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
11:33.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He means that the infinite and in comprehensible
wisdom of God should he beheld by us with such reverence that, if his works
surpass our senses, still we may be restrained by admiration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet as to the last epithet
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Only</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>it is doubtful whether he means to claim all glory for God alone, or calls
him the only wise, or says that he only is God. The second of these meanings is
that which I prefer; for it was in fine harmony with his present subject to say,
that the understanding of men, whatever it may be, must bend to the secret
purpose of God. And yet I do not deny that he affirms that God alone is worthy
of all glory; for, while he scatters on his creatures, in every direction, the
sparks of his glory, still all glory belongs truly and perfectly to him alone.
But either of those meanings implies that there is no glory but that which
belongs to God.</font><br></div>

I Recommend to thee this commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>All that he had introduced about his own person may be viewed as a
digression from his subject. Having to arm Timothy with authority, it became
necessary for himself to be clothed with the highest authority; and, therefore,
he took an early opportunity of refuting an opinion which might have stood in
his way. And now, after having proved that his apostleship ought not to be less
esteemed by good men, because at one time he fought against the kingdom of
Christ, this obstacle being removed, he returns to the course of his
exhortation. The <i>commandment, </i>therefore, is the same as he mentioned at
the beginning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Son
Timothy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. By </i>calling him his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>son</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he not only expresses his own warm regard towards him, but also recommends
him to others under that name.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According he
</i></font><font face="Palatino">reminds him what kind of testimony he had
obtained from the Spirit of God; for it was no small excitement, that his
ministry was approved by God, and that he had been called by divine revelation
before he was called by the votes of men. &#8220;It is disgraceful not to come
up to the expectations which men have been led to form; and how much more
disgraceful will it be to make void, as far as lies in thy power, the judgment
of God?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must first ascertain what are the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prophecies
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of which he speaks. Some think that Paul was
instructed by revelation to confer the office on Timothy. That I acknowledge to
be true, but I add that others made revelations; for it was not without reason
that Paul made use of the plural number. Accordingly, we conclude from these
words that several prophecies were uttered concerning Timothy, in order to
recommend him to the Church.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa28</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Being still a young man, he might have been despised on account of his age; and
Paul might also have been exposed to calumnies, on account of having ordained
youths, before the proper time, to the elder&#8217;s office. Besides, God had
appointed him to great and difficult undertakings; for he was not one of the
ordinary rank of ministers, but approached very closely to that of the apostles,
and frequently occupied the place of Paul during his absence. It was, therefore,
necessary that he should receive an extraordinary testimony, in order to make it
manifest that it was not conferred on him at random by men, but that he was
chosen by God himself. To be adorned with the applauses of the prophets was not
an ordinary occurrence, or one which was common to him along with many persons;
but because there were some circumstances to Timothy, it was the will of God
that he should not be received by men until he had been previously approved by
his own voice; it was the will of God that he should not enter into the exercise
of his office until he had been called by the revelations of the prophets. The
same thing happened to Paul and Barnabas,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:2,) when they were ordained to be teachers of the Gentiles; for it was a new
and uncommon occurrence, and they could not otherwise have escaped the charge of
rashness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It will now be objected by some, &#8220;If God had
formerly declared, by his prophets, what kind of minister Timothy should be,
what purpose did it serve to admonish him, to show that he was actually such a
person? Could he falsify prophecies which had been uttered by divine revelation?
I reply, it could not happen differently from what God had promised; but at the
same time it was the duty of Timothy, not to give himself up to sloth and
inactivity, but to render a cheerful compliance with the providence of God. It
is therefore not without good reason, that Paul, wishing to stimulate him still
more, mentions the &#8220;prophecies,&#8221; by which God might be said to have
pledged himself on behalf of Timothy; for he was thus reminded of the purpose
for which he was called.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That thou by them mayest war a good
warfare.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By this he means that Timothy,
relying on such approbation of God, ought to fight more courageously. What is
there that either ought to give, or can give us greater cheerfulness than to
know that God has appointed us to do what we are doing? These are our arms,
these are our weapons of defense, by the aid of which we shall never
fail.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>warfare</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he states indirectly, that we must maintain a contest; and this applies
universally to all believers, but especially to Christian teachers, who may be
said to be standard &#8212; bearers and leaders. It is as if he had said,
&#8220;O Timothy, if thou canst not fulfill thy office without a contest,
remember that thou art armed by divine prophecies for cherishing assured hope of
victory, and arouse thyself by calling them to remembrance. That warfare which
we maintain, having God for our leader, is a good warfare; that is, it is
glorious and successful.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Having faith and a good conscience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> I
understand the word </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith
</i></font><font face="Palatino">to be a general term, denoting sound doctrine.
In the same sense he afterwards speaks of &#8220;the mystery of faith.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:9.) And, indeed, the chief things demanded from a teacher are these
two: &#8212; that he shall hold by the pure truth of the gospel; and next, that
he shall administer it with a good conscience and holiest zeal. Where these are
found, all the others will follow of their own accord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From which some having turned aside
concerning faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He shows how necessary
it is that faith be accompanied by a good conscience; because, on the other
hand, the punishment of a bad conscience is turning aside from the path of duty.
They who do not serve God with a sincere and a perfect heart, but give a loose
rein to wicked dispositions, even though at first they had a sound
understanding, come to lose it altogether.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage ought to be carefully observed. We know
that the treasure of sound doctrine is invaluable, and therefore there is
nothing that we ought to dread more than to have it taken from us. But Paul here
informs us, that there is only one way of keeping it safe; and that is, to
secure it by the locks and bars of a good conscience. This is what we experience
every day; for how comes it that there are so many who, laying aside the gospel,
rush into wicked sects, or become involved in monstrous errors? It is because,
by this kind of blindness, God punishes hypocrisy; as, on the other hand, a
genuine fear of God gives strength for perseverance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we may learn two lessons. First, Teachers and
ministers of the gospel, and, through them all the churches are taught with what
horror they ought to regard a hypocritical and deceitful profession of true
doctrine, when they learn that it is so severely punished. Secondly, this
passage removes the offense by which so many persons are greatly distressed,
when they perceive that some, who formerly professed their attachment to Christ
and to the gospel, not only fall back into their former superstitions but (which
is far worse) are bewildered and captivated by monstrous errors. For by such
examples, God openly supports the majesty of the gospel, and openly shows that
he cannot at all endure the profanation of it. And this is what experience has
taught us in every age. All the errors that love existed in the Christian Church
from the beginning, proceeded from this source, that in some persons, ambition,
and in others, covetousness, extinguished the true fear of God. A bad conscience
is, therefore, the mother of all heresies; and we see that a vast number of
persons, who had not sincerely and honestly embraced the faith, are hurried
along, like brute boasts, into the reveries of the Epicureans, so that their
hypocrisy is exposed And not only so, but contempt of God is universally
prevalent, and the licentious and disgraceful lives of almost all ranks show
that there is either none at all, or the smallest possible potion of integrity
in the world; so that them is very great reason to fear lest the light which had
been kindled may be speedily extinguished, and God may leave the pure
understanding of the gospel to be possessed by very few.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Have made
shipwreck</i></font><font face="Palatino">: The metaphor taken from shipwreck is
highly appropriate; for it suggests to us, that, if we wish to arrive safely at
the harbor, our course must be guided by a good conscience, otherwise there is
danger of &#8220;shipwreck;&#8221; that is, there is danger lost faith be sunk
by a bad conscience, as by a whirlpool in a stormy sea.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa28A</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The former
will be again mentioned in the Second Epistle, in which the kind of
&#8220;shipwreck&#8221; which he made is likewise described; for he said that
the resurrection was past.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:17-18.) There is reason to believe that Alexander also was bewitched
by an error so absurd. And shall we wonder at the present day, if any are
deceived by the various enchantments of Satan, when we see that one of
Paul&#8217;s companions perished by so dreadful a fall?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He mentions both of them to Timothy as persons whom
he knew. For my own part, I have no doubt that this is the same Alexander that
is mentioned by Luke, and who attempted, but without success, to quell the
commotion. Now he was an Ephesian, and we have said that this Epistle was
chiefly written for the sake of the Ephesians. We now learn what was his end;
and hearing it, let us keep possession of our faith by a good conscience, that
we may hold it safe to the last.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom I have delivered to
Satan</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As I mentioned in the exposition of
another passage,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 5:5,) there are some who interpret this to mean that extraordinary
chastisement was inflicted on those persons; and they view this as referring to
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">duna&gt;meiv</font><font face="Palatino">,
&#8220;the powers&#8221; mentioned by Paul in the same Epistle.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461228&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 12:28.) For, as the apostles were endowed with the gift of healing,
in order to testify the favor and kindness of God towards the godly, so against
wicked and rebellious persons they wore armed with power, either to deliver them
to the devil to be tormented, or to inflict on them other chastisements. Of this
&#8220;power,&#8221; Peter gave a display in Ananias and Sapphira,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
5:1,) and Paul in the magician Bar &#8212; Jesus.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441306&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
13:6.) But, for my own part, I choose rather to explain it as relating to
excommunication; for the opinion that the incestuous Corinthian received any
other chastisement than excommunication is not supported by any probable
conjecture. And, if by excommunicating him, Paul delivered him to Satan, why
should not the same mode of expression have a similar import in this passage?
Besides, it explains very well the force of excommunication; for, since in the
Church Christ holds the seat of his kingdom, out of the Church there is nothing
but the dominion of Satan. Accordingly, he who is cast out of the Church must be
placed, for a time, under the tyranny of Satan, until, being reconciled to the
Church, he return to Christ. I make one exception, that, on account of the
enormity of the offense, he might have pronounced a sentence of perpetual
excommunication against them; but on that point I would not venture to make a
positive assertion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may learn not to
blaspheme</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What is the meaning of this last
clause? For one who has been cast out of the Church takes upon himself greater
freedom of acting, because, being freed from the yoke of ordinary discipline, he
breaks out into louder insolence. I reply, to whatever extent they may indulge
in their wickedness, yet the gate will be shut against them, so that they shall
not contaminate the flock; for the greatest injury done by wicked men is, when
they mingle with others under the presence of holding the same faith. The power
of doing injury is taken from them, when they are branded with public infamy, so
that none are so simple as not to know that these are irreligious and detestable
men, and therefore their society is shunned by all. Sometimes, too, it happens
that &#8212; being struck down by this mark of disgrace which has been put upon
them &#8212; they become less daring and obstinate; and therefore, although this
remedy sometimes renders them more wicked, yet it is not always ineffectual for
subduing their fierceness.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I exhort
therefore</i></font><font face="Palatino">. These exercises of godliness
maintain and even strengthen us in the sincere worship and fear of God, and
cherish the good conscience of which he had spoken. Not inappropriately does he
make use of the word <i>therefore</i>, to denote an inference; for those
exhortations depend on the preceding commandment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That, above all, prayers be
made</i></font><font face="Palatino">. First, he speaks of public prayers, which
he enjoins to be offered, not only for believers, but for all mankind. Some
might reason thus with themselves: &#8220;Why should we be anxious about the
salvation of unbelievers, with whom we have no connection? Is it not enough, if
we, who are brethren, pray mutually for our brethren, and recommend to God the
whole of his Church? for we have nothing to do with strangers.&#8221; This
perverse view Paul meets, and enjoins the Ephesians to include in their prayers
all men, and not to limit them to the body of the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What is the difference between three out of the four
kinds which Paul enumerates, I own that I do not thoroughly understand. The view
given by Augustine, who twists Paul&#8217;s words so as to denote ceremonial
observances customary at that time, is quite childish. A simpler exposition is
given by those who think that &#8220;requests&#8221; are when we ask to be
delivered from what is evil; &#8220;prayers,&#8221; when we desire to obtain
something profitable; and &#8220;supplications,&#8221; when we deplore before
God injuries which we have endured. Yet for my own part, I do not draw the
difference so ingeniously; or, at least, I prefer another way of distinguishing
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Proseucai&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">
is the Greek word for every kind of prayer; and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">deh&gt;seiv</font><font face="Palatino">
denotes those forms of petitions in which something definite is asked. In this
way the two words agree with each other, as genus and species.
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">jEnteu&gt;xeiv</font><font face="Palatino">
is the word commonly used by Paul to signify those prayers which we offer for
one another. The word used for it in the Latin Translation is
&#8220;intercessiones,&#8221; <i>intercessions</i>. Yet Plato, in his second
dialogue, styled Alcibiades, uses it in a different sense, to moan a definite
petition offered by a person for himself; and in the very inscription of the
book, and in many passages, he shows plainly, as I have said, that
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">proseuch&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">
is a general term.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa29</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But not to dwell longer than is proper on a matter
that is not essential, Paul, in my own opinion, simply enjoins that, whenever
public prayers are offered, petitions and supplications should be made <i>for
all men</i>, even for those who at present are not at all related to us. And yet
this heaping up of words is not superfluous; but Paul appears to me purposely to
join together three terms for the same purpose, in order to recommend more
warmly, and urge more strongly, earnest and constant prayer. We know now
sluggish we are in this religious duty; and therefore we need not wonder if, for
the purpose of arousing us to it, the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of Paul, employs
various excitements.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
thanksgivings</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As to this term, there is no
obscurity security; for, as he bids us make supplication to God for the
salvation of unbelievers, so also to give thanks on account of their prosperity
and success. That wonderful goodness which he shews every day,
when</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;he maketh his sun

5:45,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">is worthy of being praised; and our love of our
neighbor ought also to extend to those who are unworthy of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
kings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He expressly mentions kings and
other magistrates because, more than all others, they might be hated by
Christians. All the magistrates who existed at that time were so many sworn
enemies of Christ; and therefore this thought might occur to them, that they
ought not to pray for those who devoted all their power and all their wealth to
fight against the kingdom of Christ, the extension of which is above all things
desirable. The apostle meets this difficulty, and expressly enjoins Christians
to pray for them also. And, indeed, the depravity of men is not a reason why
God&#8217;s ordinance should not be loved. Accordingly, seeing that God
appointed magistrates and princes for the preservation of mankind, however much
they fall short of the divine appointment, still we must not on that account
cease to love what belongs to God, and to desire that it may remain in force.
That is the reason why believers, in whatever country they live, must not only
obey the laws and the government of magistrates, but likewise in their prayers
supplicate God for their salvation. Jeremiah said to the
Israelites,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Pray for the peace
of Babylon, for in their peace ye shall have peace.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That we may lead a peaceful and
quiet life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> By exhibiting the advantage,
he holds out an additional inducement, for he enumerates the fruits which are
yielded to us by a well regulated government. The first is a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peaceful
life</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for magistrates are armed with the sword,
in order to keep us in peace. If they did not restrain the hardihood of wicked
men, every place would be full of robberies and murders. The true way of
maintaining peace, therefore, is, when every one obtains what is his own, and
the violence of the more powerful is kept under restraint.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With all godliness and
decency</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The second fruit is the
preservation of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>godliness</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
that is, when magistrates give themselves to promote religion, to maintain the
worship of God, and to take care that sacred ordinances be observed with due
reverence. The third fruit is the care of public
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>decency</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
for it is also the business of magistrates to prevent men from abandoning
themselves to brutal filthiness or flagitious conduct, but, on the contrary, to
promote decency and moderation. If these three things are taken away, what will
be the condition of human life? If, therefore, we are at all moved by solicitude
about the peace of society, or godliness, or decency, let us remember that we
ought also to be solicitous about those through whose agency we obtain such
distinguished benefits.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we conclude, that fanatics, who wish to have
magistrates taken away, are destitute of all humanity, and breathe nothing but
cruel barbarism. How different is it to say, that we ought to pray for kings, in
order that justice and decency may prevail, and to say, that not only the name
of kingly power, but all government, is opposed to religion! We have the Spirit
of God for the Author of the former sentiment, and therefore the latter must be
from the Devil.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one ask, Ought we to pray for kings, from whom
we obtain none of these advantages? I answer, the object of our prayer is, that,
guided by the Spirit of God, they may begin to impart to us those benefits of
which they formerly deprived us. It is our duty, therefore, not only to pray for
those who are already worthy, but we must pray to God that he may make bad men
good. We must always hold by this principle, that magistrates were appointed by
God for the protection of religion, as well as of the peace and decency of
society, in exactly the same manner that the earth is appointed to produce
food.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa30</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Accordingly, in like manner as, when we pray to God for our daily bread, we ask
him to make the earth fertile by his blessing; so in those benefits of which we
have already spoken, we ought to consider the ordinary means which he has
appointed by his providence for bestowing them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To this must be added, that, if we are deprived of
those benefits the communication of which Paul assigns to magistrates, that is
through our own fault. It is the wrath of God that renders magistrates useless
to us, in the same manner that it renders the earth barren; and, therefore, we
ought to pray for the removal of those chastisements which have been brought
upon us by our sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On the other hand, princes, and all who hold the
office of magistracy, are here reminded of their duty. It is not enough, if, by
giving to every one what is due, they restrain all acts of violence, and
maintain peace; but they must likewise endeavor to promote religion, and to
regulate morals by wholesome discipline. The exhortation of David
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;190212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
2:12) to &#8220;kiss the Son,&#8221; and the prophecy of Isaiah, that they shall
be nursing &#8212; fathers of the Church,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234923&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
49:23,) are not without meaning; and, therefore, they have no right to fatter
themselves, if they neglect to lend their assistance to maintain the worship of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this is good and
acceptable before God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. After having taught that
what he enjoined is useful, he now brings forward a stronger argument &#8212;
that it pleases God; for when we know what His will, this ought to have the
force of all possible reasons. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he means what is proper and lawful; and, since
the will of God is the rule by which all our duties must be regulated, he proves
that it is right because it pleases God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage is highly worthy of observation; and,
first, we draw from it the general doctrine, that the true rule for acting well
and properly is to look to the will of God, and not to undertake anything but
what he approves. Next, there is likewise laid down a rule for godly prayer,
that we should follow God as our leader, and that all our prayer should be
regulated by his will and command. If due force had been allowed to this
argument, the prayers of Papists, in the present day, would not have abounded
with so many corruptions. For how will they prove that they have the authority
of God for having recourse to dead men as their intercessors, or for praying for
the dead? In short, in all their form of prayer, what can they point out that is
pleasing to God?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who wishes that all men may be
saved</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here follows a confirmation of the
second argument; and what is more reasonable than that all our prayers should be
in conformity with this decree of God?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And may come to the acknowledgment
of the truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Lastly, he demonstrates that God
has at heart the salvation of all, because he invites all to the acknowledgment
of his truth. This belongs to that kind of argument in which the cause is:
proved from the effect; for, if</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;the gospel is the
power of God for salvation to every one that believeth,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
1:16,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">it is certain that all those to whom the gospel is
addressed are invited to the hope of eternal life. In short, as the calling is a
proof of the secret election, so they whom God makes partakers of his gospel are
admitted by him to possess salvation; because the gospel reveals to us the
righteousness of God, which is a sure entrance into life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we see the childish folly of those who
represent this passage to be opposed to predestination. &#8220;If God&#8221; say
they, &#8220;wishes all men indiscriminately to be saved, it is false that some
are predestined by his eternal purpose to salvation, and others to
perdition.&#8221; They might have had some ground for saying this, if Paul were
speaking here about individual men; although even then we should not have wanted
the means of replying to their argument; for, although the: will of God ought
not to be judged from his secret decrees, when he reveals them to us by outward
signs, yet it does not therefore follow that he has not determined with himself
what he intends to do as to every individual man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I say nothing on that subject, because it has
nothing to do with this passage; for the Apostle simply means, that there is no
people and no rank in the world that is excluded from salvation; because God
wishes that the gospel should be proclaimed to all without exception. Now the
preaching of the gospel gives life; and hence he justly concludes that God
invites all equally to partake salvation. But the present discourse relates to
classes of men, and not to individual persons; for his sole object is, to
include in this number princes and foreign nations. That God wishes the doctrine
of salvation to be enjoyed by them as well as others, is evident from the
passages already quoted, and from other passages of a similar nature. Not
without good reason was it said, &#8220;Now, kings, understand,&#8221; and
again, in the same Psalm,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I will give thee
the Gentiles for an inheritance, and the ends of the earth for a
possession.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;190208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
2:8-10.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In a word, Paul intended to shew that it is our duty
to consider, not what kind of persons the princes at that time were, but what
God wished them to be. Now the duty arising: out of that love which we owe to
our neighbor is, to be solicitous and to do our endeavor for the salvation of
all whom God includes in his calling, and to testify this by godly
prayers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With the same view does he call
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God our
Savior</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for whence do we obtain salvation but
from the undeserved kindness of God? Now the same God who has already made us
partakers of salvation may sometime extend his grace to them also. He who hath
already drawn us to him may draw them along with us. The Apostle takes for
granted that God will do so, because it had been thus foretold by the
predictions of the prophets, concerning all ranks and all
nations.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For there is one
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This argument might, at first
sight, appear to be not very strong, that God wishes all men to be saved,
because he is one; if a transition had not been made from God to men. Chrysostom
&#8212; and, after him, others &#8212; view it in this sense, that there are not
many gods, as idolaters imagine. But I think that Paul&#8217;s design was
different, and that there is here an implied comparison of one God with the
whole world and with various nations, out of which comparison arises a view of
both, as they mutually regard each other. In like manner the Apostle
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Is he the God of
the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yea, it is one God who justifieth
the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450329&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
3:29.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, whatever diversity might at that time
exist among men, because many ranks and many nations were strangers to faith,
Paul brings to the remembrance of believers the unity of God, that they may know
that they are connected with all, because there is one God of all &#8212; that
they may know that they who are under the power of the same God are not excluded
for ever from the hope of salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And one Mediator between God and
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This clause is of a similar import
with the former; for, as there is one God, the Creator and Father of all, so he
says that there is but one Mediator,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa31</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
through whom we have access to the Father; and that this Mediator was given, not
only to one nation, or to a small number of persons of some particular rank, but
to all; because the fruit of the sacrifice, by which he made atonement for sins,
extends to all. More especially because a large portion of the world was at that
time alienated from God, he expressly mentions the Mediator, through whom they
that were afar off now approach.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The universal term <i>all </i>must always be referred
to classes: of men, and not to persons; as if he had said, that not only Jews,
but Gentiles also, not only persons of humble rank, but princes also, were
redeemed by the death of Christ. Since, therefore, he wishes the benefit of his
death to be common to all, an insult is offered to him by those who, by their
opinion, shut out any person from the hope of salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The man Christ
Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino">. When he declares that he is &#8220;a
man,&#8221; the Apostle does not deny that the Mediator is God, but, intending
to point out the bond of our union with God, he mentions the human nature rather
than the divine. This ought to be carefully observed. From the beginning, men,
by contriving for themselves this or that mediator, departed farther from God;
and the reason was, that, being prejudiced in favor of this error, that God was
at a great distance from them, they knew not to what hand to turn. Paul remedies
this evil, when he represents God as present with us; for he has descended even
to us, so that we do not need to seek him above the clouds. The same thing is
said in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
4:15,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;We have not a high
priest who cannot sympathize within our infirmities, for in all things he was
tempted.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And, indeed, if this were deeply impressed on the
hearts of all, that the Son of God holds out to us the hand of a brother, and
that we are united to him by the fellowship of our nature, in order that, out of
our low condition, he may raise us to heaven; who would not choose to keep by
this straight road, instead of wandering in uncertain and stormy paths!
Accordingly, whenever we ought to pray to God, if we call to remembrance that
exalted and unapproachable majesty, that we may not be driven back by the dread
of it, let us, at the same time, remember &#8220;the man Christ,&#8221; who
gently invites us, and takes us, as it were, by the hand, in order that the
Father, who had been the object of terror and alarm, may be reconciled by him
and rendered friendly to us. This is the only key to open for us the gate of the
heavenly kingdom, that we may appear in the presence of God with
confidence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we see, that Satan has, in all ages, followed
this course, for the purpose of leading men astray from the right path. I say
nothing of the various devices by which, before the coming of Christ, he
alienated the minds of men, to contrive methods of approaching to God. At the
very commencement of the Christian Church, when Christ, with so excellent a
pledge, was fresh in their remembrance, and while the earth was still ringing
with that delightfully sweet word from his mouth,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Come to me, all ye
that labor and are heavy laden,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and
I will give you rest,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401128&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
11:28,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">there were, nevertheless, some persons skilled in
deception, who thrust angels into his room as mediators; which is evident from
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510218&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:18. But what Satan, at that time, contrived secretly, he carried to such a
pitch, during the times of Popery, that scarcely one person in a thousand
acknowledged Christ, even in words, to be the Mediator. And while the name was
buried, still more was the reality unknown.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now that God has raised up good and faithful
teachers, who have labored to restore and bring to the remembrance of men what
ought to have been one of the best &#8212; known principles of our faith, the
sophists of the Church of Rome have resorted to every contrivance for darkening
a point so clear. First, the name is so hateful to them, that, if any one
mentions Christ as Mediator, without taking notice of the saints, he instantly
falls under a suspicion of heresy. But, because they do not venture to reject
altogether what Paul teaches in this passage, they evade it by a foolish
exposition, that he is called &#8220;one Mediator,&#8221; not &#8220;the only
Mediator.&#8221; As if the Apostle had mentioned God as one out of a vast
multitude of gods; for the two clauses are closely connected, that &#8220;there
is one God and one Mediator;&#8221; and therefore they who make Christ one out
of many mediators must apply the same interpretation in speaking of God. Would
they rise to such a height of impudence, if they were not impelled by blind rage
to crush the glory of Christ?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are others who think themselves more acute, and
who lay down this distinction, that Christ is the only Mediator of redemption,
while they pronounce the saints to be mediators of intercession. But the folly
of these interpreters is reproved by the scope of the passage, in which the
Apostle speaks expressly about prayer. The Holy Spirit commands us to pray for
all, because our only Mediator admits all to come to him; just as by his death
he reconciled all to the Father. And yet they who thus, with daring sacrilege,
strip Christ of his honor, wish to be regarded as Christians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is objected that this has the appearance of
contradiction; for in this very passage Paul enjoins us to intercede for others,
while, in the Epistle to the Romans, he declares that intercession belongs to
Christ alone.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450834&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:34.) I reply, the intercessions of the saints, by which they aid each other in
their addresses to God, do not contradict the doctrine, that all have but one
Intercessor; for no man&#8217;s prayers are heard either in behalf of himself,
or in behalf of another, unless he rely on Christ as his advocate. When we
intercede for one another, this is so far from setting aside the intercession of
Christ, as belonging to him alone, that the chief reliance is given, and the
chief reference made, to that very intercession.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some person will perhaps think, that it will,
therefore, be easy for us to come to an agreement with the Papists, if they
place below the only intercession of Christ, all that they ascribe to the
saints. This is not the case; for the reason why they transfer to the saints the
office of interceding is, that they imagine that otherwise we are destitute of
an advocate. It is a common opinion among them, that we need intercessors,
because in ourselves we are unworthy of appearing in the presence of God. By
speaking in this manner, they deprive Christ of his honor. Besides, it is a
shocking blasphemy, to ascribe to saints such excellence as would procure for us
the favor of God: and all the prophets, and apostles, and martyrs, and even the
angels themselves &#8212; are so far from making any pretension to this, that
they too have need of the same intercession as ourselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again, it is a mere dream, originating in their own
brain, that the dead intercede for us; and, therefore, to found our prayers on
this is altogether to withdraw our trust from calling upon God. But Paul lays
down, as the rule for calling on God in a proper manner, faith grounded on the
word of God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:17.) Justly, therefore, everything that men contrive, in the exercise of
their own thoughts, without the authority of the word of God, is rejected by
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But not to dwell on this subject longer than the
exposition of the passage demands, let it be summed up in this manner; that they
who have actually learned the office of Christ will be satisfied with having him
alone, and that none will make mediators at their own pleasure but those who
neither know God nor Christ. Hence I conclude, that the doctrine of the Papists
&#8212; which darkens, and almost buries, the intercession of Christ, and
introduces pretended intercessors without any support from Scripture &#8212; is
full of wicked distrust, and also of wicked rashness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who gave himself a ransom for
all</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa32</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The
mention of redemption in this passage is not superfluous; for there is a
necessary connection between the two things, the sacrifice of the death of
Christ, and his continual intercession.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450834&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:34.) These are the two parts of his priesthood; for, when Christ is called our
priest, it is in this sense, that he once made atonement for our sins by his
death, that he might reconcile us to God; and now having entered into the
sanctuary of heaven, he appears in presence of the Father, in order to obtain
grace for us, that we may be heard in his name.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19B004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
110:4;
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;580717&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
7:17.) So much the more does he expose the wicked sacrilege of the Papists, who,
by making dead saints to be companions of Christ in this affair, transfer to
them likewise the glory of the priesthood. Read the fourth chapter of the
Epistle to the Hebrews, towards the conclusion, and the beginning of the fifth
chapter, and you will find what I maintain, that the intercession by which God
is reconciled to us is founded on the sacrifice; which, indeed, is demonstrated
by the whole system of the ancient priesthood. It follows, therefore, that it is
impossible to take from Christ any part of the office of intercession, and
bestow it on others, without stripping him of the title of
priesthood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, when the Apostle calls him
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnti&gt;lutron</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>&#8220;</i>a ransom,&#8221;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
overthrows all other satisfactions. Yet I am not ignorant of the injurious
devices of the Papists, who pretend that the price of redemption, which Christ
paid by his death, is applied to us in baptism, so that original sin is effaced,
and that afterwards we are reconciled to God by satisfactions. In this way they
limit to a small period of time, and to a single class, that benefit which was
universal and perpetual. But a full illustration of this subject will be found
in the Institutes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That there might be a testimony in
due time</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, in order that this
grace might be revealed at the appointed time. The phrase, <i>for all, </i>which
the Apostle had used, might have given rise to the question, &#8220;Why then had
God chosen a peculiar people, if he revealed himself as a reconciled Father to
all without distinction, and if the one redemption through Christ was common to
all?&#8221; He cuts off all ground for that question, by referring to the
purpose of God the season<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa34</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for
revealing his grace. For if we are not astonished that in winter, the trees are
stripped of their foliage, the field are covered with snow, and the meadows are
stiff with frost, and that, by the genial warmth of spring, what appeared for a
time to be dead, begins to revive, because God appointed the seasons to follow
in succession; why should we not allow the same authority to his providence in
other: matters? Shall we accuse God of instability, because he brings forward,
at the proper time, what he had always determined, and settled in his own
mind?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, although it came upon the world suddenly
and was altogether unexpected, that Christ was revealed as a Redeemer to Jews
and Gentiles, without distinction; let as not think that it was sudden with
respect to God but, on the contrary, let us learn to subject all our sense to
his wonderful providence. The consequence will be, that there will be nothing
that comes from him which shall not appear to us to be highly seasonable. On
that account this admonition frequently occurs in the writings of Paul and
especially when he treats of the calling of the Gentiles, by which, at that
time, on account of its novelty, many persons were startled and almost
confounded. They who are not satisfied with this solution, that God, by his
hidden wisdom, arranged the succession of the seasons, will one day feel, that,
at the time when they think that he was idle, he was framing a hell for
inquisitive persons.</font><br></div>

&#8220;Provided that it be accompanied by a good conscience, there will be
nothing to prevent all the nations from calling upon God everywhere. But he has
employed the sign instead of the reality, for &#8220;pure hands&#8221; are the
expressions of a pure heart; just as, on the contrary, Isaiah rebukes the Jews
for lifting up &#8220;bloody hands,&#8221; when he attacks their cruelty.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;230115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
1:15.) Besides, this attitude has been generally used in worship during all
ages; for it is a feeling which nature has implanted in us, when we ask God, to
look upwards, and has always been so strong, that even idolaters themselves,
although in other respects they make a god of images of wood and stone, still
retained the custom of lifting up their hands to heaven. Let us therefore learn
that the attitude is in accordance with true godliness, provided that it be
attended by the corresponding truth which is represented by it, namely, that,
having been informed that we ought to seek God in heaven, first, we should form
no conception of Him that is earthly or carnal; and, secondly, that we should
lay aside carnal affections, so that nothing may prevent our hearts from rising
above the world. But idolaters and hypocrites, when they lift up their hands in
prayer, are apes; for while they profess, by the outward symbol, that their
minds are raised upwards, the former are fixed on wood and stone, as if God were
shut up in them, and the latter, wrapped up either in useless: anxieties, or in
wicked thoughts, cleave to the earth; and therefore, by a gesture of an opposite
meaning,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa35</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
they bear testimony against themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Without
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Some explain this to mean a burst
of indignation, when the conscience fights with itself, and, so to speak,
quarrels with God which usually happens when adversity presses heavily upon us;
for then we are displease that God does not send us immediate assistance, and
are agitated by impatience. Faith is also shaken by various assaults; for, in
consequence of his assistance not being visible, we are seized with doubts,
whether or not he cares about us, or wishes us to be saved, and things of that
nature.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They who take this view think that the word
<i>disputing </i>denotes that alarm which arises from doubt. Thus, according to
them, the meaning would be, that we should pray with a peaceful conscience and
assured confidence. Chrysostom and others think that the apostle here demands
that our minds should be calm and free from all uneasy feelings both towards God
and towards men; because there is nothing that tends more to hinder pure calling
on God than quarrels and strife. On this account Christ enjoins, that if any man
be at variance with his brother, he shall go and be reconciled to him before
offering his gift on the altar.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For my part, I acknowledge that both of these views
are just; but when I take into consideration the context of this passage, I have
no doubt that Paul had his eye on the disputes which arose out of the
indignation of the Jews at having the Gentiles made equal to themselves, in
consequence of which they raised a controversy about the calling of the
Gentiles, and went so far as to reject and exclude them from the participation
of grace. Paul therefore wishes that debates of this nature should be put down,
and that all the children of God of every nation and country should pray with
one heart. Yet there is nothing to restrain us from drawing from this particular
statement a general doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
In like manner also women</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. As </i>he
enjoined men to lift up pure hands, so he now prescribes the manner in which
women ought to prepare for praying aright. And there appears to be an implied
contrast between those virtues which he recommends and the outward
sanctification of the Jews; for he intimates that there is no profane place, nor
any from which both men and women may not draw near to God, provided they are
not excluded by their vices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He intended to embrace the opportunity of correcting
a vice to which women are almost always prone, and which perhaps at Ephesus,
being a city of vast wealth and extensive merchandise, especially abounded. That
vice is &#8212; excessive eagerness and desire to be richly dressed. He wishes
therefore that their dress should be regulated by modesty and sobriety; for
luxury and immoderate expense arise from a desire to make a display either for
the sake of pride or of departure from chastity. And hence we ought to derive
the rule of<i> </i>moderation; for, since dress is an indifferent matter, (as
all outward matters are,) it is difficult to; assign a fixed limit, how far we
ought to go. Magistrates may indeed make laws, by means of which a rage for
superfluous expenditure shall be in some measure restrained; but godly teachers,
whose business it is to guide the consciences, ought always to keep in view the
end of lawful use. This at least will be settled beyond all controversy, that
every thing in dress which is not in accordance with modesty and sobriety must
be disapproved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet we must always begin with the dispositions; for
where debauchery reigns within, there will be no chastity; and where ambition
reigns within, there will be no modesty in the outward dress. But because
hypocrites commonly avail themselves of all the pretexts that they can find for
concealing their wicked dispositions, we are under the necessity of pointing out
what meets the eye. It would be great baseness to deny the appropriateness of
modesty as the peculiar and constant ornament of virtuous and chaste women, or
the duty of all to observe moderation. Whatever is opposed to these virtues it
will be in vain to excuse. He expressly censures certain kinds of superfluity,
such as curled hair, jewels, and golden rings; not that the use of gold or of
jewels is expressly forbidden, but that, wherever they are prominently
displayed, these things commonly draw along with them the other evils which I
have mentioned, and arise from ambition or from want of chastity as their
source.</font><br></div>

dress.</font><br></div>

But I suffer not a woman to teach</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Not that he
takes from them the charge of instructing their family, but only excludes them
from the office of teaching, which God has committed to men only. On this
subject we have explained our views in the exposition of the First Epistle to
the Corinthians.<b>

appointed by the commend of God to govern the people, the answer is easy.
Extraordinary acts done by God do not overturn the ordinary rules of government,
by which he intended that we should be bound. Accordingly, if women at one time
held the office of prophets and teachers, and that too when they were
supernaturally called to it by the Spirit of God, He who is above all law might
do this; but, being a peculiar case,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa37</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
this is not opposed to the constant and ordinary system of
government.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds &#8212; what is closely allied to the office
of teaching &#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and not to
assume authority over the man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for the
very reason, why they are forbidden to teach, is, that it is not permitted by
their condition. They are subject, and to teach implies the rank of power or
authority. Yet it may be thought that there is no great force in this argument;
because even prophets and teachers are subject to kings and to other
magistrates. I reply, there is no absurdity in the same person commanding and
likewise obeying, when viewed in different relations. But this does not apply to
the case of woman, who by nature (that is, by the ordinary law of God) is formed
to obey; for
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">gunaikokrati&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(the government of women) has always been regarded by all wise persons as a
monstrous thing; and, therefore, so to speak, it will be a mingling of heaven
and earth, if women usurp the right to teach. Accordingly, he bids them be
&#8220;quiet,&#8221; that is, keep within their own rank.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa38</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Adam was first
created</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He assigns two reasons why
women ought to be subject to men; because not only did God enact this law at the
beginning, but he also inflicted it as a punishment on the woman.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
3:16.) He accordingly shews that, although mankind had stood in their first and
original uprightness, the true order of nature, which proceeded from the command
of God, bears that women shall be subject. Nor is this inconsistent with the
fact, that Adam, by falling from his first dignity, deprived himself of his
authority; for in the ruins, which followed sin, there still linger some remains
of the divine blessing, and it was not proper that woman, by her own fault,
should make her condition better than before.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa39</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet the reason that Paul Assigns, that woman was
second in the order of creation, appears not to be a very strong argument in
favor of her subjection; for John the Baptist was before Christ in the order of
time, and yet was greatly inferior in rank. But although Paul does not state all
the circumstances which are related by Moses, yet he intended that his readers
should take them into consideration. Now Moses shews that the woman was created
afterwards, in order that she might be a kind of appendage to the man; and that
she was joined to the man on the express condition, that she should be at hand
to render obedience to him.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
2:21.) Since, therefore, God did not create two chiefs of equal power, but added
to the man an inferior aid, the Apostle justly reminds us of that order of
creation in which the eternal and inviolable appointment of God is strikingly
displayed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And Adam was not deceived</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He alludes to
the punishment inflicted on the woman:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Because thou hast obeyed the
voice of the serpent, thou shalt be subject to the authority of thy husband, and
thy desire shall be to him.&#8221;</font><font face="Palatino"><b>

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
3:16.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Because she had given fatal advice, it was right that
she should learn that she was under the power and will of another; and because
she had drawn her husband aside from the command of God, it was right that she
should be deprived of all liberty and placed under the yoke. Besides, the
Apostle does not rest his argument entirely or absolutely on the cause of the
transgression, but founds it on the sentence which was pronounced by
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet it may be thought that these two statements are
somewhat contradictory that the subjection of the woman is the punishment of her
transgression, and yet that it was imposed on her from the creation; for thence
it will follow, that she was doomed to servitude before she sinned. I reply,
there is nothing to hinder that the condition of obeying should be natural from
the beginning, and that afterwards the accidental condition of serving should
come into existence; so that the subjection was now less voluntary and agreeable
than it had formerly been.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again, this passage has given to some people an
occasion for affirming that Adam did not fall by means of error, but that he was
only overcome by the allurements of his wife. Accordingly, they think that the
woman only was deceived by the wiles of the devil, to believe that she and her
husband would be like the gods; But that Adam was not at all persuaded of this,
but tasted the fruit in order to please his wife. But it is easy to refute this
opinion; for, if Adam had not given credit to the falsehood of Satan, God would
not have reproached him:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Behold, Adam is
become like one of us.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010322&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
3:22.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are other reasons of which I say nothing; for
there needs not a long refutation of an error which does not rest on any
probable conjecture. By these words Paul does not mean that Adam was not
entangled by the same deceitfulness of the devil,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
that the cause or source of the transgression proceeded from
Eve.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
But she shall be saved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The weakness of
the sex renders women more suspicious and timid, and the preceding statement
might greatly terrify and alarm the strongest minds. For these reasons he
modifies what he had said by adding a consolation; for the Spirit of God does
not accuse or reproach us, in order to triumph over us, When we are covered with
shame, but, when we have been cast down, immediately raises us up. It might have
the effect (as I have already said) of striking terror into the minds of
women,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa42</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
when they were informed that the destruction of the whole human race was
attributed to them; for what will be this condemnation? especially when their
subjection, as a testimony of the wrath of God, is constantly placed before
their eyes. Accordingly, Paul, in order to comfort them and render their
condition tolerable, informs them that they continue to enjoy the hope of
salvation, though they suffer a temporal punishment. It is proper to observe
that the good effect of this consolation is twofold. First, by the hope of
salvation held out to them, they are prevented from falling into despair through
alarm at the mention of their guilt. Secondly, they become accustomed to endure
calmly and patiently the necessity of servitude, so as to submit willingly to
their husbands, when they are informed that this kind of obedience is both
profitable to themselves and acceptable to God. If this passage be tortured, as
Papists are wont to do, to support the righteousness of works, the answer is
easy. The Apostle does not argue here about the cause of salvation, and
therefore we cannot and must not infer from these words what works deserve; but
they only shew in what way God conducts us to salvation, to which he has
appointed us through his grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Through
child-bearing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> To censorious men it
might appear absurd, for an Apostle of Christ not only to exhort women to give
attention to the birth of offspring, but to press this work as religious and
holy to such an extent as to represent it in the light of the means of procuring
salvation. Nay, we even see with what reproaches the conjugal bed has been
slandered by hypocrites, who wished to be thought more holy than all other men.
But there is no difficulty in replying to these sneers of the ungodly. First,
here the Apostle does not speak merely about having children, but about enduring
all the distresses, which are manifold and severe, both in the birth and in the
rearing of children. Secondly, whatever hypocrites or wise men of the world may
think of it, when a woman, considering to what she has been called, submits to
the condition which God has assigned to her, and does not refuse to endure the
pains, or rather the fearful anguish, of parturition, or anxiety about her
offspring, or anything else that belongs to her duty, God values this obedience
more highly than if, in some other manner, she made a great display of heroic
virtues, while she refused to obey the calling of God. To this must be added,
that no consolation could be more appropriate or more efficacious then to shew
that the very means (so to speak) of procuring salvation are found in the
punishment itself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If they continue in
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In consequence of the old
translation having used the expression, &#8220;the birth of children,&#8221; it
has been commonly thought that this clause refers to the children. But the term
used by Paul to denote &#8220;child-bearing&#8221; is a single word,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">teknogoni&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
and therefore it must refer to the women. As to the verb being plural, and the
noun singular, this involves no difficulty; for an indefinite noun, at least
when it denotes a multitude, has the force of a collective noun, and therefore
easily admits a change from the singular to the plural number.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, that he might not represent all the virtue
of women as included in the duties of marriage, immediately afterwards he adds
greater virtues, in which it is proper that godly women should excel, that they
may differ from irreligious women. Even: &#8220;child &#8212; bearing&#8221; is
obedience acceptable to God, only so far as it proceeds

follows

extends it more widely to the other parts of life.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is a true
saying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Chrysostom thinks, that this is
the conclusion of the preceding doctrine. But I do not approve of the opinion;
for Paul commonly makes use of this form of expression as a prelude to what he
is about to introduce, Besides, in the former discourse there was no need of so
strong an affirmation; but what he is now about to say, is somewhat more
weighty. Let these words, therefore, be received as a preface intended to point
out the importance of the subject; for Paul now begins a new discourse about
ordaining pastors, and appointing the government of the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any one desireth the office of a
bishop</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa43</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Having forbidden women to teach, he now takes occasion to speak of the office of
a bishop. First, that it may be more clearly seen that it was not without reason
that he refused to allow women to undertake so arduous a work; secondly, that it
might not be thought that, by excluding women only, he admitted all men
indiscriminately; and, thirdly, because it was highly proper that Timothy and
others should be reminded what conscientious watchfulness ought to be used in
the election of bishops. Thus the context, in my opinion, is as if Paul had
said, that so far are women from being fit for undertaking so excellent an
office, that not even men ought to be admitted into it without
distinction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He desireth an excellent
work</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Apostle affirms that this is
no inconsiderable work, such as any man might venture to undertake. When he says
that it is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kalo&gt;v</font><font face="Palatino">,
I have no doubt that he alludes to the ancient Greek proverb, often quoted by
Plato, </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">du&gt;skola ta&lt;
kala&gt;</font><font face="Palatino">, which means that &#8220;those things
which are excellent, are also arduous and difficult;&#8221; and thus he unites
difficulty with excellence, or rather he argues thus, that it does not belong to
every person to discharge the office of a bishop, because it is a thing of great
value.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I think that Paul&#8217;s meaning is now sufficiently
clear; though none of the commentators, so far as I perceive, have understood
it. The general meaning is, that a selection ought to be made in admitting
bishops, because it is a laborious and difficult charge; and that they who aim
at it should carefully consider with themselves, whether or not they were able
to bear so heavy a burden. Ignorance is always rash; and a mature knowledge of
things makes a man modest. How comes it that they who have neither ability nor
wisdom often aspire so confidently to hold the reins of government, but because
they rush forward with their eyes shut? On this subject Quintilian remarked,
that the ignorant speak boldly, while the greatest orators
tremble.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the purpose of restraining such rashness in
desiring the office of a bishop, Paul states, first, that this is not an
indolent rank, but a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>work</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
and next, that it is not any kind of work, but <i>excellent, </i>and therefore
toilsome and full of difficulty, as it actually is. It is no light matter to be
a representative of the Son of God, in discharging an office of such magnitude,
the object of which is to erect and extend the kingdom of God, to procure the
salvation of souls which the Lord himself hath purchased with his own blood, and
to govern the Church, which is God&#8217;s inheritance. But it is not my
intention at present to make a sermon, and Paul will again glance at this
subject in the next chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here a question arises: &#8220;Is it lawful, in any
way, to desire the office of a bishop?&#8221; On the one hand, it appears to be
highly improper for any one to anticipate, by his wish, the calling of God, and
yet Paul, while he censures a rash desire, seems to permit it to be desired with
prudence and modesty. I reply, if ambition is condemned in other matters, much
more severely ought it to be condemned in &#8220;the office of a bishop.&#8221;
But Paul speaks of a godly desire, by which holy men wish to employ that
knowledge of doctrine which they possess for the edification of the Church. For,
if it were altogether unlawful to desire the office of a teacher, why should
they who spend all their youth in reading the Holy Scriptures prepare themselves
by learning? What are the theological schools but nurseries of
pastors?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, they who have been thus instructed not
only may lawfully devote themselves and their labors to God by a voluntary
offering, but even ought to do so, and that too, before they have been admitted
unto the office; provided that, nevertheless, they do not trust themselves
forward, and do not, even by their own wish, make themselves bishops, but are
only ready to discharge the office, if their labors shall be required. And if it
turn out that, according to the lawful order; they are not called, let them know
that such was the will of God, and let them not take it in that others have been
preferred to them. But they who, without any selfish motive, shall have no other
wish than to serve God and the Church, will be affected in this manner; and, at
the same time, will have such modesty that they will not be at all envious, if
others be preferred to them as being more worthy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one object, that the government of the Church
is a matter of so great difficulty, that it ought rather to strike terror into
the minds of persons of sound judgment than to excite them to desire it. I
reply, that the desire of great men does not rest on confidence of their own
industry or virtue, but on the assistance of</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;God, from whom is
our sufficiency,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">as Paul says elsewhere.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:5.) At the same time, it is necessary to observe what it is that
Paul calls &#8220;the office of a bishop;&#8221; and so much the more, because
the ancients were led away, by the custom of their times, from the true meaning;
for, while Paul includes generally all pastors, they understand a bishop to be
one who was elected out of each college to preside over his brethren. Let us
remember, therefore, that this word is of the same import as if he had called
them ministers, or pastors, or presbyters.<b>

blameless</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The particle
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>therefore
</i></font><font face="Palatino">confirms the exposition which I have given;
for, on account of the dignity of the office, he concludes that it is requisite
that he be a man endowed with rare gifts, and not any person taken out of the
crowd.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If
the expression used had been &#8220;a good work,&#8221; as the ordinary

Erasmus has translated it, the inference would not have been
suitable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He wishes a bishop to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blameless</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<b>
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa46</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
instead of which, in the Epistle to Titus, He has used
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;560107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:7) the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajne&gt;gklhton</font><font face="Palatino">,
meaning by both words, that he must not be marked by any infamy that would
lessen his authority. There will be no one found among men that is free from
every vice; but it is one thing to be blemished with ordinary vices, which do
not hurt the reputation, because they are found in men of the highest
excellence, and another thing to have a disgraceful name, or to be stained with
any baseness. In order, therefore, that a bishop may not be without authority,
he enjoins that there shall be made a selection of one who has a good and
honorable reputation, and not chargeable with any remarkable vice. Besides, he
does not merely lay down a rule for Timothy what sort of person he must select,
but likewise reminds every one of those who aspire to that rank, to institute a
careful examination of himself and of his life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The husband of one
wife</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is a childish fancy to interpret this
as meaning &#8220;the pastor of a single church.&#8221; Another other exposition
has been more generally received, that the person set apart to that office must
be one who has not been more than once married, that one wife being since dead,
so that now he is not a married man. But both in this passage and in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;560106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:6, the words of the apostle are, &#8220;Who is,&#8221; and not &#8220;Who hath
been;&#8221; and in this very Epistle, where he treats of widows,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:10,) he expressly makes use of the participle of the past tense.
Besides, in this way he would contradict himself; because elsewhere he declares
that he has no wish to lay a snare on the consciences.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The only true exposition, therefore, is that of
Chrysostom, that in a bishop he expressly condemns polygamy,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa47</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
which at that time the Jews almost reckoned to be lawful. This corruption was
borrowed by them partly from sinful imitation of the Fathers, (for they who read
that Abraham, Jacob, David, and others of the same class, were married to more
wives than one at the same time, thought that it was lawful for them also to do
the same) and partly from neighboring nations; for the inhabitants of the East
never observed that conscientiousness and fidelity in marriage which was proper.
However that might be, polygamy was exceedingly prevalent among them;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa48</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
therefore with great propriety does Paul enjoin that a bishop should be free
from this stain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And yet I do not disapprove of the opinion of those
who think that the Holy Spirit intended to guard against the diabolical
superstition which afterwards arose; as if he had said, &#8220;So far is it from
being right and proper that celibacy should be enforced on bishops, that
marriage is a state highly becoming in all believers.&#8221; In this way, he
would not demand it as a thing necessary for them, but would only praise it as
not inconsistent with the dignity of the office. Yet the view which I have
already given is more simple and more solid, that Paul forbids polygamy in all
who hold the office of a bishop, because it is a mark of an unchaste man, and of
one who does not observe conjugal fidelity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there it might be objected, that what is sinful
in all ought not to have been condemned or forbidden in bishops alone. The
answer is easy. When it is expressly prohibited to bishops, it does not
therefore follow that it is freely allowed to others. Beyond all doubt, Paul
condemned universally what was contrary to an unrepealed law of God; for it is a
settled enactment,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;They shall be one
flesh.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;010224&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
2:24.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he might, to some extent, bear with that in
others which, in a bishop, would have been excessively vile, and therefore not
to be endured.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor is this a law laid down for the future, that no
bishop, who already has one wife, shall marry a second or a third, while the
first wife is still living; but Paul excludes from the office of a bishop any
one who shall be guilty of such an enormity. Accordingly, what had been once
done, and could not be corrected, he reluctantly endures, but only in the common
people For what was the remedy for those who, under Judaism, had fallen into the
snare of polygamy? Should they have divorced their second and third wives? Such
a divorce would not have been free from doing wrong. Since, therefore, the deed
was done, and could not be undone, he left it untouched, but with this
exception, that no bishop should be blemished by such a stain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sober, temperate,
modest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word which we have
translated <i>sober, </i>Erasmus has translated (vigilantem) <i>watchful. </i>As

preferred to translate
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sw&gt;frona</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>temperate, </i>instead of <i>sober, </i>because
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">swfrosu&gt;nh</font><font face="Palatino">

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hospitable</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i><b>
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa50</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The<i> &#8220;hospitality&#8221; </i>here spoken of, is toward strangers, and
this was very common among the ancients; for it would have been reckoned
disgraceful for respectable persons, and especially for those who were well
known, to lodge in taverns. In the present day, the state of<i> </i>matters is
different; but this virtue is and always will be highly necessary in a bishop,
for many reasons. Besides, during the cruel persecution of the godly, many
persons must have been constrained frequently to change their habitation; and
therefore it was necessary that the houses of bishops should be a retreat for
the exiles. In those times hard necessity compelled the churches to afford
mutual aid, so that they gave lodgings to one another. Now, if the bishops had
not pointed out the path to others in this department of duty, the greater part,
following their example, would have neglected the exercise of humanity, and thus
the poor fugitives would have been greatly discouraged.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa51</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Able to
teach</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In the epistle to Titus, doctrine
is expressly mentioned; here he only speaks briefly about skill in communicating
instruction. It is not enough to have profound learning, if it be not
accompanied by talent for teaching. There are many who, either because their
utterance is defective, or because they have not good mental abilities, or
because they do not employ that familiar language which is adapted to the common
people, keep within their own minds the knowledge which they possess. Such
persons, as the phrase is, ought to Sing to themselves and to the muses.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa52</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
They who have the charge of governing the people, ought to be qualified for
teaching. And here he does not demand volubility of tongue, for we see many
persons whose fluent talk is not fitted for edification; but he rather commends
wisdom in applying the word of God judiciously to the advantage of the
people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is worth while to consider how the Papists hold
that the injunctions which the apostle gives do not at all belong to them. I
shall not enter into a minute explanation of all the details; but on this one
point what sort of diligence do they observe? And, indeed, that gift would be
superfluous; for they banish from themselves the ministry of teaching as low and
groveling, although this belonged especially to a bishop. But everybody knows
how far it is from observing Paul&#8217;s rule, to assume the title of bishop,
and boast proudly of enacting a character without speaking, provided only that
they make their appearance in a theatrical dress. As if a horned mitre, a ring
richly set in jewels, or a silver cross, and other trifles, accompanied by idle
display, constituted the spiritual government of a church, which can no more be
separated from doctrine than any one of us can be separated from his own
soul.</font><br></div>

</i>which is here used, the Greeks denote not merely drunkenness, but any
intemperance in guzzling wine. And, indeed, to drink wine excessively is not
only very unbecoming in a pastor, but commonly draws along with it many things
still worse; such as quarrels, foolish attitudes, unchaste conduct, and other
things which it is not necessary to describe. But the contrast which is added
shortly afterwards, shews that Paul goes farther than this.</font><br></div>

contrasts one who is gentle or kind. The true interpretation is that which is
given by Chrysostom, that men of a drunken and fierce disposition ought to be
excluded from the office of a bishop. As to the opinion given by Chrysostom,
that &#8220;a striker&#8221; means one who wounds with the tongue, (that is, who
is guilty of slander or of outrageous reproaches,) I do not admit it. Nor am I
moved by his argument, that it will be no great matter, if the bishop do not
strike with the hand; for I think that here he reproves generally that
fierceness which is often found in the military profession, and which is utterly
unbecoming in time servants of Christ. It is well known to what ridicule they
expose themselves, who are more ready to strike a blow with the fist, and
&#8212; we might even say &#8212; to draw the sword, than to settle the disputes
of others by their own sedate behavior. <i>Strikers </i>is therefore the term

temperament.</font><br></div>

is evident, that Paul does not demand that a bishop shall be unacquainted within
human life,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa56</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but
that he shall be a good and praiseworthy master of a household; for,<i>
</i>whatever may be the admiration commonly entertained for celibacy and a
philosophical life altogether removed from ordinary custom, yet wise and
thoughtful men are convinced by experience, that they who are not ignorant of
ordinary life, but are practiced in the duties of human intercourse, are better
trained and adapted for governing the Church. And, therefore, we ought to
observe the reason which is added,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540305&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 3:5,) that he who does not know how to rule his family, Will not be
qualified for governing the Church. Now, this is the case with very many
persons, and indeed with almost all who have been drawn out of an idle and
solitary life,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa57</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as
out of dens and caverns; for they are a sort of savages and destitute of
humanity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath his children in subjection
with, all reverence</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The apostle does
not recommend a clever man, and deeply skilled in domestic matters, but one who
has learned to govern a family by wholesome discipline. He speaks chiefly of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>who may be expected to possess the natural disposition of their father; and
therefore it will be a great disgrace to a bishop, if he has children who lead a
wicked and scandalous life. As to wives, he will speak of them afterwards; but
at present, as I have said, he glances at the most important part of a
house.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the Epistle to Titus,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;560106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:6,) he shows what is here meant by the word <i>reverence; </i>for, after
having said that the children of a bishop must not be unruly and disobedient, he
likewise adds,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;nor liable to the
reproach of profligacy or of intemperance.&#8221;</font><br></div>

This argument, drawn from the less to the greater, is in itself manifest, that
he who is unfit for governing a family will be altogether unable to govern a
people. Besides that it is evident that he is destitute of the virtues necessary
for that purpose, what authority will he have over the people, seeing that his
own house makes him contemptible?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not a
novice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There being many men of
distinguished ability and learning who at that time were brought to the faith,
Paul forbids that such persons shall be admitted to the office of a bishop, as
soon as they have made profession of Christianity. And he shews how great would
be the danger; for it is evident that they are commonly vain, and full of
ostentation, and, in consequence of this, haughtiness and ambition will drive
them headlong. What Paul says we experience; for &#8220;novices&#8221; have not
only impetuous fervor and bold daring, but are also puffed up with foolish
confidence, as if they could fly beyond the clouds. Consequently, it is not
without reason that they are excluded from the honor of a bishopric, till, in
process of time their proud temper shall be subdued.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest he fall into the condemnation

preference to the former view; because it rarely happens that

Satan&#8221; may be taken either actively or passively. This latter sense is
adopted by Chrysostom, with whom I willingly agree There is an elegant contrast,
which heightens the enormity of the case, &#8220;If he who is placed over the
Church of God fall, by his pride, into the same condemnation with the
devil.&#8221; Yet I do not reject the active signification, namely, that he will
give the devil occasion for accusing him. But the opinion of Chrysostom is more
correct.<b>  </b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa59</font></sup><br></div>

appears to be very difficult, that a religious man should have, as witnesses of
his integrity, infidels themselves, who are furiously mad to tell lies against
us. But the apostle means, that, so far as relates to external behavior, even
unbelievers themselves shall be constrained to acknowledge him to be a good man;
for, although they groundlessly slander all the children of God, yet they cannot
pronounce him to be a wicked man, who leads a good and inoffensive life amongst
them. Such is that acknowledgment of uprightness which Paul here describes. The

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Likewise the
deacons</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is no reason why the
diversity of interpretations should lead us to entertain any doubt. It is
certain that time Apostle speaks of those who hold a public office in the
Church; and this refutes the opinion of those who think that domestic servants
are here meant. As to the view given by others, that it denotes presbyters who
are inferior to the e bishop, that is without foundation; for it is manifest
from other passages, that the term bishop belongs alike to all presbyters.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa60</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> All
are constrained to acknowledge this; and more especially a passage in the first
chapter of the Epistle to Titus proves clearly that this is the meaning.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;560107&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:7.) It remains to be stated that we understand &#8220;the deacons&#8221; to be
those who are mentioned by Luke,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;440603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
6:3,) and who had the charge of the poor. But those who wish to have a more full
account of the duties of deacons may consult the Institutes.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa61</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Grave, not
double-tongued</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The first four virtues,
with which he wishes them to be endowed, are of themselves sufficiently well
known. Yet it ought to be carefully observed that he advises them not to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>double-tongued</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>because it is a vice which it is difficult to avoid in the discharge of that
office, and yet ought, more than anything else, to be kept at a distance from
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Holding the mystery of
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. As </i>if he had said, &#8220;Holding
the pure doctrine of religion, and that from the heart, with a sincere fear of
God;&#8221; or, &#8220;Being well instructed in the faith, so as not to be
ignorant of anything which it is necessary for Christians to know.&#8221; He
gives to the sum of Christian doctrine the honorable appellation of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
mystery</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as indeed God, through the
gospel, reveals to men on earth a wisdom which angels in heaven behold with
admiration, and, therefore, we need not wonder if it exceed human
capacity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us therefore remember that it ought to be
embraced with the deepest reverence; and because we could never, by our own
strength, ascend to such a height, let us humbly entreat God to impart it to us
by the Spirit of revelation. On the other hand, when we see wicked men either
ridicule those doctrines or have no relish for then, let us acknowledge that it
is owing to the grace of God that those things which have been hidden from
others are in our hearts, and before our eyes, as Moses says,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;053011&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
30:11.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus he wishes that deacons should be well instructed
in &#8220;the mystery of<i> </i>faith;&#8221; because, although they; do not
hold the office <i>of </i>teaching, yet it would be exceedingly absurd to hold a
public office in the Church, while they were ill informed in the Christian
faith, more especially since they must frequently be laid under the necessity of
administering advice and consolation, if they do not choose to neglect their
duties. It is added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in a pure
conscience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which extends to the whole
life, but chiefly that they may know how to obey God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And let those be first
tried</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He wishes that they who are
chosen should not be unknown, but that their integrity should be ascertained,
like that of the bishops. And hence it is evident, that they are called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blameless</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>who are not stained by any marked vice. Besides, this trial is not for a
single hour, but consists in long experience. In a word, when deacons are to be
ordained, the choice must not fall at random, and without selection, on any that
come to hand, but those men are to be chosen who are approved by their past life
in such a manner that, after what may be called full inquiry, they are
ascertained to be well qualified.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Likewise the wives</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He means the wives
both of deacons and of bishops, for they must be aids to their husbands in their
office; which cannot be, unless their behavior excel that of
others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let the deacons
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Since he mentioned wives, he lays
down the same injunction about deacons as he had formerly down about bishops;
namely, that each of them &#8212; satisfied within having but one wife &#8212;
shall set an example of a chaste and honorable father of a family, and shall
keep his <i>children </i>and his whole house under holy discipline. And this
refutes the error of those who understand this passage as referring to domestic
servants.<b>  </b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa62</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.
For they who have served well</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Owing to
a practice which came into use one or two centuries after the death of the
apostles, of choosing presbyters from the order of deacons, this passage has
been commonly interpreted as describing elevation to a higher rank, as if the
Apostle called to the honor of being presbyters those who had faithfully
discharged the office of a deacon. For my own part, though I do not deny that
the order of deacons might sometimes be the nursery out of which presbyters were
taken, yet I take Paul&#8217;s words as meaning, more simply, that they who have
discharged this ministry in a proper manner are worthy of no small honor;
because it is not a mean employment, but a highly honorable office. Now by this
expression he intimates how much it is for the advantage of the Church to have
this office discharged by choice men; because the holy discharge of it procures
esteem and reverence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How absurd is it for Papists to maintain that, in
making deacons, they do what Paul enjoins! First, why do they make deacons but
to carry the cup in a procession, and to feed the eyes of the ignorant with I
know not what ridiculous exhibitions? Besides, they do not even observe this;
for not a single deacon has been made, during the last five hundred years,
except that, after taking this step, he may immediately rise to the priesthood.
What impudence is it, to boast of elevating to a higher rank those who have
ministered well, when they confer their priesthood on none but those who have
never touched a single part of the former office!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And much liberty in the
faith.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>With good reason does he add
this; for there is nothing that tends so much to produce liberty as a good
conscience and a life free from crime and reproach; as, on the contrary,
timidity must be the lot of those who have a bad conscience. And if they
sometimes make a valiant boast of liberty, yet it is not uniform and constant,
nor has it any weight. For this reason he describes also the kind of liberty.
&#8220;In the faith,&#8221; says he,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which is in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, that they may serve
&#8212; Christ with greater boldness; as, on the other hand, they who have acted
basely in the discharge of their office may be said to have their mouth shut and
their hands tied, and are unfit for doing good; because no reliance &#8212; no
authority is given to them.</font><br></div>

of his coming, partly in order to encourage him, and partly in order to repress
the insolence of those who grew more haughty on account of his absence. And yet
he does not make any feigned promise to Timothy, or terrify others through false
presence; for he fully expected that he would come, as it is probable that he
came, if he wrote this epistle at the time when he passed through Phrygia, as is
related by Luke.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441823&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
18:23.) Let us look on this as a proof how great was his anxiety for the
churches, when he could not endure to delay for a short time a remedy for a
present evil. Yet immediately afterwards he adds, that he wrote this epistle for
the purpose of informing Timothy, if it should happen that he were delayed
longer than he thought.</font><br></div>

be regarded as stewards, to whom God has committed the charge of governing his
house. If any person has the superintendence of a large house, he labors night
and day with earnest solicitude, that nothing may go wrong through his neglect,
or ignorance, or carelessness. If only for men this is done, how much more
should it be done for God?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the house of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There are good reasons why God
bestows this name on his Church; for not only has he received us to be his
children by the grace of adoption, but he also dwelleth in the midst of
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The pillar and foundation of
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>No ordinary enhancement is
derived from this appellation. Could it have been described in loftier language?
Is anything more venerable, or more holy, than that everlasting
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth
</i></font><font face="Palatino">which embraces both the glory of God and the
salvation of men? Were all the praises of heathen philosophy, with which it has
been adorned by its followers, collected into one heap, what is this in
comparison of the dignity of this wisdom, which alone deserves to be called
light and truth, and the instruction of life, and the way, and the kingdom of
God? Now it is preserved on earth by the ministry of the Church alone. What a
weight, therefore, rests on the pastors, who have been entrusted with the charge
of so inestimable a treasure! With what impudent trifling do Papists argue from
the words of Paul that all their absurdities ought to be held as oracles of God,
because they are &#8220;the pillar of truth,&#8221; and therefore cannot
err!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, we ought to see why Paul adorns the Church
with so magnificent a title. By holding out to pastors the greatness of the
office, He undoubtedly intended to remind them with what fidelity, and industry,
and reverence they ought to discharge it. How dreadful is the vengeance that
awaits them, if, through their fault, that truth which is the image of the
Divine glory, the light of the world, and the salvation of men, shall be allowed
to fall! This consideration ought undoubtedly to lead pastors to tremble
continually, not to deprive them of all energy, but to excite them to greater
vigilance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we may easily conclude in what sense Paul uses
these words. The reason why the Church is called the &#8220;pillar of
truth&#8221; is, that she defends and spreads it by her agency. God does not
himself come down from heaven to us, nor does he daily send angels to make known
his truth; but he employs pastors, whom he has appointed for that purpose. To
express it in a more homely manner, is not the Church the mother of all
believers? Does she not regenerate them by the word of God, educate and nourish
them through their whole life, strengthen, and bring them at length to absolute
perfection? For the same reason, also, she is called &#8220;the pillar of
truth;&#8221; because the office of administering doctrine, which God hath
placed in her hands, is the only instrument of preserving the truth, that it may
not perish from the remembrance of men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Consequently this commendation relates to the
ministry of the word; for if that be removed, the truth of God will fall to the
ground. Not that it is less strong, if it be not supported by the shoulders of
men, as the same Papists idly talk; for it is a shocking blasphemy to say, that
the word of God is uncertain, till it obtain from men what may be called a
borrowed certainty. Paul simply means what he states elsewhere in other words,
that since our &#8220;faith is by hearing,&#8221; there will be no faith, unless
there be preaching.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:17.) Accordingly in reference to men, the Church maintains the truth, because
by preaching the Church proclaims it, because she keeps it pure and entire,
because she transmits it to posterity. And if the instruction of the gospel be
not proclaimed, if there are no godly ministers who, by their preaching, rescue
truth from darkness and forgetfulness, instantly falsehoods, errors, impostures,
superstitions, and every kind of corruption, will reign. In short, silence in
the Church is the banishment and crushing of the truth. Is there anything at all
forced in this exposition?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having ascertained Paul&#8217;s meaning, let us
return to the Papists. First, by applying this eulogium to themselves, they act
wickedly; because they deck themselves with borrowed feathers. For, granting
that the Church were elevated above the third heaven, I maintain that it has
nothing to do with them in any manner. Nay, I even turn the whole passage
against them; for, if the Church &#8220;is the pillar of truth,&#8221; it
follows that the Church is not with them, when the truth not only lies buried,
but is shockingly torn, and thrown down, and trampled under foot. Is this either
a riddle or a quibble? Paul does not wish that any society, in which the truth
of God does not hold a lofty and conspicuous place, shall be acknowledged to be
a Church; now there is nothing of all this in Popery, but only ruin and
desolation; and, therefore, the true mark of a Church is not found in it. But
the mistake arises from this, that they do not consider, what was of the
greatest importance, that the truth of God is maintained by the pure preaching
of the gospel; and that the support of it does not depend on the faculties or
understandings of men, but rests on what is far higher, that is, if it does not
depart from the simple word of God.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Great is the mystery of

enhancement. That the truth of God might not, through the ingratitude of men, be

that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;great is the

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Colossians
2:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From the greatness and importance of such matters,
pastors ought to judge of their office, that they may devote themselves to the
discharge of it with greater conscientiousness and deeper
reverence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God manifested in the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Vulgate&#8217;s translator,
by leaving out the name of <i>God, </i>refers what follows to &#8220;the
mystery,&#8221; but altogether unskillfully and inappropriately, as will clearly
be seen on a bare perusal, though he has Erasmus on his side, who, however,
destroys the authority of his own views, so that it is unnecessary for me to
refute it. All the Greek copies undoubtedly agree in this rendering, &#8220;God
manifested in the flesh.&#8221; But granting that Paul did not express the name
of God, still any one who shall carefully examine the whole matter, will
acknowledge that the name of Christ ought to be supplied. For my own part, I
have no hesitation in following the reading which has been adopted in the Greek
copies. In calling the manifestation of Christ, such as he afterwards describes
it, a &#8220;great mystery,&#8221; the reason is obvious; for this is &#8220;the
height, depth, and breadth of wisdom,&#8221; which he has elsewhere mentioned,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:18,) by which all our senses must unavoidably be overwhelmed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now examine the various clauses in their
order. He could not have spoken more appropriately about the person of Christ
than in these words, &#8220;God manifested in the flesh.&#8221; First, we have
here an express testimony of both natures; for he declares at the same time that
Christ is true God and true man. Secondly, he points out the distinction between
the two natures, when, on the one hand, he calls him God, and, on the other,
expresses his &#8220;manifestation, in the flesh.&#8221; Thirdly, he asserts the
unity of the person, when he declares, that it is one and the same who was God,
and who has been manifested in the flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus, by this single passage, the true and orthodox
faith is powerfully defended against Arius, Marcion, Nestorius, and Eutyches.
There is also great emphasis in the contrast of the two words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God in
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>How wide is the difference
between God and man! And yet in Christ we behold the infinite glory of God
united to our polluted flesh in such a manner that they become one.<b>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Justified in the

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;502007&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:7,) by taking upon him our flesh, so there was displayed in him a spiritual
power which testified that he is God. This passage has received various
interpretations; but, for my own part, satisfied with having explained the
Apostle&#8217;s real meaning, as far as I understand it, I shall add nothing
more. First, <i>justification </i>here denotes an acknowledgment of divine
power; as in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;191909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
19:9, where it is said, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;the judgments of
God are justified,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">that is, are wonderfully and absolutely perfect;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa65</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
51:5, that &#8220;God is justified,&#8221; meaning that the praise of his
justice is illustriously displayed. So also,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
11:19, and
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420735&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
7:35,) when Christ says, that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Wisdom hath been
justified by her children,&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">he means that they have given honor unto her; and
when Luke
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420729&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
7:29) relates that the publicans &#8220;justified God,&#8221; he means that they
acknowledged, with due reverence and gratitude, the grace of God which they
beheld in Christ. What we read here has, therefore, the same meaning as if Paul
had said, that he who appeared clothed with human flesh was, at the same time,
declared to be the Son of God, so that the weakness of the flesh made no
diminution of his glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Under the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he includes everything in Christ that was divine and superior to man; and he
does so for two reasons: First, because he had been humbled in &#8220;the
flesh,&#8221; the Apostle now, by exhibiting the illustration of his glory,
contrasts &#8220;the Spirit&#8221; with &#8220;the flesh.&#8221; Secondly, that
glory, worthy of the only &#8212; begotten Son of God, which John affirms to
have been seen in Christ,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430114&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:14,) did not consist in outward display, or in earthly splendor, but was
almost wholly spiritual. The same form of expression is used by him,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:3-4,) &#8220;Who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, and
declared by the power of the Spirit to be the Son of. God;&#8221; but with this
difference, that in that passage he mentions one kind of manifestation, namely,
the resurrection.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seen by angels, preached to the
Gentiles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>All these statements are
wonderful and astonishing; that God deigned to bestow on the Gentiles, who had
hitherto wandered in the blindness of their minds, a revelation of his Son,
which had been unknown even to the angels in heaven. When the Apostle says, that
he was &#8220;seen by angels,&#8221; he means that the sight was such as drew
the attention of angels, both by its novelty and by its excellence. How uncommon
and extraordinary the calling of the Gentiles was, we have stated in the
exposition of the second chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Nor
is it wonderful that it was a new spectacle to angels, who, though they knew
about the redemption of mankind, yet did not at first understand the means by
which it should be accomplished, and from whom it must have been concealed, in
order that this remarkable display of the goodness of God might be beheld by
them with greater admiration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Obtained belief in the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was above all things
astonishing that God made the Gentiles, who were heathens, and the angels, who
held uninterrupted possession of his kingdom, to be equally partakers of the
same revelation. But this great efficacy of the preached gospel was no ordinary
miracle, when Christ, overcoming all obstacles, subdued to the obedience of
faith those who seemed to be altogether incapable of being tanned. Certainly
nothing appeared to be less probable &#8212; so completely was every entrance
closed and shut up. Yet faith vanquished, but by an incredible kind of
victory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lastly, he says that he was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>received into
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino">; that is<i>, </i>from this mortal and
wretched life. Accordingly, as in the world, so far as related to the obedience
of faith, so also in the person of Christ, the change was wonderful, when, from
the mean condition of a servant, he was exalted to the right hand of the Father,
that every knee may bow to him.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now the Spirit plainly
saith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He had industriously admonished
Timothy about many things; and now he sews the necessity, because it is proper
to provide against the danger which the Holy Spirit forewarns to be fast
approaching, namely, that false teachers will come, who shall hold out trifles
as the doctrine of faith, and who, placing all holiness in outward exercises,
shall throw into the shade the spiritual worship of God, which alone is lawful.
And, indeed, the servants of God have always had to contend against such persons
as Paul here describes. Men being by nature inclined to hypocrisy, Satan easily
persuades them that God is worshipped aright by ceremonies and outward
discipline; and, indeed, without a teacher, almost all have this conviction
deeply rooted in their hearts. Next is added the craftiness of Satan to confirm
the error: The consequence is, that, in all ages, there have been impostors, who
recommended false worship, by which true godliness was buried. Again, this
plague produces another, namely, that, in matters indifferent, men are laid
under restraint; for the world easily permits itself to be hindered from doing
that which God had declared to be lawful, in order that they may have it in
their power to transgress with impunity the laws of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here Paul, therefore, in the person of Timothy,
forewarns not only the Ephesians, but all the churches throughout the world,
about hypocritical teachers, who, by setting up false worship, and by ensnaring
consciences with new laws, adulterate the true worship of God, and corrupt the
pure doctrine of faith. This is the real object of the passage, which it is
especially necessary to remark.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, in order that all may hear with more earnest
attention what he is going to say, he opens with a preface, that this is an
undoubted and very clear prophecy of the Holy Spirit. There is, indeed, no
reason to doubt that he drew all the rest from the same Spirit; but, although we
ought always to listen to him as communicating the will of Christ, yet in a
matter of vast importance he wished especially to testify that he said nothing
but by the Spirit of prophecy. By a solemn announcement, therefore, he
recommends to us this prophecy; and, not satisfied with doing this, he adds that
it is plain, and free from all ambiguity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the latter
times</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>At that time certainly it could
not have been expected that, amidst so clear light of the gospel, any would have
revolted. But this is what Peter says, that, as false teachers formerly gave
annoyance to the people of Israel, so they will never cease to disturb the
Christian Church.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;610303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Peter 3:3.) The meaning is the same as if he had said, &#8220;The doctrine of
the gospel is now in a flourishing state, but Satan will not long refrain from
laboring to choke the pure seed by tares.&#8221;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa67</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401320&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:20, 38.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This warning was advantageous in the age of the
Apostle Paul, that both pastors and others might give earnest attention to pure
doctrine, and not suffer themselves to be deceived. To us in the present day it
is not less useful, when we perceive that nothing has happened which was not
fore told by an express prophecy of the Spirit. Besides, we may here remark; how
great care God exercises about his Church, when he gives so early warning of
dangers. Satan has, indeed, manifold arts for leading us into error, and attacks
us by astonishing stratagems; but, on the other hand, fortifies us sufficiently,
if we did not of our own accord choose to be deceived. There is therefore no
reason to complain that darkness is more powerful than light, or that truth is
vanquished by falsehood; but, on the contrary, we suffer the punishment of our
carelessness and indolence, when we are led aside from the right way of
salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But they who flatter themselves in their errors
object, that it is hardly possible to distinguish whom or what kind of persons
Paul describes. As if it were for nothing that the Spirit uttered this prophecy,
and published it so long before; for, if there were no certain mark, the whole
of the present warning would be superfluous, and consequently absurd. But far be
it from us to think that the Spirit of God gives us unnecessary alarm, or does
not accompany the threatening of danger by strewing how we should guard against
it! And that slander is sufficiently refuted by the words of Paul; for he points
out, as with the finger, that evil which he warns us to avoid. He does not
speak, in general terms, about false prophets, but plainly describes the kind of
false doctrine; namely, that which, by linking godliness with outward elements,
perverts and profanes, as I have already said, the spiritual worship of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Some will revolt from the
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is uncertain whether he speaks
of teachers or of hearers; but I am more disposed to refer it to the latter; for
he afterwards calls teachers spirits that are impostors. And this is
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejmfatikw&gt;teron</font><font face="Palatino">)
more emphatic, that not only will there be those who sow wicked doctrines, and
corrupt the purity of faith, but that they can never want disciples whom they
call draw into their sect; and when a lie thus gains prevalence, there arises
from it greater trouble.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, it is no slight vice which he describes, but
a very heinous crime &#8212; apostasy
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>although, at first Sight, in the
doctrine which he briefly notices there does not appear to be so much evil. What
is the case? Is faith completely overturned on account of the prohibition of
marriage, or of certain kinds of food? But we must take into view a higher
reason, that men pervert and invent at their pleasure the worship of God, that
they assume dominion over the consciences, and that they dare to forbid that use
of good things which the Lord has permitted. As soon as the purity of the
worship of God is impaired, there no longer remains anything perfect or sound,
and faith itself is utterly ruined.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, although Papists laugh at us, when we
censure their tyrannical laws about outward observances, yet we know that we are
pleading a cause of the greatest weight and importance; because the doctrine of
faith is destroyed, as soon as the worship of God is infected by such
corruptions. The controversy is not about flesh or fish, or about a black or
ashy color, or about Friday or Wednesday, but about the mad superstitions of
men, who wish to appease God by such trifles, and, by contriving a carnal
worship of him, contrive for themselves an idol instead of God. Who will deny
that this is revolting from the faith?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"> </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To
deceiving spirits</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He means prophets or
teachers, to whom he gives this designation, because they boast of the Spirit,
and, under this title, insinuate themselves into the favor of the people. This,
indeed, is true at all times, that men, whatever they are, speak under the
excitement of the spirit. But it is not the same spirit that excites them all;
for sometimes Satan is a lying spirit in the mouth of the false prophets, in
order to deceive unbelievers, who deserve to be deceived.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;112221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Kings 22:21-23.) On the other hand, every one that renders due honor to Christ
speaks by the Spirit of God, as Paul testifies.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 12:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now that mode of expression, of which we are now
speaking, originated at first from this circumstance, that the servants of God
professed to have from the revelation of the Spirit, everything that they
uttered in public. This was actually true; and hence they received the name of
the Spirit, whose organs they were. But the ministers of Satan, by a false
emulation, like apes, began afterwards to make the same boast, and likewise
falsely assumed the name. On the same grounds John says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Try the spirits,
whether they are of God.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;620401&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
John 4:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, Paul explains his meaning by adding,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to doctrines of
devils</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>which is as if he bad said,
&#8220;Attending to false prophets, and to their devilish doctrines.&#8221;
Again observe, that it is not an error of small importance, or one that ought to
be concealed, when consciences are bound by the contrivances of men, and at the
same time the worship of God is corrupted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Speaking lies in hypocrisy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>If these
words refer to &#8220;demons,&#8221; then this word will mean men deceiving
through the instigation of the devil. But we may also supply the words,
&#8220;of men speaking.&#8221; He now descends to a particular instance, when he
says that they &#8220;speak lies in hypocrisy,&#8221; and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>have their conscience seared with
a hot iron</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> And<i>, </i>indeed, it ought
to be known that these two are so closely Joined together that the former
springs from the latter; for consciences, that are bad and seared with the hot
iron of their crimes, always flee to hypocrisy as a ready refuge; that is, they
contrive hypocritical presences, in order to dazzle the eyes of God; and what
else is done by those who endeavor to appease God by the mask of outward
observances?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hypocrisy</i></font><font face="Palatino">
must therefore lie explained agreeably to the passage in which it now occurs;
for, first, it must relate to doctrine, and, next, it denotes that kind of
doctrine which adulterates the spiritual worship of God by exchanging its
genuine purity for bodily exercises; and thus it includes all methods contrived
by men for appeasing God or obtaining his favor. The meaning may be thus summed
up; first, that all who assume a pretended sanctimoniousness are led by the
instigation of the devil; because God is never worshipped aright by outward
ceremonies; for true worshipers</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;worship him in
spirit and truth,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
4:24)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and, secondly, that this is a useless medicine, by
which hypocrites mitigate their pains, or rather a plaster by which bad
consciences conceal their wounds, without any advantage, and to their utter
destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Forbidding to

mentions two instances,<b>

namely, the prohibition of marriage and of some kinds of food. They arise from
that hypocrisy which, having forsaken true holiness, seeks something else for
time purpose of concealment and disguise; for they who do not keep from
ambition, covetousness, hatred, cruelty, and such like, endeavor to obtain a
righteousness by abstaining from those things which God has left at large. Why
are consciences burdened by those laws, but because perfection is sought in
something different from the law of God? This is not done but by hypocrites,
who, in order that they may with impunity transgress that righteousness of the
heart which the law requires, endeavor to conceal their inward wickedness by
those outward observances as veils with which they cover
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This was a distinct threatening of danger, so that it
was not difficult for men to guard against it, at least if they had lent their
ears to the Holy Spirit, when he gave so express a warning. Yet we see that the
darkness of Satan generally prevailed, so that the clear light of this striking
and memorable prediction was of no avail. Not long after the death of the
apostle, arose Encratites, (who took their name from continence,) Tatianists,<b>
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa69</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Catharists, Montanus with his sect, and at length Manichaeans, who had extreme
aversion to marriage and the eating of flesh, and condemned them as profane
things. Although they were disowned by the Church, on account of their
haughtiness, in wishing to subject others to their opinions, yet it is evident
that those who opposed them yielded to their error more than was proper. It was
not intended by those of whom I am now speaking to impose a law on Christians;
but yet they attached greater weight than they ought to have done to
superstitious observances, such as abstaining from marriage, and not tasting
flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Such is the disposition of the world, always dreaming
that God ought to be worshipped in a carnal manner, as if God were carnal.
Matters becoming gradually worse, this tyranny was established, that it should
not be lawful for priests or monks to enter into the married state, and that no
person should dare to taste flesh on certain days. Not unjustly, therefore, do
we maintain that this prediction was uttered against the Papists, since celibacy
and abstinence from certain kinds of food are enjoined by them more strictly
than any commandment of God. They think that they escape by an ingenious
artifice, when they torture Paul&#8217;s words to direct them against Tatianists
or Manichaeans, or such like; as if the Tatianists had not the same means of
escape open to them by throwing back the censure of Paul on the Cataphrygians,
and on Montanus the author of that sect; or as if the Cataphrygians had it not
in their power to bring forward the Encratites, in their room, as the guilty
parties. But Paul does not here speak of persons, but of the thing itself; and,
therefore although a hundred different sects he brought forward, all of which
are charged with the same hypocrisy in forbidding some kinds of food, they shall
all incur the same condemnation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence it follows, that to no purpose do the Papists
point to the ancient heretics, as if they alone were censured; we must always
see if they are not guilty in the same manner They object, that they do not
resemble the Encratites and Manichaens, because they do not absolutely forbid
the use of marriage and of flesh, but only on certain days constrain to
abstinence from flesh, and make the vow of celibacy compulsory on none but monks
and priests and nuns. But this excuse also is excessively frivolous; for, first,
they nevertheless make holiness to consist in these things; next, they set up a
false and spurious worship of God; and lastly, they bind consciences by a
necessity from which they ought to have been free.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the fifth book of Eusebius, there is a fragment
taken out of the writings of Apollonius, in which, among other things, he
reproaches Montanus with being the first that dissolved marriage, and laid down
laws for fasting. He does not say, that Montanus absolutely prohibited marriage
or certain kinds of food. It is enough if he lay a religious obligation on the
consciences, and command men to worship God by observing those things; for the
prohibition of things that are indifferent, whether it be general or special, is
always a diabolical tyranny. That this is true in regard to certain kinds of
food will appear more clearly from the next clause,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which God
created</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is proper to observe the reason,
that, in the use of various kinds of food, we ought to be satisfied with the
liberty which God has granted to us; because He created them for this purpose.
It yields inconceivable joy to all the godly, when they know that all the kinds
of food which they eat are put into their hands by the Lord, so that the use of
them is pure and lawful. What insolence is it in men to take away what God
bestows! Did they create food? Can they make void the creation of God? Let it
always be remembered by us, that he who created the food, gave us also the free
use of it, which it is vain for men to attempt to hinder.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To be received with
Thanksgiving</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God created food
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to be
received</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, that we may enjoy it.
This end can ever be set aside by human authority. He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with
thanksgiving</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>because we can never
render to God any recompense for his kindness but a testimony of gratitude. And
thus he holds up to greater abhorrence those wicked lawgivers who, by new and
hasty enactments, hinder the sacrifice of praise which God especially requires
us to offer to him. Now, there can be no thanksgiving without sobriety and
temperance; for the kindness of God is not truly acknowledged by him who
wickedly abuses it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By
believers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>What then? Does not God make
his sun to rise daily on the good and the bad?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400545&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:45.) Does not the earth, by his command, yield bread to the wicked? Are not
the very worst of men fed by his blessing? When David says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He causeth the
herb to grow for the service of men, that he may bring forth food out of the
earth,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;19A414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
104:14)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">the kindness which he describes is universal. I
reply, Paul speaks here of the lawful use, of which we are assured before God.
Wicked men are in no degree partakers of it, on account of their impure
conscience, which, as is said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;defileth all
things.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;560115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Titus
1:15,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And indeed, properly speaking, God has appointed to
his children alone the whole world and all that is in the world. For this
reason, they are also called the heirs of the world; for at the beginning Adam
was appointed to be lord of all, on this condition, that he should continue in
obedience to God. Accordingly, his rebellion against God deprived of the right,
which had been bestowed on him, not only himself but his posterity,. And since
all things are subject to Christ, we are fully restored by His mediation, and
that through faith; and therefore all that unbelievers enjoy may be regarded as
the property of others, which they rob or steal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And by those that know the
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In this clause he defines who
they are whom he calls &#8220;believers,&#8221; namely, those that have a
knowledge of<i> </i>sound doctrine; for there is no faith but from the word of
God; in order that we may not falsely think, as the Papists imagine, that faith
is a confused opinion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
For every creature of God is good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The
use of food must be judged, partly from its substance, and partly from the
person of him who eats it. The Apostle therefore avails himself of both
arguments. So far as relates to food, he asserts that it is pure, because God
has created it; and that the use of it is consecrated to us by faith and prayer.
The goodness of the creatures, which he mentions, has relation to men, and that
not with regard to the body or to health, but to the consciences. I make this
remark, that none may enter into curious speculations unconnected with the scope
of the passage; for, in a single word, Paul means, that those things which come
from the hand of God, and are intended for our use, are not unclean or polluted
before God, but that we may freely eat them with regard to
conscience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it be objected, that many animals were formerly
pronounced to be unclean under the Law, and that fruit, which: was yielded by
the tree of knowledge of good and evil, was destructive to man; the answer is,
that creatures are not called pure, merely because they are the works of God,
but because, through his kindness, they have been given to us; for we must
always look at the appointment of God, both what he commands and what he
forbids.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For it is sanctified by the
word of God and prayer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is the
confirmation of the preceding clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if it be received with
Thanksgiving</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And it is an argument drawn from
contrast; for &#8220;holy&#8221; and &#8220;profane&#8221; are things contrary
to each other. Let us now see what is time sanctification of all good things,
which belong to the sustenance of the present life. Paul testifies that it
consists of &#8220;the word of God and prayer.&#8221; But it ought to be
observed, that this <i>word </i>must be embraced by faith, in order that it may
be advantageous; for, although God himself sanctifies all things by the Spirit
of his mouth, yet we do not obtain that benefit but by faith. To this is added
&#8220;prayer;&#8221; for, on the one hand, we ask from God our daily bread,
according to the commandment of Christ,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
6:11;) and, on the other hand we offer thanksgiving to Him for His
goodness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now Paul&#8217;s doctrine proceeds on this principle,
that there is no good thing, the possession of which is lawful, unless
conscience testify that it is lawfully our own. And which of us would venture to
claim for himself a single grain of wheat, if he were not taught by the word of
God that he is the heir of the world? Common sense, indeed, pronounces, that the
wealth of the world is naturally intended for our use; but, since dominion over
the world was taken from us in Adam, everything that we touch of the gifts of
God is defiled by our pollution; and, on the other hand, it is unclean to us,
till God graciously come to our aid, and&#8217; by ingrafting us into his Son,
constitutes us anew to be lords of the world, that we may lawfully use as our
own all the wealth with which he supplies us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Justly, therefore, does Paul connect lawful enjoyment
with &#8220;the word&#8221;, by which alone we regain what was lost in Adam; for
we must acknowledge God as our Father, that we may be his heirs, and Christ as
our Head, that those things which are his may become ours. Hence it ought to be
inferred that the use of all the gifts of God is unclean, unless it be
accompanied by true knowledge and calling on the name of God; and that it is a
beastly way of eating, when we sit down at table without any prayer; and, when
we have eaten to the full, depart in utter forgetfulness of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And if such sanctification is demanded in regard to
common food, which, together with the belly, is subject to corruption, what must
we think about spiritual sacraments? If &#8220;the word,&#8221; and calling on
God through faith, be not there, what remains that is not profane? Here we must
attend to the distinction between the blessing of the sacramental table and the
blessing of a common table; for, as to the food which we eat for the nourishment
of our body, we bless it for this purpose, that we may receive it in a pure and
lawful manner; but we consecrate, in a more solemn manner, the bread and wine in
the Lord&#8217;s Supper, that they may be pledges to us of the body and blood of
Christ.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Exhibiting these things to
the brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this expression he
exhorts Timothy to mention those things frequently; and he afterwards repeats
this a second and a third time; for they are things of such a nature as it is
proper to call frequently to remembrance. And we ought to make the contrast
which is implied; for the doctrine which he commends is here contrasted by him
not with false or wicked doctrines, but with useless trifles which do not edify.
He wishes that those trifles may be entirely buried in forgetfulness, when he
enjoins Timothy to be earnest in exhibiting other things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou shalt be a good
minister</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Men frequently aim at
something else than to approve themselves to Christ; and consequently many are
desirous of being applauded for genius, eloquence, and profound knowledge. And
that is the very reason why they pay less attention to necessary things, which
do not tend to procure the admiration of the common people. But Paul enjoins
Timothy to be satisfied with this alone, to be a faithful minister of Christ.
And certainly we ought to look on this as a far more honorable title than to be
a thousand times called seraphic and subtle doctors. Let us, therefore,
remember, that as it is the highest honor of a godly pastor to be reckoned a
good servant of Christ, so he ought to aim at nothing else during his whole
ministry; for whoever has any other object in view, will have it in his power to
obtain applause from men, but will not please God. Accordingly, that we may not
be deprived of so great a blessing, let us learn to seek nothing else, and to
account nothing so valuable, and to treat everything as worthless in comparison
of this single object.</font><br></div>

active signification, <i>nourishing; </i>but as there is no noun governed by the
verb, I think that this would be ratter a forced construction; and, therefore, I
prefer to take it in a passive sense, as confirming the preceding exhortation by
the education of Timothy. As if he had said, &#8220;As thou hast been, from thy
infancy, properly instructed in the faith, and, so to speak, hast sucked along
with the milk sound doctrine, and hast made continual progress in it hitherto,
endeavor, by faithful ministration, to prove that thou art such.&#8221; This

After having instructed him as to doctrine, what it ought to be, he now also
admonishes him what kind of example he ought to give to others. He says, that he
ought to be employed in &#8220;godliness;&#8221; for, when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Exercise
thyself</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he means that this is his proper
occupation, his labor, his chief care. As if he had said, &#8220;There is no
reason why you should weary yourself to no purpose about other matters; you will
do that which is of the highest importance, if you devote yourself, with all
your zeal, and with all your ability, to godliness alone.&#8221; By the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>godliness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
he means the spiritual worship of God which consists in purity of conscience;
which is still more evident from what follows, when it is contrasted with bodily
exercise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
For bodily exercise is of little profit</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the
exercise &#8220;of the body,&#8221; he does not mean that which lies in:
hunting, or in the race-course, or in wrestling, or in digging, or in the
mechanical occupations; but he gives that name to all the outward actions that
are undertaken, for the sake of religion, such as watchings, long fasts, lying
on the earth, and such like. Yet he does not here censure the superstitious
observance of those things; otherwise he would totally condemn them, as he does
in the Epistle to the Colossians,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510221&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:21,) but at present he only speaks slightingly of them, and says that they are
of little advantage. So, then though the heart be altogether upright, and the
object proper, yet, in outward actions, Paul finds nothing that he can value
highly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a very necessary warning; for the world will
always lean to the side of wishing to worship God by outward services; which is
an exceedingly dangerous imagination. But &#8212; to say nothing about the
wicked opinion of merit &#8212; our nature always disposes us strongly to
attribute more than we ought to austerity of life; as if it were no ordinary
portion of Christian holiness. A clearer view of this cannot be adduced, than
the fact, that, shortly after the publication of this command, the whole world
was ravished with immoderate admiration of the empty form of bodily exercises.
Hence arose the order of monks and nuns, and nearly all the most excellent
discipline of the ancient Church, or, at least, that part of it which was most
highly esteemed by the common people. If the ancient monks had not dreamed that
there was some indescribably divine or angelical perfection in their austere
manner of living, they would never have pursued it with so much ardor. In like
manner, if pastors had not attached undue value to the ceremonies which were
then observed for the mortification of the flesh, they would never have been so
rigid in exacting them.: And what does Paul say on the other hand? That, when
any one shall have labored much and long in those exercises, the profit will be
small and inconsiderable; for they are nothing but the rudiments of childish
discipline.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But godliness is profitable for all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>That is, he who has godliness
wants nothing, though he has not those little aids; for godliness alone is able
to conduct a man to complete perfection. It is the beginning, the middle, and
the end, of Christian life; and, therefore, where that is entire, nothing is
imperfect. Christ did not lead so austere a manner of life as John the Baptist;
was he, therefore, any whit inferior? Let the meaning be thus summed up.
&#8220;We ought to apply ourselves altogether to piety alone; because when we
have once attained it, God asks nothing more from us; and we ought to give
attention to bodily exercises in such a manner as not to hinder or retard the
practice of godliness.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which hath the
promises</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is a very great
consolation, that God does not wish the godly to be in want of anything; for,
having made our perfection to consist in godliness, he now makes it the
perfection of all happiness. As it is the beginning of happiness in this life,
so he likewise extends to it the promise of divine grace, which alone makes us
happy, and without which we are very miserable; for God testifies that, even in
this life, he will be our Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us remember to distinguish between the good
things of the present and of the future life; for God bestows kindness on us in
this world, in order that he may give us only a taste of his goodness, and by
such a taste may allure us to the desire of heavenly benefits, that in them we
may find satisfaction. The consequence is, that the good things of the present
life are not only mingled with very many afflictions, but, we may almost say,
overwhelmed by them; for it is not expedient for us to have abundance in this
world, lest we should indulge in luxury. Again, lest any one should found on
this passage the merits of works, we ought to keep in mind what we have already
said, that godliness includes not only a good conscience toward men, and the
fear of God, but likewise faith and calling upon him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
This is a faithful saying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now sets
down, at the conclusion of the argument, what he stated twice at the beginning
of it; and he appears to do so expressly, because he will immediately subjoin
the contrary objection. Yet it is not without good reason that he employs so
strong an assertion; for it is a paradox strongly at variance with the feeling
of the flesh, that God supplies his people, in this world, with everything that
is necessary for a happy and joyful life; since they are often destitute of all
good things, and, on that account, appear to be forsaken by God. Accordingly,
not satisfied with the simple doctrine, he wards off all opposing temptations by
this shield, and in this manner instructs believers to open the door to the
grace of God, which our unbelief shuts out; for, undoubtedly if we were willing
to receive God&#8217;s benefits,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa73</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> he
would use greater liberality toward us.</font><br></div>

anticipation by which he solves that question, &#8220;Are not believers the most
miserable of all men, because they are oppressed by tribulations of every
kind?&#8221; In order to show, therefore, that their condition must not be
judged from outward appearance, he distinguishes them from others, first in the
cause, and next in the result. Hence it follows, that they lose nothing of the
promises which he has mentioned, when they are tried by adversity. The sum is,
that believers are not miserable in afflictions, because a good conscience
supports them, and a blessed and joyful end awaits them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, since the happiness of the present life consists
chiefly of two parts, honor and conveniences, he contrasts them within two

such a kind, that men ought not to be weary of it, though they heard it every

the demonstrative <i>these; </i>for it means that they are not things of small
importance, of which it is enough to take a passing and brief notice; but, on
the contrary, that they deserve to be repeated every day, because they cannot be
too much inculcated. A prudent pastor ought, therefore, to consider what things
are chiefly necessary, that he may dwell on them. Nor is there reason to dread
that it shall become wearisome; for whosoever is of God will gladly hear
frequently those things which need to be so often uttered.</font><br></div>

this, both in regard to others, and to Timothy himself. As to others, he does
not wish that the age of Timothy should prevent him from obtaining that
reverence which he deserves, provided that, in other respects, he conduct
himself as becomes a minister of Christ. And, at the same time, he instructs
Timothy to supply by gravity of demeanor what is wanting in his age. As if he
had said, &#8220;Take care that, by gravity of demeanor, thou procure for
thyself so great reverence, that thy youthful age, which, in other respects lays
one open to contempt, may take nothing from thy authority.&#8221; Hence we learn
that Timothy was still young, though he held a place of distinguished excellence
among many pastors; and that it is a grievous mistake to estimate by the number
of years how much is due to a person.</font><br></div>

the Spirit.</font><br></div>

the custom and ordinary practice of the Apostles to ordain ministers &#8220;by
the laying on of hands.&#8221; As to this ceremony, and its origin and meaning,
I have formerly given a brief explanation of them, and the rest may be learned
from the Institutes (Book 4: chap. 3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They who think that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>presbytery

</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa78</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
are, I think, correct in their opinion; although, after weighing the whole
matter, I acknowledge that a different meaning is not inapplicable, that is,
that <i>presbytery </i>or <i>eldership</i> &#8212; is the name of an office. He
put the ceremony for the very act of ordination; and therefore the meaning is,
that Timothy &#8212; having been called to the ministry by the voice of the
prophets, and having afterwards been solemnly ordained was, at the same time,
endued with the grace of the Holy Spirit for the discharge of his office. Hence
we infer that it was not a useless ceremony, because God? by his Spirit,
accomplished that consecration which men expressed symbolically &#8220;by the
laying on of hands.&#8221;</font><br></div>

might; and that not only for a short time, but with unfailing perseverance.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa80</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Paul therefore reminds Timothy that this work leaves no room for indolence, or
for slackening his labors, but demands the utmost industry and constant
application.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That thy profiting may be

means, that he ought to labor to this purpose, that by his agency the
edification of the Church may be: more and more advanced, and that corresponding
results may be visible; for it is not the work of a single day, and therefore he
should strive to make daily progress. Some refer this to Timothy, that he may
profit more and more; but I choose rather to interpret it as referring to the
effect of his ministry.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Greek words,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn
pa~sin</font><font face="Palatino">, may either be translated, <i>to all men,
</i>or, in <i>all things. </i>There will thus be a twofold meaning; either,
&#8220;that all may see the progress which springs from his labors&#8221;, or,
&#8220;that in all respects, or in every possible way, (which is the same
thing,) they may be visible.&#8221; I prefer the latter view.</font><br></div>

Give heed to thyself, and to the doctrine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>There are two things of which a good pastor should be careful; to be
diligent in teaching, and to keep himself pure.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa81</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It
is not enough if he frame his life to all that is good and commendable, and
guard against giving a bad example, if he do not likewise add to a holy life
continual diligence in teaching; and, on the other hand, doctrine will be of
little avail, if there be not a corresponding goodness and holiness of life.
With good reason, therefore, does Paul urge Timothy to &#8220;give heed,&#8221;
both to himself personally, and to doctrine, for the general advantage of the
Church. On the other hand, he commends his constancy, that he may never grow
weary; for there are many things that frequently happen, which may lead us aside
from the right course, if we do not set our foot firmly to
resist.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If thou shalt do these things, thou
shalt both save thyself end them that hear
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is no ordinary spur to excite
the thoughtfulness of pastors, when they learn that their own salvation, as well
as that of the people, depends on the industry and perseverance with which they
devote themselves to their office. And as doctrine, which solidly edifies, is
commonly attended by little display, Paul says that he ought to consider what is
profitable. As if he had said,&#8221; Let men who are desirous of glory be fed
by their ambition, let them applaud themselves for their ingenuity; to you, let
it be enough to devote yourself to your own salvation and that of the
people.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, this exhortation applies to the whole body of
the Church, that they, may not take offense at the simplicity which both
quickens souls and preserves them in health. Nor ought they to think it strange
that Paul ascribes to Timothy the work of saving the Church; for, certainly, all
that is gained to God is saved, and it is by the preaching of the gospel that we
are gathered to Christ. And as the unfaithfulness or carelessness of the pastor
is ruinous to the Church, so the cause of salvation is justly ascribed to his
faithfulness and diligence. True, it is God alone that saves; and not even the
smallest portion of his glory can lawfully be bestowed on men. But God parts
with no portion of his glory when he employs the agency of men for bestowing
salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our salvation is, therefore, the gift of God alone,
because from him alone it proceeds, and by his power alone it is performed; and
therefore, to him alone, as the author, it must be ascribed. But the ministry of
men is not on that account excluded, nor does all this interfere with the
salutary tendency of that government on which, as Paul shews, the prosperity of
the Church depends.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490411&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
4:11.) Moreover, this is altogether the work of God, because it is he who forms
good pastors, and guides them by his Spirit, and blesses their labor, that it
may not be ineffectual.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If thus a good pastor is the salvation of his
hearers, let bad and careless men know that their destruction must be ascribed
to those who have the charge of them; for, as the: salvation of the flock is the
crown of the pastor, so from careless pastors all that perishes will be
required. Again, a pastor is said to <i>save </i>himself, when, by faithfully
discharging the office committed to him, he serves his calling; not only because
he avoids that terrible vengeance which the Lord threatens by Ezekiel, &#8212;
&#8220;His blood will I require at thy hand,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;263308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
33:8,) but because it is customary to speak of believers as performing their
salvation when they walk and persevere<b>

the course of their salvation. Of this mode of expression we have spoken in our

gentleness. Hence pastors are taught, that they must not only take into account
their office, but must also see particularly what is due to the age of
individuals; for the same things are not applicable to all. Let it therefore be

wicked men any handle for laughter. For this purpose, he demands a chaste
gravity, which shall shine throughout all their intercourse and conversation; so

from all the private concerns of a family, and might lay aside every hindrance.
Justly, therefore, does Paul forbid to receive the mothers of families, who are
already bound by a charge of a different kind. When he calls them &#8220;really
widows&#8221;, he alludes to the Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ch&gt;ra</font><font face="Palatino">,
which is derived </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpo&lt; tou~
chrou~sqai</font><font face="Palatino">, from a verb which signifies to be
&#8220;deprived&#8221; or &#8220;destitute.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any
widow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There are various ways of
explaining this passage; and the ambiguity arises from this circumstance, that
the latter clause may refer either to widows or to their children. Nor is this
consistent with the verb (</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let
them learn</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>)</i> being plural, while Paul
spoke of a </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>widow
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in the singular number; for a change of number
is very customary in a general discourse, that is, when the writer speaks of a
whole class, and not of an individual. They who think that it relates to widows,
are of the opinion that the meaning is, let them learn, by the pious government
of their family, to repay to their successors the education that they received
from their ancestors.&#8221; This is the explanation given by Chrysostom and
some others. But others think that it is more natural to interpret it as
relating to children and grandchildren. Accordingly, in their opinion, the
Apostle teaches that the mother or grandmother is the person towards whom they
should exercise their piety; for nothing is more natural than
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajntipelargi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
the return of filial for parental affection; and it is very unreasonable that it
should be excluded from the Church. Before the Church is burdened with them, let
them do their duty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hereto I have related the opinion of others. But I
wish my readers to consider if it would not agree better with the context in
this manner: &#8220;Let them learn to conduct themselves in a godly manner at
home.&#8221; As if he had said, that it would be valuable as a preparatory
instruction, that they should train themselves to the worship of God, by
performing godly offices at home towards their relatives; For nature commands us
to love our parents next to God; that this secondary piety leads to the highest
piety. And as Paul saw that the very rights of nature were violated under the
pretense of religion,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa85</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in
order to correct this fault, he commanded that widows should be trained by
domestic apprenticeship to the worship of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To shew piety towards their own
house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Almost all the commentators take
the verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eujsebei~n</font><font face="Palatino">
in an active sense, because it is followed by an accusative; but that is not a
conclusive argument, for it is customary with the Greek authors to have a
preposition understood. And this exposition agrees well with the context, that,
by cultivating human piety, they should train themselves in the worship of God;
lest a foolish and silly devotion should divest them of human feelings. Again,
let widows learn to repay what they owe to their ancestors by educating their
own offspring.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this is good and acceptable
before God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Not to shew gratitude to our
ancestors is universally acknowledged to be monstrous; for that is a lesson
taught us by natural reason. And not only is this conviction natural to all,
that affection towards our parents is the second degree of piety; but the very
storks teach us gratitude by their example; and that is the etymology of the
word

origin in the opinion of men; but God hath so ordained.&#8221;</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>She who is really a
widow</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He expresses his meaning more
clearly than before; for he shews that they are really widows who are solitary
and have no children. He says that such persons <i>hope in God. </i>Not that
this is done by all, or by them alone; for we may see many widows that are
childless, and that have no relatives whatever, who nevertheless are haughty and
insolent, and altogether ungodly both in heart and in life. On the other hand,
then, are those who have many children, and who are not prevented from having
their hope placed in God; such as Job and Jacob and David. But for this,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">polutekni&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)
a multitude of children would be a curse, whereas Scripture always reckons it
among the remarkable blessings of God. But Paul says here that widows
&#8220;hope in God,&#8221; in the same manner as he elsewhere writes, that the
unmarried study only to please God, because their affections are not divided
like those of married persons.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460732&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 7:32.) The meaning therefore is, that they have nothing to disturb
their thoughts, from looking to God alone; because they find nothing in the
world on which they can rely. By this argument he commends them; for, when human
aid and every refuge fails them, it is the duty of the Church to stretch forth
her hand to render assistance; and thus the condition of the widow, who is
childless and desolate, implores the aid of the pastor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Continueth in
prayers</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is the second ground of
commendation, that they continually devote themselves to prayer. Hence it
follows, that they ought to be relieved and supported at the expense of the
Church. At the same time, by these two marks he distinguishes between the worthy
and the unworthy; for these words are of the same import as if he enjoined that
they only shall be received who look for no aid from men, but rely on God alone,
and, laying aside other cares and employments, are earnestly devoted to prayer;
and that others are ill qualified and of no advantage to the Church. Again, this
constancy in prayer demands freedom from other cares; for they who are occupied
with the government of a family have less freedom and leisure. We are all,
indeed, commanded to pray continually; but it ought to be considered what is
demanded by every person&#8217;s condition, when, in order to prayer, retirement
and exemption from all other cares are demanded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What Paul praises in widows, Luke
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420236&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
2:36) asserts as to Anna, the daughter of Phanuel; but the same thing would not
apply to all, on account of the diversity in their manner of life. There will be
foolish women &#8212; apes, and not imitators, of Anna &#8212; who will run from
altar to altar, and will do nothing but sigh and mutter till noon. On this
presence, they will rid themselves of all domestic affairs; and, having returned
home, if they do not find everything arranged to their wish, they will disturb
the whole family by outrageous cries, and will sometimes proceed to blows. Let
us therefore remember that there are good reasons why it is the peculiar
privilege of those who are widows and childless, to have leisure for praying by
night and by day; because they are free from lawful hindrances, which would not
permit those who govern a family to do the same.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And yet this passage lends no countenance to monks or
nuns, who sell their mutterings or their loud noises for the sake of leading an
easy and idle life. Such were anciently the Euchites or Psallians; for monks and
Popish priests differ in no respect, except that the former, by continually
praying, thought that none but themselves were pious and holy, while the latter,
with inferior industry, imagined that they sanctify both themselves and others.
Paul had no thought of anything of this sort, but only intended to shew how much
more freely they may have leisure for prayer who have nothing else to disturb
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.
She who is in luxury</i></font><font face="Palatino">. After having described
the marks by which real widows may be known, he now contrasts them with others
that ought not to be received. The Greek participle which he employs,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">spatalw~sa</font><font face="Palatino">,
means one who allows herself every indulgence, and leads an easy and luxurious
life. Accordingly, Paul (in my opinion) censures those who abuse their widowhood
for this purpose, that, being loosed from the marriage yoke, and freed from
every annoyance, they may lead a life of pleasant idleness; for we see many who
seek their own freedom and convenience, and give themselves up to excessive
mirth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is dead while she
liveth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> When Paul says that such persons
&#8220;are dead while they live,&#8221; this is supposed by some to mean that
they are unbelievers; an opinion with which I do not at all agree. I think it
more natural to say that a woman &#8220;is dead,&#8221; when she is useless, and
does no good; for to what purpose do we live, if it be not that our actions may
yield some advantage? And what if we should say that the emphasis lies in the
word liveth? For they who covet an indolent life, that they may live more at
their ease, have constantly in their mouth the proverbial saying: &#8212;
</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>&#8220;For life is
not to live, but to be well.&#8221;</i></b></font><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa87</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning would therefore be: &#8220;If they reckon
themselves happy, when they have everything to their heart&#8217;s wish, and if
they think that nothing but repose and luxury can be called life, for my part, I
declare that they are dead.&#8221; But as this meaning might seem liable to the
charge of excessive ingenuity, I wished merely to give a passing glimpse of it,
without making any positive assertion. This at least is certain, that Paul here
condemns indolence, when he calls those women dead who are of no
use.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And command these
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He means, that not only does he
prescribe to Timothy the course which he ought to follow, but the women also
must be carefully taught not to be stained with such vices. It is the duty of
the pastor not only to oppose the wicked practices or ambition of those who act
an unreasonable part, but to guard against every danger, as far as lies in his
power, by instruction and constant warnings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may be
blameless.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was the natural result of
prudence and steadfastness not to admit widows, unless they were worthy; but yet
it was proper to assign a reason why they were not admitted; and it was even
necessary to forewarn the Church that unworthy persons should not be brought
forward, or should not offer themselves. Again, Paul commends this part of
instruction on the ground of utility; as if he had said, that it must by no
means be despised, because it is common, since it aims at the chief part of a
good and perfect life. Now there is nothing that ought to be more diligently
learned in God&#8217;s school than the study of a holy and upright life. In a
word, moral instruction is compared with ingenious speculations, which are of no
visible advantage, agreeably to that saying,</font><br></div>

&#8220;If any woman do not provide for her own,&#8221; making it apply
exclusively to females. But I prefer to view it as a general statement; for it
is customary with Paul, even when he is treating of some particular subject, to
deduce arguments from general principles, and, on the other hand, to draw from
particular statements a universal doctrine. And certainly it will have greater
weight, if it apply both to men and to women.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath denied the

</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa88</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> He
says that they who do not care about any of their relatives, and especially
about their own house, have &#8220;denied the faith.&#8221; And justly; for
there is no piety towards God, when a person can thus lay aside the feelings of
humanity. Would faith, which makes us the sons of God, render us worse than
brute beasts? Such inhumanity, therefore, is open contempt of God, and denying
of the faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Not content with this, Paul heightens the criminality
of their conduct, by saying, that he who forgets his own
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>is worse than an
infidel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is true for two reasons.
First, the further advanced any one is in the knowledge of God, the less is he
excused; and therefore, they who shut their eyes against the clear light of God
are worse than infidels. Secondly, this is a kind of duty which nature itself
teaches; for they are (</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">storgai&lt;
fusikai&gt;</font><font face="Palatino">)<i> </i>natural affections. And if, by
the mere guidance of nature, infidels are so prone to love their own, what must
we think of those who are not moved by any such feeling? Do they not go even
beyond the ungodly in brutality? If it be objected, that, among unbelievers,
there are also many parents that are cruel and savage; the explanation is easy,
that Paul is not speaking of any parents but those who, by the guidance and
instruction of nature, take care of their own offspring; for, if any one have
degenerated from that which is so perfectly natural, he ought to be regarded as
a monster.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is asked, Why does the Apostle prefer the members
of the household to the children? I answer, when he speaks of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his own and especially those of
his household</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by both expressions he
denotes the children and grandchildren. For, although children may have been
transferred, or may have passed into a different family by marriage, or in any
way may have left the house of the parents; yet the right of nature is not
altogether extinguished, so as to destroy the obligation of the older to govern
the younger as committed to them by God, or at least to take care of them as far
as they can. Towards domestics, the obligation is more strict; for they ought to
take care of them for two reasons, both because they are their own blood, and
because they are a part of the family which they govern.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let a widow be

widows should be taken under the care of the Church;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa89</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and
more clearly than he had formerly done.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not under sixty years of

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sixty
years</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for, being supported at the
public expense, it was proper that they should have already reached old age.
Besides, there was another and stronger reason; for they consecrated themselves
to the ministry of the Church, which would have been altogether intolerable, if
there were still a likelihood of their being married. They were received on the
condition that the Church should relieve their poverty, and that, on their part,
they should be employed in ministering to the poor, as far as the state of their
health allowed. Thus there was a mutual obligation between them and the Church.
It was unreasonable that those who were under that age, and who were still in
the vigor of life, should be a burden to others. Besides, there was reason to
fear that they would change their mind and think of being married again. These
are two reasons why he does not wish any to be admitted &#8220;under sixty years
of age.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath been the wife of one
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. As </i>to the desire of marrying, that
danger had been sufficiently guarded against, when a woman was more than sixty
years old; especially if, during her whole life, she had not been married to
more than one husband. It may be regarded as a sort of pledge of continence and
chastity, when a woman has arrived at that age, satisfied with having had but
one husband. Not that he disapproves of a second marriage, or affixes a mark of
ignominy to those who have been twice married; (for, on the contrary, he advises
younger widows to marry;) but because he wished carefully to guard against
laying any females under a necessity of remaining unmarried, who felt it to be
necessary to have husbands. On this subject we shall afterwards speak more
fully.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For good
works</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Those qualifications which are
next enumerated relate partly to honor, and partly to labor. There can be no
doubt that the assemblies of widows were honorable, and highly respectable; and,
therefore, Paul does not wish that any should be admitted into them, but those
who had excellent attestations of the whole of their past life. Besides, they
were not appointed in order to lazy and indolent inactivity, but to minister to
the poor and the sick, until, being completely worn out, they should be allowed
honorably to retire. Accordingly, that they may be better prepared for the
discharge of their office, he wishes them to have had long practice and
experience in all the duties which belong to it; such as &#8212; labor and
diligence in bringing up children, hospitality, ministering to the poor, and
other charitable works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it be now asked, Shall all that are barren be
rejected, because they have never borne any children? We must reply, that Paul
does not here condemn barrenness, but the daintiness of mothers, who, by
refusing to endure the weariness of bringing up their children, sufficiently
shew that they will be very unkind to strangers. And at the same time he holds
out this as an honorable reward to godly matrons, who have not spared
themselves, that they, in their turn, shall be received into the bosom of the
Church in their old age.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By a figure of speech, in which a part is taken for
the whole, he means by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the

employment of this nature might have the appearance of being mean and almost
servile; and therefore he makes use of this mark for describing females who were

to liberality; and, lastly, he expresses the same thing in general terms, when
he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if she hath been

he only asserts that they must not be rewarded by obtaining that honor which he
has already mentioned. And if the Spirit of God, by the mouth of Paul, declares
that no woman under sixty years of age deserves to be admitted into that order,
because at that age the unmarried state was dangerous; what effrontery was it,
afterwards, to lay down a law of celibacy for young women in all the warmth of
youthful years? Paul, I say, does not allow of abstaining from marriage till
they are in extreme old age, and altogether beyond the danger of incontinence.
They afterwards came to forty years as the age for putting the veil on virgins,
and next to thirty; and at length they began to put the veil &#8212;
indiscriminately, and without exception &#8212; on females of any age. They
allege, that continence is much easier for virgins, who have never had a
husband, than it is for widows. But they will never succeed in proving, that
there is no reason to dread that danger against which Paul guards and commands
others to guard. Accordingly, it is rash, and even cruel, to lay a snare for
those who still are young girls, and who would have been fitter for the married
state.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For when they have begun to be
wanton against Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He says that they
are &#8220;wanton against Christ,&#8221; who, forgetting the condition to which
they were called, indulge in unbecoming mirth; for they ought to have kept
themselves under the yoke of modesty, as becomes grave and respectable females.
Accordingly, a more luxurious and abandoned course of life is a sort of
wantonness against Christ, to whom they had pledged their fidelity. As Paul had
seen many instances of this kind, he meets it by a general remedy, that none
should be admitted who were of an age that could ever induce them to desire to
be married.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How many monsters of crimes are produced every day in
Popery by that compulsory celibacy of nuns! What barriers does it not
deliberately break through! And therefore, although this course had at first
appeared to be commendable, yet, taught by experiments so many and so terrible,
they ought to have somewhat complied with in the counsel of Paul. But they are
so far from doing this, that they provoke the wrath of God more and more, from
day to day, by their obstinacy. Nor do I speak of nuns only, but priests and
monks are also compelled by them to observe perpetual celibacy. Yet disgraceful
lusts rage amongst them, so that hardly one in ten lives chastely; and in
monasteries, the least of the evils is ordinary fornication. If they would
incline their heart to hear God speaking by the mouth of Paul, they would
instantly have recourse to this remedy which he prescribes; but so great is
their pride, that they furiously persecute all who remind them of
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some read the words thus: &#8212; &#8220;When they
become wanton, they will marry in opposition to Christ.&#8221; Although this
makes little difference as to Paul&#8217;s meaning, the former view is
preferable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Having condemnation, because they have renounced their first
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. &#8220;</i>To have
condemnation,&#8221; is interpreted by some as signifying &#8220;to deserve
reproof.&#8221; But I take it to be a statement of greater severity, that Paul
terrifies them by the damnation of eternal death; as if he reproved them by
saying that that excellent order, which ought rather to have united them to
Christ, was the very ground of their condemnation. And the reason is added, that
they entirely &#8220;revolt from the faith &#8220;of baptism and from
Christianity. I am aware that there are some who interpret it differently; that
is, that they break the pledge which they gave to the Church by marrying, having
formerly promised that they would live unmarried till death. This is exceedingly
absurd. Besides, why should he call it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>their first
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, Paul rises to greater vehemence against
them, and magnifies the enormity of the offense, by saying that not only would
they bring disgrace on Christ and his Church by departing from the condition to
which they had agreed, but they likewise broke their &#8220;first faith
&#8220;by wicked revolt. Thus it usually happens, that he who has once
transgressed the bounds of modesty gives himself up to all impudence. It grieved
him that the levity of those women was a reproach to the godly, and that their
lustfulness was reproved, or, at least, was liable to reproof. This led them to
proceed to greater and greater degrees of licentiousness, till they renounced
Christianity. That amplification is exceedingly appropriate; for is there
anything more absurd than that they should, through a wish to promote the
advantage of persons, open the door to the denial of Christ?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The attempt of the Papists to support, by means of
this passage, a vow of perpetual celibacy, is absurd. Granting that it was
customary to exact from the widows an engagement in express terms, still they
would gain nothing by this admission. First, we must consider the end. The
reason why widows formerly promised to remain unmarried, was not that they might
lead a holier life than in a state of marriage, but because they could not, at
the same time, be devoted to husbands and to the Church; but in Popery, they
make a vow of continence, as if it were a virtue acceptable to God on its own
account. Secondly, in that age they renounced the liberty of marrying at the
time when they ceased to be marriageable; for they must have been, at least,
sixty years old, and, by being satisfied with being once married, must have
already given a proof of their chastity. But now, vows are made among the
Papists to renounce marriage, either before the time, or in the midst of time
ardor of youthful years.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now we disapprove of the tyrannical law about
celibacy, chiefly for two reasons. First, they pretend that it is meritorious
worship before God; and secondly, by rashness in vowing, they plunge souls into
destruction. Neither of these was to be found in the ancient institution. They
did not make a direct vow of continence, as if the married life were less
acceptable to God, but only, so far as it was rendered necessary by the office
to which they were elected, they promised to keep from the tie of marriage for
their whole life; nor did they deprive themselves of the liberty of marrying,
till the time when, though they had been ever so free, it was foolish and
unreasonable for them to marry. In short, those widows differed as much from the
nuns, as Anna the prophetess from Claude the Vestal.<b>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tattlers and
busybodies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Besides, those widows, under
the pretense of the respect due to the public character which they sustained,
had more easy access to many persons. This opportunity, obtained through the
kindness of the Church, they abused for purposes of &#8220;idleness;&#8221; and
next, as usually happens, from slothfulness sprung curiosity, which is also the
mother of talkativeness. Most true is the saying of Horace: &#8220;Shun an
inquisitive person, for he is always a tattler.&#8221;<b>

they have blabbed it out.&#8221; This is especially the case with women, who, by
nature, are prone to talkativeness, and cannot keep a secret. With good reason,
therefore, has Paul joined together these three things, sloth, inquisitiveness,
and tattling.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino">(widows)
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
marry</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Censorious men laugh at this injunction
of the Apostle. &#8220;As if,&#8221; say they, &#8220;it had been necessary to
stimulate their excessively strong desire; for who does not know that almost all
widows have naturally a wish to be married?&#8221; Superstitious men, on time
other hand, would reckon that this doctrine concerning marriage is highly
unsuitable to an Apostle of Christ. But, after a careful examination of the
whole matter, men of sound judgment will acknowledge that Paul teaches nothing
here but what is necessary and highly useful. For, on the one hand, there are
many to whom widowhood gives the opportunity of greater licentiousness; and, on
the other hand, there are always arising spirits speaking lies in hypocrisy, who
make holiness to consist in celibacy, as if it were angelical perfection, and
either totally condemn marriage, or despise it as if it savored of the pollution
of the flesh. There are few either of men or women that consider their calling.
How rarely do you find a man who willingly bears the burden of governing a wife!
The reason is, that it is attended by innumerable vexations. How reluctantly
does a woman submit to the yoke!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Consequently, when Paul bids the younger widows
marry, he does not invite them to nuptial delights; and, when he bids them bear
children, he does not exhort them to indulge lust; but, taking into account the
weakness of the sex, and the slipperiness of the age, he exhorts them to chaste
marriage, and, at the same time, to the endurance of those burdens which belong
to holy marriage. And he does this, especially, in order that he may not be
thought to heave acted contemptuously in excluding them from the rank of widows;
for he means, that their life will be not less acceptable to God than if they
remained in widowhood. And, indeed, God pays no regard to the superstitious
opinions of men, but values this obedience more highly than all things else,
when we comply with our calling, instead of permitting ourselves to be carried
along by the wish of our own heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Having heard that consolation, they have no reason to
complain that injury is done to them, or to take it in that they are excluded
from one kind of honor; for they learn that, in the married state, they are not
less acceptable to God, because they obey his calling. When he speaks of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bearing
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he includes, under a single
word, all the annoyances that must be endured in bringing up children; in the
same manner as, under </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
government of the house</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he includes all
that belongs to household management.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To give no occasion to the
adversary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For, as the husband may be
said to be the covering of the wife, so widowhood is liable to many unfavorable
suspicions. And what purpose does it serve, to arm the enemies of time gospel
with calumnies, without any necessity? But it is very difficult for a widow, in
the flower of her age, to act with such caution that wicked men shall not find
some pretext for slandering her; and, therefore, if they sincerely desire
edification, let them, in order to shut the mouth of evil speakers, choose a way
of life that is less liable to suspicion. Here, I suppose, the common
<i>adversaries </i>of the gospel to be meant, rather than the private
adversaries of any woman; for Paul speaks indefinitely.<b>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For some have already turned
aside</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is certain, that there is no
ordinance so holy that some evil may not arise out of it through the wickedness
of men. Yet those things which are necessary ought to remain unmoved, whatever
may happen to them, although the sky should fall. But when we are at liberty to
choose either way, and when this or that has been found by experience to be
advantageous, it is a matter of prudence to lay aside what was formerly
approved, as in the present case. It was not at all necessary that women, who
were still young, should be admitted into the rank of widows; experience shewed
that it was dangerous and hurtful; and, therefore, Paul justly advises to take
care for the future that nothing of this kind may happen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If the revolt of some women was regarded by him as a
sufficiently strong argument for seeking a universal remedy, how many arguments
would the Papists have for abolishing their filthy celibacy, if they had any
regard to edification! But they choose rather to strangle millions of souls by
the cruel cords of a wicked and diabolical law than to loose a single knot; and
this makes it evident how widely their cruelty differs from the holy zeal of
Paul.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After
Satan</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The expression is worthy of
notice; be. cause no one can turn aside from Christ, in the smallest degree,
without following Satan; for he has dominion over all who do not belong to
Christ. We learn from this how destructive is turning aside from the right
course, since, from being children of God, it makes us slaves of Satan, and, by
withdrawing us from the government of Christ, places Satan over us as our
guide.<b>  </b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa95</font></sup><br></div>

to support their widows; for, as to those widows who renounced a wicked
relationship, it was proper that they should be received by the Church. And if
they act a sinful part, who, by sparing themselves, allow the Church to be
burdened with expense, let us learn from this in what aggravated sacrilege they
are involved, who, by fraud or robbery, profane what was once dedicated to the

people men of worth and of good character, who, united with the pastors in a
common council and authority administered the discipline of the Church, and were

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;401816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
18:16.) Why then does the Apostle protect elders alone by this privilege, as if
it were peculiar to them, that their innocence shall be defended against false
accusations?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I reply, this is a necessary remedy against the
malice of men; for none are more liable to slanders and calumnies than godly
teachers.<b>

Not only does it arise from the difficulty of their office, that sometimes they
either sink under it, or stagger, or halt, or blunder, in consequence of which
wicked men seize many occasions for finding fault with them; but there is this
additional vexation, that, although they perform their duty correctly, so as not
to commit any error whatever, they never escape a thousand censures. And this is
the craftiness of Satan, to draw away the hearts of men from ministers, that
instruction may gradually fall into contempt. Thus not only is wrong. done to
innocent persons, in having their reputation unjustly wounded, (which is
exceedingly base in regard to those who hold so honorable a rank,) but the
authority of the sacred doctrine of God is diminished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is what Satan, as I have said, chiefly
labors to accomplish; for not only is the saying of Plato true in this instance,
that &#8220;the multitude are malicious, and envy those who are above
them,&#8221; but the more earnestly any pastor strives to advance the kingdom of
Christ, so much the more is he loaded with envy, and so much the fiercer are the
assaults made on him. Not only so, but as soon as any charge against the
ministers of the word has gone abroad, it is believed as fully as if they were
already convicted. This is not merely owing to the higher degree of moral
excellence which is demanded from them, but because almost all are tempted by
Satan to excessive credulity, so that, without making any inquiry, they eagerly
condemn their pastors, whose good name they ought rather to have
defended.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On good grounds, therefore, Paul opposes so heinous
iniquity, and forbids that elders shall be subjected to the slanders of wicked
men till they have been convicted by sufficient proof. We need not wonder,
therefore, if they whose duty it is to reprove the faults of all, to oppose the
wicked desires of all, and to restrain by their severity every person whom they
see going astray, have many enemies. What, then, will be the consequence; if we
shall listen indiscriminately to all the slanders that are spread abroad
concerning them?</font><br></div>

</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa101</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Whenever any measure is taken for the protection of good men, it is immediately
seized by bad men to prevent them from being condemned. Accordingly, what Paul
had said about repelling unjust accusations he modifies by this statement, so
that none may, on this presence, escape the punishment due to sin. And, indeed,
we see how great and diversified are the privileges by which Popery surrounds
its clergy; so that, although their life be ever so wicked,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa102</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
still they are exempted from all reproof. Certainly, if regard be had to the
cautions which are collected by Gratian,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa103</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(Caus. 2:Quest. 4 and Quest. 7,) there will be no danger of their being ever
compelled to give an account of their life. Where will they find the seventy
&#8212; two witnesses for condemning a bishop, which are demanded by the
disgusting bull issued by Pope Sylvester? Moreover, seeing that the whole order
of laymen is debarred from accusing, and as the inferior orders, even of the
clergy, are forbidden to give any annoyance to the higher classes of them, what
shall hinder them from fearlessly mocking at all decisions?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is therefore proper carefully to observe this
moderation, that insolent tongues shall be restrained from defaming elders by
false accusations, and yet that every one of them who conducts himself badly
shall be severely corrected; for I understand this injunction to relate to
elders, that they who live a dissolute life shall be openly
reproved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That others also may
fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Wherefore? That others, warned by
such an example, may fear the more, when they perceive that not even those who
are placed above them in rank and honor are spared; for as elders ought to lead
the way to others by the example of a holy life, so, if they commit crime, it is
proper to exercise severity of discipline toward them, that it may serve as an
example to others. And why should greater forbearance be used toward those whose
offenses are much more hurtful than those of others? Let it be understood that
Paul speaks of crimes or glaring transgressions, which are attended by public
scandal; for, if any of the elders shall have committed a fault, not of a public
nature, it is certain that he ought to be privately admonished and not openly
reproved.</font><br></div>

I adjure thee before God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Paul
introduced this solemn appeal, not only on account of the very great importance
of the subject, but likewise on account of its extreme difficulty. Nothing is
more difficult than to discharge the office of a public judge with so great
impartiality as never to be moved by favor for any one, or to give rise to
suspicions, or to be influenced by unfavorable reports, or to use excessive
severity, and in every cause to look at nothing but the cause itself; for only

pastors are admonished, and that Timothy is armed, as with a shield, against
wicked desires, which not infrequently occasion much trouble even to some
excellent persons. He therefore places God before the eyes of Timothy, that he
may know that he ought to execute his office not less conscientiously than if he
were in the presence of God and of his angels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord Jesus

&#8220;angels,&#8221; not as judges, but as the future witnesses of our
carelessness, or rashness, or ambition, or unfaithfulness. They are present as
spectators, because they have been commanded to take care of the Church. And,
indeed, he must be worse than stupid, and must have a heart of stone, whose
indolence and carelessness are not shaken off by this single consideration, that
the government of the Church is under the eye of God and the angels; and when
that solemn appeal is added, our fear and anxiety must be redoubled. He calls
them

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lay not hands suddenly on any
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There can be no doubt that he
intended to guard Timothy against ill &#8212; will, and to obviate many
complaints, which are continually arising against the godly servants of Christ,
who refuse to comply with the ambitious requests of any. For some accuse them of
sternness; others of envy; and some exclaim that they are cruel, because they do
not at once receive those who boast of having some recommendatory qualities.
This is what we abundantly experience in the present day. Paul therefore exhorts
Timothy not to lay aside judicious caution, and not to suffer himself to be
overpowered by improper feelings; not that Timothy needed such an admonition,
but to restrain, by his authority, those who otherwise might have given
annoyance to Timothy,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, the
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>laying on of

</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa109</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
that is, the sign is put for the thing signified; for he forbids him to receive
too easily any one that has not been fully tried. There are some who, through a
desire of novelty, would wish to receive into the ministerial office, some
person hardly at all known, as soon as he has given one or two exhibitions that
are reckoned good. It is the duty of a wise and thoughtful bishop, to resist
this troublesome feeling, in the same manner as Paul here bids Timothy
do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither partake of other
men&#8217;s sins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He means that he who
consents to an unlawful act of ordination is involved in the same guilt as the
chief actors in it. Yet some explain it thus: &#8220;If he admit unworthy
persons, whatever faults they may afterwards commit, to him will be imputed the
blame or a part of the blame.&#8221; But I think that this is a more simple view
of it: &#8220;Though others rush forth to such rashness, do not make thyself a
partaker with them, lest thou share in their guilt.&#8221; Even where our
judgment is otherwise sound, it often happens that we are carried away by the
folly and levity of others.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa110</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep thyself
pure</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> I consider this also to have the
same reference as the preceding clause. As if he had said, &#8220;If others do
anything that is wrong, beware lest any contagion reach you, either by consent
or by approbation. If you cannot hinder them from polluting themselves, it is at
least your duty to have your counsels at all times separated from theirs, so
that you may keep yourself pure.&#8221; If any prefer to view it as a general
statement, let him enjoy his opinion; but, for my own part, I reckon it to be
more suitable to limit it to the present context.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No longer drink
water</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There are some who conjecture
that this sentence, which breaks off the train of thought, was not written by
Paul. But we see that Paul was not so anxious about keeping up the close
connection of a discourse, and that it was very customary with him to
intermingle a variety of statements without any arrangement. Besides, it is
possible that what had been formerly written in the margin of the Epistle
afterwards found its way into this passage through the mistake of the
transcribers. Yet there is no necessity for giving ourselves much trouble on
that point, if we consider Paul&#8217;s custom, which I have mentioned, of
sometimes mingling various subjects.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What is said amounts to this, that Timothy should
accustom himself to drink a little wine, for the sake of preserving his health;
for he does not absolutely forbid him to &#8220;drink water,&#8221; but to use
it as his ordinary beverage; and that; is the meaning of the Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJdropotei~n</font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why does he not simply advise him to <i>drink
wine? </i>For when he adds, a <i>little, </i>he appears to guard against
intemperance, which there was no reason to dread in Timothy. I reply, this was
rather expressed, in order to meet the slanders of wicked men, who would
otherwise have been ready to mock at his advice, on this or some such pretext:
&#8220;What sort of philosophy is this, which encourages to drink wine? Is that
the road by which we rise to heaven?&#8221; In order to meet jeers of this kind,
he declares that he provides only for a case of necessity; and at the same time
he recommends moderation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now it is evident that Timothy was not only frugal,
but even austere, in his mode of living; so much so as even not to take care of
his health; and it is certain that this was done, neither through ambition nor
through superstition. Hence we infer, that not only was he very far from
indulging in luxury and superfluities, but that, in order that he might be
better prepared for doing the work of the Lord, he retrenched a portion even of
his ordinary food; for it was not by natural disposition, but through a desire
of temperance, that he was abstemious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How few are there at the present day, who need to be
forbidden the use of water; or rather how many are there that need to be limited
to drink wine soberly! It is also evident how necessary it is for us, even when
we are desirous to act right, to ask from the Lord the spirit of prudence, that
he may teach us moderation. Timothy was, indeed, upright in his aims; but,
because he is reproved by the Spirit of God, we learn that excess of severity of
living was faulty in him. At the same time a general rule is laid down, that,
while we ought to be temperate in eating and drinking, every person should
attend to his own health, not for the sake of prolonging life, but that, as long
as he lives, he may serve God, and be of use to his neighbors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And if excessive abstinence is blamed, when it brings
on or promotes diseases, how much more should superstition be avoided? What
judgment shall we form as to time obstinacy of the Carthusians,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa111</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
who would sooner have died than taste the smallest morsel of flesh in extreme
necessity? And if those who live sparingly and soberly are commanded not to
injure their health by excessive parsimony, no slight punishment awaits the
intemperate, who, by cramming their belly, waste their strength. Such persons
need not only to be advised, but to be kept back from their fodder like brute
beasts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
The sins of some men are visible
beforehand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> As there is nothing that
distresses more the faithful ministers of the Church, than to see no way of
correcting evils, and to be compelled to endure hypocrites, of whose wickedness
they are aware and to be unable to banish from the Church many who are
destructive plagues, or even to hinder them from spreading their venom by secret
arts;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa112</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Paul supports Timothy by this consolation, that, when it shall please God,
they,&#8217; will one day be brought to public view. Thus he strengthens him for
the exercise of patience; because he ought calmly to await the fit time which
God in his wisdom has appointed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is another kind of base conduct that sorely
distresses good and holy pastors. When they have most conscientiously discharged
their duty, they are provoked by many unfair statements, are loaded with much
ill &#8212; will, and perceive that those actions which deserved praise are
turned into blame. Paul meets this case also, by informing Timothy, that there
are some good works which are reserved for being brought to light at a future
period; and consequently that, if their praise is, as it were, buried under
ground by the ingratitude of men, that also ought to be patiently endured, till
the time of revelation have arrived.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet not only does he provide a remedy for these
evils, but, because it often happens that we are mistaken in choosing ministers,
unworthy persons insinuating themselves cunningly, and the good being unknown to
us; and even though we do not go wrong in judging, but still cannot bring others
to approve of our judgment, the most excellent being rejected, notwithstanding
all our efforts to the contrary, while bad men either insinuate or force
themselves forward; it is impossible that our condition and that of the Church
should not occasion great anguish. Accordingly, Paul strenuously endeavors to
remove, or at least to alleviate, this cause of uneasiness. The meaning may be
thus summed up. &#8220;We must bear what cannot be immediately corrected; we
must sigh and groan, while the time for the remedy is not fully come; and we
must not apply force to diseases, till they are either ripened or laid open. On
the other hand, when virtue does not receive the honor which it deserves, we
must wait for the full time of revelation, and endure the stupidity of the
world, and wait quietly in darkness till the day dawn.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hastening to
judgment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I now come to the words, after
having given a brief illustration of the subject. When he says that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the sins of some men are visible
beforehand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he means that they are
discovered early, and come to the knowledge of men, as it were, before the time.
He expresses the same thing by another comparison, that they run, as it were,
and &#8220;hasten to their judgment;&#8221; for we see that many run headlong,
and, of their own accord, bring damnation on themselves, though the whole world
is desirous to save them. Whenever this happens, let us remember that the
reprobate are prompted by an unseen movement of Providence, to throw out their
foam.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In some they follow
after</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The rendering given by Erasmus,
&#8220;Some they follow after,&#8221; I do not approve. Although it seems to be
more in accordance with the Greek construction, yet the sense requires that the
preposition
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn</font><font face="Palatino">
be understood; for the change of case does not destroy the contrast. As he had
said that the Sins of some men hasten rapidly to their judgment; so now, on the
other hand, he adds, that the sins of some men (or, of others) come slowly to be
known. But instead of the genitive &#8220;of some,&#8221; he uses the dative
&#8220;in some&#8217;&#8221; (or &#8220;in others.&#8221;) He means that,
although the sins of some men may be concealed longer than we would wish, and
are slowly brought to light, yet they shall not always be concealed; for they
too shall have their own time. And if the version of Erasmus be preferred, still
the meaning must be the same, that, although the vengeance of God does not
hasten, yet it follows slowly behind them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
In like manner also the good works</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He
means, that sometimes piety and other virtues obtain early and speedily their
applause among men; so that great men are held in estimation; and that, if it
happen otherwise, the Lord will not suffer innocence and uprightness to be
always oppressed; for it is often obscured by calumnies, or by clouds, but at
length shall be fulfilled the prediction,

to assume to ourselves the prerogative of God.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">It appears that, at the beginning of the gospel,
slaves cheered their hearts, as if the signal had been given for their
emancipation; for Paul labors hard, in all his writings, to repress that desire;
and indeed the condition of slavery was so hard that we need not wonder that it
was exceedingly hateful. Now, it is customary to seize, for the advantage of the
flesh, everything that has the slightest appearance of being in our favor. Thus
when they were told that we are all brethren, they instantly concluded that it
was unreasonable that they should be the slaves of brethren. But although
nothing of all this had come into their mind, still wretched men are always in
need of consolation, that may allay the bitterness of their afflictions.
Besides, they could not without difficulty be persuaded to bend their necks,
willingly and cheerfully, to so harsh a yoke. Such, then, is the object of the
present doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They who are slaves under the
yoke</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Owing to the false opinion of his
own excellence which every person entertains, there is no one who patiently
endures that others should rule over him. They who cannot avoid the necessity
do, indeed, reluctantly obey those who are above them; but inwardly they fret
and rage, because they think that they suffer wrong. The Apostle cuts off, by a
single word, all disputes of this kind, by demanding that all who live
&#8220;under the yoke&#8221; shall submit to it willingly. He means that they
must not inquire whether they deserve that lot or a better one; for it is enough
that they are bound to this condition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he enjoins them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to esteem worthy of all honor the
masters </i></font><font face="Palatino">whom they serve, he requires them not
only to be faithful and diligent in performing their duties, but to regard and
sincerely respect them as persons placed in a higher rank than themselves. No
man renders either to a prince or to a master what he owes to them, unless,
looking at the eminence to which God has raised them, he honor them, because he
is subject to them; for, however unworthy of it they may often be, still that
very authority which God bestows on them always entitles them to honor. Besides,
no one willingly renders service or obedience to his master, unless he is
convinced that he is bound to do so. Hence it follows, that subjection begins
with that honor of which Paul wishes that they who rule should be accounted
worthy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the name and doctrine of God
may not be blasphemed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We are always too
ingenious in our behalf. Thus shaves, who have unbelieving masters, are ready
enough with the objection, that it is unreasonable that they who serve the devil
should have dominion over the children of God. But Paul throws back the argument
to the opposite side, that they ought to obey unbelieving masters, in order that
the name of God and the gospel may not be evil spoken of; as if God, whom we
worship, incited us to rebellion, and as if the gospel rendered obstinate and
disobedient those who ought to be subject to others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who have believing
masters</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The name of <i>brother </i>may
be thought to constitute equality, and consequently to take away dominion. Paul
argues, on the contrary, that shaves ought the more willingly to subject
themselves to believing masters, because they acknowledge them to be children of
God, and are bound to them by brotherly love, and are partakers of the same
grace.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa113</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> It
is no small honor, that God has made them equal to earthly lords, in that which
is of the highest importance; for they have the same adoption in common with
them; and therefore this ought to be no slight inducement to bear slavery with
patience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are believers and
beloved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is an additional argument,
that slavery is much more easily endured under mild lords, who love us, and whom
we love in return. There is also the bond of faith which binds very closely
together those who are of different conditions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These things teach and
exhort.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He means that these are matters
on the teaching of which he ought to dwell largely, and wishes that doctrine
should be accompanied by exhortations. It is as if he had said, that this kind
of instruction ought to be daily repeated, and that men need not only to be
taught, but likewise to be roused and urged by frequent
exhortations.</font><br></div>

possible that he who does not profess any wicked or open error may yet, by
endeavoring to insinuate himself by means of silly babbling, corrupt the
doctrine of godliness; for, when there is no progress, and no edification in the
doctrine itself, there is already a departure from the ordinance of Christ. Now
although Paul does not speak of the avowed supporters of wicked doctrines, but
of vain and irreligious teachers, who, by their ambition or covetousness,
disfigure the plain and simple doctrine of godliness, yet we see with what
sharpness and severity he attacks them. Nor need we wonder at this; for it is
almost impossible to tell how much injury is done by preaching that is
hypocritical and altogether framed for the purposes of ostentation and of idle
display. But who they are that are blamed by him, appears more clearly from what
immediately follows &#8212; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And consenteth not to sound

explain the former. It frequently happens that such men as are here described,

and thus indulge in wanton freaks, like unruly horses. And what is this but to
reject </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the sound words Of

consistent with &#8220;godliness,&#8221; if it do not instruct us in the fear
and worship of God, if it do not edify our faith, if it do not train us to
patience, humility, and all the duties of that love which we owe to our
fellowmen. Whoever, therefore, does not strive to teach usefully, does not teach
as he ought to do; and not only so, but that doctrine is neither godly nor
sound, whatever may be the brilliancy of its display, that does not tend to the
profit of the hearers.</font><br></div>

persons Paul first charges with pride, foolish and empty pride. Next, because no
punishment can be imagined that is better adapted to chastise ambitious persons
than to declare that all that they delight in proves their ignorance, Paul
pronounces that they </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know
nothing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>though they are swelled with
many subtleties; for they have nothing that is solid, but mere wind. At the same
time, he instructs all believers not to be carried away by that windy
ostentation, but to remain steadfast in the simplicity of the
gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But languishing after questions and

contrast between &#8220;the soundness of the doctrine of Christ,&#8221; and that
&#8220;languishing;&#8221; for, when they have wearied themselves much and long
with ingenious questions, what advantage do they reap from their labor, but that
the disease continually grows? Thus not only do they consume their strength to
no purpose, but their foolish curiosity begets this languishing; and hence it
follows, that they are very far from profiting aright, as the disciples of
Christ ought to do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Not without reason does the Apostle connect
&#8220;questions and disputes of words;&#8221; for by the former term he does
not mean every kind of questions, which either arise from a sober and moderate
desire to learn, or contribute to clear explanation of useful things, but to
such questions as are agitated, in the present day, in the schools of the
Sorbonne, for displaying acuteness of intellect. There one question gives rise
to another; for there is no limit to them, when every person, desiring to know
more than is proper, indulges his vanity; and hence, there afterwards arise
innumerable quarrels. As the thick clouds, during hot weather, are not dispelled
without thunder, so those thorny questions must burst into
disputes.</font><br></div>

foundation; for if any person carefully inquire what sort of contentions are
burning among the sophists, he will perceive that they do not arise from
realities, but are framed out of nothing. In a word, Paul intended to condemn
all questions which sharpen us for disputes that are of no
value.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From which arises
envy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He demonstrates from the effects
how much an ambitious desire of knowledge ought to be avoided; for ambition is
the mother of envy. Where envy reigns, there also rage brawlings, contentions,
and other evils, which are here enumerated by Paul.</font><br></div>

understanding, and that are destitute of the
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is certain that here he
censures the sophists, who, neglecting edification, turn the word of God into
trivial distinctions, and an art of ingenious discussion. If the Apostle only
shewed that the doctrine of salvation is thus rendered useless, even that would
be an intolerable profanation; but far heavier and fiercer is that reproof, when
he says that evils so pernicious, and plagues so hurtful, spring from it. From
this passage, therefore, let us learn to detest
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sofistikh&lt;n</font><font face="Palatino">)

believed.</font><br></div>

a gainful art; that is, because they measure the whole of Christianity by gain.

merchandise exposed to sale.</font><br></div>

openly resist the gospel, but, on the contrary, make a false profession of
adhering to it, yet their society is infectious. Besides, if the multitude see

reason why we transgress the bounds, is, that our anxiety extends to a thousand
lives which we falsely imagine. Nothing is more common, and indeed nothing is
more generally acknowledged, than this statement of Paul; but as soon as all
have acknowledged it, (as we see every day with our eyes,) every man swallows up
with his wishes his vast possessions, in the same manner as if he had a belly

exhorted him to be content, and to despise riches, he now explains how dangerous
is the desire of having them, and especially in the ministers of the Church, of
whom he expressly speaks in this passage. Now the cause of the evils, which the
Apostle here enumerates, is not riches, but an eager desire of them, even though
the person should be poor. And here Paul shews not only what generally happens,
but what must always happen; for every man that has resolved to become rich
gives himself up as a captive to the devil. Most true is that saying of the
heathen poet, &#8212; &#8220;He who is desirous of becoming rich is also
desirous of acquiring riches soon.&#8221;<b>

glitter of gold or silver dazzles their eyes.</font><br></div>

</i>There is no necessity for being too scrupulous in comparing other vices with
this. It is certain that ambition and pride often produce worse fruits than
covetousness does; and yet ambition does not proceed from covetousness. The same
thing may be said of the sins forbidden by the seventh commandment. But
Paul&#8217;s intention was not to include under covetousness every kind of vices
that can be named. What then? He simply meant, that innumerable evils arise from
it; just as we are in the habit of saying, when we speak of discord, or
gluttony, or drunkenness, or any other vice of that kind, that there is no evil
which it does not produce. And, indeed, we may most truly affirm, as to the base
desire of gain, that there is no kind of evils that is not copiously produced by
it every day; such as innumerable frauds, falsehoods, perjury, cheating,
robbery, cruelty, corruption in judicature, quarrels, hatred, poisonings,
murders; and, in short, almost every sort of crime.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Statements of this nature occur everywhere in heathen
writers; and, therefore, it is improper that those persons: who would applaud
Horace or Ovid, when speaking in that manner, should complain of Paul as having
used extravagant language. I wish it were not proved by daily experience, that
this is a plain description of facts as they really are. But let us remember
that the same crimes which spring from avarice, may also arise, as they
undoubtedly do arise, either from ambition, or from envy, or from other sinful
dispositions.</font><br></div>

desired;&#8221; but it does not obscure the sense. He affirms that the most
aggravated of all evils springs from avarice &#8212; revolting from the faith;
for they who are diseased with this disease are found to degenerate gradually,
till they entirely renounce the faith. Hence those <i>sorrows, </i>which he
mentions; by which term I understand frightful torments of conscience, which are
wont to befall men past all hope; though God has other methods of trying

were pastime, whereas Christ calls all his servants to warfare.</font><br></div>

soldiers do not hesitate to fight, when the result is doubtful, and when there

how much more bravely ought we to do battle under the guidance and banner of
Christ, when we are certain of victory? More especially, since a reward awaits
us, not such as other generals are wont to give to their soldiers, but a
glorious immortality and heavenly blessedness; it would certainly be disgraceful
that we, who have such a hope held out to us, should grow weary or give way. And
that is what he immediately afterwards adds, &#8212; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lay hold on eternal
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As if he had said, &#8220;God
calls thee to eternal life, and therefore, despising the world, strive to obtain
it.&#8221; When he commands them to &#8220;lay hold on it,&#8221; he forbids
them to pause or slacken in the middle of their course; as if he had said, that
&#8220;nothing has been done,<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa123A</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
till we have obtained the life to come, to which God invites us.&#8221; In like
manner, he affirms that he strives to make progress, because he has not yet laid
hold.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
3:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To which also thou, hast been
called</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Because men would run at random,
and to no purpose, if they had not God as the director of their course, for the
purpose of promoting their cheerful activity, he mentions also the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>calling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for there is nothing that ought to animate us with greater courage than to
learn that we have been &#8220;called&#8221; by God; for we conclude from this,
that our labor, which God directs, and in which he stretches out his hand to us,
will not be fruitless. Besides, to have rejected the calling of God would be a
disgraceful reproach; and, therefore, this ought to be a very powerful
excitement: &#8220;God calls thee to eternal life; beware of being drawn aside
to anything else, or of falling short in any way, before thou hast attained
it.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hast confessed a good
confession</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By mentioning his former
life, the Apostle excites him still more to persevere; for to give way, after
having begun well, is more disgraceful than never to have begun. To Timothy, who
had hitherto acted valiantly, and had obtained applause, he addresses this
powerful argument, that the latter end should correspond to the beginning. By
the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>confession</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>I understand not that which is expressed in words, but rather what is
actually performed; and that not in a single instance merely, but throughout his
whole ministry. The meaning therefore is: &#8220;Thou hast many witnesses of thy
illustrious confession, both at Ephesus and in other countries, who have beheld
thee acting faithfully and sincerely in the profession of the gospel; and,
therefore, having given such a proof of fidelity, thou canst not, without the
greatest shame and disgrace, shew thyself to be anything else than a
distinguished soldier of Christ.&#8221; By this passage we are taught in
general, that the more any of us excels, the less excusable is he if he fail,
and the stronger are his obligations to God to persevere in the right
course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I charge
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The great vehemence of solemn
appeal, which Paul employs, is a proof how rare and hard a virtue it is, to
persevere in the ministry, in a proper manner, till the end; for, although he
exhorts others, in the person of Timothy, yet he addresses him
also.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before God, who quickeneth all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>What he affirms concerning
Christ and concerning God, has an immediate relation to the present subject;
for, when he ascribes this to God, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>quickeneth all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he wishes to meet the offense of
the cross, which presents to us nothing but the appearance of death. He
therefore means, that we should shut our eyes, when ungodly men hold out and
threaten death; or rather, that we should fix our eyes on God alone, because it
is he who restoreth the dead to life. The amount of the whole is, that, turning
away our gaze from the world, we should learn to look at God
alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Christ Jesus, who testified a
good, confession before Pontius Pilate. </i></font><font face="Palatino">What he
now adds about </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ
</i></font><font face="Palatino">contains a remarkable confirmation; for we are
taught, that we are not in the school of Plato, to learn philosophy from him,
and to hear him discoursing in the shade about idle disputes; but that the
doctrine which Timothy professes was ratified by the death of the Son of God.
Christ made his confession before Pilate, not in a multitude of words, but in
reality; that is, by undergoing a voluntary death; for, although Christ chose to
be silent before Pilate, rather than speak in his own defense, because he had
come thither &#8212; devoted already to a certain condemnation; yet in his
silence there was a defense of his doctrine not less magnificent than if he had
defended himself with a loud voice. He ratified it by his blood, and by the
sacrifice of his death, better than he could have ratified it by his voice.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa124</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This confession the Apostle calls<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
For Socrates also died; and yet his death was not a satisfactory proof of the
doctrine which he held. But when we hear that the blood of the Son of God was
shed, that is an authentic seal which removes all our doubt. Accordingly,
whenever our hearts waver, let us remember that we should always go to the death
of Christ for confirmation. What cowardice would there be in deserting such a
leader going before us to show us the way!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
That thou, keep the commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the word
commandment he means all that he hath hitherto said about the office of Timothy,
the sum of which was, that he should show himself to be a faithful minister to
Christ and to the Church. What is the use of extending this to the whole law?
But perhaps it will be thought preferable to view it as denoting the office
which he had received by divine authority; for we are appointed to be ministers
of the Church on no other condition than this, that God enjoins upon us whatever
he wishes us to do. Thus to &#8220;keep the commandment&#8221; would be nothing
else than to discharge honestly the office committed to him. I certainly view it
as referring altogether to the ministry of Timothy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spotless and
unblameable</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa125</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Whether we consider the case or the termination<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa126</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> of
the two Greek adjectives which are thus translated, they may apply either to the
commandment given, or to the person of Timothy; but the meaning which I have
assigned is much more appropriate.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa127</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Paul informs Timothy, that he must he wish to discharge his office in a proper
manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Till the revelation of our Lord
Jesus Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is impossible to tell
how necessary it was to all the godly, at that time, to have their mind entirely
fixed on the day of Christ; because innumerable offenses existed everywhere in
the world. They were assailed on every hand, were universally hated and
abhorred, were exposed to the mockeries of all, were oppressed every day with
new calamities; and yet they saw no fruit of so many toils and annoyances. What
then remained, but that in thought they should fly away to that blessed day of
our redemption?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet the same reason is in force with regard to us in
the present day, and indeed applies equally to almost every age. How many things
does Satan constantly present to our eyes, which, but for this, would a thousand
times draw us aside from the right course! I say nothing about fires, and
swords, and banishments, and all time furious attacks of enemies. I say nothing
about slanders and other vexations. How many things are within, that are far
worse! Ambitious men openly attack us, Epicureans and Lucianists jeer at us,
impudent men provoke us, hypocrites murmur at us, they who are wise after the
flesh secretly bite us, we are harassed by various methods in every direction.
In short, it is a great miracle that any man perseveres steadfastly in an office
so difficult and so dangerous. The only remedy for all these difficulties is, to
cast our eyes towards the appearing of Christ, and to keep them fixed on it
continually.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font color="Maroon">fa128</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Which in his seasons he will show</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We
are commonly hasty in our wishes, and not far from prescribing a day and hour to
God, as if we should say, that he must not delay to perform anything that he has
promised; and for that reason the Apostle takes an early opportunity of
restraining excessive haste, by expecting the coming of Christ. For that is the
meaning of the words, &#8220;which in his seasons he will show.&#8221; When men
know that the proper time for anything is not fully come, they wait for it more
patiently. How comes it that we are so patient in bearing with the order of
nature, but because we are restrained by this consideration, that we shall act
unreasonably, if we struggle against it with our desires? Thus we know, that the
revelation of Christ has its appointed time, for which we must wait
patiently.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The blessed and only
Prince</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Those splendid titles are here
employed in exalting the princely authority of God, in order that the brilliancy
of the princes of this world may not dazzle our eyes. And such instruction was,
at that time, especially necessary; for by how much all kingdoms were then great
and powerful, by so much were the majesty and glory of God thrown into the
shade. For all that governed the kingdoms of the world not only were deadly
enemies of the kingdom of God, but proudly mocked at God, and trampled his
sacred name under their feet; and the greater the haughtiness with which they
despised true religion, the more happy did they imagine themselves to be. From
such an aspect of things who would not have concluded that God was miserably
vanquished and oppressed? We see to what a pitch of insolence Cicero rises
against the Jews on account of their humbled condition, in his oration for
Flaccus.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When good men see that the wicked are puffed up with
prosperity, they are sometimes cast down; and therefore Paul, for the purpose of
withdrawing the eyes of the godly from that transitory splendor, ascribes to God
alone &#8220;blessedness, principality, and kingly power.&#8221; When he calls
God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the only
prince</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he does not overthrow civil
government, as if there ought to be no magistrates or kings in the world, but
means that it is He alone who reigns from himself and from his own power. This
is evident from what follows, which he adds by way of exposition, &#8212;
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>King of kings, and Lord of
lords</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The sum of it is, that all the
governments of the world are subject to his dominion, depend upon him, and stand
or fall at his bidding, but that the authority of God is beyond all comparison,
because all the rest are nothing as compared with his glory, and while they fade
and quickly perish, his authority will endure for ever.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who alone hath
immortality</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Paul labors to demonstrate
that there is no happiness, no dignity or excellence, no life, out of God.
accordingly, he now says that God alone is immortal, in order to inform us, that
we and all the creatures do not, strictly speaking, live, but only borrow life
from Him. Hence it follows that, when we look up to God as the fountain of
immortal life, we should reckon this present life as of no
value.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is objected, that the human soul and angels
have their immortality, and therefore this cannot be truly affirmed of God
alone. I reply, when it is said, that God alone possesses immortality, it is not
here denied that he bestows it, as he pleases, on any of his creatures. The
meaning is the same as if Paul had said that God alone not is immortal from
himself and from his own nature, but has immortality in his power; so that it
does not belong to creatures, except so far as he imparts to them power and
vigor; for if you take away the power of God which is communicated to the soul
of man, it will instantly fade away; and the same thing may be said about
angels. Strictly speaking, therefore, immortality does not subsist in the nature
of souls or of angels, but comes from another source, namely, from the secret
inspiration of God, agreeably to that saying,</font><br></div>

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441728&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Acts
17:28.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any one wish to have a larger and more acute
discussion of this subject, let him consult the twelfth book of Augustine
&#8220;On the City of God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who inhabiteth unapproachable
light</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He means two things, that God is
concealed from us, and yet that the cause of obscurity is not in himself, as if
be were hidden in darkness, but in ourselves, who, on account of the weak
vision, or rather the dullness of our understanding, cannot approach to his
light. We must understand that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>light
</i></font><font face="Palatino">of God is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unapproachable</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>if any one endeavor to approach to it in his own strength; for, if God did
not open up the entrance to us by his grace, the prophet would not
say:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;They who draw near
to him are enlightened.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;193405&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
34:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet it is true that, while we are surrounded by this
mortal flesh, we never penetrate so far into the deepest secrets of God as to
have nothing hidden from us; for</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;we know in part,
and we see as by a mirror, and in a

Corinthians 13:9-12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By faith, therefore, we enter into the light of God,
but only in part. Still it is true, that it is a &#8220;light
unapproachable&#8221; by man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom no man hath seen or can
see</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is added for the sake of
additional explanation, that men may learn to look by faith to him, whom they
cannot see with the bodily eyes, or even with the powers of their understanding;
for I view this as referring not only to the bodily eyes, but also to the
faculties of the soul. We must always consider what is the Apostle&#8217;s
design. It is difficult for us to overlook and disregard all those things of
which we have immediate vision, that we may endeavor to come to God, who is
nowhere to be seen. For this thought always comes into our mind: &#8220;How
knowest thou if there is a God, seeing that thou only hearest that he is, and
dost not see him?&#8221; The Apostle fortifies us against this danger, by
affirming that it ought not to be judged according to our senses, because it
exceeds our capacity; for the reason why we do not see is, that our sight is not
so keen as to ascend to so great a height.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is a long dispute in Augustine on this point,
because it appears to contradict what is said, in the first
Epistle,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Then shall we see
him as he is, because we shall be like

<div><font face="Palatino">While he reasons on this subject in many passages,
there appears to me to be none in which he explains it more clearly than in the
letter which he writes to the widow Paulina.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So far as relates to the meaning of the present
passage, the answer is easy, that we cannot see God in this nature, as it is
said elsewhere,</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">We must be renewed, that we may be like God, before
it be granted to us to see him. And that our curiosity may not be beyond
measure, let us always remember, that the manner of living is of more importance
in this inquiry than the manner of speaking. At the same time, let us remember
the judicious caution which Augustine gives us, to be on our guard lest, while
we are keenly disputing how God can be seen, we lose both peace and
sanctification, without which no man can ever see God.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Command (or charge) those who
are rich</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There being many among
Christians who were poor and in a mean condition, it is probable that they were
despised (as usually happens) by the rich; and especially this might be common
at Ephesus, which was a wealthy city; for in such cities, for the most part,
pride is more extensively prevalent. And hence we infer how dangerous is a great
abundance of riches. Nor are there wanting good reasons why Paul addresses so
severe an admonition to the rich; but it is for the purpose of remedying faults
which almost always follow riches in the same manner as the shadow follows the
body; and that through the depravity of our natural disposition, for out of the
gifts of God we always draw an occasion for sinning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they be not haughty, nor hope
in the uncertainty of riches </i></font><font face="Palatino">He expressly
mentions two things against which rich men ought to be on their guard,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pride
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>deceitful
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>of which the former springs from
the latter. Accordingly, Paul appears to have added, in the same place,
&#8220;nor hope in the uncertainty of riches,&#8221; in order to point out the
source of all pride. For whence comes it, that rich men grow insolent, and take
extreme delight in despising others, but because they imagine that they are
supremely happy? Vain confidence goes first, and then arrogance
follows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Rich in this
world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When Paul wishes to correct those
faults, he first speaks contemptuously of riches; for the phrase,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in this
world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is intended to lower them in our
esteem. All that is in the world has the taste of its nature; so that it is
fading, and quickly passes away. The uncertainty and vanity of time hope that is
placed in riches are strewn by him from this consideration, that the possession
of them is so transitory that it is like a thing unknown; for, while we think
that we hold them, they slip out of our hands in a moment. How foolish is it,
therefore, to place our hope in them!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But in the living
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He who understands this will find
no difficulty in withdrawing his hope from riches; for, if it is God alone who
supplies us with everything for the necessary purposes of life, we transfer to
riches what is this prerogative, when we place hope in them. Now observe that
there is an implied contrast, when he affirms that God giveth abundantly to all.
The meaning is, that, although we have a full and overflowing abundance of all
things, yet we have nothing but from the blessing of God alone; for it is that
blessing alone which imparts to us all that is needful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence it follows, that they are egregiously mistaken,
who rely on riches, and do not depend entirely on the blessing of God, in which
consists a sufficiency of food and of everything else. Hence also we conclude,
that we are forbidden to trust in riches, not only because they belong to the
use of mortal life, but likewise because they are nothing but smoke; for we are
fed, not by bread only, but by the blessing of God.

former, for correcting the sinful dispositions of rich men, by stating
authoritatively what is the lawful use of riches; for the richer any man is, the
more abundant are his means of doing good to others; and because we are always
more tardy than we ought to be in giving to the poor, he employs many words in
commendation of that virtue.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Laying up for themselves a
good foundation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Besides, he adds an
incitement drawn from the promise <i>of </i>a reward; that, by <i>bestowing
</i>and <i>communicating, </i>they will procure for themselves a better treasure
than they can have on earth. By the word foundation he means a firm end lasting
duration; for the spiritual riches which we &#8220;lay up for ourselves&#8221;
in heaven, are not exposed to the ravages of worms or thieves,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400620&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
6:20,) or fires, but continue always to be placed beyond all danger. On the
contrary, nothing on earth is solidly founded; but everything may be said to be
in a floating condition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The inference drawn by Papists from this passage,
that we therefore obtain eternal life by the merit of good works, is excessively
frivolous. It is true that God accepts as given to himself everything that is
bestowed on the poor.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402540&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
25:40.) But even the most perfect hardly perform the hundredth part of their
duty; and therefore our liberality, does not deserve to be brought into account
before God. So far are we from rendering full payment, that, if God should call
us to a strict account, there is not one of us who would not be a bankrupt. But,
after having reconciled us to himself by free grace, he accepts our services,
such as they are, and bestows on them a reward which is not due. This
recompense, therefore, does not depend on considerations of merit, but on
God&#8217;s gracious acceptance, and is so far from being inconsistent with the
righteousness of faith, that it may be viewed as an appendage to
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>O Timothy, guard that which
is committed, to thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Though
interpreters differ in expounding
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">paraqh&gt;khn</font><font face="Palatino">,
a thing <i>committed, </i>yet, for my part, I think that it denotes that grace
which had been communicated to Timothy for the discharge of his office. It is
called &#8220;a thing committed,&#8221; for the same reason that it is called
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;402515&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
25:15,) &#8220;a talent;&#8221; for all the gifts which God bestows on us are
committed to us on this condition, that we shall one day give an account of
them, if the advantage which they ought to have yielded be not lost through our
negligence. The Apostle therefore exhorts him to keep diligently what had been
given to him, or rather, what had been committed to him in trust; that he may
not suffer it to be corrupted or adulterated, or may not deprive or rob himself
of it through his own fault. It frequently happens that our ingratitude or abuse
of the gifts of God causes them to be taken from us; and therefore Paul exhorts
Timothy to endeavor to preserve, by a good conscience and by proper use, that
which had been &#8220;committed&#8221; to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Avoiding profane vanities of
noises</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The object of the admonition is,
that he may be diligent in imparting solid instruction; and this cannot be,
unless he detest ostentation; for, where an ambitious desire to please prevails,
there is no longer any strong desire of edification. For this reason, when he
spoke of &#8220;guarding the thing committed,&#8221; he very appropriately added
this caution about avoiding profane talkativeness. As to the rendering which the
Vulgate gives to
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kenofwvi&gt;av</font><font face="Palatino">,
<i>&#8220;</i>vanities of voices,&#8221; I do not so much object to it, except
on the ground of an ambiguity which has led to a wrong exposition; for
&#8220;Voces&#8221; is commonly supposed to have the same meaning here as
&#8220;Vocabula,&#8221; &#8220;Words,&#8221; such as Fate or
Fortune.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, for my part, I think that he describes the high
&#8212; sounding and verbose and bombastic style of those who, not content with
the simplicity of the gospel, turn it into profane philosophy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"> The
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kenofwbi&gt;ai</font><font face="Palatino"><b>

consist, not in single words, but in that swelling language which is so
constantly and so disgustingly poured out by ambitious men, who aim at applause
rather than the profit of the Church. And most accurately has Paul described it;
for, while there is a strange sound of something lofty, there is nothing
underneath but &#8220;empty&#8221; jingle, which he likewise calls
&#8220;profane;&#8221; for the power of the Spirit is extinguished as soon as
the Doctors blow their flutes in this manner, to display their
eloquence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the face of a prohibition so clear and distinct,
which the Holy Spirit has given, this plague has nevertheless broken out; and,
indeed, it showed itself at the very beginning, but, at length, has grown to
such a height in Popery, that the counterfeit mark of theology which prevails
there &#8212; is a lively mirror of that &#8220;profane&#8221; and &#8220;empty
noise&#8221; of which Paul speaks. I say nothing about the innumerable errors
and follies and blasphemies with which their books and their noisy disputes
abound. But even although they taught nothing that was contrary to godliness,
yet, because their whole doctrine contains nothing else than big words and
bombast, because it is inconsistent with the majesty of Scripture, the efficacy
of the Spirit, the gravity of the prophets, and the sincerity of the apostles,
it is, on that account, an absolute profanation of real
theology.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, I ask, do they teach about faith, or
repentance, or calling on God; about the weakness of men, or the assistance of
the Holy Spirit, or the forgiveness of sins by free grace, or about the office
of Christ, that can be of any avail for the solid edification of godliness? But
on this subject we shall have occasion to speak again in expounding the Second
Epistle. Undoubtedly, any person who possesses a moderate share of understanding
and of candor; will acknowledge that all the high &#8212; sounding terms of
Popish Theology, and all the authoritative decisions that make so much noise in
their schools, are nothing else than &#8220;profane
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kenofwni&gt;ai</font><font face="Palatino">,&#8221;
(empty words,) and that it is impossible to find more accurate terms for
describing them than those which the Apostle has employed. And certainly it is a
most righteous punishment of human arrogance, that they who swerve from the
purity of Scripture become profane. The doctors of the Church, therefore, cannot
be too earnestly attentive to guard against such corruptions, and to defend the
youth from them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The old translation, adopting the reading of
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kainofwni&gt;av</font><font face="Palatino">
instead of
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kenofwni&gt;av</font><font face="Palatino">,
rendered it <i>novelties of words; </i>and it is evident from the commentaries
of the ancients, that this rendering, which is even now found in some Greek
copies, was at one time extensively approved; but the former, which I have
followed, is far better.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And contradictions of science
falsely so called</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This also is highly
exact and elegant; for so swollen are the subtleties on which men desirous of
glory plume themselves, that they overwhelm the real doctrine of the gospel,
which is simple and unpretending. That pomp, therefore, which courts display,
and which is received with applause by the world, is called by the Apostle
&#8220;contradictions.&#8221; Ambition, indeed, is always contentious, and is
the mother of disputes; and hence it arises that they who are desirous to
display themselves are always ready to enter into the arena of debate on any
subject. But Paul had this principally in view, that the empty doctrine of the
sophists, rising aloft into airy speculations and subtleties, not only obscures
by its pretensions the simplicity of true doctrine, but also oppresses and
renders it contemptible, as the world is usually carried away by outward
show.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul does not mean that Timothy should be moved by
emulation to attempt something of the same kind, but, because those things which
have an appearance of subtlety, or are adapted to ostentation, are more
agreeable to human curiosity, Paul, on the contrary, pronounces that
&#8220;science &#8220;which exalts itself above the plain and humble doctrine of
godliness &#8212; to be <i>falsely called </i>and thought a <i>science. </i>This
ought to be carefully observed, that we may learn boldly to laugh at and despise
all that hypocritical wisdom which strikes the world with admiration and
amazement, although there is no edification in it; for, according to Paul, no
science is truly and justly so called but that which instruct us in the
confidence and fear of God; that is, in godliness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which some professing, have
erred concerning the faith. </i></font><font face="Palatino">From the result,
also, he demonstrates how dangerous a thing it is, and how much it ought to be
avoided. The way in which God punishes the haughtiness of those who, through the
desire of obtaining reputation, corrupt and disfigure the doctrine of godliness,
is, that he allows them to fall away from soundness of understanding, so that
they involve themselves in many absurd errors. We see that this has taken place
in Popery; for, after they began to speculate in profane manner, about the
mysteries of our religion, there followed innumerable monsters of false
opinions. <i>Faith </i>is here taken, as in some former passages, for the
summary of religion and sound doctrine. Warned by such examples, if we abhor
revolt from &#8220;the faith,&#8221; let us adhere to the pure word of God, and
let us detest sophistry and all useless subtleties, because they are abominable
corruptions of religion.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">END OF THE
FIRST EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">THE ARGUMENT</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>ON</b></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE SECOND
EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">IT cannot be absolutely ascertained from Luke&#8217;s
history at what time the former Epistle was written. But I have no doubt that,
after that time, Paul had personal communication with Timothy; and it is even
possible (if the generally received opinion be believed) that Paul had him for a
companion and assistant in many places. Yet it may readily be concluded that he
was at Ephesus when this Epistle was written to him; because, towards the close
of the Epistle,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550419&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 4:19,) Paul &#8220;salutes Priscilla, and Aquila, and
Onesiphorus,&#8221; the last of whom was an Ephesian, and Luke informs us that
the other two remained at Ephesus when Paul sailed to Judea,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442818&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
28:18, 29.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The chief point on which it turns is to confirm
Timothy, both in the faith of the gospel, and in the pure and constant preaching
of it. But yet these exhortations derive no small weight from the consideration
of the time when he wrote them. Paul had before his eyes the death which he was
prepared to endure for the testimony of the gospel. All that we read here,
therefore, concerning the kingdom of Christ, the hope of eternal life, the
Christian warfare, confidence in confessing Christ, and the certainty of
doctrine, ought to be viewed by us as written not with ink but with Paul&#8217;s
own blood; for nothing is asserted by him for which he does not offer the pledge
of his death; and therefore this Epistle may be regarded as a solemn
subscription and ratification of Paul&#8217;s doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is of importance to remember, however, what we
stated in the exposition of the former Epistle, that the Apostle did not write
it merely for the sake of one man, but that he exhibited, under the person of
one man, a general doctrine, which should afterwards be transmitted from one
hand to another. And first, having praised the faith of Timothy, in which he had
been educated from his childhood, he exhorts him to persevere faithfully in the
doctrine which he had learned, and in the office intrusted to him; and, at the
same time, lest Timothy should be discouraged on account of Paul&#8217;s
imprisonment, or the apostasy of others, he boasts of his apostleship and of the
reward laid up for him. He likewise praises Onesiphorus, in order to encourage
others by his example; and because the condition of those who serve Christ is
painful and difficult, he borrows comparisons both from husbandmen and from
soldiers, the former of whom do not hesitate to bestow much labor on the
cultivation of the soil before any fruit is seen, while the latter lay aside all
cares and employments, in order to devote themselves entirely to the life of a
soldier and to the command of their general.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Next, he gives a brief summary of his gospel, and
commands Timothy to hand it down to others, and to take care that it shall be
transmitted to posterity. Having taken occasion from this to mention again his
own imprisonment, he rises to holy boldness, for the purpose of animating others
by his noble courage; for he invites us all to contemplate, along with him, that
crown which awaits him in heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He bids him also abstain from contentious disputes
and vain questions, recommending to him, on the contrary, to promote
edification; and in order to shew more clearly how enormous an evil it is, he
relates that some have been ruined by it, and particularly mentions two,
Hymenaeus and Philetus who, having fallen into monstrous absurdity, so as to
overturn the faith of the resurrection, suffered the horrible punishment of
their vanity. But because falls of that kind, especially of distinguished men
and those who enjoyed some reputation are usually attended by great scandal, he
shews that believers ought not to be distressed on account of them, because they
who possess the name of Christ do not all belong actually to Christ, and because
the Church must be exposed to the misery of dwelling among wicked and ungodly
persons in this world. Yet that this may not unduly terrify weak minds, he
prudently softens it, by saying that the Lord will preserve till the end his
own, whom he has elected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards returns to exhort Timothy to persevere
faithfully in the discharge of his ministry; and in order to make him more
careful, he foretells what dangerous times await the good and the pious, and
what destructive men shall afterwards arise; but, in opposition to all this, he
confirms him by the hope of a good and successful result. More especially, he
recommends to him to be constantly employed in teaching sound doctrine, pointing
out the proper use of Scripture, that he may know that he will find in it
everything that is necessary for the solid edification of the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Next, he mentions that his own death is at hand, but
he does so in the manner of a conqueror hastening to a glorious triumph, which
is a clear testimony of wonderful confidence. Lastly, after having besought
Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, he points out the necessity arising
from his present condition. This is the principal subject in the conclusion of
the Epistle.</font><br></div>

already perceive that Paul had not in view Timothy alone; other wise he would
not have employed such lofty titles in asserting his apostleship; for what
purpose would it have served to employ these ornaments of language ill writing
to one who was fully convinced of the fact? He, therefore, lays claim to that

God for its author and defender, is beyond all dispute.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the promise of
life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>That his calling may be the more
certain, he connects it with the promises of eternal life; as if he had said,
&#8220;As from the beginning God promised eternal life in Christ, so now he has
appointed me to be the minister for proclaiming that promise.&#8221; Thus also
he points out the design of his apostleship, namely, to bring men to Christ,
that in him they may find life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which is in Christ
Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He speaks with great accuracy,
when he mentions that &#8220;the promise of life&#8221; was indeed given, in
ancient times, to the fathers.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
26:6.) But yet he declares that this life is in Christ, in order to inform us
that the faith of those who lived under the Law must nevertheless have looked
towards Christ; and that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My beloved

testifies his love of Timothy, but procures respect and submission to him;
because he wishes to be acknowledged in him, as one who may justly be called his
son,  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The reason of the appellation is, that he had begotten him in Christ; for,
although this honor belongs to God alone, yet it is also transferred to
ministers, whose agency he employs for regenerating us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Grace,
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
which he employs here, is commonly left out by him in his ordinary salutations.
I think that he introduced it, when he poured out his feelings with more than
ordinary vehemence. Moreover, he appears to have inverted the order; for, since
&#8220;mercy&#8221; is the cause of &#8220;grace,&#8221; it ought to have come
before it in this passage. But still it is not unsuitable that it should be put
after &#8220;grace&#8221;, in order to express more clearly what is the nature
of that grace, and whence it proceeds; as if he had added, in the form of a
declaration, that the reason why we are loved by God is, that he is merciful.
Yet this may also be explained as relating to God&#8217;s daily benefits, which
are so many testimonies of his &#8220;mercy&#8221;; for, whenever he assists us,
whenever he delivers us from evils, pardons our sins, and bears with our
weakness, he does so, because he has compassion on us.</font><br></div>

I give thanks</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The meaning usually
assigned to these words is, that Paul &#8220;gives thanks to God,&#8221; and
next assigns the cause or ground of thanksgiving; namely, that he is unceasingly
mindful of Timothy. But let my readers consider whether the following sense do
not suit equally well and even better: &#8220;Whenever I remember thee in my
prayers, (and I do so continually,) I also give thanks concerning thee;&#8221;
for the particle</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">
wJv</font><font face="Palatino"> most frequently has that meaning; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb4</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and,
indeed, any meaning that can be drawn from a different translation is
exceedingly meager. According to this exposition, prayer will be a sign of
carefulness, and thanksgiving a sign of joy; that is, he never thought of
Timothy without calling to remembrance the eminent virtues with which he was
adorned. Hence arises ground of thanksgiving; for the recollection of the gifts
of God is always pleasant and delightful to believers. Both are proofs of real
friendship. He calls the <i>mention </i>of him
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajdia&gt;leipton</font><font face="Palatino">)
<i>unceasing, </i>because he never forgets him when he prays.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom I worship from my
ancestors</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This declaration he made in
opposition to those well &#8212; known calumnies with which the Jews everywhere
loaded him, as if he had forsaken the religion of his country, and apostatized
from the law of Moses. On the contrary, he declares that he worships God,
concerning whom he had been taught by his ancestors, that is, the God of
Abraham, who revealed himself to the Jews, who delivered his law by the hand of
Moses; and not some pretended God, whom he had lately made for
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here it may be asked, &#8220;Since Paul glories
in following the religion handed down from his ancestors, is this a sufficiently
solid foundation? For hence it follows, that this will be a plausible presence
for excusing all superstitions, and that it will be a crime, if any one depart,
in the smallest degree, from the institutions of his ancestors, whatever these
are.&#8221; The answer is easy. He does not here lay down a fixed rule, that
every person who follows the religion that he received from his fathers is
believed to worship God aright, and, on the other hand, that he who departs from
the custom of his ancestors is at all to blame for it. For this circumstance
must always be taken into account, that Paul was not descended from idolaters,
but from the children of Abraham, who worshipped the true God. We know what
Christ says, in disapproving of all the false worship of the Gentiles, that the
Jews alone maintained the true method of worship. Paul, therefore, does not rest
solely on the authority of the fathers, nor does he speak indiscriminately of
all his ancestors; but he removes that false opinion, with which he knew that he
was unjustly loaded, that he had forsaken the God of Israel, and framed for
himself a strange god.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In a pure
conscience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is certain that
Paul&#8217;s conscience was not always pure; for he acknowledges that he was
deceived by hypocrisy, while he gave loose reins to sinful desire. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb5</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450708&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:8.) The excuse which Chrysostom offers for what Paul did while he was a
Pharisee, on the ground that he opposed the gospel, not through malice, but
through ignorance, is not a satisfactory reply to the objection; for &#8220;a
pure conscience&#8221; is no ordinary commendation, and cannot be separated from
the sincere and hearty fear of God. I, therefore, limit it to the present time,
in this manner, that he worships the same God as was worshipped by his
ancestors, but that now he worships him with pure affection of the heart, since
the time when he was enlightened by the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This statement has the same object with the numerous
protestations of the apostles, as recorded in the Acts of the
Apostles:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I serve the God of

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In my prayers night and

constancy in prayer; and yet he affirms nothing about himself but what Christ
recommends to all his followers. We ought, therefore, to be moved and inflamed
by such examples to imitate them, so far, at least, that an exercise so
necessary may be more frequent among us. If any one understand this to mean the
daily and nightly prayers which Paul was wont to offer at stated hours, there
will be no impropriety in that view; though I give a more simple interpretation,
that there was no time when he was not employed in prayer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Calling to remembrance that
unfeigned faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Not so much for the
purpose of applauding as of exhorting Timothy, the Apostle commends both his own
faith and that of his grandmother and mother; for, when one has begun well and
valiantly, the progress he has made should encourage him to advance, and
domestic examples are powerful excitements to urge him forward. Accordingly, he
sets before him </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his grandmother
Lois and his mother Eunice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by whom he
had been educated from his infancy in such a manner that he might have sucked
godliness along with his milk. By this godly education, therefore, Timothy is
admonished not to degenerate from himself and from his
ancestors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is uncertain whether, on the one hand, these women
were converted to Christ, and what Paul here applauds was the commencement of
faith, or whether, on the other hand, faith is attributed to them apart from
Christianity. The latter appears to me more probable; for, although at that time
everything abounded with many superstitions and corruptions, yet God had always
his own people, whom he did not suffer to be corrupted with the multitude, but
whom he sanctified and separated to himself, that there might always exist among
the Jews a pledge of this grace, which he had promised to the seed of Abraham.
There is, therefore, no absurdity in saying that they lived and died in the
faith of the Mediator, although Christ had not yet been revealed to them. But I
do not assert anything, and could not assert without rashness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I am persuaded that in thee
also</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This clause confirms me in the
conjecture which I have just now stated; for, in my opinion, he does not here
speak of the present faith of Timothy. It would lessen that sure confidence of
the former eulogium, if he only said that he reckoned the faith of Timothy to
resemble the faith of his grandmother and mother. But I understand the meaning
to be, that Timothy, from his childhood, while he had not yet obtained a
knowledge of the gospel, was imbued with the fear of God, and with such faith as
proved to be a living seed, which afterwards manifested itself.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For which cause I advise
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The more abundantly that Timothy
had received the grace of God, the more attentive (the Apostle intimates) he
ought to be in making progress from day to day. It deserves notice that the
words &#8220;for which cause&#8221; introduce this advice as a conclusion from
what has been already said.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To stir up the gift of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This exhortation is highly necessary; for
it usually happens, and may be said to be natural, that the excellence of gifts
produces carelessness, which is also accompanied by sloth; and Satan continually
labors to extinguish all that is of God in us. We ought, therefore, on the other
hand, to strive to bring to perfection everything that is good in us, and to
kindle what is languid; for the metaphor, which Paul employs, is taken from a
fire which was feeble, or that was in course of being gradually extinguished, if
strength and fame were not added, by blowing upon it and by supplying new fuel.
Let us therefore remember that we ought to apply to use the gifts of God, lest,
being unemployed and concealed, they gather rust. Let us also remember that we
should diligently profit by them, lest they be extinguished by our
slothfulness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which is in thee by the laying on
of my hands</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There can be no doubt that
Timothy was invited by the general voice of the Church, and was not elected by
the private wish of Paul alone; but there is no absurdity in saying, that Paul
ascribes the election to himself personally, because he was the chief actor in
it. Yet here he speaks of ordination, that is, of the solemn act of conferring
the office of the ministry, and not of election. Besides, it is not perfectly
clear whether it was the custom, when any minister was to be set apart, that all
laid their hands on his head, or that one only did so, in the room and name of
all. I am more inclined to the conjecture, that it was only one person who laid
on his hands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So far as relates to the ceremony, the apostles
borrowed it from an ancient custom of their nation; or rather, ill consequence
of its being in use, they retained it; for this is a part of that decent and
orderly procedure which Paul elsewhere recommends.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;461440&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 14:40.) Yet it may be doubted if that &#8220;laying on of
hands&#8221; which is now mentioned refers to ordination; because, at that time,
the graces of the Spirit, of which he speaks in the 12th chapter of the Epistle
to the Romans (Romans 12), and in the 13th of the First Epistle to the
Corinthians (1 Corinthians 13), were bestowed on many others who were not
appointed to be pastors. But, for my own part, I think that it may be easily
inferred from the former Epistle, that Paul here speaks of the office of a
pastor, for this passage agrees with that,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Do not neglect the
grace which was given to thee with the laying on of the hands of the
eldership.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Timothy 4:14.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That point being settled, it is asked, &#8220;Was
grace given by the outward sign?&#8221; To this question I answer, whenever
ministers were ordained, they were recommended to God by the prayers of the
whole Church, and in this manner grace from God was obtained for them by prayer,
and was not given to them by virtue of the sign, although the sign was not
uselessly or unprofitably employed, but was a sure pledge of that grace which
they received from God&#8217;s own hand. That ceremony was not a profane act,
invented for the sole purpose of procuring credit in the eyes of men, but a
lawful consecration before God, which is not performed but by the power of the
Holy Spirit. Besides, Paul takes the sign for the whole matter or the whole
transaction; for he declares that Timothy was endued with grace, when he was
offered to God as a minister. Thus in this mode of expression there is a figure
of speech, in which a part is taken for the whole.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we are again met by another question; for if it
was only at his ordination that Timothy obtained the grace necessary for
discharging his office, of what nature was the election of a man not yet fit or
qualified, but hitherto void and destitute of the gift of God? I answer, it was
not then so given to him that he had it not before; for it is certain that he
excelled both in doctrine and in other gifts before Paul ordained him to the
ministry. But there is no inconsistency in saying, that, when God wished to make
use of his services, and accordingly called him, he then fitted and enriched him
still more with new gifts, or doubled those which he had previously bestowed. It
does not therefore follow that Timothy had not formerly any gift, but it shone
forth the more when the duty of teaching was laid upon him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For God hath not given to us
a spirit of cowardice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is a
confirmation of what he had said immediately before; and thus he continues to
urge Timothy to display the power of the gifts which he had received. He makes
use of this argument, that God governs his ministers by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Spirit of
power</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>which is the opposite of
<i>cowardice. </i>Hence it follows, that they ought not to lie down through
slothfulness, but, sustained by great confidence and cheerfulness, should
exhibit and display, by visible effects, that power of the
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The following passage occurs in the Epistle to the
Romans:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;For we have not
received a spirit of bondage, to be again in terror; but we have received the
spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
8:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That passage is, at first sight, nearly similar to
this; but yet the context shews that the meaning is different. There he treats
of the confidence of adoption which all believers have; but here he speaks
particularly about ministers, and exhorts them, in the person of Timothy, to
arouse themselves actively to deeds of velour; because God does not wish them to
perform their office in a cold and lifeless manner, but to press forward
powerfully, relying on the efficacy of the Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But of power, and of love, and of
soberness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence we are taught, first,
that not one of us possesses that firmness and unshaken constancy of the Spirit,
which is requisite for fulfilling our ministry, until we are endued from heaven
with a new power. And indeed the obstructions are so many and so great, that no
courage of man will be able to overcome them. It is God, therefore, who endues
us with &#8220;the spirit of power;&#8221; for they who, in other respects, give
tokens of much strength, fall down in a moment, when they are not upheld by the
power of the Divine Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Secondly, we gather from it, that they who have
slavish meanness and cowardice, so that they do not venture to do anything in
defense of the truth, when it is necessary, are not governed by that Spirit by
whom the servants of Christ are guided. Hence it follows, that there are very
few of those who bear the title of ministers, in the present day, who have the
mark of sincerity impressed upon them; for, amongst a vast number, where do we
find one who, relying on the power of the Spirit, boldly despises all the
loftiness which exalts itself against Christ? Do not almost all seek their own
interest and their leisure? Do they not sink down dumb as soon as any noise
breaks out? The consequence is, that no majesty of God is seen in their
ministry. The word </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit

passages.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb6</font></sup><br></div>

</i>In my opinion, it was for the purpose of distinguishing that power of the
Spirit from the fury and rage of fanatics, who while they rush forward with
reckless impulse, fiercely boast of having the Spirit of God. For that reason he
expressly states that this powerful energy is moderated by &#8220;soberness and
love,&#8221; that is, by a calm desire of edifying. Yet Paul does not deny that
prophets and teachers were endued with the same Spirit before the publication of
the gospel; but he declares that this grace ought now to be especially powerful
and conspicuous under the reign of Christ.</font><br></div>

confession of the gospel was accounted infamous; and therefore he forbids that
either ambition or the fear of disgrace shall prevent or retard him from the
liberty of preaching the gospel. And he infers this from what has been already
said; for he who is armed with the power of God will not tremble at the noise
raised by the world, but will reckon it honorable that wicked men mark them with
disgrace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And justly does he call the gospel
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the testimony of our

of our assistance, yet he hays upon us this duty, that we shall give
&#8220;testimony&#8221; to him for maintaining his glory. It is a great and
distinguished honor which he confers upon us, and, indeed, upon all, (for there
is no Christian that ought not to reckon himself a witness of Christ,) but
chiefly pastors and teachers, as Christ said to the apostles, &#8212;

gospel is in the world, the more earnestly should they labor to confess it
openly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he adds, <i>nor of </i>me; by this word he
reminds Timothy not to refuse to be his companion, as in a cause common to both
of them; for, when we begin to withdraw from the society of those who, for the
name of Christ, suffer persecution, what else do we seek than that the gospel
shall be free from all persecution? Now, though there were not wanting many
wicked men who thus ridiculed Timothy, &#8212; &#8221;Do you not see what has
befallen your master? Do you not know that the same reward awaits you also? Why
do you press upon us a doctrine which you see is hissed at by the whole
world?&#8221; &#8212; still he must have been cheered by this exhortation,
&#8212; &#8220;You have no reason to be ashamed of me, in that which is not
shameful, for I am <i>Christ&#8217;s prisoner;&#8221; </i>that is, &#8220;Not

prison.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But be thou a partaker of the
affections of the gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He lays down a
method by which that which he enjoins may be done; that is, if Timothy shall
prepare himself for enduring the afflictions which are connected, with the
gospel. Whosoever shall revolt at and shrink from the cross will always be
ashamed of the gospel. Not without good reason, there<i>fore, </i>does Paul,
while he exhorts to boldness of confession, in order that he may not exhort in
vain, speak to him also about bearing the cross.

<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,

did not support us, we should immediately sink under the load. And this clause
contains both admonition and consolation. The admonition is, to turn away his
eyes from his present weakness, and, relying on the assistance of God, to
venture and undertake what is beyond his strength. The consolation is, that, if
we endure anything on account of the gospel, God will come forth as our
deliverer, that by his power, we may obtain the victory.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath saved
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>From the greatness of the benefit he
shews how much we owe to God; for the salvation which he has bestowed on us
easily swallows up all the evils that must be endured in this world. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>saved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
though it admit of a general signification, is here limited, by the context, to
denote eternal salvation. So then he means that they who, having obtained
through Christ not a fading or transitory, but an eternal salvation, shall spare
their fleeting life or honor rather than acknowledge their Redeemer; are
excessively ungrateful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hath called us with a holy
calling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He places the sealing of
salvation 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>calling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for, as the salvation of men was completed in the death of Christ, so God,
by the gospel, makes us partakers of it. In order to place in a stronger light
the value of this &#8220;calling,&#8221; he pronounces it to be <i>holy.
</i>This ought to be carefully observed, because, as salvation must not be
sought anywhere but in Christ so, on the other hand, he would have died and
risen again without any practical advantage, unless so far as he calls us to a
participation of this grace Thus, after having procured salvation for us, this
second blessing remains to be bestowed, that, ingrafting us into his body, he
may communicate his benefits to be enjoyed by us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not according to our works, but
according to his purpose and grace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He
describes the source both of our calling and of the whole of our salvation. We
had not works by which we could anticipate God; but the whole depends on his
gracious purpose and election; for in the two words <i>purpose </i>and <i>grace
</i>there is the figure of speech called Hypallage, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb9</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> and the
latter must have the force of an objection, as if he had said, &#8212;
&#8221;according to his gracious purpose.&#8221; Although Paul commonly employs
the word &#8220;purpose&#8221; to denote the secret decree of God, the cause of
which is in his own power, yet, for the sake of fuller explanation, he chose to
add &#8220;grace,&#8221; that he might more clearly exclude all reference to
works. And the very contrast proclaims loudly enough that there is no room for
works where the grace of God reigns, especially when we are reminded of the
election of God, by which he was beforehand with us, when we had not yet been
born. On this subject I have spoken more fully in my exposition of the first
chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians; and at present I do nothing more than
glance briefly at that which I have there treated more at large. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb10</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which was given to
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>From the order of time he argues,
that, by free grace, salvation was given to us which we did not at all deserve;
for, if God chose us before the creation of the world, he could not have regard
to works, of which we had none, seeing that we did not then exist. As to the
cavil of the sophists, that God was moved by the works which he foresaw, it does
not need a long refutation. What kind of works would those have been if God had
passed us by, seeing that the election itself is the source and beginning of all
good works?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This <i>giving</i> of grace, which he mentions, is
nothing else than predestination, by which we were adopted to be the sons of
God. On this subject I wished to remind my readers, because God is frequently
said actually to &#8220;give&#8221; his grace to us when we receive the effect
of it. But here Paul sets before us what God purposed with himself from the
beginning. He, therefore, gave that which, not induced by any merit, he
appointed to those who were not yet born, and kept laid up in his treasures,
until he made known by the fact itself that he purposeth nothing in
vain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before eternal
ages</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He employs this phrase in the same
sense in which he elsewhere speaks of the uninterrupted succession of years from
the foundation of the world.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;560102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:2.) For that ingenious reasoning which Augustine conducts in many passages is
totally different from Paul&#8217;s design. The meaning therefore is, &#8212;
&#8220;Before times began to take their course from all past ages.&#8221;
Besides, it is worthy of notice, that he places the foundation of salvation in
Christ; for, apart from him, there is neither adoption nor salvation; as was
indeed said in expounding the first chapter of the Epistle to the
Ephesians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But hath now been revealed by the
appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Observe how appropriately he connects the faith which we have from the
gospel within God&#8217;s secret election, and assigns to each of them its own
place. God has now called us by the gospel, not because he has suddenly taken
counsel about our salvation, but because he had so determined from all eternity.
Christ hath now &#8220;appeared&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb11</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for our
salvation, not because the power of saving has been recently bestowed on him,
but because this grace was laid up in him for us before the creation of the
world. The knowledge of those things is revealed to us by faith; and so the
Apostle judiciously connects the gospel with the most ancient promises of God,
that novelty may not render it contemptible.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is asked; &#8220;Were the fathers under the
Law ignorant of this grace?&#8221; for if it was not revealed but by the coming
of Christ, it follows that, before that time, it was concealed. I reply, Paul
speaks of the full exhibition of the thing itself on which depended also the
faith of the fathers, so that this takes nothing from them. The reason why Abel,
Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, and all believers, obtained the same faith with us,
was, that they placed their confidence in this &#8220;appearance.&#8221; Thus,
when he says that &#8220;grace hath been revealed to us by the appearing of
Christ,&#8221; he does not exclude from communion with that grace the fathers
who are made partakers with us of this appearing by the same faith. Christ
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;581308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
13:8) was yesterday as he is today; but he did not manifest himself to us, by
his death and resurrection, before the time appointed by the Father. To this, as
the only pledge and accomplishment of our salvation, both our faith and that of
the fathers look with one accord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath indeed destroyed
death</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When he ascribes to the gospel
the manifestation of life, he does not mean that we must begin with the word,
leaving out of view the death and resurrection of Christ, (for the word, on the
contrary, rests on the subject &#8212; matter,) but he only means that the fruit
of this grace comes to men in no other way than by the gospel, in accordance
with what is said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;God was in Christ,

now concealed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To which I have been

he so highly commend the gospel along with his apostleship. Satan labors, beyond
all things else, to banish from our hearts, by every possible method, the faith
of sound doctrine; and as it is not always easy for him to do this if he attack
us in open war, he steals upon us by secret and indirect methods; for, in order
to destroy the credibility of doctrine, he holds up to suspicion the calling of
godly teachers. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Paul,
therefore, having death before his eyes, and knowing well the ancient and
ordinary snares of Satan, determined to assert not only the doctrine of<i>
</i>the gospel in general, but his own calling. Both were necessary; for,
although there be uttered long discourses concerning the: dignity of the gospel,
they will not be of much avail to us, unless we understand what is the gospel.
Many will agree as to the general principle of the undoubted authority of the
gospel, who afterwards will have nothing certain that they can follow. This is
the reason why Paul expressly wishes to be acknowledged to be a faithful and
lawful minister of that life &#8212; giving doctrine which he had
mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A herald, and an apostle, and a

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>herald</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>whose duty it is, to publish the commands of princes and magistrates. The
word </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>apostle
</i></font><font face="Palatino">is here used in its ordinary and restricted
meaning. Moreover, because there is a natural relation between a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>teacher
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and his disciples, he takes to himself also
this third name, that they who learn from him may know that they have a master
who has been appointed to them by God. And to whom does he declare that he was
appointed? To the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Gentiles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for the main hinge of the controversy was about them, because the Jews
denied that the promises of life belonged to any others than to the fleshly
children of Abraham. In order, therefore, that the salvation of the Gentiles may
not be called in question, he affirms that to them he has been especially sent
by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
For which cause also I suffer these things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>It is well known that the rage of the Jews was kindled against Paul, for
this reason more than any other, that he made the gospel common to the Gentiles.
Yet the phrase </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for which cause
</i></font><font face="Palatino">relates to the whole verse, and therefore must
not be limited to the last clause about &#8220;the
Gentiles.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But I am not
ashamed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>That the prison in which he was
bound might not in any degree lessen his authority, he contends, on the
contrary, by two arguments. First, he shows that the cause, far from being
disgraceful, was even honorable to him; for he was a prisoner, not on account of
any evil deed, but because he obeyed God who called him. It is an inconceivable
consolation, when we are able to bring a good conscience in opposition to the
unjust judgments of men. Secondly, from the hope of a prosperous issue he argues
that there is nothing disgraceful in his imprisonment. He who shall avail
himself of this defense will be able to overcome any temptations, however great
they may be. And when he says, that he &#8220;is not ashamed,&#8221; he
stimulates others, by his example, to have the same courage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For I know whom I have
believed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is the only place of
refuge, to which all believers ought to resort, whenever the world reckons them
to be condemned and ruined men; namely, to reckon it enough that God approves of
them; for what would be the result, if they depended on men? And hence we ought
to infer how widely faith differs from opinion; because, when Paul says,
&#8220;I know whom I have believed,&#8221; he means that it is not enough if you
believe, unless you have the testimony of God, and unless you have full
certainty of it. Faith, therefore, neither leans on the authority of men, nor
rests on God, in such a manner as to hesitate, but must be joined with
knowledge; otherwise it would not be sufficiently strong against the innumerable
assaults of Satan. He who with Paul enjoys this knowledge, will know, by
experience, that, on good grounds, our faith is called</font><br></div>

what he hath promised. On the other hand, he who has not this truth sealed on
his heart, will be continually shaken hither and thither like a
reed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage is highly worthy of attention; because
it expresses admirably the power of faith, when it shows that, even in desperate
affairs, we ought to give to God such glory as not to doubt that he will be true
and faithful; and when it likewise shows that we ought to rely on the word as
fully as if God had manifested himself to us from heaven; for he who has not
this conviction understands nothing. Let us always remember that Paul does not
pursue philosophical speculations in the shade, but, having the reality before
his eyes, solemnly declares, how highly valuable is a confident hope of eternal
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And am persuaded that he is
able</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Because the power and greatness of
dangers often fill us with dismay, or at least tempt our hearts to distrust, for
this reason we must defend ourselves with this shield, that there is sufficient
protection in the power of God. In like manner Christ, when he bids us cherish
confident hope, employs this argument,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The Father, who
gave you to me, is greater than
all,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;431029&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John

<div><font face="Palatino">by which he means, that we are out of danger, seeing
that the Lord, who hath taken us under his protection, is abundantly powerful to
put down all opposition. True, Satan does not venture to suggest this thought in
a direct form, that God cannot fulfill, or is prevented from fulfilling, what he
has promised, (for our senses are shocked by so gross a blasphemy against God,)
but, by preoccupying our eyes and understandings, he takes away from us all
sense of the power of God. The heart must therefore be well purified, in order
that it may not only taste that power, but may retain the taste of it amidst
temptations of every kind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, whenever Paul speaks of the power of God,
understand by it what may be called his actual or
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejnergoume&gt;nmn</font><font face="Palatino">)

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:29) Faith always connects the power of God with the word, which it does not
imagine to be at a distance, but, having inwardly conceived it, possesses and
retains it. Thus it is said of Abraham:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He did not
hesitate or dispute, but gave glory to God, being fully convinced that what he

to denote eternal life; for hence we conclude, that our salvation is in the hand
of God, in the same manner as there are in the hand of a depository those things

words</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some explain it thus: &#8220;Let
thy doctrine be, as it were, a pattern which others may imitate.&#8221; I do not
approve <i>of </i>that view. Equally removed from Paul&#8217;s meaning is
Chrysostom&#8217;s exposition, that Timothy should have at hand the image of
virtues engraven on his heart by Paul&#8217;s doctrine. I rather think that Paul
commands Timothy to hold fast the doctrine which he had learned, not only as to
substance, but as to the very form of expression; for
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpotu&gt;pwsiv
</font><font face="Palatino">&#8212; the word which Paul employs on this
occasion &#8212; denotes a lively picture of objects, as if they were actually
placed before the eyes. Paul knew how ready men are to depart or fall off from
pure doctrine. For this reason he earnestly cautions Timothy not to turn aside
from that form of teaching which he had received, and to regulate his manner of
teaching by the rule which had been laid down; not that we ought to be very
scrupulous about words, but because to misrepresent doctrine, even in the
smallest degree, is exceedingly injurious. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb14</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we see what kind of theology there is in
Popery, which has degenerated so far from the pattern which Paul recommends,
that it resembles the riddles of diviners or soothsayers rather than a doctrine
taken from the word of God. What taste of Paul&#8217;s writings, I ask, is there
in all the books of the schoolmen? This licentiousness in corrupting doctrine
shews that there are great reasons why Paul invites Timothy to hold fast the
original and natural form. And he contrasts <i>sound words </i>not only with
doctrines manifestly wicked, but within useless questions, which, instead of
health, bring nothing but disease.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In faith and love, which is in
Christ Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I am aware that the
preposition
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn</font><font face="Palatino">,
agreeably to the idiom of the Hebrew language,
</font><font face="Gideon-Medium" color="Teal">b</font><font face="Palatino"> is
often taken for <i>with; </i>but here, I think, the meaning is different Paul
has added this as a mark of sound doctrine, in order that we may know what it
contains, and what is the summary of it, the whole of which, according to his
custom, he includes under &#8220;faith and love.&#8221; He places both of them
<i>in Christ; </i>as, indeed, the knowledge of Christ consists chiefly of these
two parts; for, although the words, <i>which is, </i>are in the singular number,
agreeing with the word <i>love, </i>yet it must also be understood as applying
<i>to faith.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Those who translate it, &#8220;<i>with </i>faith and
love,&#8221; make the meaning to be, that Timothy should add to sound doctrine
the affections of piety and love. I do acknowledge that no man can persevere
faithfully in sound doctrine unless he is endued with true faith and unfeigned
love. But the former exposition, in my opinion, is more appropriate, namely,
that Paul employs these terms for describing more fully what is the nature of
&#8220;sound words&#8221; and what is the subject of them. Now he says that the
summary consists in &#8220;faith and love&#8221; of which the knowledge of
Christ is the source and beginning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep the excellent thing
committed to thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This exhortation is
more extensive than the preceding. He exhorts Timothy to consider what God has
given to him, and to bestow care and application in proportion to the high value
of that which has been committed; for, when the thing is of little value, we are
not wont to call any one to so strict an account.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By &#8220;that which hath been committed,&#8221; I
understand him to mean both the honor of the ministry and all the gifts with
which Timothy was endued. Some limit it to the ministry alone; but I think that
it denotes chiefly the qualifications for the ministry, that is, all the gifts
of the Spirit, in which he excelled. The word &#8220;committed&#8221; is
employed also for another reason, to remind Timothy that he must, one day,
render an account; for we ought to administer faithfully what God has committed
to us.</font><br></div>

that which is of high or singular value; and, therefore, Erasmus has happily
translated it (<i>egregium</i>) &#8220;excellent,&#8221; for the sake of
denoting its rare worth. I have followed that version. But what is the method of
keeping it? It is this. We must beware lest we lose by our indolence what God
has bestowed upon us, or lest it be taken away, because we have been ungrateful
or have abused it; for there are many who reject the grace of God, and many who,
after having received it, deprive themselves of it altogether. Yet because the
difficulty of keeping it is beyond our strength, he therefore adds, &#8212;
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the Holy
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As if he had said, &#8220;I do
ask from thee more than thou canst, for what thou hast not from thyself the
Spirit of God will supply to thee.&#8221; Hence it follows, that we must not
judge of the strength of men from the commandments of God; because, as he
commands by words, so he likewise engraves his words on our hearts, and, by
communicating strength, causes that his command shall not be in
vain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who dwelleth in

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb16</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>By this he means, that the assistance of the Holy Spirit is present to
believers, provided that they do not reject it when it is offered to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Thou knowest that all that are in Asia have forsaken
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Those apostasies which he mentions
might have shaken the hearts of many, and given rise, at the same time, to many
suspicions; as we commonly look at everything in the worst light. Paul meets
scandals of this kind with courage and heroism, that all good men may learn to
abhor the treachery of those who had thus deserted the servant of Christ, when
he alone, at the peril of his life, was upholding the common cause; and that
they may not on that account give way, when they learn that Paul is not left
destitute of divine assistance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of whom are Phygellus and
Hermogenes</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He names two of them, who
were probably more celebrated than the rest, that he may shut the door against
their slanders; for it is customary with revolters and deserters from the
Christian warfare, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb17</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> in
order to excuse their own baseness, to forge as many accusations as they can
against the good and faithful ministers of the gospel. &#8220;Phygellus and
Hermogenes,&#8221; knowing that their cowardice was justly reckoned infamous by
believers, and that they were even condemned as guilty of base treachery, would
not have hesitated to load Paul with false accusations, and impudently to attack
his innocence. Paul, therefore, in order to take away all credit from their
tries, brands them with the mark which they deserve.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus also, in the present day, there are many who,
because they are not here admitted into the ministry, or are stripped of the
honor on account of their wickedness, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> or
because we do not choose to support them while they do nothing, or because they
have committed theft or fornication, are compelled to fly, and forthwith wander
through France and other countries, and, by throwing upon us all the accusations
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb19</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> that
they can, borrow from them an attestation of their innocence. And some brethren
are so silly as to accuse us of cruelty, if any of us paints such persons in
their true colors. But it were to be wished that all of them had their forehead
marked with a hot iron, that they might be recognized at first
sight.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>May the Lord grant
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>From this prayer we infer, that
the good offices done to the saints are not thrown away, even though they cannot
recompense them; for, when he prays to God to reward them, this carries in it
the force of a promise. At the same time, Paul testifies his gratitude, by
desiring that God will grant the remuneration, because he is unable to pay. What
if he had possessed abundant means of remuneration? Undoubtedly he would have
manifested that he was not ungrateful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the family of Onesiphorus, for
he often refreshed me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is worthy of
attention, that although he praises the kindness of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Onesiphorus
</i></font><font face="Palatino">alone, yet, on his account, he prays for mercy
to the whole
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>family</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Hence we infer, that &#8220;the blessing of God rests, not only on the head
of the righteous man,&#8221; but on all his house. So great is the love of God
toward his people, that it diffuses itself over all who are connected with
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And was not ashamed of my
chain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This is a proof, not only of his
liberality, but likewise of his zeal; seeing that he cheerfully exposed himself
to danger and to the reproach of men, in order to assist Paul.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
May the Lord grant to him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some explain
it thus: &#8212; &#8220;May God grant to him that he may find mercy with Christ
the Judge.&#8221; And, indeed, this is somewhat more tolerable than to interpret
that passage in the writings of Moses:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The Lord rained
fire from the Lord,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;012924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Genesis
29:24,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">as meaning, &#8212; &#8220;The Father rained from the
Son.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb20</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Yet it
is possible that strong feeling may have prompted Paul, as often happens, to
make a superfluous repetition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he may find mercy with the
Lord on that day</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb21</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
prayer shews us how much richer a recompense awaits those who, without the
expectation of an earthly reward, perform kind offices to the saints, than if
they received it immediately from the hand of men. And what does he pray for?
&#8220;That he may find mercy;&#8221; for he who hath been merciful to his
neighbors will receive such mercy from God to himself. And if this promise does
not powerfully animate and encourage us to the exercise of kindness, we are
worse than stupid. Hence it follows, also, that when God rewards us, it is not
on account of our merits or of any excellence that is in us; but that the best
and most valuable reward which he bestows upon us is, when he pardons us, and
shews himself to be, not a stern judge, but a kind and indulgent
Father.</font><br></div>

to keep, by time Spirit, that which was committed to him, so now he likewise
enjoins him &#8220;to be strengthened in grace.&#8221; By this expression he
intends to shake off sloth and indifference; for the flesh is so sluggish, that
even those who are endued with eminent gifts are found to slacken in the midst
of their course, if they be not frequently aroused.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some will say: &#8220;Of what use is it to exhort a
man to &#8216;be strong in grace,&#8217; unless free-will have something to do
in cooperation?&#8221; I reply, what God demands from us by his word he likewise
bestows by his Spirit, so that we are strengthened in the grace which he has
given to us. And yet the exhortations are not superfluous, because the Spirit of
God, teaching us inwardly, causes that they shall not sound in our ears
fruitlessly and to no purpose. Whoever, therefore, shall acknowledge that the
present exhortation could not have been fruitful without the secret power of the
Spirit, will never support free &#8212; will by means of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which is in Christ
Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is added for two reasons; to shew
that the grace comes from Christ alone, and from no other, and that no Christian
will be destitute of it; for, since there is one Christ common to all, it
follows that all are partakers of his grace, which is said to be in Christ,
because all who belong to Christ must have it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My

admission into the heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And which thou hast heard from me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again
shews how earnestly desirous he is to transmit sound doctrine to posterity; and
he exhorts Timothy, not only to preserve its shape and features, (as he formerly
did,) but likewise to hand it down to godly teachers, that, being widely spread,
it may take root in the hearts of many; for he saw that it would quickly perish
if it were not soon scattered by the ministry of many persons. And, indeed, we
see what Satan did, not long after the death of the Apostles; for, just as if
preaching had been buried for some centuries, he brought in innumerable
reveries, which, by their monstrous absurdity, surpassed the superstitions of
all the heathens. We need not wonder, therefore, if Paul, in order to guard
against an evil of such a nature and of such magnitude, earnestly desires that
his doctrines shall be committed to all godly ministers, who shall be qualified
to teach it. As if he had said, &#8212; &#8220;See that after my death there may
remain a sure attestation of my doctrine; and this will be, if thou not only
teach faithfully what thou hast learned from me, but take care that it be more
widely published by others; therefore, whomsoever thou shalt see fitted for that
work, commit to their trust this treasure.&#8221;</font><br></div>

which is common to all Christians, but on account of their pre &#8212; eminence,
as possessing a large measure of faith. We might even translate it
&#8220;<i>faithful</i> men;&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb22</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for
there are few who sincerely labor to preserve and perpetuate the remembrance of
the doctrine intrusted to them. Some are impelled by ambition, and that of
various kinds, some by covetousness, some by malice, and others are kept back by
the fear of dangers; and therefore extraordinary faithfulness is here
demanded.</font><br></div>

case of Timothy; but, because some might raise a controversy whether that which
Timothy taught had proceeded from Paul, or had been forged by himself, he
removes all doubt by this argument, that he did not speak secretly in a corner,
but that there were many alive who could testify that Timothy spoke nothing
which they had not formerly heard from the mouth of Paul. The doctrine of
Timothy would therefore be beyond suspicion, seeing that they had many
fellow-disciples, who could bear testimony to it. Hence we learn how greatly a
servant of Christ should labor to maintain and defend the purity of doctrine,
and not only while he lives, but as long as his care and labor can extend
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Do thou therefore endure afflictions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Not without strong necessity has he added this second exhortation; for they
who offer their obedience to Christ must be prepared for &#8220;enduring
afflictions;&#8221; and thus, without patient endurance of evils, there will
never be perseverance. And accordingly he adds, &#8220;as becomes a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good soldier of Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.&#8221; </i>By this term he means
that all who serve Christ are warriors, and that their condition as warriors
consists, not in inflicting evils, but rather in patience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These are matters on which it is highly necessary for
us to meditate. We see how many there are every day, that throw away their
spears, who formerly made a great show of velour. Whence does this arise?
Because they cannot become inured to the cross. First, they are so effeminate
that they shrink from warfare. Next, they do not know any other way of fighting
than to contend haughtily and fiercely with their adversaries; and they cannot
bear to learn what it is to</font><br></div>

use of the metaphor which he had borrowed from warfare. Yet, strictly speaking,
he formerly called Timothy &#8220;a soldier of Christ&#8221; metaphorically; but
now he compares profane warfare with spiritual and Christian warfare in this
sense. &#8220;The condition of military discipline is such, that as soon as a
soldier has enrolled himself under a general, he leaves his house and all his
affairs, and thinks of nothing but war; and in like manner, in order that we may
be wholly devoted to Christ, we must be free from all the entanglements of this
world.&#8221;</font><br></div>

comparison to the present subject, that every one who wishes to fight under
Christ must relinquish all the hindrances and employments of the world, and
devote himself unreservedly to the warfare. In short, let us remember the old
proverb, <i>Hoc age</i>, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb26</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> which
means, that in the worship of God, we ought to give such earnestness of
attention that nothing else should occupy our thoughts and feelings. The old

destroys Paul&#8217;s meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here Paul speaks to the pastors of the Church in the
person of Timothy. The statement is general, but is specially adapted to the
ministers of the word. First, let them see what things are inconsistent within
their office, that, freed from those things, they may follow Christ. Next, let
them see, each for himself, what it is that draws them away from Christ; that
this heavenly General may not have less authority over us than that which a
mortal man claims for himself over heathen soldiers who have enrolled under
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if any one
strive</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now speaks of perseverance,
that no man may think that he has done enough when he has been engaged in one or
two conflicts. He borrows a comparison from wrestlers, not one of whom obtains
the prize till he has been victorious in the end. Thus he says:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;In a race all run,
but one obtaineth the prize;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">run so

<div><font face="Palatino">If any man, therefore, wearied with the conflict,
immediately withdraw from the arena to enjoy repose, he will be condemned for
indolence instead of being crowned. Thus, because Christ wishes us to strive
during our whole life, he who gives way in the middle of the course deprives
himself of honor, even though he may have begun valiantly. To <i>strive lawfully
is </i>to pursue the contest in such a manner and to such an extent as the law
requires, that none may leave off before the time appointed.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remember that Jesus Christ,
being raised from the dead.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He expressly
mentions some part of his doctrine, which he wished to go down to posterity,
entire and uncorrupted. It is probable that he glances chiefly at that part
about which he was most afraid; as will also appear clearly from what follows,
when he comes to speak about the error of &#8220;Hymenaeus and Philetus,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550217&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:17;) for they denied the resurrection, of which we have a sure pledge
in this confession, when they falsely said that it was already
past.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">How necessary this admonition of Paul was, the
ancient histories shew; for Satan put forth all his strength, in order to
destroy this article of our faith. There being two parts of it, that Christ was
born &#8220;of the seed of David,&#8221; and that he rose from the dead;
immediately after the time of the Apostles, arose Marcion, who labored to
destroy the truth of the human nature in Christ; and afterwards he was followed
by the Manichaeans; and even, in the present day, this plague is still
spreading.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So far as relates to the resurrection, how many have
been employed, and with what diversified schemes, in laboring to overthrow the
hope of it! This attestation, therefore, means as much as if Paul had said,
&#8220;Let no one corrupt or falsify my gospel by slanders; I have thus taught,
I have thus preached, that Christ, Who was born a man of the seed of David, rose
from the dead.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to my
gospel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He calls it &#8220;his
gospel,&#8221; not that he professes to be the author but the minister of it.
Now, in the resurrection of Christ we all have a sure pledge of our own
resurrection. Accordingly, he who acknowledges that Christ has risen affirms
that the same thing will take place with us also; for Christ did not rise for
himself, but for us. The head must not be separated from his members. Besides,
in the resurrection of Christ is contained the fulfillment of our redemption and
salvation; for it is added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from
the dead</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Thus Christ, who was dead, arose.
Why? and for what purpose? Here we must come to ourselves, and here too is
manifested the power and fruit of both, namely, of his resurrection and of his
death; for we must always hold by this principle, that Scripture is not wont to
speak of these things coldly, and as matters of history, but makes indirect
reference to the fruit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of the seed of
David</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This clause not only asserts the
reality of human nature in Christ, but also claims for him the honor and name of
the Messiah. Heretics deny that Christ was a real man, others imagine that his
human nature descended from heaven, and others think that there was in him
nothing more than the appearance of a man. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Paul
exclaims, on the contrary, that he was &#8220;of the seed of David;&#8221; by
which he undoubtedly declares that he was a real man, the son of a human being,
that is, of Mary. This testimony is so express, that the more heretics labor to
get rid of it, the more do they discover their own impudence. The Jews and other
enemies of Christ deny that he is the person who was formerly promised; but Paul
affirms that he is the son of David, and that he is descended from that family
from which the Messiah ought to descend.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In which I am a
sufferer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is an anticipation, for
his imprisonment lessened the credit due to his gospel in the eyes of ignorant
people. He, therefore, acknowledges that, as to outward appearance, he was
imprisoned like a criminal; but adds, that his imprisonment did not hinder the
gospel from having free course; and not only so, but that what he suffers is
advantageous to the elect, because it tends to confirm them. Such is the
unshaken courage of the martyrs of Christ, when the consciousness of being
engaged in a good cause lifts them up above the world; so that, from a lofty
position, they look down with contempt, not only on bodily pains and agonies,
but on every kind of disgrace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, all godly persons ought to strengthen
themselves with this consideration, when they see the ministers of the gospel
attacked and outraged by adversaries, that they may not, on that account,
cherish less reverence for doctrine, but may give glory to God, by whose power
they see it burst through all the hindrances of the world. And, indeed, if we
were not excessively devoted to the flesh, this consolation alone must have been
sufficient for us in the midst of persecutions, that, if we are oppressed by the
cruelty of the wicked, the gospel is nevertheless extended and more widely
diffused; for, whatever they may attempt, so far are they from obscuring or
extinguishing the light of the gospel, that it burns the more brightly. Let us
therefore bear cheerfully, or at least patiently, to have both our body and our
reputation Shut up in prison, provided that the truth of God breaks through
those fetters, and is spread far and wide.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Wherefore I endure all things for the sake of the
elect</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>From the elect he shews, that his
imprisonment is so far from being a ground of reproach, that it is highly
profitable to the elect. When he says that he endures
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the sake of the
elect</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> this
demonstrates how much more he cares for the edification of the Church than for
himself; for he is prepared, not only to die, but even to be reckoned in the
number of wicked men, that he may promote the salvation of the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this passage Paul teaches the same doctrine as in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510124&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:24, where he says, that he</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;fills up what is
wanting in the sufferings of Christ, for his body, which is the
Church.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence the impudence of the Papists is abundantly
refuted, who infer from these words that the death of Paul was a satisfaction
for our sins; as if he claimed anything else for his death, than that it would
confirm the faith of the godly, for he immediately adds an exposition, by
affirming that the salvation of believers is found in Christ alone. But if any
of my readers wishes to see a more extended illustration of this subject, let
him consult my Commentary on the chapter which I have just now quoted &#8212;
the first of the Epistle to the Colossians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With eternal
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is the end of the salvation
which we obtain in Christ; for our salvation is to live to God, which salvation
begins with our regeneration, and is completed by our perfect deliverance, when
God takes us away from the miseries of this mortal life, and gathers us into his
kingdom. To this salvation is added the participation of heavenly, that is,
divine glory; and, therefore, in order to magnify the grace of Christ, he gave
to salvation the name of &#8220;eternal glory.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A faithful
saying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He makes a preface to the
sentiment which he is about to utter; because nothing is more opposite to the
feeling of the flesh, than that we must die in order to live, and that death is
the entrance into life; for we may gather from other passages, that Paul was
wont to make use of a preface of this sort, in matters of great importance, or
hard to be believed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If we die with him, we shall also
live with him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The general meaning is,
that we shall not be partakers of the life and glory of Christ, unless we have
previously died and been humbled with him; as he says, that all the elect
were</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;predestinated that
they might be conformed to his image.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450829&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
8:29.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is said both for exhorting and comforting
believers. Who is not excited by this exhortation, that we ought not to be
distressed on account of our afflictions, which shall have so happy a result?
The same consideration abates and sweetens all that is bitter in the cross;
because neither pains, nor tortures, nor reproaches, nor death ought to be
received by us with horror, since in these we share with Christ; more especially
seeing that all these things are the forerunners of a triumph.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By his example, therefore, Paul encourages all
believers to receive joyfully, for the name of Christ, those afflictions in
which they already have a taste of future glory. If this shocks our belief, and
if the cross itself so overpowers and dazzles our eyes, that we do not perceive
Christ in them, let us remember to present this shield, &#8220;It is a faithful
saying.&#8221; And, indeed, where Christ is present, we must acknowledge that
life and happiness are there. We ought, therefore, to believe firmly, and to
impress deeply on our hearts, this fellowship, that we do not die apart, but
along with Christ, in order that we may afterwards have life in common with him;
that we suffer with him, in order that we may be partakers of his glory. By
<i>death </i>he means all that outward mortification of which he speaks in
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If we deny him, he will also
deny us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>A threatening is likewise
added, for the purpose of shaking off sloth; for he threatens that they who,
through the dread of persecution, leave off the confession of his name, have no
part or lot with Christ. How unreasonable is it, that we should esteem more
highly the transitory life of this world than the holy and sacred name of the
Son of God ! And why should he reckon among his people those who treacherously
reject him? Here the excuse of weakness is of no value; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb35</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for, if
men did not willingly deceive themselves with vain flatteries, they would
constantly resist, being endued with the spirit of strength and courage. Their
base denial of Christ proceeds not only from weakness, but from unbelief;
because it is in consequence of being blinded by the allurement of the world,
that they do not at all perceive the life which is in the kingdom of God. But
this doctrine has more need of being meditated on than of being explained; for
the words of Christ are perfectly clear, </font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Whoever shall deny
me, him will I also deny.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It remains that every one consider with himself, that
this is no childish terror, but the judge seriously pronounces what will be
found, at the appointed time, to be true.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
If we are unbelieving, he remaineth
faithful</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The meaning is, that our base
desertion takes nothing from the Son of God or from his glory; because, having
everything in himself, he stands in no need of our confession. As if he had
said, &#8220;Let them desert Christ who will, yet they take nothing from him;
for when they perish, he remaineth unchanged.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He cannot deny
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is a still stronger
expression. &#8220;Christ is not like us, to swerve from his truth.&#8221; Hence
it is evident, that all who deny Christ are disowned by him. And thus he drives
away from wicked apostates the flatteries with which they soothe themselves;
because, being in the habit of changing their hue, according to circumstances,
they would willingly imagine that Christ, in like manner, assumes various forms,
and is liable to change; which Paul affirms to be impossible. Yet, at the same
time, we must firmly believe what I stated briefly on a former passage, that our
faith is founded on the eternal and unchangeable truth of Christ, in order that
it may not waver through the unsteadfastness or apostasy of
men.</font><br></div>

from this severity we learn how dangerous to the Church is that knowledge which

or &#8220;disputing about words,&#8221; is condemned by him. It is of no
advantage, and it is exceedingly hurtful, by disturbing weak minds. Although in
the version I have followed Erasmus, because it did not disagree with
Paul&#8217;s meaning yet I wish to in form my readers that Paul&#8217;s words
may be explained in this manner, &#8220;That which is useful for nothing.&#8221;
The Greek words are, </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv
oujde&lt;n crh&gt;simon</font><font face="Palatino">, and I read
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue"><i>crh&gt;simon</i></font><font face="Palatino">
in the accusative case, and not in the nominative. The style will thus flow more
agreeably; as if he had said, &#8220;Of what use is it, when no good comes from
it, but much evil? for the faith of many is subverted.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us remark, first, that, when a manner of teaching
does no good, for that single reason it is justly disapproved; for God does not
wish to indulge our curiosity, but to instruct us in a useful manner. Away with
all speculations, therefore, which produce no edification!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the second is much worse, when questions are
raised, which are not only unprofitable, but tend
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to the subversion of the
hearers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> I wish that this were attended
to by those who are always armed for fighting with the tongue, and who, in every
question are looking for grounds of quarreling, and who go so far as to lay
snares around every word or syllable. But they are carried in a wrong direction
by ambition, and sometimes by an almost fatal disease; which I have experienced
in some. What the Apostle says about
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>subverting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is shown, every day, by actual observation, to be perfectly true; for it is
natural, amidst disputes, to lose sight of the truth; and Satan avails himself
of quarrels as a presence for disturbing weak persons, and overthrowing their
faith.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Study to shew thyself to be
approved by God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Since all disputes
about doctrine arise from this source, that men are desirous to make a boast of
ingenuity before the world, Paul here applies the best and most excellent
remedy, when he commands Timothy to keep his eyes fixed on God; as if he had
said; &#8220;Some aim at the applause of a crowded assembly, but do thou study
to approve thyself and thy ministry to God.&#8221; And indeed there is nothing
that tends more to check a foolish eagerness for display, than to reflect that
we have to deal with God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A workman that doth not

<i>&#8220;</i>that ought not to blush.&#8221; I do not find fault with that
rendering, but prefer to explain it actively, &#8220;that doth not
blush;&#8221;, both because that is the more ordinary meaning of the word as
used by Greek writers, and because I consider it to agree better with the
present passage. There is an implied contrast. Those who disturb the Church by
contentions break out into that fierceness, because they are ashamed of being
overcome, and because they reckon it disgraceful that there should be anything
that they do not know. Paul, on the contrary, bids them appeal to the judgment
of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And first, he bids them be not lazy disputants, but
<i>workmen</i> By this term he indirectly reproves the foolishness of those who
so greatly torment themselves by doing nothing. Let us therefore be
&#8220;workmen&#8221; in building the Church, and let us be employed in the work
of God in such a manner that some fruit shall be seen then we shall have no
cause to &#8220;blush;&#8221; for, although in debating we be not equal to
talkative boasters, yet it will be enough that we excel them in the desire of
edification, in industry, in courage, and in the efficacy of doctrine. In short,
he bids Timothy labor diligently, that he may not be ashamed before God; whereas
ambitious men dread only this kind of shame, to lose nothing of their reputation
for acuteness or profound knowledge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Dividing aright the word of
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is a beautiful metaphor, and one
that skillfully expresses the chief design of teaching. &#8220;Since we ought to
be satisfied with the word of God alone, what purpose is served by having
sermons every day, or even the office of pastors? Has not every person an
opportunity of reading the Bible?&#8221; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb39</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> But
Paul assigns to teachers the duty of dividing or cutting, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb40</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as if a
father, in giving food to his children, were dividing the bread, by cutting it
into small pieces.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He advises Timothy to &#8220;cut aright,&#8221; lest,
when he is employed in cutting the surface, as unskillful people are wont to do,
he leave the pith and marrow untouched. Yet by this term I understand,
generally, an allotment of the word which is judicious, and which is well suited
to the profit of the hearers. Some mutilate it, others tear it, others torture
it, others break it in pieces, others, keeping by the outside, (as we have
said,) never come to the soul of doctrine. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb41</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> To all
these faults he contrasts time &#8220;dividing aright,&#8221; that is, the
manner of explaining which is adapted to edification; for that is the rule by
which we must try all interpretation of Scripture.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And their word will eat as a
gangrene</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have been told by Benedict
Textor, a physician, that this passage is badly translated by Erasmus, who, out
of two diseases quite different from each other, has made but one disease; for,
instead of &#8220;gangrene,&#8221; he has used the word &#8220;cancer:&#8221;
Now Galen, in many passages throughout his writings, and especially where he
lays down definitions in his small work &#8220;On unnatural swellings,&#8221;
distinguishes the one from the other. Paul Aegineta, too, on the authority of
Galen, thus in his sixth book defines a &#8220;cancer;&#8221; that it is
&#8220;an unequal swelling, with inflated extremities, loathsome to the sight,
of a leaden color, and unaccompanied by pain.&#8221; Next, he enumerates two
kinds, as other physicians do; for he says that some &#8220;cancers&#8221; are
concealed and have no ulcer; while others, in which there is a preponderance of
the black bile from which they originate, are ulcerous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Of the &#8220;gangrene,&#8221; on the other hand,
Galen, both in the small work already quoted, and in his second book to Glauco,
Aetius in his fourteenth book, and the same &AElig;gineta in his fourth book,
speak to the following effect; that it proceeds from great phlegmons or
inflammations, if they fall violently on any member, so that the part which is
destitute of heat and vital energy tends to destruction. If that part be quite
dead, the Greek writers call the disease
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sfa&gt;kelov</font><font face="Palatino">
the Latins <i>sideratio, </i>and the common people call it St. Anthony&#8217;s
fire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I find, indeed, that Cornelius Celsius draws the
distinction in this manner, that &#8220;cancer &#8220;is the genus, and
&#8220;gangrene &#8220;the species; but his mistake is plainly refuted from
numerous passages in the works of physicians of high authority. It is possible,
also, that he was led astray by the similarity between the Latin words
&#8220;cancer&#8221; and &#8220;gangr&aelig;na.&#8221; But in the Greek words
there can be no mistake of that kind; for
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ka&gt;rkinov</font><font face="Palatino">
is the name which corresponds to the Latin word &#8220;cancer,&#8221; and
denotes both the animal which we call a crab, and the disease; while grammarians
think that
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ga&gt;ggraina</font><font face="Palatino">
is derived </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpo tou~
grai&gt;nein</font><font face="Palatino"> which means &#8220;to eat.&#8221; We
must therefore abide by the word &#8220;gangrene,&#8221; which Paul uses, and
which best agrees with what he says as to &#8220;eating&#8221; or
&#8220;consuming.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We have now explained the etymology; but all
physicians pronounce the nature of the disease to be such, that, if it be not
very speedily counteracted, it spreads to the adjoining parts, and penetrates
even to the bones, and does not cease to consume, till it has killed the man.
Since, therefore, &#8220;gangrene&#8221; is immediately followed by
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ne&gt;krwsiv</font><font face="Palatino">)
mortification, which rapidly infects the rest of the members till it end in the
universal destruction of the body; to this mortal contagion Paul elegantly
compares false doctrines; for, if you once give entrance to them, they spread
till they have completed the destruction of the Church. The contagion being so
destructive, we must meet it early, and not wait till it has gathered strength
by progress; for there will then be no time for rendering assistance. The
dreadful extinction of the gospel among the Papists arose from this cause, that,
through the ignorance or slothfulness of the pastors, corruptions prevailed long
and without control, in consequence of which time purity of doctrine was
gradually destroyed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of the number of whom are Hymenaeus
and Philetus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He points out with the
finger the plagues themselves, that all may be on their guard against them; for,
if those persons who aim at the ruin of the whole Church are permitted by us to
remain concealed, then to some extent we give them power to do injury. it is
true that we ought to conceal the faults of brethren, but only those faults the
contagion of which is not widely spread. But where there is danger to many, our
dissimulation is cruel, if we do not expose in proper time the hidden evil. And
why? Is it proper, for the sake of sparing one individual, that a hundred or a
thousand persons shall perish through my silence? Besides, Paul did not intend
to convey this information to Timothy alone, but he intended to proclaim to all
ages and to all nations the wickedness of the two men, in order to shut the door
against their base and ruinous doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b><i>.

have erred, saying that the resurrection is already
past</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>After having said that they had
departed from &#8220;the truth,&#8221; he specifies their error, which consisted
in this, that they gave out that &#8220;the resurrection was already
past.&#8221; In doing this, they undoubtedly contrived a sort of allegorical
resurrection, which has also been attempted in this age by some filthy dogs. By
this trick Satan overthrows that fundamental article of our faith concerning the
resurrection of the flesh. Being an old and worthless dream, and being so
severely condemned by Paul, it ought to give us the less uneasiness. But when we
learn that, from the very beginning of the gospel, <i>the faith of some was
subverted, </i>such an example ought to excite us to diligence, that we may
seize an early opportunity of driving away from ourselves and others so
dangerous a plague; for, in consequence of the strong inclination of men to
vanity, there is no absurdity so monstrous that there shall not be some men who
shall lend their ear to it.</font><br></div>

experience, how much scandal is produced by the apostasy of those who at one
time professed the same faith with ourselves. This is especially the case with
those who were extensively known, and who had a more brilliant reputation than
others; for, if any of the common people apostatize, we are not so deeply
affected by it. But they who in the ordinary opinion of men held a distinguished
rank, having been formerly regarded as pillars, cannot fall in this manner,
without involving others in the same ruin with themselves; at least, if their
faith has no other support. This is the subject which Paul has now in hand; for
he declares that there is no reason why believers should lose heart, although
they see those persons fall, whom they were wont to reckon the
strongest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He makes use of this consolation, that the levity or
treachery of men cannot hinder God from preserving his Church to the last. And
first he reminds us of the election of God, which he metaphorically calls
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a
foundation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> expressing by this word the
firm and enduring constancy of it. Yet all this tends to prove the certainty of
our salvation, if we are of the elect of God. As if he had said, &#8220;The
elect do not depend on changing events, but rest on a solid and immovable
foundation; because their salvation is in the hand of God.&#8221; For
as</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;every plant which

<div><font face="Palatino">First of all, therefore, let us hold this principle,
that, amidst so great weakness of our flesh,, the elect are nevertheless beyond
the reach of danger, because they do not stand by their own strength, but are
founded on God. And if foundations laid by the hand of men have so much
firmness, how much more solid will be that which has been laid by God himself? I
am aware that some refer this to doctrine, &#8220;Let no man judge of the truth
of it from the unsteadfastness of men;&#8221; but it may easily be inferred from
the context, that Paul speaks of the Church of God, or of the
elect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having this

or impress, I have translated it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sigillum

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord knoweth who are

<i>seal, </i>reminds us, that we must not judge, by our own opinion, whether the
number of the elect is great or small; for what God hath sealed he wishes to be,
in some respect, shut up from us. Besides, if it is the prerogative of God to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know who are

them are often unknown to us, or even if we fall into mistakes in making the

will not be shaken, as if it depended on men; nor shall we be even dismayed, as
often happens, when unexpected events take place. Secondly, being convinced that

reprobate go away into their own lot, to which they were appointed; because
there will remain the full number, with which God is satisfied. Therefore,
whenever any sudden change happens among men, contrary to our opinion and
expectation, let us immediately call to remembrance, &#8220;The Lord knoweth who

and demonstrates by a comparison, that when we see some who, for a time, made a
show of distinguished piety and zeal, fall back shamefully, so far from being
troubled on account of it, we ought rather to acknowledge that this arrangement
is seemly and adapted to the providence of God. Who will find fault with a large
house, in which there is abundance of every kind of furniture, and which
accordingly contains not only those articles which are fitted for purposes of
display, but likewise those which. are of a meaner sort? This diversity is even
ornamental, if, while the side-board and the table glitter with gold and silver,
the kitchen is furnished with vessels of wood and of earthenware. Why then
should we wonder if God, the head of the family, so rich and so abundantly
supplied with everything, has in this world, as in a large house, various kinds
of men, as so many parts of furniture?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Commentators are not agreed, however, whether the
&#8220;great house&#8221; means the Church alone, or the whole world. And,
indeed, the context rather leads us to understand it as denoting the Church; for
Paul is not now reasoning about strangers, but about God&#8217;s own family. Yet
what he says is true generally, and in another passage the same Apostle extends
it to the whole world; that is, at
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450921&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:21, where he includes all the reprobate under the same word that is here used.
We need not greatly dispute, therefore, if any person shall apply it simply to
the world. Yet there can be no doubt that Paul&#8217;s object is to shew that we
ought not to think it strange, that bad men are mixed with the good, which
happens chiefly in the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
If any man shall cleanse himself from these</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>If the reprobate are &#8220;vessels for dishonor,&#8221; they have that
dishonor confined to themselves, but they do not disfigure the house, or bring
any disgrace on the head of the family, who, while he has a variety of articles
of furniture, appropriates each vessel to its proper use. But let us learn, by
their example, to apply them to better and worthier uses; for in the reprobate,
as in mirrors, we perceive how detestable is the condition of man, if he do not
sincerely promote the glory of God. Such examples, therefore, afford to us good
ground for exhortation to devote ourselves to a holy and blameless
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are many who misapply this passage, for the
sake of proving that what Paul elsewhere
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

within the power of &#8220;him that willeth and him that runneth.&#8221; This is
exceedingly frivolous; for Paul does not here argue about the election of men,
in order to shew what is the cause of it, as he does in the ninth chapter of the
Epistle to the Romans (Romans 9); but only means that we are unlike wicked men,
whom we perceive to have been born to their perdition. It is consequently
foolish to draw an inference from these words, about the question whether it is
in a man&#8217;s power to place himself in the number of the children of God,
and to be the author of his own adoption. That is not the present question. Let
this short warning suffice against those who bid a man cause himself to be
predestinated; as if Paul enjoined men to do what they must have done before
they were born, and even before the foundations of the world were
laid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Others, who infer from these words that free-will is
sufficient for preparing a man, that he may be fit and qualified for obeying
God, do not at first sight appear to be so absurd as the former, yet there is no
solidity in what they advance. The Apostle enjoins that men who desire to
consecrate themselves to the Lord cleanse themselves from the pollution of
wicked men; and throughout the Scriptures God gives the same injunction; for we
find nothing here but what we have seen in many passages of Paul&#8217;s
writings, and especially in the Second Epistle to the
Corinthians,</font><br></div>

goes before; for, after mentioning useless questions, and having been led by
this circumstance to censure Hymenaeus and Philetus, whose ambition and vain
curiosity had led them away from the right faith, he again exhorts Timothy to
keep at a distance from so dangerous a plague kind for this purpose he advises
him to avoid &#8220;youthful desires.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By this term he does not mean either a propensity to
uncleanness, or any of those licentious courses or sinful lusts in which young
men frequently indulge, but any impetuous passions to which the excessive warmth
of that age is prone. If some debate has arisen, young men more quickly grow
warm, are more easily irritated, more frequently blunder through want of
experience, and rush forward with greater confidence and rashness, than men of
riper age. With good reason, therefore, does Paul advise Timothy, being a young
man, to be strictly on his guard against the vices of youth, which otherwise
might easily drive him to useless disputes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But follow

opposite feelings, that they may restrain his mind from breaking out into any
youthful excesses; as if he had said, &#8220;These are the things to which thou
oughtest to give thy whole attention, and thy whole exertions.&#8221; And first
he mentions <i>righteousness,</i> that is, the right way of living; and
afterwards he adds <i>faith</i> and <i>love, </i>in which it principally
consists. <i>Peace </i>is closely connected with the present subject; for they
who delight in the questions which he forbids must be contentious and fond of
debating.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With all that call on the

which a part is taken for the whole, &#8220;calling on God&#8221; is taken
generally for worship, if it be not thought preferable to refer it to
profession. But this is the chief part of the worship of God, and for that
reason &#8220;calling on God&#8221; often signifies the whole of religion or the
worship of God. But when he bids him seek &#8220;peace with all that call upon
the Lord,&#8221; it is doubtful whether, on the one hand, he holds out all
believers as an example, as if he had said, that he ought to pursue this in
common with all the true worshippers of God, or, on the other hand, he enjoins
Timothy to cultivate peace with them. The latter meaning appears to be more
suitable.</font><br></div>

the world entertains for silly trifles, and how eagerly it runs after them. That
an ambition to please may not urge us to seek the favor of men by such display,
let us always remember this remarkable testimony of Paul, that questions, which
are held in high estimation, are nevertheless foolish, because they are
unprofitable.</font><br></div>

ought to shun them.&#8221; And if superfluous questions ought to be avoided on
this single ground, that it is unseemly for a servant of God to fight, how
impudently do they act, who have the open effrontery of claiming applause for
raising incessant controversies? Let the theology of the Papists now come forth;
what else will be found in it than the art of disputing and fighting? The more

and for that reason he adds, &#8220;bearing with them,&#8221; at the same time
pointing out the reason why it is necessary; namely, because a godly teacher
ought even to try whether it be possible for him to bring back to the right path
obstinate and rebellious persons, which cannot be done without the exercise of
gentleness.</font><br></div>

</i>This expression, &#8220;If sometime,&#8221; or &#8220;If perhaps,&#8221;
points out the difficulty of the case, as being nearly desperate or beyond hope.
Paul therefore means that even towards the most unworthy we must exercise
<i>meekness; </i>and although at first there be no appearance of having gained
advantage, still we must make the attempt. For the same reason he mentions that
&#8220;God will grant it.&#8221; Since the conversion of a man is in the hand of
God, who knows whether they who today appear to be unteachable shall be suddenly
changed by the power of God, into other men? Thus, whoever shall consider that
repentance is the gift and work of God, will cherish more earnest hope, and,
encouraged by this confidence, will bestow more toil and exertion for the
instruction of rebels. We should view it thus, that our duty is, to be employed
in sowing and watering, and, while we do this, we must look for the increase
from God.

the actual repentance of those who for a time were disobedient to God; for Paul
declares that it begins with &#8220;the knowledge of the truth.&#8221; By this
he means that the understanding of man is blinded, so long as it stands out
fiercely against God and his doctrine.</font><br></div>

deliverance from the bondage of the devil; for unbelievers are so intoxicated by
Satan, that, being asleep, they do not perceive their distresses. On the other
hand, when the Lord shines upon us by the light of his truth, he wakens us out
of that deadly sleep, breaks asunder the snares by which we were bound, and,
having removed all obstacles, trains us to obedience to him.</font><br></div>

when the devil has so great power over us, that he drags us, as captive slaves,
here and there at his pleasure. Yet such is the condition of all those whom the
pride of their heart draws away from subjection to God. And this tyrannical
dominion of Satan we see plainly, every day, in the reprobate; for they would
not rush with such fury and with brutal violence into every kind of base and
disgraceful crimes, if they were not drawn by the unseen power of Satan. That is

<div><font face="Palatino">Such examples admonish us to keep ourselves carefully
under the yoke of Christ, and to yield ourselves to be governed by his Holy
Spirit. And yet a captivity of this nature does not excuse wicked men, so that
they do not sin, because it is by the instigation of Satan that they sin; for,
although their being carried along so resistlessly to that which is evil
proceeds from the dominion of Satan, yet they do nothing by constraint, but are
inclined with their whole heart to that to which Satan drives them. The result
is, that their captivity is voluntary.</font><br></div>

this</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. By </i>this prediction he intended
still more to sharpen his diligence; for, when matters go on to our wish, we
become more careless; but necessity urges us keenly. Paul, therefore informs
him, that the Church will be subject to terrible diseases, which will require in
the pastors uncommon fidelity, diligence, watchfulness, prudence, and unwearied
constancy; as if he enjoined Timothy to prepare for arduous and deeply anxious
contests which awaited him. And hence we learn, that, so far from giving way, or
being terrified, on account of any difficulties whatsoever, we ought, on the
contrary. to arouse our hearts for resistance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the last
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Under &#8220;the last days,&#8221;
he includes the universal condition of the Christian Church. Nor does he compare
his own age with ours, but, on the contrary, informs Timothy what will be the
future condition of the kingdom of Christ; for many imagined some sort of
condition that would be absolutely peaceful, and free from any annoyance. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb48</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
short, he means that there will not be, even under the gospel, such a state of
perfection, that all vices shall be banished, and virtues of every kind shall
flourish; and that therefore the pastors of the Christian Church will have quite
as much to do with wicked and ungodly men as the prophets and godly priests had
in ancient times. Hence it follows, that there is no time for idleness or for
repose.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For men will
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is proper to remark, first, in
what he makes the hardship of those &#8220;dangerous&#8221; or
&#8220;troublesome&#8221; times to consist; not in war, nor in famine, nor in
diseases, nor in any calamities or inconveniences to which the body is incident,
but in the wicked and depraved actions of men. And, indeed, nothing is so
distressingly painful to godly men, and to those who truly fear God, as to
behold such corruptions of morals; for, as there is nothing which they value
more highly than the glory of God, so they cannot but suffer grievous anguish
when it is attacked or despised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Secondly, it ought to be remarked, who are the
persons of whom he speaks. They whom he briefly describes are not external
enemies, who openly assail the name of Christ, but domestics, who wish to be
reckoned among the members of the Church; for God wishes to try his Church to
such an extent as to carry within her bosom such plagues, though she abhors to
entertain them. So then, if in the present day many whom we justly abhor are
mingled within us, let us learn to groan patiently under that burden, when we
are informed that this is the lot of the Christian Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Next, it is wonderful that those persons, whom Paul
pronounces to be guilty of so many and so aggravated acts of wickedness, can
keep up the appearance of piety, as he also declares. But daily experience shows
that we ought not to regard this as so wonderful; for such is the amazing
audacity and wickedness of hypocrites, that, even in excusing the grossest
crimes, they are excessively impudent, after having once learned falsely to
shelter themselves under the name of God. In ancient times, how many crimes
abounded in the life of the Pharisees? And yet, as if they had been pure from
every stain, they enjoyed a reputation of eminent holiness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Even in the present day, although the lewdness of the
Popish clergy is such that it stinks in the nostrils of the whole world, still,
in spite of their wickedness, they do not cease to arrogate proudly to
themselves all the rights and titles of saints. Accordingly, when Paul says that
hypocrites, though they are chargeable with the grossest vices, nevertheless
deceive under a mask of piety, this ought not to appear strange, when we have
examples before our eyes. And, indeed, the world deserves to be deceived by
those wicked scoundrels, when it either despises or cannot endure true holiness.
Besides, Paul enumerates those vices which are not visible at first sight, and
which are even the ordinary attendants of pretended holiness. Is there a
hypocrite who is not proud, who is not a lover of himself, who is not a despiser
of others, who is not fierce and cruel, who is not treacherous? But all these
are concealed from the eyes of men. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb49</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To spend time in explaining every word would be

that
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">filauti&gt;a</font><font face="Bwgrkl">,</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>self-love, </i>which is put first, may be regarded as the source from which
flow all the vices that follow afterwards. He who loveth himself claims a
superiority in everything, despises all others, is cruel, indulges in
covetousness, treachery, anger, rebellion against parents, neglect of what is
good, and such like. As it was the design of Paul to brand false prophets with
such marks, that they might be seen and known by all; it is our duty to open our
eyes, that we may see those who are pointed out with the
finger.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>From those turn

Paul does not speak of a distant posterity, nor foretell what would happen many
ages afterwards; but that, by pointing out present evils, he applies to his own
age what he had said about &#8220;the last times;&#8221; for how could Timothy
&#8220;turn away&#8221; from those who were not to arise till many centuries
afterwards? So then, from the very beginning of the gospel, the Church must have
begun to be affected by such corruptions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of those are they who creep
into families</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> You would say, that here
Paul intentionally draws a lively picture of the order of monks. But without
saying a single word about monks, those marks by which Paul distinguishes false
and pretended teachers are sufficiently clear; creeping into houses, snares for
catching silly women, mean flattery, imposing upon people by various
superstitions. These marks it is proper to observe carefully, if we wish to
distinguish between useless drones and faithful ministers of Christ. These
former are here marked by so black a coal, that it is of no use for them to
shuffle. To &#8220;creep into families&#8221; means to enter stealthily, or to
seek an entrance by cunning methods.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And lead captive silly women laden
with sins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now, he speaks of
&#8220;women&#8221; rather than men, because the former are more liable to be
led astray in this manner: He says that they &#8220;are led captive,&#8221;
because false prophets of this sort, through various tricks, gain their ear,
partly by prying curiously into all their affairs, and partly by flattery. And
this is what he immediately adds, &#8220;laden with sins;&#8221; for, if they
had not been bound by the chain of a bad conscience, they would not have allowed
themselves to be led away, in every possible manner, at the will of
others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By various sinful
desires</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> I consider &#8220;sinful
desires&#8221; to denote generally those foolish and light desires by which
women, who do not seek God sincerely, and yet wish to be reckoned religious and
holy, are carried away. There is no end of the methods adopted by them, when,
departing from a good conscience, they are constantly assuming new masks.
Chrysostom is more disposed to refer it to disgraceful and immodest desires;
but, when I examine the context, I prefer the former exposition; for it
immediately follows &#8212; </font><br></div>

desires, of which he now speaks, is when, having nothing solid in themselves,
they are tossed about in all directions. They &#8220;learn,&#8221; he says, as
people do who are under the influence of curiosity, and with a restless mind,
but in such a manner as never to arrive at any certainty or truth. It is ill
&#8212; conducted study, and widely different from knowledge. And yet such
persons think themselves prodigiously wise; but what they know is nothing, so
long as they do not hold the truth, which is the foundation of all
knowledge.</font><br></div>

resisted Moses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This comparison confirms
what I have already said about the &#8220;last times;&#8221;, for he means that
the same thing happens to us under the gospel, which the Church experienced
almost from her very commencement, or at least since the law was published. In
like manner the Psalmist also speaks largely about the unceasing battles of the
Church.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Often did they

129:1,3)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul reminds us, that we need not wonder if
adversaries rise up against Christ to oppose his gospel, since Moses likewise
had those who contended with him; for these examples drawn from a remote
antiquity yield us strong consolation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is generally believed; that the two who are
mentioned, &#8220;Jannes and Jambres,&#8221; were magicians put forward by
Pharaoh. But from what source Paul learned their names is doubtful, except that
it is probable, that many things relating to those histories were handed down,
the memory of which God never permitted to perish. It is also possible that in
Paul&#8217;s time there were commentaries on the prophets that gave more fully
those narratives which Moses touches very briefly. However that may be, it is
not at random that he calls them by their names. The reason why there were two
of them may be conjectured to have been this, that, because the Lord had raised
up for his people two leaders, Moses and Aaron, Pharaoh determined to place
against them the like number of magicians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
But they shall not proceed further</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He
encourages Timothy for the contest, by the confident hope of victory; for,
although false teachers give him annoyance, he promises that they shall be,
within a short time, disgracefully ruined. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb50</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Yet the
event does not agree with this promise; and the Apostle appears to make a
totally different declaration, a little afterwards, when he says that they will
grow worse and worse. Nor is there any force in the explanation given by
Chrysostom, that they will grow worse every day, but will do no injury to any
person; for he expressly adds, &#8220;deceived and deceiving;&#8221; and,
indeed, the truth of this is proved by experience. It is more correct to say,
that he looked at them in various aspects; for the affirmation, that they will
not make progress, is not universal; but he only means, that the Lord will
discover their madness to many whom they had, at first, deceived by their
enchantments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For their folly shall be manifest
to all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> it is by a figure of speech, in
which the whole is taken for a part. And, indeed, they who are most successful
in deceiving do, at first, make great boasting, and obtain loud applause; and,
in short, it appears as if nothing were beyond their power. But speedily their
tricks vanish into air; for the Lord opens the eyes of many, so that they begin
to see what was concealed from them for a time. Yet never is the
&#8220;folly&#8221; of false prophets discovered to such an extent as to be
known to all. Besides, no sooner is one error driven away than new errors
continually spring up.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Both admonitions are therefore necessary. That godly
teachers may not despair, as if it were in vain for them to make war against
error, they must be instructed about the prosperous success which the Lord will
give to his doctrine. But that they may not think, on the other hand, that they
are discharged from future service, after one or two battles, they must be
reminded that there will always be new occasion for fighting. But on this second
point we shall speak afterwards; at present, let it suffice us, that he holds
out to Timothy the sure hope of a successful issue, that he may be time more
encouraged to fight, And he confirms this by the example which he had quoted;
for, as the truth of God prevailed against the tricks of the magicians, so he
promises that the doctrine of the gospel shall be victorious against every kind
of errors that may be invented.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But thou hast
followed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb51</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> In
order to urge Timothy, he employs this argument also, that he is not an ignorant
and untaught soldier, because Paul carried him through a long course of
training. Nor does he speak of doctrine only; for those things which he likewise
enumerates add much weight, and he gives to us, in this sentence, a very lively
picture of a good teacher, as one who does not, by words only, train and
instruct his disciples, but, so to speak, opens his very breast to them, that
they may know, that whatever he teaches, he teaches sincerely. This is what is
implied in the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>purpose</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>He likewise adds other proofs of sincere and unfeigned affection, such as
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith, mildness, love,
patience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Such were the early
instructions which had been imparted to Timothy in the school of Paul. Yet he
does not merely bring to remembrance what he had learned from him, but bears
testimony to his former life, that in this manner he may urge him to
perseverance; for he praises him as an imitator of his own virtues; as if he had
said, &#8220;Thou hast been long accustomed to follow my instructions; I ask
nothing more than that thou shouldst go on as thou hast begun.&#8221; It is his
wish, however; that the example of his &#8220;faith, love, and patience&#8221;
should be constantly before the eyes of Timothy; and for that reason he dwells
chiefly on his persecutions, which were best known to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But out of them all the Lord
delivered me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is a consolation which
mitigates the bitterness of afflictions, that they always have a happy and
joyful end. If it be objected, that the success of which he boasts is not always
visible, I acknowledge that this is true, so far as relates to the feeling of
the flesh; for Paul had not yet been delivered. But when God sometimes delivers
us, he testifies, in this manner, that he is present with us, and will always be
present; for from the feeling, or actual knowledge, of present aid, our
confidence ought to be extended to the future. The meaning, therefore, is as if
he had said, &#8220;Thou hast known by experience that God hath never forsaken
me, so that thou hast no right to hesitate to follow my
example.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
And all who wish to live a godly life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb52</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Having
mentioned his own persecutions, he likewise adds now, that nothing has happened
to him which does not await all the godly. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb53</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And he
says this, partly that believers may prepare themselves for submitting to this
condition, and partly that good men may not view him with suspicion on account
of the persecutions which he endures from wicked persons; as it frequently
happens that the distresses to which men are subjected lead to unfavorable
opinions concerning them; for he whom men regard with aversion is immediately
declared by the common people to be hated by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By this general statement, therefore, Paul classes
himself with the children of God, and, at the same time, exhorts all the
children of God to prepare for enduring persecutions; for, if this condition is
laid down for &#8220;all who wish to live a godly life in Christ,&#8221; they
who wish to be exempt from persecutions must necessarily renounce Christ. In
vain shall we endeavor to detach Christ from his cross; for it may be said to be
natural that the world should hate Christ even in his members. Now hatred is
attended by cruelty, and hence arise persecutions, In short, let us know that we
are Christians on this condition, that we shall be liable to many tribulations
and various contests.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is asked, Must all men be martyrs? for it is
evident that there have been many godly persons who have never suffered
banishment, or imprisonment, or flight, or any kind of persecution. I reply, it
is not always in one way that Satan persecutes the servants of Christ. But yet
it is absolutely unavoidable that all of them shall have the world for their
enemy in some form or other, that their faith may be tried and their
steadfastness proved; for Satan, who is the continual enemy of Christ, will
never suffer any one to be at peace during his whole life; and there will always
be wicked men that are thorns in our sides. Moreover, as soon as zeal for God is
manifested by a believer, it kindles the rage of all ungodly men; and, although
they have not a drawn sword, yet they vomit out their venom, either by
murmuring, or by slander, or by raising a disturbance, or by other methods.
Accordingly, although they are not exposed to the same assaults, and do not
engage in the same battles, yet they have a warfare in common, and shall never
be wholly at peace and exempt from persecutions.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But wicked men and
impostors</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> This is the most bitter of
all persecutions, when we see wicked men, with their sacrilegious hardihood,
with their blasphemies and errors, gathering strength. Thus Paul says elsewhere,
that Ishmael persecuted Isaac, not by the sword, but by mockery
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480429&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:29.) Hence also we may conclude, that in the preceding verse, it was not
merely one kind of persecution that was described, but that the Apostle spoke,
in general terms, of those distresses which the children of God are compelled to
endure, when they contend for the glory of their Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I stated, a little before, in what respect they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shall grow worse and
worse</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for he foretells not only that
they will make obstinate resistance, but that they will succeed in injuring and
corrupting others. One worthless person will always be more effectual in
destroying, than ten faithful teachers in building, though they labor with all
their might. Nor are there ever wanting the tares which Satan sows for injuring
the pure corn; and even when we think that false prophets are driven away,
others continually spring up in other directions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Again, as to the power of doing injury, 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb54</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> it is
not because falsehood, in its own nature, is stronger than truth, or that the
tricks of Satan exceed the energy of the Spirit of God; but because men, being
naturally inclined to vanity and errors, embrace far more readily what agrees
with their natural disposition, and also because, being blinded by a righteous
vengeance of God, they are led, as captive slaves, at the will of Satan. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb55</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> And the
chief reason, why the plague of wicked doctrines is so efficacious, is, that the
ingratitude of men deserves that it should be so. It is highly necessary for
godly teachers to be reminded of this, that they may be prepared for
uninterrupted warfare, and may not be discouraged by delay, or yield to the
haughtiness and insolence of adversaries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But as for thee, continue in
those things which thou hast learned</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
Although wickedness prevail, and push its way forward, he advises Timothy
nevertheless to stand firm. And undoubtedly this is the actual trial of faith,
when we offer unwearied resistance to all the contrivances of Satan, and do not
alter our course for every wind that blows, but remain steadfast on the truth of
God, as on a sure anchor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Knowing from whom thou hast learned
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is said for the purpose of
commending the certainty of the doctrine; for, if any one has been wrong
instructed, he ought not to persevere in it. On the contrary, we ought to
unlearn all that we have learned apart from Christ, if we wish to be his
disciples; as, for example, it is the commencement of our pure instruction in
the faith to reject and forget all the instruction of Popery. The Apostle
therefore does not enjoin Timothy to defend indiscriminately the doctrine which
has been delivered to him, but only that which he knows to be truth; by which he
means, that he must make a selection. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb56</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Besides, he does not claim this as a private individual, that what he has taught
shall be reckoned to be a divine revelation; but he boldly asserts his own
authority to Timothy, who, he was aware, knew that his fidelity and his calling
had been proved. And if he was fully convinced that he had been taught by an
Apostle of Christ, he concluded that therefore it was not a doctrine of man, but
of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage teaches us, that we ought to be as
careful to guard against obstinacy in matters that are uncertain, (such as all
the doctrines of men are,) as to hold within unshaken firmness the truth <i>of
</i>God. Besides, we learn from it, that faith ought to be accompanied by
prudence, that it may distinguish between the word of God and the word of men,
so that we may not adopt at random everything that is brought forward. Nothing
is more inconsistent with the nature of faith than light credulity, which allows
us to embrace everything indiscriminately, whatever it may be, and from
whomsoever it proceeds; because it is the chief foundation of faith, to know
that it has God for its author.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And which have been intrusted to
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb57</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When he
adds, that the doctrine had been intrusted to Timothy, this gives
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">au]xhsin</font><font face="Palatino">)
additional force to the exhortation; for to &#8220;commit a thing in
trust&#8221; is something more than merely to deliver it. Now Timothy had not
been taught as one of the common people, but in order that he might faithfully
deliver into the hands of others what he had received.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that from (thy)
childhood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This was also no ordinary
addition, that he had been accustomed, from his infancy, to the reading of the
Scripture; for this long habit may make a man much more strongly fortified
against every kind of deception. It was therefore a judicious caution observed
in ancient times, that those who were intended for the ministry of the word
should be instructed, from their infancy, in the solid doctrine of godliness,
that, when they came to the performance of their office, they might not be
untried apprentices. And it ought to be reckoned a remarkable instance of the
kindness of God, if any person, from his earliest years, has thus acquired a
knowledge of the Scriptures.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which are able to make thee wise
unto salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is a very high
commendation of the Holy Scriptures, that we must not seek anywhere else the
wisdom which is sufficient for salvation; as the next verse also expresses more
fully. But he states, at the same time, what we ought to seek in the Scripture;
for the false prophets also make use of it as a pretext; and therefore, in order
that it may be useful to us for salvation, it is necessary to understand the
right use of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Through faith, which is in Christ
Jesus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> What if any one give his whole
attention to curious questions? What if he adhere to the mere letter of the law,
and do not seek Christ? What if he pervert the natural meaning by inventions
that are foreign to it? For this reason he directs us to the faith of Christ as
the design, and therefore as the sum, of the Scriptures; for on faith depends
also what immediately follows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All
Scripture</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>or,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the whole of
Scripture</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>though it makes little
difference as to the meaning. He follows out that commendation which he had
glanced at briefly. First, he commends the Scripture on account of its
authority; and secondly, on account of the utility which springs from it. In
order to uphold the authority of the Scripture, he declares that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it is divinely
inspired</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for, if it be so, it is beyond
all controversy that men ought to receive it with reverence. This is a principle
which distinguishes our religion from all others, that we know that God hath
spoken to us, and are fully convinced that the prophets did not speak at their
own suggestion, but that, being organs of the Holy Spirit, they only uttered
what they had been commissioned from heaven to declare. Whoever then wishes to
profit in the Scriptures, let him first of all, lay down this as a settled
point, that tine Law and the Prophets are not a doctrine delivered according to
the will and pleasure of men, but dictated by the Holy Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If it be objected, &#8220;How can this be
known?&#8221; I answer, both to disciples and to teachers, God is made known to
be the author of it by the revelation of the same Spirit. Moses and the prophets
did not utter at random what we have received from their hand, but, speaking at
the suggestion of God, they boldly and fearlessly testified, what was actually
true, that it was time mouth of the Lord that spake. The same Spirit, therefore,
who made Moses and the prophets certain of their calling, now also testifies to
our hearts, that he has employed them as his servants to instruct us.
Accordingly, we need not wonder if there are many who doubt as to the Author of
the Scripture; for, although the majesty of God is displayed in it, yet none but
those who have been enlightened by the Holy Spirit have eyes to perceive what
ought, indeed, to have been visible to all, and yet is visible to the elect
alone. This is the first clause, that we owe to the Scripture the same reverence
which we owe to God; because it has proceeded from him alone, and has nothing
belonging to man mixed with it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And is
profitable</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now follows the second part
of the commendation, that the Scripture contains a perfect rule of a good and
happy life. When he says this, he means that it is corrupted by sinful abuse,
when this usefulness is not sought. And thus he indirectly censures those
unprincipled men who fed the people with vain speculations, as with wind. For
this reason we may in the present day, condemn all who, disregarding
edification, agitate questions which, though they are ingenious, are also
useless. Whenever ingenious trifles of that kind are brought forward, they must
be warded off by this shield, that &#8220;Scripture is profitable.&#8221; Hence
it follows, that it is unlawful to treat it in an unprofitable manner; for the
Lord, when he gave us the Scriptures, did not intend either to gratify our
curiosity, or to encourage ostentation, or to give occasion for chatting and
talking, but to do us good; and, therefore, the right use of Scripture must
always tend to what is profitable.

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
instruction</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Here he enters into a
detailed statement of the various and manifold advantages derived from the
Scriptures. And, first of all, he mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>instruction</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which ranks above all the rest; for it will be to no purpose that you exhort
or reprove, if you have not previously instructed. But because
&#8220;instruction,&#8221; taken by itself, is often of little avail, he adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reproof
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>correction</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It would be too long to explain what we are to learn
from the Scriptures; and, in the preceding verse, he has given a brief summary
of them under the word <i>faith. </i>The most valuable knowledge, therefore, is
&#8220;faith in Christ.&#8221; Next follows instruction for regulating the life,
to which are added the excitements of exhortations and reproofs. Thus he who
knows how to use the Scriptures properly, is in want of nothing for salvation,
or for a Holy life. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Reproof
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>correction
</i></font><font face="Palatino">differ little from each other, except that the
latter proceeds from the former; for the beginning of repentance is the
knowledge of our sinfulness, and a conviction of the judgment of God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Instruction in
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>means the rule of a good
and holy life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>

there is nothing defective; for he asserts absolutely, that the Scripture is
sufficient for perfection. Accordingly, he who is not satisfied with Scripture
desires to be wiser than is either proper or desirable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here an objection arises. Seeing that Paul speaks
of the Scriptures, which is the name given to the Old Testament, how does he say
that it makes a man thoroughly perfect? for, if it be so, what was afterwards
added by the apostles may be thought superfluous. I reply, so far as relates to
the substance, nothing has been added; for the writings of the apostles contain
nothing else than a simple and natural explanation of the Law and the Prophets,
together with a manifestation of the things expressed in them. This eulogium,
therefore, is not inappropriately bestowed on the Scriptures by Paul; and,
seeing that its instruction is now rendered more full and clear by the addition
of the Gospel, what can be said but that we ought assuredly to hope that the
usefulness, of which Paul speaks, will be much more displayed, if we are willing
to make trial and receive it?</font><br></div>

</i>by means of which he appropriately connects Scripture with preaching. This
also refutes certain fanatics, who haughtily boast that they no longer need the
aid of teachers, because the reading of scripture is abundantly sufficient. But
Paul, after having spoken of the usefulness of Scripture, infers not only that
all ought to read it, but that teachers ought to administer it, which is the
duty enjoined on them. Accordingly, as all our wisdom is contained in the
Scriptures, and neither ought we to learn, nor teachers to draw their
instructions, from any other source; so he who, neglecting the assistance of the
living voice, shall satisfy himself with the silent Scripture, will find how
grievous an evil it is to disregard that way of learning which has been enjoined
by <i>God </i>and <i>Christ. </i>Let us remember, I say, that the reading of
Scripture is recommended to us in Such a manner as not to hinder, in the
smallest degree, the ministry of pastors; and, therefore, let believers endeavor
to profit both in reading and in hearing; for not in vain hath God ordained both
of them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, as in a very weighty matter, Paul adds a solemn
charge, exhibiting to Timothy God as the avenger, and Christ as the judge, if he
shall cease to discharge his office of teaching. And, indeed, in like manner as
God showed by an inestimable pledge, when he spared not his only &#8212;
begotten Son, how great is the care which he has for the Church, so he will not
suffer to remain unpunished the negligence of pastors, through whom souls, which
he hath redeemed at so costly a price, perish or are exposed as a
prey.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who shall judge the living and the
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>More especially the Apostle fixes
attention on the judgment of Christ; because, as we are his representatives, so
he will demand a more strict account of evil administration. By &#8220;the
living and the dead&#8221; are meant those whom he shall find still alive at his
coming, and likewise those who shall have died. There will therefore be none
that escape his judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The appearance of Christ and his
kingdom </i></font><font face="Palatino">mean the same thing; for although he
now reigns in heaven and earth, yet hitherto his reign is not clearly
manifested, but, on the contrary, is obscurely hidden under the cross, and is
violently assailed by enemies. His kingdom will therefore be established at that
time when, having vanquished his enemies, and either removed or reduced to
nothing every opposing power, he shall display his majesty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Be instant in season, out of season</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. By
</i>these words he recommends not only constancy, but likewise earnestness, so
as to overcome all hindrances and difficulties; for, being, by nature,
exceedingly effeminate or slothful, we easily yield to the slightest opposition,
and sometimes we gladly seek apologies for our slothfulness. Let us now consider
how many arts Satan employs to stop our course, and how slow to follow, and how
soon wearied are those who are called. Consequently the gospel will not long
maintain its place, if pastors do not urge it earnestly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, this earnestness must relate both to the
pastor and to the people; to the pastor, that he may not devote himself to the
office of teaching merely at his own times and according to his own convenience,
but that, shrinking neither from toils nor from annoyances, he may exercise his
faculties to the utmost. So far as regards the people, there is constancy and
earnestness, when they arouse those who are asleep, when they lay their hands on
those who are hurrying in a wrong direction, and when they correct the trivial
occupations of the world. To explain more fully in what respects the pastor must
&#8220;be instant,&#8221; the Apostle adds &#8212; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Reprove, rebuke,
exhort</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words he means, that we
have need of many excitements to urge us to advance in the right course; for if
we were as teachable as we ought to be, a minister of Christ would draw us along
by the slightest expression of his will. But now, not even moderate
exhortations, to say nothing of sound advices, are sufficient for shaking off
our sluggishness, if there be not increased vehemence of reproofs and
threatenings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With all gentleness and
doctrine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. A </i>very necessary exception;
for reproofs either fall through their own violence, or vanish into smoke, if
they do not rest on
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>doctrine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>Both exhortations and reproofs are merely aids to doctrine, and, therefore,
have little weight without it. We see instances of this in those who have merely
a large measure of zeal and bitterness, and are not furnished with solid
doctrine. Such men toil very hard, utter loud cries, make a great noise, and all
to no purpose, because they build without a foundation. I speak of men who, in
other respects, are good, but with little learning, and excessive warmth; for
they who employ all the energy that they possess in battling against sound
doctrine, are far more dangerous, and do not deserve to be mentioned here at
all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, Paul means that reproofs are founded on
doctrine, in order that they may not be justly despised as frivolous. Secondly,
he means that keenness is moderated by gentleness; for nothing is more difficult
than to set a limit to our zeal, when we have once become warm. Now when we are
carried away by impatience, our exertions are altogether fruitless. Our
harshness not only exposes us to ridicule, but also irritates the minds of the
people. Besides, keen and violent men see generally unable to endure the
obstinacy of those with whom they are brought into intercourse, and cannot
submit to many annoyances and insults, which nevertheless must be digested, if
we are desirous to be useful. Let severity be therefore mingled with this
seasoning of gentleness, that it may be known to proceed from a peaceful
heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For there will be a
time</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb59</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> From
the very depravity of men he shews how careful pastors ought to be; for soon
shall the gospel be extinguished, and perish from the remembrance of men, if
godly teachers do not labor with all their might to defend it. But he means that
we must avail ourselves of the opportunity, while there is any reverence for
Christ; as if one should say that, when a storm is at hand, we must not labor
remissly, but must hasten with all diligence, because there will not afterwards
be an equally fit season.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When they will not endure sound
doctrine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This means that they will not
only dislike and despise, but will even hate, sound doctrine; and he calls it
&#8220;sound (or healthful) doctrine,&#8221; with reference to the effect
produced, because it actually instructs to godliness. In the next verse he
pronounces the same doctrine to be truth, and contrasts it with <i>fables,</i>
that is, useless imaginations, by which the simplicity of the gospel is
corrupted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, let us learn from it, that the more
extraordinary the eagerness of wicked men to despise the doctrine of Christ, the
more zealous should godly ministers be to defend it, and the more strenuous
should be their efforts to preserve it entire; and not only so, but also by
their diligence to ward off the attacks of Satan. And if ever this ought to have
been done, the great ingratitude of men has now rendered it more than necessary;
for they who at first receive the gospel warmly, and make a show of some kind of
uncommon zeal, afterwards contract dislike, which is by and by followed by
loathing; others, from the very outset, either reject it furiously, or,
contemptuously lending an ear, treat it with mockery; while others, not
suffering the yoke to be laid on their neck, kick at it, and, through hatred of
holy discipline, are altogether estranged from Christ and, what is worse, from
being friends become open enemies. So far from this being a good reason why we
should be discouraged and give way, we ought to fight against such monstrous
ingratitude, and even to strive with greater earnestness than if all were gladly
embracing Christ offered to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Secondly, having been told that men will thus despise
and even reject the word of God, we ought not to stand amazed as if it were a
new spectacle, when we see actually accomplished that which the Holy Spirit
tells us will happen. And indeed, being by nature prone to vanity, it is no new
or uncommon timing, if we lend an ear more willingly to fables than to
truth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lastly, the doctrine of the gospel, being plain and
mean in its aspect, is unsatisfactory partly to our pride, and partly to our
curiosity. And how few are there who are endued with spiritual taste, so as to
relish newness of life and all that relates to it! Yet Paul foretells some
greater impiety of one particular age, against which he bids Timothy be early on
his guard.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shall heap up to themselves
teachers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is proper to observe the
expression, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heap
up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which he means that the madness
of men will be so great, that they will not be satisfied with a few deceivers,
but will desire to have a vast multitude; for, as there is an unsatiable longing
for those things which are unprofitable and destructive, so the world seeks, on
all sides and without end, all the methods that it can contrive and imagine for
destroying itself; and the devil has always at hand a sufficiently large number
of such teachers as the world desires to have. There has always been a plentiful
harvest of wicked men, as there is in the present day; and therefore Satan never
has any lack of ministers to deceive men, as he never has any lack of the means
of deceiving.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Indeed, this monstrous depravity, which almost
constantly prevails among men, deserves that God, and his healthful doctrine,
should be either rejected or despised by them, and that they should more gladly
embrace falsehood. Accordingly, that false teachers frequently abound, and that
they sometimes multiply like a nest of hornets, should be ascribed by us to the
righteous vengeance of God. We deserve to be covered and choked by that kind of
filth, seeing that the truth of God finds no place in us, or, if it has found
entrance, is immediately driven from its possession; and since we are so much
addicted to fabulous notions, that we never think that we have too great a
multitude of deceivers. Thus what all abomination of Monks is there in Popery!
If once godly pastor were to be supported, instead of ten Monks and as many
priests, we should presently hear nothing else than complaints about the great
expense.  </font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb60</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The disposition of the world is therefore such that,
by &#8220;heaping up&#8221; with insatiable desire innumerable deceivers, it
desires to banish all that belongs to God. Nor is there any other cause of so
many errors than that men, of their own accord, choose to be deceived rather
than to be properly instructed. And that is the reason why Paul adds the
expression, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>itching
ears</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb61</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> When he
wishes to assign a cause for so great an evil, he makes use of an elegant
metaphor, by which he means, that the world will have ears so refined, and so
excessively desirous of novelty, that it will collect for itself various
instructors, and will be incessantly carried away by new inventions. The only
remedy for this vice is, that believers be instructed to adhere closely to the
pure doctrine of the gospel.</font><br></div>

exhortation, to the effect that the more grievous the diseases are, the more
earnestly Timothy may labor to cure them; and that the nearer dangers are at
hand, the more diligently he may keep watch. And because the ministers of
Christ, when they faithfully discharge their office, are immediately called to
engage in combats, he at the same time reminds Timothy to be firm and immovable

It is also more probable that Timothy, whom Paul had associated with himself as
his closest companion in all things, surpassed ordinary pastors in rank and
dignity of office, than that he was only one of their number. Besides, to
mention an honorable title of office tends not only to encourage him, but to

withheld from thee; thou hast been much aided by my advices, and much confirmed
by my example; the time is now come, that thou shouldst be shine own teacher and
exhorter, and shouldst begin to swim without support: beware lest any change in
thee be observed at my death.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the time of my dissolution is
at hand</i></font><font face="Palatino">. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb63</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> We must
attend to the modes of expression by which he denotes his death. By the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dissolution
</i></font><font face="Palatino">he means that we do not altogether perish when
we die; because it is only a separation of the soul from the body. Hence we
infer, that death is nothing else than a departure of the soul from the body
&#8212; a definition which contains a testimony of the immortality of the
soul.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Sacrifice&#8221; was a term peculiarly
applicable to the death of Paul, which was inflicted on him for maintaining the
truth of Christ; for, although all believers, both by their obedient life and by
their death, are victims or offerings acceptable to God, yet martyrs are
sacrificed in a more excellent manner, by shedding their blood for the name of
Christ. Besides, the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">spe&gt;ndesqai</font><font face="Palatino">
which Paul here employs, does not denote every kind of sacrifice, but that which
serves for ratifying covenants. Accordingly, in this passage, he means the same
thing which he states more clearly when he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;But if I am
offered on the sacrifice of your faith, I rejoice.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;505017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Philippians
2:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For there he means that the faith of the Philippians
was ratified by his death, in precisely the same manner that covenants were
ratified in ancient times by sacrifices of slain beasts; not that the certainty
of our faith is founded, strictly speaking, on the steadfastness of the martyrs,
but because it tends greatly to confirm us. Paul has here adorned his death by a
magnificent commendation, when he called it the ratification of his doctrine,
that believers, instead of sinking into despondency &#8212; as frequently
happens &#8212; might be more encouraged by it to persevere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The time of
dissolution</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This mode of expression is
also worthy of notice, because he beautifully lessens the excessive dread of
death by pointing out its effect and its nature. How comes it that men are so
greatly dismayed at any mention of death, but because they think that they
perish utterly When they die? On the contrary, Paul, by calling it
&#8220;Dissolution,&#8221; affirms that man does not perish, but teaches that
the soul is merely separated from the body. It is with the same object that he
fearlessly declares that &#8220;the time is at hand,&#8221; which he could not
have done unless he had despised death; for although this is a natural feeling,
which can never be entirely taken away, that man dreads and shrinks from death,
yet that terror must be vanquished by faith, that it may not prevent us from
departing form this world in an obedient manner, whenever God shall call
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
I have fought the good fight</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Because it
is customary to form a judgment from the event, Paul&#8217;s fight might have
been condemned on the ground that it did not end happily. He therefore boasts
that it is excellent, whatever may be the light in which it is regarded by the
world. This declaration is a testimony of eminent faith; for not only was Paul
accounted wretched in the opinion of all, but his death also was to be
ignominious. Who then would not have said that he fought without success? But he
does not rely on the corrupt judgments of men. On the contrary, by magnanimous
courage he rises above every calamity, so that nothing opposes his happiness and
glory; and therefore he declares &#8220;the fight which he fought&#8221; to be
good and honorable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have finished my
course</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He even congratulates himself on
his death, because it may be regarded as the goal or termination of his course.
We know that they who run a race have gained their wish when they have reached
the goal. In this manner also he affirms that to Christ&#8217;s combatants death
is desirable, because it puts an end to their labors; and, on the other hand, he
likewise declares that we ought never to rest in this life, because it is of no
advantage to have run well and constantly from the beginning to the middle of
the course, if we do not reach the goal.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I have kept the
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb64</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This
may have a twofold meaning, either that to the last he was a faithful soldier to
his captain, or that he continued in the right doctrine. Both meanings will be
highly appropriate; and indeed he could not make his fidelity acceptable to the
Lord in any other way then by constantly professing, the pure doctrine of the
gospel. Yet I have no doubt that he alludes to the solemn oath taken by
soldiers; as if he had said that he was a good and faithful soldier to his
captain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b><i>.</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> Having boasted of having
fought his fight and finished his course, and kept the faith, he now affirms
that he has not labored in vain. Now it is possible to put forth strenuous
exertion, and yet to be defrauded of the reward which is due. But Paul says that
his reward is sure. This certainty arises from turning his eyes to the day of
the resurrection, and this is what we also ought to do; for all around we see
nothing but death, and therefore we ought not to keep our eye fixed on the
outward appearance of the world, but, on the contrary, to hold out to our minds
the coming of Christ. The consequences will be, that nothing can detract from
our happiness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which the Lord the righteous Judge
will render to me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Because he mentions
&#8220;the crown of righteousness&#8221; and &#8220;the righteous Judge,&#8221;
and employs the word &#8220;render,&#8221; the Papists endeavor, by means of
this passage, to build up the merits of works in opposition to the grace of God.
But their reasoning is absurd. Justification by free grace, which is bestowed on
us through faith, is not at variance within the rewarding of works, but, on the
contrary, those two statements perfectly agree, that a man is justified freely
through the grace of Christ, and yet that God will render to him the reward of
works; for as soon as God has received us into favor, he likewise accepts our
works, so as even to deign to give them a reward, though it is not due to
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here two blunders are committed by the Papists;
first, in arguing that we deserve something from God, because we do well by
virtue of our freewill; and secondly, in holding that God is bound to us, as if
our salvation proceeded from anything else than from his grace. But it does not
follow that God owes anything to us, because he renders righteously what he
renders; for he is righteous even in those acts of kindness which are of free
grace. And he &#8220;renders the reward&#8221; which he has promised, not
because we take the lead by any act of obedience, but because, in the same
course of liberality in which he has begun to act toward us, he follows up his
former gifts by those which are afterwards bestowed. In vain, therefore, and to
no purpose, do the Papists labor to prove from this, that good works proceed
from the power of freewill; because there is no absurdity in saying that God
crowns in us his own gifts. Not less absurdly and foolishly do they endeavor, by
means of this passage, to destroy the righteousness of faith; since the goodness
of God &#8212; by which he graciously embraces a man, not imputing to him his
sins &#8212; is not inconsistent with that rewarding of works which he will
render by the same kindness with which he made the promise. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb65</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And not to me
only</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>That all the rest of the believers
might fight courageously along with him, he invites them to a participation of
the crown; for his unshaken steadfastness could not have served for an example
to <i>us</i>, if the same hope of obtaining the crown had not been held out to
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To all who love his

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb66</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> This is
a singular mark which he employs in describing believers. And, indeed, wherever
faith is strong, it will not permit their minds to fall asleep in this world,
but will elevate them to the hope of the last resurrection. His meaning
therefore is, that all who are so much devoted to the world, and who love so
much this fleeting life, as not to care about the coming of Christ, and not to
be moved by any desire of it, deprive themselves of immortal glory. Woe to our
stupidity, therefore, which exercises such power over us, that we never think
seriously about the coming of Christ, to which we ought to give our whole
attention. Besides, he excludes from the number of believers those in whom the
coming of Christ produces terror and alarm; for it cannot be loved unless it be
regarded as pleasant and delightful.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Make haste, to come to me
quickly.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As he knew that the time of his death
was at hand, there were many subjects &#8212; I doubt not &#8212; on which he
wished to have a personal interview with Timothy for the good of the Church; and
therefore he does not hesitate to desire him to come from a country beyond the
sea. Undoubtedly there must have been no trivial reason why he called him away
from a church over which he presided, and at so great a distance. Hence we may
infer how highly important are conferences between such persons; for what
Timothy had learned in a short space of time would be profitable, for a long
period, to all the churches; so that the loss of half a year, or even of a whole
year, was trivial compared with the compensation gained. And yet it appears from
what follows, that Paul called Timothy with a view to his own individual benefit
likewise; although his own personal matters were not preferred by him to the
advantage of the Church, but it was because it involved the cause of the gospel,
which was common to all believers; for as he defended it from a prison, so he
needed the labors of others to aid in that defense.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having embraced this
world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It was truly base in such a man
to prefer the love of this world to Christ. And yet we must not suppose that he
altogether denied Christ or gave himself up either to ungodliness or to the
allurements of the world; but he merely preferred his private convenience, or
his safety, to the life of Paul. He could not have assisted Paul without many
troubles and vexations, attended by imminent risk of his life; he was exposed to
many reproaches, and must have submitted to many insults, and been constrained
to leave off the care of his own affairs; and, therefore being overcome by his
dislike of the cross, he resolved to consult his own interests. Nor can it be
doubted, that he enjoyed a propitious gale from the world. That he was one of
the leading men may be conjectured on this ground, that Paul mentions him amidst
a very few at
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510414&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
4:14,) and likewise in the Epistle to Philemon,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;570124&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philemon
1:24,) where also he is ranked among Paul&#8217;s assistants; and, therefore, we
need not wonder if he censures him so sharply on this occasion, for having cared
more about himself than about Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Others, whom he afterwards mentions, had not gone
away from him but for good reasons, and with his own consent. Hence it is
evident that he did not study his own advantage, so as to deprive churches of
their pastors, but only to obtain from them some relief. Undoubtedly he was
always careful to invite to come to him, or to keep along with him, those whose
absence would not be injurious to other churches. For this reason he had sent
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Titus to
Dalmatia</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> and some to one place and some
to another, when he invited Timothy to come to him. Not only so, but in order
that the church at Ephesus may not be left destitute or forlorn during
Timothy&#8217;s absence, he sends
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Tychicus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>thither, and mentions this circumstance to Timothy, that he may know that
that church will not be in want of one to fill his place during his
absence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Bring the cloak which I left at
Troas</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As<i> </i>to the meaning of the
word

</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb67</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
commentators are not agreed; for some think that it is a chest or box for
containing books, and others that it is a garment used by travelers, and fitted
for defending against cold and rain. Whether the one interpretation or the other
be adopted, how comes it that Paul should give orders to have either a garment
or a chest brought to him from a place so distant, as if there were not workmen,
or as if there were not abundance both of cloth and timber? If it be said, that
it was a chest filled with books, or manuscripts, or epistles, the difficulty
will be solved; for such materials could not have been procured at any price.
But, because many will not admit the conjecture, I willingly translate it by the
word <i>cloak. </i>Nor is there any absurdity in saying that Paul desired to
have it brought from so great a distance, because that garment, through long
use, would be more comfortable for him, and he wished to avoid expense. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb68</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet (to own the truth) I give the preference to the
former interpretation; more especially because Paul immediately afterwards
mentions </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>books and
parchments</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is evident from this, that the
Apostle had not given over reading, though he was already preparing for death.
Where are those who think that they have made so great progress that they do not
need any more exercise? Which of them will dare to compare himself with Paul?
Still more does this expression refute the madness of those men who &#8212;
despising books, and condemning all reading &#8212; boast of nothing but their
own

<div><font face="Palatino">Here some one will ask, &#8220;What does Paul mean by
asking for a robe or cloak, if he perceived that his death was at hand?&#8221;
This difficulty also induces me to interpret the word as denoting a chest,
though there might have been some use of the &#8220;cloak&#8221; which is
unknown in the present day; and therefore I give myself little trouble about
these matters.</font><br></div>

disputer; but domestic enemies have always been abundantly able to do injury.
And the wickedness of such men always obtains credit in the world, so that
malicious and impudent ignorance sometimes creates trouble and difficulty
greater than the highest abilities accompanied by learning. Besides, when the
Lord brings his servants into contest with persons of this low and base class,
he purposely withdraws them from the view of the world, that they may not
indulge in ostentatious display.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From Paul&#8217;s words,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 4:15,) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for he vehemently
opposed our discourses</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> we may infer
that he had committed no greater offense than an attack on sound doctrine; for
if Alexander had wounded his person, or committed an assault on him, he would
have endured it patiently; but when the truth of God is assailed, his holy
breast burns with indignation, because, in all the members of Christ that saying
must hold good,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The zeal of thy house hath eaten
me up.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;196909&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
69:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is also the reason of the stern imprecation
into which he breaks out, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the Lord may reward him according
to his works</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. A </i>little afterwards, when
he complains that <i>all had forsaken him,
</i>(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;196916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
69:16,) still he does not call down the vengeance of God on them, but, on the
contrary, appears as their intercessor, pleading that they may obtain pardon. So
mild and so merciful to all others, how comes it that he shows himself so harsh
and inexorable towards this individual? The reason is this. Because some had
fallen through fear and weakness, he desires that the Lord would forgive them;
for in this manner we ought to have compassion on the weakness of brethren. But
because this man rose against God with malice and sacrilegious hardihood, and
openly attacked known truth, such impiety had no claim to
compassion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must not imagine, therefore, that Paul was moved
by excessive warmth of temper, when he broke out into this imprecation; for it
was from the Spirit of God, and through a well regulated zeal, that he wished
eternal perdition to Alexander, and mercy to the others. Seeing that it is by
the guidance of the Spirit that Paul pronounces a heavenly judgment from on
high, we may infer from this passage, how dear to God is his truth, for
attacking which he punishes so severely. Especially it ought to be observed how
detestable a crime it is, to fight with deliberate malice against the true
religion</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But lest any person, by falsely imitating the
Apostle, should rashly utter similar imprecations, there are three things here
that deserve notice. First, let us not avenge the injuries done to ourselves,
lest self-love and a regard to our private advantage should move us violently,
as frequently happens. Secondly, while we maintain the glory of God, let us not
mingle with it our own passions, which always disturb good order. Thirdly, let
us not pronounce sentence against every person without discrimination, but only
against reprobates, who, by their impiety, give evidence that such is their true
character; and thus our wishes will agree with God&#8217;s own judgment
otherwise there is ground to fear that the same reply may be made to us that
Christ made to the disciples who thundered indiscriminately against all who did
not comply with their views,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Ye know not of
what spirit ye are.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;420955&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
9:55.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They thought that they had Elijah as their supporter,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;120110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Kings 1:10,) who prayed to the Lord in the same manner; but because they
differed widely from the spirit of Elijah, the imitation was absurd. It is
therefore necessary, that the Lord should reveal his judgment before we burst
forth into such imprecations; and wish that by his Spirit he should restrain and
guide our zeal. And whenever we call to our remembrance the vehemence of Paul
against a single individual, let us also recollect his amazing meekness towards
those who had so basely forsaken him, that we may learn, by his example, to have
compassion on the weakness of our brethren.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here I wish to put a question to those who pretend
that Peter presided over the church at Rome. Where was he at that time?
According to their opinion, he was not dead; for they tell us, that exactly a
year intervened between his death and that of Paul. Besides, they extend his
pontificate to seven years. Here Paul mentions his first defense: his second
appearance before the court would not be quite so soon. In order that Peter may
not lose the title of Pope, must he endure to be charged with the guilt of so
shameful a revolt? Certainly, when the whole matter has been duly examined, we
shall find that everything that has been believed about his Popedom is
fabulous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the Lord assisted
me</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He adds this, in order to remove the
scandal which he saw might arise from that base desertion of his cause. 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb72</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Though
the church at Rome had failed to perform its duty, he affirms that the gospel
had suffered no loss by it, because, leaning on heavenly power, he was himself
fully able to bear the whole burden, and was so far from being discouraged by
the influence of that fear which seized on all, that it became only the more
evident that the grace of God has no need of receiving aid from any other
quarter. He does not boast of his courage, but gives thanks to the Lord; that,
when reduced to extremities, he did not give way nor lose heart under so
dangerous a temptation. He therefore acknowledges that he was supported by the
arm of the Lord, and is satisfied with this, that the inward grace of God served
for a shield to defend him against every assault. He assigns the reason &#8212;
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the proclamation might be
confirmed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word
&#8220;proclamation&#8221; is employed by him to denote the office of publishing
the gospel among the Gentiles, which was especially assigned to him; 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fb73</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for the
preaching of others did not so much resemble a proclamation, in consequence of
being confined to the Jews. And with good reason does he make use of this word
in many passages. It was no small confirmation of his ministry, that, when the
whole world foamed with madness against him, and on the other hand, all human
assistance failed him, still he remained unshaken. Thus he gave practical
demonstration that his apostleship was from Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He now describes the manner of the confirmation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that all the Gentiles might
hear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that the Lord had so powerfully
assisted him; for from this event they might infer that both their own calling
and that of Paul were from the Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And I was delivered out of the
mouth of the lion.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>By the word
&#8220;lion,&#8221; many suppose that he means Nero. For my part, I rather think
that he makes use of this expression to denote danger in general; as if he had
said, &#8220;out of a blazing fire,&#8221; or &#8220;out of the jaws of
death.&#8221; He means that it was not without wonderful assistance from God,
that he escaped, the danger being so great that but for this he must have been
immediately swallowed up.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Lord will deliver me
from every evil work</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He declares, that
he hopes the same for the future; not that he will escape death, but that he
will not be vanquished by Satan, or turn aside from the right course. This is
what we ought chiefly to desire, not that the interests of the body may be
promoted, but that we may rise superior to every temptation, and may be ready to
suffer a hundred deaths rather than that it should come into our mind to pollute
ourselves by any &#8220;evil work.&#8221; Yet I am well aware, that there are
some who take the expression </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>evil
work</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>in a passive sense, as denoting the
violence of wicked men, as if Paul had said, &#8220;The Lord will not suffer
wicked men to do me any injury.&#8221; But the other meaning is far more
appropriate, that he will preserve him pure and unblemished from every wicked
action; for he immediately adds, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his heavenly
kingdom</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by<i> </i>which he means that
that alone is true salvation, when the Lord &#8212; either by life or by death
&#8212; conducts us into his kingdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable passage for maintaining the
uninterrupted communication of the grace of God, in opposition to the Papists.
After having confessed that the beginning of salvation is from God, they ascribe
the continuation of it to freewill; so that in this way perseverance is not a
heavenly gift, but a virtue of man. And Paul, by ascribing to God this work of
&#8220;preserving us to his kingdom,&#8221; openly affirms that we are guided by
his hand during the whole course of our life, till, having discharged the whole
of our warfare, we obtain the victory. And we have a memorable instance of this
in Demas, whom he mentioned a little before, because, from being a noble
champion of Christ, he had become a base deserter. All that follows has been
seen by us formerly, and therefore does not need additional
exposition.</font><br></div>

inscription of your name-is, indeed, a small gift; yet I fully believe that it
will be acceptable to you, for this reason, that the subject of the Epistle
induced me to make this Dedication. The task of putting the finishing hand to
that building which Paul had begun in Crete, but left incomplete was undertaken
by Titus. I occupy nearly the same position with regard to you.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When you had made some progress in rearing this
church with vast exertions, and at great risk, after some time had elapsed I
came, first as your assistant, and afterwards was left as your successor, that I
might endeavor to carry forward, to the<b> </b>best of my ability, that work
which you had so well and so successfully begun. This work, I and my colleagues
are endeavoring to perform, if not with so great progress as might have been
desired yet heartily and faithfully, according to our small
ability.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To return to you, in consequence of holding the same
relation to you which Paul assigned to Titus, I have been led to consider this
similarity as a good reason for selecting you above all others, for dedicating
to you this labor of mine. Meanwhile, to the present age, and perhaps to
posterity, it will, at least, be some evidence of that holy union and friendship
which exists between us. I think that there has never been, in ordinary life, a
circle of friends so sincerely bound to each other as we have been in<b> </b>our
ministry. With both of you I discharged here the office of pastor; and so far
was there from being any appearance of envy, that you and I seemed to be one. We
were afterwards separated by places; for you, Farell, were invited by the church
of Neufchastel, which you had rescued from the tyranny of Popery, and brought
into obedience to Christ; and you, Viret, are held in the same relation by the
church of Lausanne.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">While each of us occupies his own position, our union
brings together the children of God into the fold of Christ, and even. unites
them in his<b> </b>body; while it scatters not only those outward enemies who
openly carry on war with us, but those nearer and domestic enemies, by whom we
are inwardly assailed. For I reckon this also to be one of the benefits
resulting from being closely related, that filthy dogs, whose bites cannot
succeed so far as to tear and rend the Church of Christ, do nothing more than
bark against it with all their might. And, indeed, we cannot too thoroughly
despise their insolence, since we can, with truth, glory before God, and have
proved to men by the clearest evidence, that we cultivate no other society or
friendship than that which has been consecrated to the name of Christ, which has
hitherto been advantageous to his Church, and which has no other aim than that
all may be at one with us in Him.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE
ARGUMENT</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>ON THE EPISTLE TO
TITUS</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul, having only laid the foundations of the church
in Crete, and hastening to go to another place, (for he was not the pastor of a
single island only, but the Apostle of the Gentiles,) had given charge to Titus
to prosecute this work as an Evangelist. It is evident from this Epistle that,
immediately after Paul&#8217;s departure, Satan labored not only to overthrow
the government of the Church, but likewise to corrupt its
doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There were some who, through ambitious motives,
wished to be elevated to the rank of pastors, and who, because Titus did not
comply with their wicked desires, spoke unfavorably of him to many persons. On
the other hand, there were Jews who, under the presence of supporting the Mosaic
law, introduced a great number of trifles; and such persons were listened to
with eagerness and with much acceptance. Paul therefore writes with this design,
to arm Titus with his authority, that he may be able to bear so great a burden;
for undoubtedly there were some who fearlessly despised him as being but one of
the ordinary rank of pastors. It is also possible that complaints about him were
in circulation, to the effect that he assumed more authority than belonged to<b>
</b>him when he did not admit pastors till he had made trial and ascertained
their fitness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we may infer, that this was not so much a
private epistle of Paul to Titus, as it was a public epistle to the Cretans. It
is not probable that Titus is blamed for having with too great indulgence raised
unworthy persons to the office of bishop, or that, as an ignorant man and a
novice, he is told what is that kind of doctrine in which he ought to<b>
</b>instruct the people; but because due honor was not rendered to him, Paul
clothes him with his own authority, both in ordaining ministers and in the whole
government of the Church. Because there were many who foolishly desired to have
another form of doctrine than that which he delivered, Paul approves of this
alone &#8212; rejecting all others &#8212; and exhorts him to proceed as he had
begun.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, then, he shows what sort of persons ought to
be chosen for being ministers.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc1</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">Among other qualifications, he requires that a
minister shall be well instructed in sound doctrine, that by means of it he may
resist adversaries. Here he takes occasion to censure some vices of the Cretans,
but especially rebukes the Jews, who made some kind of holiness to consist in a
distinction of food, and in other outward ceremonies. In order to refute their
fooleries, he contrasts with them the true exercises of piety and Christian
life; and, with the view of pressing them more closely, he describes what are
the duties which belong to every one in his calling. These duties he enjoins
Titus diligently and constantly to inculcate. On the other hand, he admonishes
others not to be weary of hearing them, and shows that this is the design of
time redemption and salvation obtained through Christ. If any obstinate person
oppose, or refuse to obey, he bids him set that person aside. We now see that
Paul has no other object in view than to support the cause of Titus, and to
stretch out the hand to assist him in performing the work of the
Lord.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A servant of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This extended and laborious
commendation of his apostleship shows that Paul had in view the whole Church,
and not Titus alone; for his apostleship was not disputed by Titus, and Paul is
in the habit of proclaiming the titles of his calling, in order to maintain his
authority. Accordingly, just as he perceives those to whom he writes to be
disposed, he deals largely or sparingly in those ornaments. Here his design was,
to bring into subjection those who had haughtily rebelled; and for this reason
he extols his apostleship in lofty terms. He therefore writes this Epistle, not
that it may be read in solitude by Titus in his closet, but that it may be
openly published.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>An Apostle of Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>First, he calls himself &#8220;a
servant of God,&#8221; and next adds the particular kind of his ministry,
namely, that he is &#8220;an Apostle of Christ;&#8221; for there are various
ranks among the servants of God. Thus he descends from the general description
to the particular class. We ought also to keep in remembrance what I have said
elsewhere, that the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>servant</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>means something else than ordinary subjection, (on account of which all
believers are called &#8220;servants of God,&#8221;) and denotes a minister Who
has received a particular office. In this sense the prophets were formerly
distinguished by this title, and Christ himself is the chief of the
prophets:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Behold my servant,
I have chosen him.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;234201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
42:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus David, with a view to his royal dignity calls
himself &#8220;a servant of God.&#8221; Perhaps, also, it is on account of the
Jews that he designates himself &#8220;a servant of God;&#8221; for they were
wont to lower his authority by alleging the law against him. He therefore wishes
to be accounted an Apostle of Christ in such a manner that he may likewise glory
in being a servant of the eternal God. Thus he shows not only that those two
titles are quite consistent with each other, but that they are joined by a bond
which cannot be dissolved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to the faith of the elect
of God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc2</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> If any one doubt about his apostleship,
he procures credit for it by a very strong reason, connecting it with the
salvation &#8220;of the elect of God.&#8221; As if he had said, &#8220;There is
a mutual agreement between my apostleship and the faith of the elect of God;
and, therefore, it will not be rejected by any man who is not a reprobate and
opposed to the true faith.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By &#8220;the elect&#8221; he means not only those
who were at that time alive, but all that had been from the beginning of the
world; for he declares that he teaches no doctrine which does not agree with the
faith of Abraham and of all the fathers. So, then, if any person in the present
day wishes to be accounted a successor of Paul, he must prove that he is the
minister of the same doctrine. But these words contain also an implied contrast,
that the gospel may suffer no damage from the unbelief and obstinacy of many;
for at that time, as well as in the present day, weak minds were greatly
disturbed by this scandal, that the greater part of those who boasted of the
title of the Church rejected the pure doctrine of Christ. For this reason Paul
shows that, though all indiscriminately boast of the name of God, there are many
of that multitude who are reprobates; as he elsewhere
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:7) affirms, that not all who are descended from Abraham according to the
flesh, are the lawful children of Abraham.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the knowledge of that
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> I consider the copulative and to
be here equivalent to that is; so that the passage might run thus:
&#8220;according to the faith of the elect of God, that is, time knowledge of
that truth which is according to godliness.&#8221; This clause explains what is
the nature of that &#8220;faith&#8221; which he has mentioned, though it is not
a full definition of it, but a description framed so as to apply to the present
context. For the purpose of maintaining that his apostleship is free from all
imposture and error, he solemnly declares that it contains nothing but known and
ascertained truth, by which men are instructed in the pure worship of God. But
as every word has its own weight, it is highly proper to enter into a detailed
explanation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, when &#8220;faith&#8221; is called
&#8220;knowledge,&#8221; it is distinguished not only from opinion, but from
that shapeless faith which the Papists have contrived; for they have forged an
implicit faith destitute of all light of the understanding. But when Paul
describes it to be a quality which essentially belongs to faith &#8212; to know
the truth, he plainly shews that there is no faith without
knowledge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word truth expresses still more clearly the
certainty which is demanded by the nature of faith; for faith is not satisfied
with probable arguments, but holds what is true. Besides, he does not speak of
every kind of truth, but of the heavenly doctrine, which is contrasted with the
vanity of the human understanding. As God has revealed himself to us by means of
that truth, so it is alone worth, of the honor of being called &#8220;the
truth&#8221; &#8212; a name which is bestowed on it in many parts of
Scripture.</font><br></div>

&#8220;the truth&#8221; of which he had spoken, but at the same time commends
the doctrine of Paul from the fruit and end of it, because it has no other
object than that God should be worshipped in a right manner, and that pure
religion should flourish among men. In this manner he defends his doctrine from
every suspicion of vain curiosity, as he did before Felix,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;442601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts

to be suspected and even hated by good men, the only lawful commendation of
doctrine is this, that it instructs us to fear God and to bow before him with
reverence. And hence we are also informed, that the greater progress any one has
made in godliness, he is so much the better disciple of Christ; and that he
ought to be reckoned a true theologian who edifies consciences in the fear of
God.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>

nothing else shall produce contempt of God, while they reduce men to the

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which God promised before the times

times of ages&#8221; but &#8220;eternal times,&#8221; he gives himself great
uneasiness about &#8220;the eternity of times,&#8221; till at length he explains
&#8220;eternal times&#8221; as denoting those which go beyond all antiquity. As
to the meaning, he and Jerome and other commentators agree, that God determined,
before the creation of the world, to give that salvation which he hath now
manifested by the gospel. Thus Paul would have used the word <i>promise
</i>incorrectly instead of <i>decree; </i>for before men existed there was no
one to whom he could promise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this reason, while I do not reject this
exposition, yet when I take a close survey of the whole matter, I am constrained
to adopt a different interpretation &#8212; that eternal life was promised to
men many ages ago, and not only to those who lived at that time, but also for
our own age. It was not for the benefit of Abraham alone, but with a view to all
who should live after him, that God said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8216;In thy seed shall
all nations be blessed.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">Nor is this inconsistent with what he says, in
another sense,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 1:9) that salvation was given to men &#8220;before the times of
ages.&#8221; The meaning of the word is still the same in both passages; for,
since the Greek word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aijw&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
denotes an uninterrupted succession of time from the beginning to the end of the
world, Paul declares, in that passage, that salvation was given or decreed for
time elect of God before times began to flow. But because in this passage he
treats of the promise, he does not include all ages, so as to lead us back
beyond the creation of the world, but shews that many
ages</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc4</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
have elapsed since salvation was promised.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If any person prefer to view &#8220;the times of
ages&#8221; as a concise expression for the ages themselves, he is at liberty to
do so. But because salvation was given by the eternal election of God before it
was promised the act of giving salvation is put in that passage
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;550109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 1:9) before all ages, and therefore we must supply the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>But here it means nothing more than that the promise is more ancient than a
long course of ages, because it began immediately after the creation of the
world. In the same sense he shews<b> </b>that the gospel, which was to have been
proclaimed when Christ rose from the dead, had been promised in the Scriptures
by the prophets; for there is a wide difference between<b> </b>the promise which
was formerly given to the fathers and the present exhibition of
grace.</font><br></div>

is added for glorifying God, and still more for confirming our faith. And,
indeed, whenever the subject treated of is our salvation, we ought to recollect
that it is founded on the word of Him who can neither deceive nor lie. Moreover,
the only proof of the whole of religion is &#8212; the unchangeable truth of
God.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

manifestation of this kind, when God in ancient times spake by his prophets; but
because Christ publicly, displayed by his coming those thing which they had
obscurely predicted, and the Gentiles were afterwards admitted into the
fellowship of the covenant, in this sense Paul says that what had<b>
</b>formerly been exhibited in part &#8220;hath now been manifested.&#8221;
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In his own

must have been the most seasonable time for doing it; and he mentions this for
the purpose of meeting the rashness of men, who have always the hardihood to
inquire why it was not sooner, or why it is to-day rather than to-morrow. In
order therefore that our curiosity may not exceed proper bounds, he shews that
the &#8220;times&#8221; are placed in the hand, and at the disposal, of God, in
such a manner that we ought to think that he does everything in the proper order
and at the most seasonable time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His

not uncommon with Greek writers to supply the preposition by. Or, he calls
Christ the Word; if it be not thought preferable to supply something for the
sake of completing the sentence. Were it not that the second exposition is a
little forced, in other respects I should give it the preference. Thus John
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;What we have
heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what our hands have handled of the Word

John 1:1, 2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I therefore prefer what is a simple meaning, that God
hath manifested the word concerning the life by the preaching of the
gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
preaching</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>of which he speaks, is the
gospel proclaimed, as the chief thing which we hear in it is &#8212; that Christ
is given to us, and that in him there is life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which hath been committed to
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Because all are not<b>

himself into it, he asserts his calling, according to his custom. Here we ought
to learn &#8212; what we have often remarked on other occasions &#8212; that the
honor is not due to any man, till he has proved that God has ordained him, for
even the ministers of Satan proudly boast that God has called them, but there.
is no truth in their words. Now Paul states nothing but what is known and
proved, when he mentions his calling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, from this passage we learn for what purpose
they were made apostles. It was for the sake of publishing the gospel, as he
says elsewhere,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Woe to me if I

(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460916&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1

<div><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, they who enact dumb show, in the midst

successors of the apostles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of God our

the Father and to Christ, so that each of them is our Savior, but for a
different reason; for the Father is called our Savior, because he redeemed us by
the death of his Son, that he might make us heirs of eternal life; and the Son,
because<b> </b>he shed his blood as the pledge and the price of our salvation

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To Titus, my own son,

is evident in what sense a minister of the word is said to beget spiritually
those whom he brings to the obedience of Christ, that is, so that he himself is
also begotten. Paul declares himself to be the father of Titus, with respect to
his faith; but immediately adds, that this faith is common to both, so that both
of them alike have the same Father in heaven. Accordingly, God does not diminish
his own prerogative, when he pronounces those to be spiritual fathers along with
himself, by whose ministry he regenerates whom he chooses; for of themselves
they do nothing, but only by the efficacy of the Spirit. As to the remainder of
the verse, the exposition of it will be found in the Commentaries on the former
Epistles, and especially on the First Epistle to
Timothy.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc5a</font></sup><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this reason I left thee
in Crete</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This preface clearly proves,
that Titus is not so much admonished on his own account as recommended to
others, that no one may hinder him. Paul testifies that he has appointed him in
his own room; and on that account all should acknowledge and receive him with
reverence as the Apostle&#8217;s deputy. The apostles had no fixed place
assigned to them, but were charged to spread the gospel through the whole world;
and for this reason, when they left one city or district to go to another, they
were wont to place fit men as their substitutes, to complete the work which they
had begun. Thus Paul affirms that he founded the church of the Corinthians, but
that there were other workmen,</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc6</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> who must build on his foundation, that
is, carry forward the building.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, indeed, belongs to all pastors; for the
churches will always stand in need of increase and progress, as long as the
world shall endure. But in addition to the ordinary office of pastors, the care
of organizing the church was committed to Titus. Till the churches have been
already organized, and reduced to some order, pastors were not usually appointed
over them. But Titus held some additional charge, which consisted in giving a
form to churches that had not yet been properly arranged, and in appointing a
fixed kind of government accompanied by discipline. Having laid the foundation,
Paul departed; and then it became the duty of Titus to carry the work higher,
that the building might have fair proportions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is what he calls correcting those things which
are still wanting. The building of the Church is not a work so easy that it can
be brought all at once to perfection. How long Paul was in Crete &#8212; is
uncertain; but he had spent some time there, and had faithfully devoted his
labors to erect the kingdom of Christ. He did not lack the most consummate skill
that can be found in man; he was unwearied in toil; and yet he acknowledged that
he left the work rough and incomplete. Hence we see the difficulty; and, indeed,
we find, by experience, in the present day, that it is not the labor of one or
two years to restore fallen. churches to a tolerable condition. Accordingly,
those who have made diligent progress for many years &#8212; must still be
attentive to correct many things.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc7</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here it is highly proper to observe the modesty of
Paul who willingly permits another person to complete the work which he had
begun. And, indeed, although Titus is greatly inferior to him, he does not
refuse to have him for
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpanorqwth&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino">
a &#8220;corrector,&#8221; to give the finishing hand to his work. Such ought to
be the dispositions of godly teachers; not that every one should. labor to make
everything bend to his own ambitious views, but that they should strive to
assist each other, and that, when any one has labored more successfully, he
should be congratulated and not envied by all the rest.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And yet we must not imagine that Paul intended that
Titus should correct those things which he had left undone, either through
ignorance, or forgetfulness, or carelessness, but those things which he could
not finish on account of the shortness of the time. In short, he enjoined Titus
to make that correction which he would himself have made, if he had remained
longer in Crete; not by varying &#8212; not by changing anything, but by adding
what was wanting; because the difficulty of such a work does not allow every
part of it to be done in a single day.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And appoint presbyters in each
city</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc9</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In the spiritual building this nearly comes next to doctrine, that pastors be
ordained, to take charge of governing the Church; and therefore Paul mentions it
here in preference to everything else. It is a point which ought to be carefully
observed, that churches cannot safely remain without the ministry of pastors,
and that consequently, wherever there is a considerable body of people, a pastor
should be appointed over it. And yet he does not say that each town shall have a
pastor, so that no place shall have more than one; but he means that no towns
shall be destitute of pastors</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Presbyters</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or elders. It is well known, that it was not on account of age, that they
received this appellation; for sometimes those who were still young &#8212; such
as Timothy &#8212; were admitted to this rank. But in all languages it has been
customary to apply this honorable designation to all rulers. Although we may
conclude, from
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;540517&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Timothy 5:17, that there were two<b> </b>classes of presbyters, the context will
immediately show, that here none other than teachers are meant, that is,<b>
</b>those who were ordained to teach; for immediately afterwards, he will call
the same persons &#8220;bishops.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be thought that he gives too much power to
Titus, when he bids him appoint ministers for all the churches. That would be
almost royal power. Besides, this method takes away from each church the right
of choosing, and from the College of Pastors the power of judging; and thus the
sacred administration of the Church would be almost wholly profaned. The answer
is easy. He does not give permission to Titus, that he alone may do everything
in this matter, and may place over the churches those whom he thinks fit to
appoint to be bishops; but only bids him preside, as moderator, at the
elections, which is quite necessary. This mode of expression is very common. In
the same manner, a consul, or regent, or dictator is said to have created
consuls, on account of having presided over the public assembly in electing
them. Thus also Luke relates that Paul and Barnabas ordained elders in every
church.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;441423&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
14:23.) Not that they alone, in an authoritative manner, appointed pastors which
the churches had neither approved nor known; but that they ordained fit men, who
had been chosen or desired by the people. From this passage we do indeed learn,
that there was not at that time such equality among the ministers of Christ but
that some one had authority and deliberative voice above others; but this has
nothing to do with the tyrannical and profane custom which prevails in Popery as
to Collations. The apostles had a widely different mode of
procedure.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any one is
blameless</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>In order that no one may be
angry with Titus, as if he were too rigorous or severe in rejecting any, Paul
takes the whole blame to himself;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc10</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> for he declares that he has expressly
commanded, that no one may be admitted, unless he be such a person as is here
described. Accordingly, as he testified, a little before, that he had invested
Titus with authority to preside in the appointment of pastors, that others might
allow to him that right; so he now relates the injunction which he had given,
lest the severity of Titus should be exposed to the illwill of the ignorant, or
the slanders of wicked men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As this passage presents to us a lively portrait of a
lawful bishop, we ought to observe it carefully; but, on the other hand, as
almost everything that is here contained has been explained by me in the
Commentary on the First Epistle to Timothy, it will be enough at present to
touch on it slightly. When he says, that a bishop must be
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajne&gt;gklhov</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>blameless</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he does not mean one who is exempt from every vice, (for no such person
could at any time be found,) but one who is marked by no disgrace that would
lessen his authority. He means, therefore, that he shall be a man of unblemished
reputation.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc11</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The husband of one
wife</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The reason why this rule is laid
down &#8212; has been explained by us in the Commentary on the First Epistle to
Timothy. Polygamy was so common among the Jews, that the wicked custom had
nearly passed into a law. If any man had married two wives before he made a
profession of Christianity, it would have been cruel<b> </b>to compel him to
divorce one of them; and therefore the apostles endured what was in itself
faulty, because they could not correct it. Besides, they who had involved
themselves by marrying more shall one wife at a time, even though they had been
prepared to testify their repentance by retaining but one wife, had,
nevertheless, given a sign of their incontinence, which might have been a brand
on their good name. The meaning is the same as if Paul had enjoined them to
elect those who had lived chastely in marriage &#8212; had been satisfied with
having a single wife, and had forbidden those who had manifested the power of
lust by marrying many wives. At the same time, he who, having become an
unmarried man by the death of his wife, marries another, ought, nevertheless, to
be accounted &#8220;the husband of one wife;&#8221; for the apostle does not
say, that they shall choose him who has been, but him who is, &#8220;the husband
of one wife.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having believing
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Seeing that it is required
that a pastor shall have prudence and gravity, it is proper that those qualities
should be exhibited in his family; for how shall that man Who cannot rule his
own house &#8212; be able to govern the church! Besides, not only must the
bishop himself be free from reproach, but his whole family ought to be a sort of
mirror of chaste and honorable discipline; and, therefore, in the First Epistle
to Timothy, he not less strictly enjoins their wives what they ought to
be.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">First, he demands that the children shall be
&#8220;believers;&#8221; whence it is obvious that they have been educated in
the sound doctrine of godliness, and in the fear of the Lord. Secondly, that
they shall not be devoted to luxury, that they may be known to have been
educated to temperance and frugality. Thirdly, that they shall <i>not </i>be
<i>disobedient; </i>for he who cannot obtain from his children any reverence or
subjection &#8212; will hardly be able to restrain the people by the bridle of
discipline.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For a bishop ought to be
blameless, as a governor of the house of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He again repeats, that they who
aspire to the office of a bishop ought to retain an unspotted reputation; and he
confirms it by this argument, that, because the Church is the house of God,
every person who is appointed to govern it &#8212; is constituted, as it were,
governor of the house of God. Now, he would be ill spoken of among men, Who
should take a scandalous and infamous person, and make him his steward; and
therefore it would be far more base and intolerable to appoint such persons to
be rulers of the household of God. The Latin word <i>dispensator </i>(steward or
manager) &#8212;  employed in the old translation, and retained by Erasmus
&#8212;  does not at all express Paul&#8217;s meaning; for, in order that
greater care may be exercised in the election, he adorns the office of a bishop
within this honorable eulogy, that it is a government of the house of God, as he
says to Timothy,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;That thou mayest

Timothy 3:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage plainly shows that there is no
distinction between a presbyter and a bishop; for he now calls indiscriminately,
by the latter name, those whom he formerly he employs both names in the same
sense, without any distinction; as Jerome has remarked, both in his Commentary
on this passage, and in his Epistle to Evagrius. And hence we may perceive how
much greater deference has been paid to the opinions of men than ought to have
been paid to them; for the language of the Holy Spirit, has been set aside, and
the custom introduced by the arbitrary will of man has prevailed. For my own
part, I do not find fault with the custom which has existed from the very
beginning of the Church, that each assembly of bishops shall have one
moderator;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc12</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> but that the name of office which God
has given to all, shall be conveyed to one alone, and that all the rest shall be
deprived of it, is both unreason able and absurd. Besides, to pervert the
language of the Holy Spirit &#8212; in such a manner that the same words shall
have a different meaning from what he intended &#8212; is excessive and profane
hardihood.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc13</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not
self-willed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>With good reason does he
condemn this vice in a bishop, whose duty it is not only to receive kindly those
who come to him of their own accord, but also to allure those who<b>
</b>withdraw themselves, that he may conduct all in like manner to Christ. Now,

every man pleases himself to such an extent as to refuse to yield and
accommodate himself to others. And, indeed, every
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aujqa&gt;dhv</font><font face="Palatino">)

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But hospitable, devoted to
kindness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Hence it is evident how
destructive is that plague which tears the Church by quarrels. With this vice he
contrasts, first, docility, and next, gentleness and modesty towards all; for a
bishop will never teach well, who is not also ready to learn. Augustine praises
highly a saying of Cyprian: &#8220;Let him be as patient to learn as skillful to
teach.&#8221; Besides, bishops often need advice and warnings. If they refuse to
be admonished, if they reject good advices, they will immediately fall headlong
to the grievous injury of the Church. The remedy against these evils, therefore,
is, that they be not wise to themselves.</font><br></div>

contrasted by Paul with covetousness and niggardliness. He calls that man

</i>who lives among men without doing harm to any one.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Holiness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

words.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Holding fast the faithful
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is<i> </i>the chief gift in a
bishop, who is elected principally for the sake of teaching; for the Church
cannot be governed in any other way than by the word. &#8220;The faithful
word&#8221; is the appellation which he gives to that doctrine which is pure,
and which has proceeded from the mouth of God. He wishes that a bishop should
hold it fast, so as not only to be well instructed in it, but to be constant in
maintaining it. There are some fickle persons who easily suffer themselves to be
carried away to various kinds of doctrine; while others are cast down by fear,
or moved by any occurrence to forsake the defense of the truth. Paul therefore
enjoins that those persons shall be chosen who, having cordially embraced the
truth of God, and holding it firmly, never allow it to be wrested from them, or
can be torn from it. And, indeed, nothing is more dangerous than that fickleness
of which I have spoken, when a pastor does not stedfastly adhere to that
doctrine of which he ought to be the unshaken defender. In short, in a pastor
there is demanded not only learning, but such zeal for pure doctrine as never to
depart from it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what is meant by <i>according to instruction</i>
or <i>doctrine?</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc14</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The meaning is, that it is useful
for the edification of the Church; for Paul is not wont to give the name of
&#8220;doctrine&#8221; to anything that is learned and known without promoting
any advancement of godliness; but, on the contrary, he condemns as vain and
unprofitable all the speculations which yield no advantage, however ingenious
they may be in other respects. Thus, &#8220;He that teacheth, let him do it in
doctrine;&#8221; that is, let him labor to do good to the hearers.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451207&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:7.) In short, the first thing required in a pastor is, that he be well
instructed in the knowledge of sound doctrine; the second is, that, with
unwavering firmness of courage, he hold by the confession of it to the last; and
the third is, that he make his manner of teaching tend to edification, and do
not, through motives of ambition, fly about through the subtleties of frivolous
curiosity, but seek only the solid advantage of the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he may be
able</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The pastor ought to have two
voices: one, for gathering the sheep; and another, for warding off and driving
away wolves and thieves. The Scripture supplies him with the means of doing
both; for he who is deeply skilled in it will be able both to govern those who
are teachable, and to refute the enemies of the truth. This twofold use of
Scripture Paul describes when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he may be able to exhort and
to convince adversaries</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>And hence let
us learn, first, what is the true knowledge of a bishop, and, next, to what
purpose it ought to be applied. That bishop is truly wise, who holds the right
faith; and he makes a proper use of his knowledge, when he applies it to the
edification of the people.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is remarkable applause bestowed on the word of
God, when it is pronounced to be sufficient, not only for governing the
teachable, but for subduing the obstinacy of enemies. And, indeed, the power of
truth revealed by the Lord is such that it easily vanquishes all falsehoods. Let
the Popish bishops now go and boast of being the successors of the apostles,
seeing that the greater part of them are so ignorant of all doctrine, as to
reckon ignorance to be no small part of their dignity.</font><br></div>

After having laid down a general rule, which ought to be everywhere observed, in
order that Titus may be more attentive to adhere to it, he holds out to him the
urgent necessity which ought to excite him more than all things else. He warns
him that he has to deal with many obstinate and incorrigible persons, that many
are puffed up with vanity and idle talk, that many are deceivers; and that
therefore they ought to choose, on the other hand, such leaders as are qualified
and well prepared to oppose them. For, if the children of this world, when
dangers arise, increase their solicitude and watchfulness, it would be
disgraceful for us, when Satan is using his utmost efforts to remain careless

nothing to piety and the fear of God. And such is all the scholastic theology
that is found, in the present day, in Popery. Yet he calls the same persons
<i>deceivers of minds</i>. It may be thought preferable to view this as relating
to a different class of persons; but, for my own part, I think that it means the
same class; for the teachers of such trifles entice and fascinate the minds of
men, so as no longer to receive sound doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Chiefly they who are of the

chiefly of the Jews; for it is highly requisite that such plagues shall be known
by all. We ought not to listen to those who plead that we should spare the
reputation of this or that individual, when the matter in question is the great
danger of the whole Church. And so much the greater danger was to be apprehended
from that nation, because it claimed superiority above others on account of the
sacredness of its lineage. This is therefore the reason why Paul reproves the
Jews more sharply, in order to take from them the power of doing
injury.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whose mouth must be
stopped</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>A good pastor ought therefore
to be on the watch, so as not to give silent permission to wicked and dangerous
doctrines to make gradual progress, or to allow wicked men an opportunity of
spreading them. But it may be asked, &#8220;How is it possible for a bishop to
constrain obstinate and self-willed men to be silent? For such persons, even
though they are vanquished in argument, still do not hold their peace; and it
frequently happens that, the more manifestly they are refuted and vanquished,
they become the more insolent; for not only is their malice strengthened and
inflamed, but they give themselves up to indolence.&#8221; I reply, when they
have been smitten down by the sword of God&#8217;s word, and overwhelmed by the
force of the truth, the Church may command them to be silent; and if they
persevere, they may at least be banished from the society of believers, so that
they shall have no opportunity of doing harm.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc18</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Yet by &#8220;shutting the mouth&#8221;
Paul simply means &#8212; &#8221;to refute their vain talking, even though they
should not cease to make a noise; for he who is convicted by the word of God,
however he may chatter, has nothing to say.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who overturn whole
houses.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>If the faith of one individual
were in danger of being overturned, (for we are speaking of the perdition of a
single soul redeemed by the blood of Christ) the pastor should immediately gird
himself for the combat; how much less tolerable is it to see whole houses
overturned?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Teaching things which they ought
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The manner in which they were
overturned is described in these words. Hence we may infer how dangerous it is
to make even the smallest departure from sound doctrine; for he does not say
that the doctrines, by which they overturned time faith of many, were openly
wicked; but we may understand by this designation every kind of corruptions,
when there is a turning aside from the desire of edification. Thus it is in
reality, that, amidst so great weakness of the flesh, we are exceedingly prone
to fall; and hence it arises, that Satan easily and speedily destroys, by his
ministers, what godly teachers had reared with great and long-continued
toil.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He next points out the source of the evil, a desire
of <i>dishonest gain; </i>by which He reminds us flow destructive a plague
avarice is in teachers; for, as soon as they give themselves up to the pursuit
of gain, they must labor to obtain the favor and countenance of men. This is
quickly followed by the corruption of pure
doctrine.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>One of themselves, a prophet
of their own</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have no doubt that he
who is here spoken of is Epimenides, who was a native of Crete; for, when the
Apostle says that this author was &#8220;one of themselves,&#8221; and was
&#8220;a prophet of their own,&#8221; he undoubtedly means that he belonged to
the nation of the Cretans. Why he calls him a Prophet--is doubtful. Some think
that the reason is, that the book from which Paul borrowed this passage bears
the title </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Peri&lt;
Crhsmw~n</font><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;concerning oracles.&#8221; Others
are of opinion that Paul speaks ironically, by saying that they have such a
Prophet &#8212; a Prophet worthy of a nation which refuses to listen to the
servants of God. But as poets are sometimes called by the Greeks
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">profh~tai</font><font face="Palatino">)
&#8220;prophets,&#8221; and as the Latin authors call them Vates, I consider it
to denote simply a teacher. The reason why they were so called appears to have
been, that they were always reckoned to be
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ge&gt;nov qei~on kai&lt;
ejnqousiastiko&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino">)<i> &#8220;</i>a divine race
and moved by divine inspiration.&#8221; Thus also Adimantus, in the Second Book
of Plato&#8217;s treatise </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Peri&lt;
Politei&gt;av</font><font face="Palatino"> after having called the poets
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ui[ouv
Qew~n</font><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;sons of the gods,&#8221; adds, that
they also became their prophets. For this reason I think that Paul accommodates
his style to the ordinary practice. Nor is it of any importance to inquire on
what occasion Epimenides calls his countrymen liars, namely, because they boast
of having the sepulcher of Jupiter; but seeing that the poet takes it from an
ancient and well-known report, the Apostle quotes it as a proverbial
saying.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc19</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From this passage we may infer that those persons are
superstitious, who do not venture to borrow anything from heathen authors. All
truth is from God; and consequently, if wicked men have said anything that is
true and just, we ought not to reject it; for it has come from God. Besides, all
things are of God; and, therefore, why should it not be lawful to dedicate to
his glory everything that can properly be employed for such a purpose? But on
this subject the reader may consult Basil&#8217;s

must not deal with obstinate and unruly persons in the same manner as with those
who are meek and teachable; for, in instructing the latter, we ought to use such
mildness as is suitable to their teachable disposition, while the stubbornness
of the former must be severely corrected, and (as the saying is) for a bad knot
there must be a bad wedge.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc24</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The reason why Titus ought to be more
sharp and severe in rebuking them has been already stated, namely, that they are
&#8220;evil beasts.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may be sound in the
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Whether the
&#8220;soundness&#8221; or &#8220;healthfulness&#8221; is here contrasted with
the diseases which he has mentioned, or whether he simply commands them to
remain in the sound faith, is uncertain. I prefer the latter view. As they
already are exceedingly vicious, and may easily be corrupted more and more, he
wishes them to be more closely and strictly kept within the pure
faith.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">

&#8220;sound faith&#8221; consists &#8212; when it is not corrupted by any
&#8220;fables.&#8221; But in guarding against the danger he prescribes this
remedy &#8212; not to give ear to them; for God wishes us to be so attentive to
his word, that there shall be no entrance for trifles. And, indeed, when the
truth of God has once gained admission all that can be brought against it will
be so tasteless, that it will not attract our minds. If, therefore, we wish to
preserve the faith uncontaminated, let us learn carefully to restrain our
senses, so that they may not give themselves up to strange contrivances; for, as
soon as any person shall begin to listen to fables, he will lose the purity of
faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">All trivial inventions he calls &#8220;fables,&#8221;
or, as we would say, &#8220;trifles;&#8221; for what he immediately adds, about
&#8220;the commandments of men,&#8221; has the same meaning. And he calls those
men </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>enemies of the
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>who<i>, </i>not satisfied with the
pure doctrine of<i> </i>Christ, mix up with them their own fooleries; for all
that men of themselves contrive ought to be accounted
&#8220;fabulous.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He attributes this vice chiefly to the Jews, because,
under the presence of<i> </i>the divine lew, they introduced superstitious
ceremonies. The Gentiles, being aware that they had been wretchedly deceived
during their whole life, more easily renounced their former course of life;
while the Jews, having been educated in the true religion, obstinately defended
the ceremonies to which they had been accustomed, and could not be convinced
that the Law had been abrogated. In this manner they disturbed all churches,
because, as soon as the gospel began to make its appearance anywhere, they did
not cease to corrupt its purity by mixing it with their leaven. Accordingly,
Paul not only forbids them, in general terms, to degenerate from sound doctrine,
but points out, as with the finger, the present evil which needed to be
remedied, that they may be on their guard against
it.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the pure all things indeed
are pure</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He glances at one class of
fabulous opinions; for the choice of the kinds of food, (such as was temporarily
enjoined by Moses,) together with purifications and washings, were insisted on
as being still necessary, and they even made holiness to consist almost wholly
in these minute observances. How dangerous to the Church this was, we have
already explained. First, a snare of bondage was laid on the consciences; and
next, ignorant persons, bound by this superstition, had a veil drawn over their
eyes, which hindered them from advancing in the pure knowledge of Christ. If any
of the Gentiles refused to submit to this yoke, because he had not been
accustomed to it, the Jews vehemently contended for it, as if it had been the
chief article of religions. Not without good reason, therefore, does Paul firmly
oppose such corrupters of the gospel. In this passage, indeed, he not only
refutes their error, but wittily laughs at their folly, in laboring anxiously,
any advantage, about abstaining from certain kinds of food and things of that
nature</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the first clause of this verse he upholds
Christian liberty, by asserting, that to believers nothing is unclean; but at
the same time he indirectly censures the false apostles who set no value on
inward purity, which alone is esteemed by<b> </b>God. He therefore rebukes their
ignorance, in not understanding that Christians are pure without the ceremonies
enjoined by the Law; and next he chastises their hypocrisy, in disregarding
uprightness of heart, and occupying themselves with useless exercises. But as
the subject now in hand is not the health of the body, but peace of conscience,
he means nothing else than that the distinction of the kinds of food, which was
in force under the Law, has now been abolished. For the same reason it is
evident, that they do wrong, who impose religious scruples on consciences in
this matter; for this is not a doctrine intended for a single age, but an
eternal oracle of the Holy Spirit, which cannot lawfully be set aside by any new
law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Accordingly, this must be true till the end of the
world, that there is no kind of food which is unlawful in the sight of God; and,
therefore, this passage is fitly and appropriately quoted in opposition to the
tyrannical law of the Pope, which forbids the eating of flesh on certain days.
And yet I am not unacquainted with the sophistical arguments which they employ.
They affirm, that they do not forbid the eating of flesh, because they allege
that it is unclean, (for they acknowledge that all kinds of food are in
themselves clean and pure,) but that abstinence from flesh is enjoined on
another ground, that it has a tendency to tame the lust of the flesh; as if the
Lord had forbidden to eat swine&#8217;s flesh, because he judged swine to be
unclean. Even under the Law the fathers reckoned that everything which God
created is in itself pure and clean; but they held that they were unclean for
this reason, that the use of them was unlawful, because God had forbidden it.
All things are, therefore, pronounced by the Apostle to be pure, with no other
meaning than that the use of all things is free, as regards the conscience.
Thus, if any law binds the consciences to any necessity of abstaining from
certain kinds of food, it wickedly takes away from believers that liberty Which
God had given them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But to the polluted and unbelieving
nothing is pure.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is the second
clause, in which he ridicules the vain and useless precautions of such
instructors. He says that they gain nothing by guarding against uncleanness in
certain kinds of food, because they cannot touch anything that is clean to them.
Why so? Because they are &#8220;polluted,&#8221; and, therefore, by their only
touching those things which were otherwise pure, they become
&#8220;polluted.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the &#8220;polluted&#8221; he adds the
&#8220;unbelieving,&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc26</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> not as being a different class of
persons; but the addition is made for the sake of explanation. Because there is
no purity in the sight of God but that of faith, it follows that all unbelievers
are unclean. By no laws or rules, therefore, will they obtain that cleanness
which they desire to have; because, being themselves &#8220;polluted,&#8221;
they will find nothing in the world that is clean to
them.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc27</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But their mind and conscience are
polluted.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He shows the fountain from
which flows all the filth which is spread over the whole life of man; for,
unless the heart be well purified, although men consider works to have great
splendor, and a sweet smell, yet with God they will excite disgust by their
abominable smell and by their filthiness.</font><br></div>

seen abstaining from one kind of food &#8212; indulge in wantonness and

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But speak thou the things
which become sound doctrine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He points
out the remedy for driving away fables, namely, that Titus should devote himself
to edification. He gives the appellation of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sound
doctrine</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to that which may instruct men
to godliness; for all trifles vanish away, when that which is solid is taught.
When be enjoins him to speak those things which agree with &#8220;sound
doctrine,&#8221; it is as if he had said, that Titus must be continually
employed in this preaching; for to mention these things once or twice would not
be enough. And Paul does not speak of the discourse of a single day; but so long
as Titus shall hold the office of pastor, he wishes him to be employed in
teaching this doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Sound doctrine&#8221; is so called from the
effect produced by it; as, on the contrary, he says, that unskillful men dote
about questions which do no good.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sound</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>therefore, means wholesome, that which actually feeds souls. Thus, by a
single word, as by a solemn proclamation, he banishes from the Church all
speculations which serve rather to promote ostentation than to aid
godliness,</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc29</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> as he did in both of the Epistles to
Timothy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He makes &#8220;sound doctrine&#8221; to consist of
two parts. The first is that which magnifies the grace of God in Christ, from
which we may learn where we ought to seek our salvation; and the second is that
by which the life is framed to the fear of God, and inoffensive conduct.
Although the former, which includes faith, is far more excellent, and therefore
ought to be more zealously inculcated; yet Paul, in writing to Timothy, was not
careful about attending to order; for he had to deal with an intelligent man, to
whom he would offer an insult, if he dictated to him word by word, as is usually
done to apprentices or beginners. Under the person of Titus, indeed, he
instructs the whole church of Crete; yet he attends to the rules of propriety,
that he may not appear to distrust his prudence. Besides, the reason why he is
longer in his exhortations is, that they who gave their whole attention to idle
questions &#8212; needed especially to be exhorted to the practice of a good and
holy life; for nothing is better fitted to restrain the wandering curiosity of
men than to know in what duties</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc30</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> they ought to be
employed.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That aged men be
sober</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He begins with particular duties,
that the discourse may be better adapted to the instruction of the people. And
he does so, not only that he may accommodate himself to their capacity, but that
he may press every one more closely; for a general doctrine produces a less
powerful impression; but when by holding out a few cases, he has instructed
every person about his duty, there is no one who may not easily conclude, that
the Lord has sufficiently instructed him as to the work in which he ought to be
employed. We must not therefore, look for a regular method here; for
Paul&#8217;s design was only to state briefly what were the subjects concerning
which godly teachers ought to speak, and not to undertake to treat largely of
those subjects.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Aged men&#8221; are mentioned by him in the
first place. He wishes them to be &#8220;sober,&#8221; because excessive
drinking is a vice too common among the old. <i>Gravity, </i>which he next
mentions, is procured by well-regulated morals. Nothing thing is more shameful
than for an old man to indulge in youthful wantonness, and, by his countenance,
to strengthen the impudence of the young. In the life of old men, therefore, let
there be displayed
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">semno&gt;thv</font><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;a becoming gravity,&#8221; which shall constrain the young to modesty.
This will be followed chiefly by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>temperance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which he immediately adds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sound in
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. I </i>do not know whether the word
&#8220;sound&#8221; or &#8220;healthy&#8221; contains an indirect allusion to
the various diseases of old men, with which he contrasts this health of the
soul; at least, I think so, though I do not affirm it. With good reason does he
include in these three parts &#8212;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith, love,
patience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> &#8212; </i>the sum of Christian
perfection. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By

calling upon him, nor any exercises of godliness, can be separated from it.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>extends to all the commandments of the second table. Next follows
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>patience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>as the seasoning of &#8220;faith&#8221; and &#8220;love;&#8221; for without
&#8220;patience&#8221; faith would not long endure, and many occurrences are
taking place every day &#8212; instances of unhandsome conduct or evil temper,
which irritate us so much that we should not only be languid, but almost dead,
to the duties of love towards our neighbor, if the same &#8220;patience&#8221;
did not support us.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That aged women in like
manner</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We very frequently see, that
females advanced in age either continue to dress<b> </b>with the lightness of
youthful years, or have something superstitious in their apparel, and seldom hit
the golden mean. Paul wished to guard against both extremes, by enjoining them
to follow a course that is agreeable both to outward propriety and to religion;
or, if you choose to express it in simpler language, to give evidence, by their
very dress, that they are holy and godly women.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He next corrects other two vices, to which they are
often<b> </b>addicted, when he forbids them to be <i>slanderers </i>and
<i>slaves to much wine. </i>Talkativeness is a disease of women, and it is<b>
</b>increased by old age. To this is added, that women never think that they are
eloquent enough, if they are not given to prattling and to slander &#8212; if
they do not attack the characters of all. &#8220;he consequence is, that old
women, by their<b> </b>slanderous talkativeness, as by a lighted torch,
frequently set on fire may houses. Many are also given to drinking, so that,
forgetting modesty and gravity, they indulge in an unbecoming
wantonness</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may teach young

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>young
women</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by their instructions, to a
decent and chaste life. He therefore adds, that by their example they should
train to temperance and gravity those younger women whom the warmth of youth
might otherwise lead into imprudence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To love their husbands and their
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> I do<i> </i>not agree with
those who think that this is a recapitulation of the advices which elderly women
should give to those who are younger for a careful perusal of the context will
enable any one easily to perceive that Paul goes on in explaining the duties of
women, which apply equally to those who are older. Besides, the construction
would be inappropriate,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">swfroni&gt;zwsi, sw&gt;fronav

fc31</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Yet while he instructs elderly females
what they ought to be, he at the same time holds out to the younger the example
which they ought to follow. Thus he indiscriminately teaches both. In short, he
wishes women to be restrained, by conjugal love and affection for their
children, from giving themselves up to licentious attachments, he wishes them to
rule their own house in a sober and orderly manner, forbids them to wander about
in public places, bids them be chaste, and at the same time modest, so as to be
subject to the dominion of their husbands; for those who excel in other virtues
sometimes take occasion from them to act haughtily, so as to be disobedient to
their husbands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that the word of God may not be
evil spoken</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>of, it is supposed that this
relates strictly to women who were married to unbelieving husbands, who might
judge of the gospel from the wicked conduct of their wives; and this appears to
be confirmed by 1 Peter in.1. But what if he does not speak: of husbands alone?
And, indeed, it is probable that he demands such strictness of life as not to
bring the gospel into the contempt of the public by their vices. As to the other
parts of the verse, the reader will find them explained in the Commentary on the
First Epistle to Timothy.</font><br></div>

ambiguity. First, he makes use of the words

the most probable. First, I connect these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of good works in

Titus that, in teaching he shall inculcate the practice of good works, he wishes
that good works, which correspond to this doctrine, may be visible in his life;
and consequently the preposition
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">in</font><font face="Palatino"><i>

What follows is in no degree obscure; for; in order that he may exhibit a

relates (in my opinion) to ordinary life and familiar conversation; for it would
be absurd to interpret it as relating to public instruction, since he only
wishes that Titus, both in his actions and in his words, shall lead a life that
agrees with his preaching. He therefore enjoins that his words shall be pure
and<b> </b>free from all corruption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unblamable
may</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>apply either to the words or the
person of Titus. I prefer the latter view, that the other nouns in the
accusative case (which the Greek syntax easily allows) may depend upon it in
this sense &#8212; &#8221;that thou mayest shew thyself unblamable in gravity,
in integrity, and in sound words.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the adversary may be
ashamed</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Although a Christian man ought to look
at other objects, yet this must not be neglected, to shut the mouth of wicked
men, as we are everywhere taught that we should give no occasion for slander.
Everything that they can seize on as improper in our conduct is maliciously
turned against Christ and his doctrine. The consequence is, that, through our
fault, the sacred name of God is exposed to insult. Accordingly, the more we
perceive that we are keenly observed by enemies, let us be the more attentive to
guard against their calumnies, and thus let their malignity strengthen in us the
desire of doing well.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Servants, that they be
subject to their masters</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It has been
already said that Paul merely glances at some things by way of example, and does
not explain the whole of these subjects, as if he undertook, expressly, to
handle them. Accordingly, when he enjoins servants
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to please their masters in all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>this desire of pleasing must be
limited to those things which are proper; as is evident from other passages of a
similar nature, in which an exception is expressly added, to the effect that
nothing should be done but according to the will of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be authority of others shall be obedient and
submissive. With good reason he does this, for nothing is more contrary to the
natural disposition of man than subjection, and there was danger lest they
should take the gospel as a pretext for becoming more refractory, as reckoning
it unreasonable that they should be subject to the authority of unbelievers. So
much the greater care and diligence ought pastors to use for either subduing or
checking this rebellious spirit.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.

steal.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc36</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The comedies are full of instances of excessively ready talk, by which servants
cheat their masters. Nor was it without reason that an exchange of names took
place in ancient times, by which &#8220;servant &#8220;and &#8220;thief
&#8220;became convertible terms. Thus prudence requires that we make our
instructions apply to the morals of each individual.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By<i>

</i>to act faithfully, without using fraud or doing injury, in transacting the
affairs of their masters.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they may adorn the doctrine of
God our Savior in all things</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This ought
to be a very sharp spur of exhortation to us, when we learn that our becoming
conduct adorns the doctrine of God, which, at the same time, is a mirror of his
glory. And, indeed, we see that this usually happens; as, on the other hand, our
wicked life brings disgrace upon it; for men commonly judge of us from our
works. But this circumstance ought also to be observed, that God deigns to
receive an &#8220;ornament&#8221; from shaves, whose condition was so low and
mean that they were wont to be scarcely accounted men; for he does not mean
&#8220;servants,&#8221; such as we have in the present day, but
slaves,</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc37</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
who were bought with money, and held as property, hike oxen or horses. And if
the life of those men is an ornament to the Christian name, much more let those
who are in honor take care that they do not stain it by their
baseness.</font><br></div>

itself down even to the race of slaves; for, since God does not despise men of
the lowest and most degraded condition, it would be highly unreasonable that we

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ungodliness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i>
I include not only superstitions, in which they had gone astray&#8217;, but
irreligious contempt of God, such as reigns in men, till they have been
enlightened in the knowledge of the truth. Although they have some profession of
religion, yet they never fear and reverence God sincerely and honestly, but, on
the contrary, have consciences that are useless, so that nothing is further from
their thoughts than that they ought to serve
God.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc40</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By worldly

flesh; because we look at nothing but the world, till the Lord has drawn us to
himself. Meditation on the heavenly life begins with regeneration. Before we
have been regenerated, our desires lean towards the world, and rest on the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That we may live temperately, and
righteously, and piously</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As he formerly
mentioned those three, when he wished to give a comprehensive summary of
Christian life, so he now makes it to consist of those three, &#8220;piety,
righteousness, and temperance.&#8221; &#8220;Piety&#8221; is religion towards
God. &#8220;Righteousness&#8221; has place among men. He who is endowed with
both of these lacks nothing for perfect virtue; and, indeed, in the law of God
there is absolute perfection, to which nothing whatever can be added. But as the
exercises of godliness may be regarded as appendages to the first table, so
&#8220;temperance,&#8221; which Paul mentions in this passage, aims at nothing
else than keeping the law, and, as I said before about patience is added to the
former as a seasoning. Nor does the Apostle contradict himself, when at one time
he describes patience, and at another time temperance, as the perfection of a
holy life; for they are not distinct virtues, since
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">swfrosu&gt;nh</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(here translated temperance) includes patience under it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, in this
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc42</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> because the Lord has appointed the
present life for the trial of our faith. Although the fruit of good actions is
not yet visible, yet the hope should be sufficient for stimulating us to doing
well; and this is what he immediately adds, &#8212;
</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Looking for that blessed
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>From the hope of future
immortality he draws an exhortation, and indeed, if that hope be deeply seated
in our mind, it is impossible that it should not lead us to devote ourselves
wholly to God. On time contrary, they who do not cease to live to the world and
to the flesh never have actually tasted what is the worth of the promise of
eternal life; for the Lord, by calling us to heaven, withdraws us from the
earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hope
is</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>here put for the thing hoped for,
otherwise it would be an incorrect mode of expression. He gives this appellation
to the blessed life which is laid up for us in heaven. At the same time he
declares when we shall enjoy it, and what we ought to contemplate, when we
desire or think of our salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the appearing of the glory of
the great God and Savior</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> I interpret
the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glory of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>to mean not only that by which he
shall be glorious in himself, but also that by which he shall than diffuse
himself on all <i>sides, so </i>as to make all his elect partakers of it. He
calls God great, because his greatness &#8212; which men, blinded by the empty
splendor of the world, now extenuate, and sometimes even annihilate, as far as
lies in their power &#8212; shall be fully manifested on the last day. The
luster of the world, while it appears great to our eyes, dazzles them so much
that &#8220;time glory of God&#8221; is, as it were, hidden in darkness. But
Christ, by his coming, shall chase away all the empty Show of the world &#8212;
shall no longer obscure the brightness, shall no longer lessen the magnificence,
of his glory. True the Lord demonstrates his majesty every day by his works; but
because men are prevented by their blindness from seeing it, it is said to be
hidden in obscurity. Paul wishes that believers may now contemplate by faith
that which shall be manifested on the last day, and therefore that God may be
magnified, whom the world either despises, or; at least, does not esteem
according to his excellence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is uncertain whether these words should be read
together thus, &#8220;the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, the great God and our
Savior,&#8221; or separately, as of the Father and the Son, &#8220;the glory of
the great God, and of our Savior, the Lord Jesus
Christ.&#8221;</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc43</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> The Arians, seizing on this latter
sense, have endeavored to prove from it, that the Son is less than the Father,
because here Paul calls the Father &#8220;the great God&#8221; by<i> </i>way of
distinction from the Son. The orthodox teachers of the Church, for the purpose
of shutting out this slander, eagerly contended that both are affirmed of
Christ. But the Arians may be refuted in a few words and by solid argument; for
Paul, having spoken of the revelation of the glory of &#8220;the great
God,&#8221; immediately added &#8220;Christ,&#8221; in order to inform us, that
that revelation of glory will be in his person; as if he had said that, when
Christ shall appear, the greatness of the divine glory shall then be revealed to
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we learn, first, that there is nothing that
ought to render us more active or cheerful in doing good than the hope of the
future resurrection; and, secondly, that believers ought always to have their
eyes fixed on it, that they may not grow weary in the right course; for, if we
do not wholly depend upon it, we shall continually be carried away to the
vanities of the world. But, since the coming of the Lord to judgment might
excite terror in us, Christ is held out to us as our &#8220;Savior,&#8221; who
will also be our judge.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who gave himself for
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is<i> </i>another argument of
exhortation, drawn from the design or effect of the death of Christ, who offered
himself for us, that he might redeem us from the bondage of sin, and purchase us
to himself as his heritage. His grace, therefore, necessarily brings along with
it &#8220;newness of life,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:4,) because they who still are the slaves of sin make void the blessing of
redemption; but now we are released from the bondage of sin, in order that we
may serve the righteousness of God; and, therefore, he immediately added,
&#8212; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peculiar people, zealous of good
works</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by which he means that, so far as
concerns us, the fruit of redemption is lost, if we are still entangled by the
sinful desires of the world. And in order to express more fully, that we have
been consecrated to good works by the death of Christ, he makes use of the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>purify</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for it would be truly base in us to be again polluted by the same filth from
which the Son of God hath washed us by his
blood.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc44</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak these things, and
exhort, and reprove</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This conclusion is
of the same meaning as if he enjoined Titus to dwell continually on that
doctrine of edification, and never to grow weary, because it cannot be too much
inculcated. He likewise bids him add the spurs of &#8220;exhortations and
reproofs;&#8221; for men are not sufficiently admonished as to their duty, if
they be not also vehemently urged to the performance of it. He who understands
those things which the Apostle has formerly stated, and who has them always in
his mouth, will have ground not only for teaching, but likewise for
correcting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With all
authority</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I<i> </i>do not agree with
Erasmus, who translates
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpitagh&gt;</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>&#8220;diligence in commanding.&#8221; There is greater probability in the
opinion of Chrysostom who interprets it to mean severity against more atrocious
sins; through I do not think that even he has hit the Apostle&#8217;s meaning;
which is, that Titus should claim authority and respect for himself in teaching
these things. For men given to curious inquiries, and eager about trifles,
dislike the commandments to lead a pious and holy, life as being too common and
vulgar. In order that Titus may meet this disdain, he is enjoined to add the
weight of his authority to his doctrine. It is with the same view (in my
opinion) that he immediately adds, &#8212; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let no man despise
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Others think that Titus is
instructed to gain the ear of men, and their respect for him, by the integrity
of his life; and. it is indeed true that holy and blameless conduct imparts
authority to instruction. But Paul had another object in view; for here he
addresses the people rather than Titus. Because many had ears so delicate, that
they despised the simplicity of the gospel; because they had such an itch for
novelty, that hardly any space was left for edification; he beats down the
haughtiness of such men, and strictly charges them to desist from despising, in
any way, sound and useful doctrine. This confirms the remark which I made at the
outset, that this Epistle was written to the inhabitants of Crete rather than to
any single
individual.</font><br><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">CHAPTER

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Remind them to be subject to
principalities and powers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>From many
passages it is evident that the Apostles had great difficulty in keeping the
common people subject to the authority of magistrates and princes. We are all by
nature desirous of power; and the consequence is, that no one willingly is
subject to another. Besides, perceiving that nearly all the principalities and
powers of the world</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc45</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> were at that time opposed to Christ they
thought them unworthy of receiving any honor. The Jews especially, being an
untamable race, did not cease to mutiny and rage. Thus, after having spoken of
particular duties, Paul now wishes to give a general admonition to all, to
observe peaceably the order of civil government, to submit to the laws, to obey
magistrates. That subjection to princes, and that obedience to magistrates,
which he demands, is extended to edicts, and laws, and other parts of civil
government.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he immediately adds, To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be ready for every good
work</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>may<i> </i>be applied to the same
subject, as if he had said, &#8220;All who do not refuse to lead a good and
virtuous life, will cheerfully yield obedience to magistrates.&#8221; For, since
they have been appointed for the preservation of mankind, he who desires to have
them removed, or shakes off their yoke, is an enemy of equity and justice, and
is therefore devoid of all humanity. Yet if any prefer to interpret it without
any immediate relation to the context, I have no objection; and indeed there can
be no doubt that, in this sentence, he recommends to them kind offices towards
their neighbors throughout their whole
life.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To speak evil of no
one</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now lays down the method of
maintaining peace and friendship with all men. We know that there is nothing to
which the disposition of every man is more prone than to despise others in
comparison of himself. The consequence is, that many are proud of the gifts of
God; and this is accompanied by contempt for their brethren, which is
immediately followed by insult. He therefore forbids Christians to glory over
others, or to reproach them, whatever may be their own superior excellence. Yet
he does not wish them to flatter the vices of wicked men; he only condemns the
propensity to slander.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not given to
fighting</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As if he had said,
&#8220;Quarrels and<b> </b>contentions must be avoided.&#8221; The old
translation has therefore rendered it better, <i>Not quarrelsome; </i>for there
are other ways of fighting than the sword or the fist. And from what follows it
is evident that this is the meaning; for he points out the remedies for the
evil, when he enjoins them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to be
kind, and to shew all meekness towards all
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for &#8220;kindness&#8221; is
contrasted with the utmost rigor of law, and &#8220;meekness&#8221; with
bitterness. If, therefore, we are disposed to avoid every kind of contentions
and fighting, let us learn, first, to moderate many things by gentleness, and
next to bear with many things; for they who are excessively severe and
ill-tempered carry with them a fire to kindle strife.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>towards all
men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in order to intimate that he should
bear with even the lowest and meanest persons. Believers, holding wicked men in
contempt, did not think them worthy of any forbearance. Such severity, which
arises from nothing else than pride, Paul wished to
correct.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we
ourselves</i></font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc46</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> also were formerly
foolish</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Nothing is better adapted to
subdue our pride, and at the same time to moderate our severity, than when it is
strewn that everything that we turn against others may fall back on our own
head; for he forgives easily who is compelled to sue for pardon in return. And
indeed, ignorance of our own faults is the only cause that renders us unwilling
to forgive our brethren. They who have a true zeal for God, are, indeed, severe
against those who sin; but, because they begin with themselves, their severity
is always attended by compassion. In order that believers, therefore, may not
haughtily and cruelly mock at others, who are still held in ignorance and
blindness, Paul brings back to their remembrance what sort of persons they
formerly were; as if he had said, &#8220;If such fierce treatment is done to
those on whom God has not yet bestowed the light of the gospel, with equally
good reason might you have been at one time harshly treated. Undoubtedly you
would not have wished that any person should be so cruel to you; exercise now,
therefore, the same moderation towards others.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the words of Paul, there are two things that need
to be<b> </b>understood. The first is, that they who have now been enlightened
by the Lord, being humbled by the remembrance of their former ignorance, should
not exalt themselves proudly over others, or treat them with greater harshness
and severity than that which, they think, ought to have been exercised towards
themselves when they were what those now are. The second is, that they should
consider, from what has taken place in their own persons, that they who to-day
are strangers may to-morrow be received into the Church, and, having been led to
amendment of heir<b> </b>sinful practices, may become partakers of the gifts of
God, of which they are now destitute. There is a bright mirror of both in
believers, who</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;at one time were
darkness, and afterwards began</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">to
be light in the Lord.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
5:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The knowledge of their former condition should
therefore dispose them to
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sumpa&gt;qeian</font><font face="Palatino">
fellow-feeling. On the other hand, the grace of God, which they now enjoy, is a
proof that others may be brought to salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus we see that we must be humbled before God, in
order that we may be gentle towards brethren; for pride is always cruel and
disdainful of others. In another passage,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;480601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:1,) where he exhorts us to mildness, he advises every one to remember his own
weakness. Here he goes farther, for he bids us remember those vices from which
we have been delivered, that we may not pursue too keenly those which, still
dwell in others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, seeing that here Paul describes briefly the
natural disposition of men, such as it is before it is renewed by the Spirit of
God, we may behold, in this description, how wretched we are while we are out of
Christ. First, he calls unbelievers <i>foolish, </i>because the whole wisdom of
men is mere vanity, so long as they do not know God. Next, he calls them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>disobedient</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>because, as it is faith alone that truly obeys God, so unbelief is always
wayward and rebellious; although we might translate
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajpeiqei~v</font><font face="Palatino">
<i>unbelieving, so </i>as to describe the kind of &#8220;foolishness.&#8221;
Thirdly, he says that unbelievers <i>go astray; </i>for Christ alone is
&#8220;the way&#8221; and the &#8220;light of the world.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;430812&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
8:12; 14:6.) All who are estranged from God must therefore wander and go astray
during their whole life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hitherto he has described the nature of unbelief; but
now he likewise adds the fruits which proceed from it, namely, <i>various
desires and pleasures, envy, malice, </i>and such like. It is true that each
person is not equally chargeable with every vice; but, seeing that all are the
slaves of wicked desires, although some are carried away by one and others by
another desire, Paul embraces in a general
statement</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc47</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> all the fruits that are anywhere
produced by unbelief This subject is explained towards the chose of the first
chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, since Paul, by these marks, distinguishes
the children of God from unbelievers, if we wish to be accounted believers, we
must have our heart cleansed from all envy, and from all malice; and we must
both love and be beloved. It is unreasonable that those desires should reign in
us, which are there called &#8220;&#8216;various,&#8221; for this reason, in my
opinion, that the lusts by which a carnal man is driven about are like opposing
billows, which, by fighting against each other, turn the man hither and thither,
so that he changes and vacillates almost every moment. Such, at least, is the
restlessness of all who abandon themselves to carnal desires; because there is
no stability but in time fear of God.</font><br></div>

Thus it will be proper to supply, that they were changed for the better, and
became new men, in consequence of God having mercy upon them; as if he had said,
When God regenerated you by his Spirit, then did you begin to differ from
others. But since there is a complete sense in the words of Paul, there is no
necessity for making any addition. He classes himself along with others, in

might be asked, &#8212; &#8221;Did the goodness of God begin to be made known to
the world at the time when Christ was manifested in the flesh? For certainly,
from the beginning, the fathers both knew and experienced that God was good, and
kind, and gracious to them; and therefore this was not the first manifestation
of his goodness, and fatherly love towards us,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The answer is easy. in no other way did the fathers
taste the goodness of God under the Law, than by looking at Christ, on whose
coming all their faith rested. Thus the goodness of God is said to have
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>appeared</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>when he exhibited a pledge of it, and gave actual demonstration, that not in
vain did he so often promise salvation to men.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;God so loved the
world&#8221;, says John, &#8220;that he gave his only-begotten Son.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">Paul also says in another passage,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Hereby God

us.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Romans
5:8.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is a customary way of speaking in Scripture, that
the world was reconciled to God through the death of Christ, although we know
that he was a kind Father in all ages. But because we find no cause of the love
of God toward us, and no ground of our salvation, but in Christ, not without
good reason is God the Father said to have strewn his goodness to us in
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet there is a different reason for it in this
passage, in which Paul speaks, not of that ordinary manifestation of Christ
which took place when he came as a man into the world, but of the manifestation
which is made by the gospel, when he exhibits and reveals himself, in a peculiar
manner, to the elect. At the first coming of Christ, Paul was not renewed; but,
on the contrary, Christ was raised in glory, and salvation through his name
shone upon many, not only in Judea, but throughout the neighboring countries,
while Paul, blinded by unbelief, labored to extinguish this grace<b> </b>by
every means in his power. He therefore means that the grace of God
&#8220;appeared&#8221; both to himself and to others, when they were enlightened
in the knowledge of the gospel. And indeed, in no other way could these words
apply; for he does not speak indiscriminately about the men of his age, but
specially addresses those who had been separated from the ordinary ranks; as if
he had said, that formerly they resembled those unbelievers who were still
plunged in darkness, but that now they differ from them, not through their own
merit, but by the grace of God; in the same manner as he beats down all the
haughtiness of the flesh by the same argument. &#8220;Who maketh thee to
differ,&#8221; or to be more highly, esteemed than others?
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;460407&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Goodness and
love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.<b> </b></i>He has with propriety
assigned the first rank to &#8220;goodness,&#8221; which prompts God to love us;
for God will never find in us anything which he ought to love, but he loves us
because he is good and merciful. Besides, although he testifies his goodness and
love to all, yet we know it by faith only, when he declares himself to be our<b>
</b>Father in Christ. Before Paul was called to the faith of Christ, he enjoyed
innumerable gifts of God, which might have given him a taste of God&#8217;s
fatherly kindness; he had been educated, from his infancy, in the doctrine of
the law; yet he wanders in darkness, so as not to perceive the goodness of God,
till the Spirit enlightened his mind, and till Christ came forth as the witness
and pledge of the grace of God<b> </b>the Father, from which, but for him, we
are all excluded Thus he means that the kindness of God is not revealed and
known but by the light of faith.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not by
works</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font color="Maroon">
fc48</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Let us remember that here Paul addresses
his discourse to believers, and describes the manner in which they entered into
the kingdom of God. He affirms that by their works they did not at all deserve
that they should become partakers of salvation, or that they should be
reconciled to God through faith; but he says that they obtained this blessing
solely through the mercy of God. We therefore conclude from his words, that we
bring nothing to God, but that he goes before us by his pure grace, without any
regard to works. For when he says, &#8212; &#8220;Not by works which we have
done&#8221;, he means, that we can do nothing but sin till we have been renewed
by God. This negative statement depends on the former affirmation, by which he
said that they were foolish and disobedient, and led away by various desires,
till they were created anew in Christ; and indeed, what good work could proceed
from so corrupt a mass?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is madness, therefore, to allege that a man
approaches to God by his own &#8220;preparations,&#8221; as they call them
During the whole period of life they depart further and further from him, until
he puts forth his hand, and brings them back into<b> </b>that path from which
they had gone astray. In short, that we, rather than others, have been admitted
to enjoy the salivation of Christ, is altogether ascribed by Paul to the mercy
of God, because there were no works of righteousness in us. This argument would
have no weight, if he did not take for granted, that everything that we attempt
to do before we believe, is unrighteous and hateful to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which we had
done.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To argue<i> </i>from the preterite
tense of this verb, that God looks at the future merits of men when he calls
them, is sophistical and foolish. &#8220;When Paul,&#8221; say they,
&#8220;denies that God is induced &#8216;by our merits to bestow his grace upon
us, he limits the statement to the past time; and therefore, if it is only for
the righteousness going before that no room is left, future righteousness is
admitted to consideration. But they assume a principle, which Paul everywhere
rejects, when he declares that election by free grace is the foundation of good
works. If we owe it entirely to the grace of God, that we are fit for living a
holy life, what future works of ours will God look upon? If, previously to our
being called by God, iniquity holds such dominion over us, that it will not
cease to make progress till it come to its height, how can God be induced, by a
regard to our righteousness, to call us? Away then with such trifling! When Paul
spoke of past works, his sole object was to exclude all merits. The meaning of
his words is as if he had said, &#8212; &#8221;If we boast of any merit, what
sort of works had we?&#8221; This maxim holds good, that men would not be better
than they were before, if the Lord did not make them better by his
calling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He hath saved
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He speaks of faith, and shews that
we have already obtained salvation. Although, so long as we are held by the
entanglements <i>of </i>sin, we carry about a body of death, yet we are certain
<i>of </i>our salvation, provided that we are ingrafted into Christ by faith,
according to that saying, &#8212;</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He that believeth

<div><font face="Palatino">Yet, shortly afterwards, by introducing the word
<i>faith, </i>the Apostle will shew that we have not yet actually attained what
Christ procured for us by his death. Hence it follows, that, on the part of God,
our salvation is completed, while the full enjoyment of it is delayed till the
end of our warfare. And that is what the same Apostle teaches in another
passage, that &#8220;we are saved by hope.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450824&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:24.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>washing of
regeneration</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have no doubt that he
alludes, at least, to baptism, and even I will not object to have this passage
expounded as relating to baptism; not that salvation is contained in the outward
symbol of water, but because baptism sells to us the salvation obtained by
Christ. Paul treats of the exhibition of the grace of God, which, we have said,
has been made by faith. Since therefore a part of revelation consists in
baptism, that is, so far as it is intended to confirm our faith, he properly
makes mention of it. Besides, baptism &#8212; being the entrance into the Church
and the symbol of our ingrafting into Christ &#8212; is here appropriately
introduced by Paul, when he intends to shew in what manner the grace of God
appeared to us; so that the strain of the passage runs thus: &#8212; &#8220;God
hath saved us<b> </b>by his mercy, the symbol and pledge of which he gave in
baptism, by admitting us into his Church, and ingrafting us into the body of his
Son.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the Apostles are wont to draw an argument from
the Sacraments, to prove that which is there exhibited under a figure, because
it ought to be held by believers as a settled principle, that God does not sport
with us by unmeaning figures, but inwardly accomplishes by his power what he
exhibits by the outward sign; and therefore, baptism is fitly and truly said to
be &#8220;the washing of regeneration.&#8221; The efficacy and use of the
sacraments will be properly understood by him who shall connect the sign and the
thing signified, in Such a manner as not to make the sign unmeaning and
inefficacious, and who nevertheless shall not, for the sake of adorning the:
sign, take away from the Holy Spirit what belongs to him. Although by baptism
wicked men are neither washed nor renewed, yet it retains that power, so far as
relates to God, because, although they reject the grace of God, still it is
offered to them. But here Paul addresses believers, in whom baptism is always
efficacious, and in whom, therefore, it is properly connected with its truth and
efficacy. But by this mode <i>of </i>expression we are reminded that, <i>if
</i>we do not wish to annihilate holy baptism, we must prove its efficacy by
&#8220;newness of life.&#8221;

fc49</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> Though he mentioned the sign, that he
might exhibit to our view the grace of God, yet, that we may not fix our whole
attention on the sign, he immediately sends us to the Spirit, that we may know
that we are washed by his power, and not by water, agreeably to what is said,
&#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">And indeed, the words of Paul agree so completely
with the words of the Prophet, that it appears clearly that both of them say the
same thing. For this reason I said at the commencement, that Paul, while he
speaks directly about the Holy Spirit, at tine same time alludes to baptism. It
is therefore the Spirit of God who regenerates us, and makes us new creatures;
but because his grace is invisible and hidden, a visible symbol of it is beheld

baptized without any distinction; for, while he shews that the &#8220;washing

signified, in which the truth of the sign exists.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he, says,

he has received, so much the more is he under obligations to the mercy of God,
which alone enriches us; for in ourselves we are altogether poor, and destitute
of everything good. If it be objected that not all the children of God enjoy so
great abundance, but, on the contrary, the grace of God drops sparingly on many;
the answer is, that no one has received so small a measure that he may not be
justly accounted rich; for tine smallest drop of the Spirit (so to speak)
resembles an ever-flowing fountain, which never dries up. It is therefore a
sufficient reason for calling it &#8220;abundance,&#8221; that, how small soever
the portion that has been given to us it is never exhausted.</font><br></div>

of the Spirit, who is the earnest and witness of our adoption. Paul therefore
teaches us by this word, that the Spirit of regeneration is bestowed on none but
those who are the members of
Christ.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That being justified by his
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> If<i> </i>we understand
&#8220;regeneration &#8220;in its strict and ordinary meaning, it might be
thought that the Apostle employs the word &#8220;justified&#8220; instead of
&#8220;regenerated;&#8221; and this is sometimes the meaning of it, but very
seldom; yet there is no necessity which constrains us to depart from its strict
and more natural signification. The design of Paul is, to ascribe to the grace
of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>all that we are, and all that we have, so that we may not exalt ourselves
proudly against others. Thus he now extols the mercy of God, <i>by </i>ascribing
to it entirely the cause of our salvation. But because he had spoken of the
vices of unbelievers, it would have been improper to leave out the grace of
regeneration, which is the medicine for curing them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Still this does not prevent him from returning
immediately to praise divine mercy; and he even mingles both blessings together
&#8212; that our sins have been freely pardoned, and that we have been renewed
so as to obey God. This, at least, is evident, that Paul maintains that
&#8220;justification&#8217;, is the free gift of God; and the only question is,
what he means by the word justified. The contest seems to demand that its
meaning shall be extended further than to the imputation of righteousness; and
in this larger sense it is seldom (as I have said) employed by Paul; yet there
is nothing that hinders the meaning of it from being limited to the forgiveness
of sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says, by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>this applies both to Christ and
to the Father, and we ought not to contend for either of these expositions,
because it will always hold good, that, by the grace of God, we have obtained
righteousness through Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Heirs according to the hope of
eternal life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This clause is added by
way of exposition. He had said that we have been saved through the mercy of
God.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc51</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But our salvation is as yet hidden; and therefore he now says that we are heirs
of life, not because we have arrived at the present possession of it, but
because hope brings to us full and complete certainly of it. The meaning may be
thus summed up. &#8220;Having been dead, we were restored to life through the
grace of Christ, when God the: Father bestowed on us his Spirit, by whose power
we have been purified. and renewed. Our salvation consists in this; but, because
we are still in the world, we do not yet enjoy &#8216;eternal life,&#8217; but
only obtain it by &#8216;hoping.&#8217;&#8221;</font><br></div>

disregard other matters, and to teach those which are certain and undoubted
&#8212; to press them on the attention of their hearers &#8212; to dwell upon
them &#8212; while others talk idly about things of little importance. Hence
also, we conclude that a bishop must not make any assertions at random, but must
assert those things only which he has ascertained to be true. &#8220;Affirm
these things,&#8221; says he, &#8220;because they are true and worthy of
credit.&#8221; But we are reminded, on the other hand, that it is the duty and
office of a bishop to affirm strongly, and maintain boldly, those things which
are believed on good grounds, and which edify godliness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they who have believed God may
be careful to excel in good works,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>(or,
<i>to extol good works, </i>or, <i>to assign to them the highest rank.) </i>He
includes all the instructions which he formerly gave concerning the duty of
every person, and the desire of leading a religious and holy life; as if he
contrasted the fear of God, and well-regulated conduct, with idle speculations.
He wishes the people to be instructed in such a manner that &#8220;they who have
believed God,&#8221; may be solicitous, above all things, about good
works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But, as the verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">proi`&gt;stasqai</font><font face="Palatino"><i>

for various interpretations. Chrysostom: explains it to mean, that they should
endeavor to relieve their neighbors by giving alms.
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Proi`&gt;stasqai</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>does sometimes mean &#8220;to give assistance;&#8221; but in that case the
syntax would require us to understand that the &#8220;good works &#8220;should
be aided, which would be a harsh construction. The meaning conveyed by the
French word <i>avancer, &#8220;</i>to go forward,&#8221; would be more
appropriate. What if we should say, &#8212; &#8221;Let them strive as those who
have the pre-eminence?&#8221; That is also one meaning of the word. Or, perhaps,
some one will prefer what I have enclosed in brackets: &#8220;Let them be
careful to assign the highest rank to good works.&#8221; And certainly it would
not be unsuitable that Paul should enjoin that those things should prevail in
the life of believers, because they are usually disregarded by
others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whatever may be the ambiguity of the expression, the
meaning of Paul is sufficiently clear, that the design of Christian doctrine is,
that believers should exercise themselves in good
works.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc53</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus he wishes them to give to it their study and application; and, when the
Apostle says,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">fronti&gt;zwsi</font><font face="Palatino"><i>

useless contemplations of those who speculate without advantage, and without
regard to active life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Yet he is not so careful about good works as to
despise the root &#8212; that is, faith &#8212; while he is gathering the
fruits. He takes account of both parts, and, as is highly proper, assigns the
first rank to faith; for he enjoins those &#8220;who believed in God&#8221; to
be zealous of &#8220;good works;&#8221; by which he means that faith must go
before in such a manner that good works may follow.</font><br></div>

doctrine rather than to the works, in this sense: &#8220;It is excellent and

formerly exhorted Titus to be zealous in affirming are the same things that are
good and useful to<b> </b>men.&#8221; We might translate

&#8220;beautiful,&#8221; or &#8220;honorable;&#8221; but, in my opinion, it
would be best to translate it &#8220;excellent.&#8221; He states indirectly that
all other things that are taught are of no value, because they yield no profit
or advantage; as, on the contrary, that which contributes to salvation is worthy
of praise.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But avoid foolish
questions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is no necessity for
debating long about the exposition of this passage. He contrasts
&#8220;questions&#8221; with sound and certain doctrine. Although it is
necessary to seek, in order to find, yet there is a limit to seeking, that you
may understand what is useful to be known, and, next, that you may adhere firmly
to the truth, when it has been known. Those who inquire curiously into
everything, and are never at rest, may be truly called Questionarians. In short,
what the schools of the Sorbonne account worthy of the highest praise &#8212; is
here condemned by Paul; for the whole theology of the Papists is nothing else
than a labyrinth of questions. He calls <i>them
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>foolish</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>not that, at first sight, they appear to be such, (for, on the contrary,
they often deceive by a vain parade of wisdom,) but because they contribute
nothing to godliness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>genealogies</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he mentions one class of &#8220;foolish questions;&#8221; for instance, when
curious men, forgetting to gather fruit from the sacred histories, seize on the
lineage of races, and trifles of that nature, with which they weary themselves
without advantage. Of that folly we spoke towards the beginning of the First
apostle to Timothy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He properly adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>contentions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>because in &#8220;questions&#8221; the prevailing spirit is ambition; and,
therefore, it is impossible but that they shall immediately break forth into
&#8220;contention&#8221; and quarrels; for there every one wishes to be the
conqueror. This is accompanied by hardihood in affirming about things that are
uncertain, which unavoidably leads to debates</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And fightings about the
law</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He gives this disdainful
appellation to those debates which were raised by the Jews under the presence of
the law; not that the law of itself produces them, but because the Jews,
pretending to defend the law, disturbed the peace of the Church by their absurd
controversies about the observation of ceremonies, about the distinction of the
kinds of food and things of that nature.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For they are
unprofitable</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unnecessary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>In doctrine, therefore, we should always have regard to usefulness, so that
everything that does not contribute to godliness. shall be held in no
estimation. And yet those sophists, in babbling about things. of no value,
undoubtedly boasted of them as highly worthy and useful to be known; but Paul
does not acknowledge them to possess any usefulness, unless they tend to the
increase of faith and to a holy life.</font><br></div>

there will be no end of quarrels and dispute, if we wish to conquer obstinate
men by argument; for they will never want words, and they will derive fresh
courage from impudence, so that they will never grow weary of fighting. Thus,
after having given orders to Titus as to the form of doctrine which he should
lay down, he now forbids him to waste much time in debating with heretics,
because battle would lead to battle and dispute to dispute. Such is the cunning
of Satan, that, by the impudent talkativeness of such men, he entangles good and
faithful pastors, so as to draw them away from diligence in teaching. We must
therefore beware lest we become engaged in quarrelsome disputes; for we shall
never have leisure to devote our labors to the Lord&#8217;s flock, and
contentious men will never cease to annoy us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he commands him to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>avoid</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>such persons, it is as if he said that he must not toil hard to satisfy
them, and even that there is nothing better than to cut off the handle for
fighting which they are eager to find. This is a highly necessary admonition;
for even they who would willingly take no part in strifes of words are sometimes
drawn by shame into controversy, because they think that it would be shameful
cowardice to quit the field. Besides, there is no temper, however mild, that is
not liable to be provoked by the fierce taunts of enemies, because they look
upon it as intolerable that those men should attack the truth, (as they are
accustomed to do,) and that none should reply. Nor are there wanting men who are
either of a combative disposition, or excessively hot-tempered, who are eager
for battle. On the contrary, Paul does not wish that the servant of Christ
should be much and long employed in debating with heretics.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must now see what he means by the word heretic.
There is a common and well-known distinction between a heretic and a schismatic.
But here, in my opinion, Paul disregards that distinction: for, by the term
&#8220;heretic&#8221; he describes not only those who cherish and defend an
erroneous or perverse doctrine, but in general all who do not yield assent to
the sound doctrine which he laid down a little before. Thus under this name he
includes all ambitious, unruly, contentious parsons, who, led away by sinful
passions, disturb the peace of the Church, and raise disputings. In short, every
person who, by his overweening pride, breaks up the unity of the Church, is
pronounced by Paul to be &#8220;heretic.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must exercise moderation, so as not instantly
to declare<b> </b>every man to be a &#8220;heretic&#8221; who does not agree
with our opinion. There are some matters on which Christians may differ from
each other, without being divided into sects. Paul himself commands that they
shall not be so divided, when he bids them keep their harmony unbroken, and wait
for the revelation of God.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;500316&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
3:16.) But whenever the obstinacy of any person grows to such an extent, that,
led by selfish motives, he either separates from the body, or draws away some of
the flock, or interrupts the course of sound doctrine, in such a case we must
boldly resist.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In a word, a heresy or sect and the unity of the
Church &#8212;  are things totally opposite to each other. Since the unity of
the Church is dear to God, and ought to be held by us in the highest estimation,
we ought to entertain the strongest abhorrence of heresy. Accordingly, the name
of sect or heresy, though philosophers and statesmen reckon it to be honorable,
is justly accounted infamous among Christians. We now understand who are meant
by Paul, when he bids us dismiss and avoid heretics. But at the same time we
ought to observe what immediately follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>After the first and second
admonition</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for neither shall we have a
right to pronounce a man to be a heretic, nor shall we be at liberty to reject
him, till we have first endeavored to bring him back to sound
views.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc54</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He does not mean any &#8220;admonition,&#8221; whatever, or that of a private
individual, but an &#8220;admonition&#8221; given by a minister, with the public
authority of the Church; for the meaning of the Apostle&#8217;s words is as if
he had said, that heretics must be rebuked with solemn and severe
censure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They who infer from this passage, that the supporters
of wicked doctrines must be restrained by excommunication alone, and that no
rigorous measures beyond this must be used against them, do not argue
conclusively. There is a difference between the duties of a bishop and those of
a magistrate. Writing to Titus, Paul does not treat of the office of a
magistrate, but points out what belongs to a
bishop.</font><sup><font color="Maroon"> fc55</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Yet moderation is always best, that, instead of being restrained by force and
violence, they may be corrected by the discipline of the Church, if there be any
ground to believe that they can be
cured.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.

some part, but completely demolished, so that it is incapable of being
repaired.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He next points out the sign of this ruin &#8212; an
evil conscience, when he says, that they who do not yield to admonitions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>are condemned by
themselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for, since they obstinately
reject the truth, it is certain that they sin willfully and of their own accord,
and therefore it would be of no advantage to admonish them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, we learn from Paul&#8217;s words
that we must not rashly or at random pronounce any man to be a heretic; for he
says, &#8220;Knowing that he who is such is ruined.&#8221; Let the bishop
therefore beware lest, by indulging his passionate temper, he treat with
excessive harshness, as a heretic, one whom he does not yet know to be
such.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Zenas a
lawyer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is uncertain whether
&#8220;Zenas&#8221;, was a Doctor of the Civil Law or of the Law of Moses; but
as we may learn from Paul&#8217;s words that he was a poor man and needed the
help of others, it is probable that he belonged to the same rank with
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Apollo</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that is, an expounder of the Law of God among the Jews. It more frequently
happens that such persons are in want of the necessaries of life than those who
conduct causes in civil courts. I have said that Zenas&#8217;s poverty may be
inferred from the words of Paul, because the expression,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>conduct
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>means here to supply him with the
means of accomplishing his journey, as is evident from what<b>
</b>follows.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b><i>.

burden, may not complain of being loaded with the expense, he reminds them that
they must not be <i>unfruitful, </i>and that therefore they must be warmly
exhorted to be zealous in good works. But of this mode of expression we have
already spoken. Whether, therefore, he enjoins them to excel in good works, or
to assign the highest rank to good works, he means that it is useful for them to
have an opportunity afforded for exercising liberality, that they may not
&#8220;be unfruitful&#8221; on this ground, that there is no opportunity, or
that it is not demanded by necessity. What follows has been already explained in
the other Epistles.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">THE singular loftiness of the mind of Paul, though it
may be seen to greater advantage in his other writings which treat of weightier
matters, is also attested by this Epistle, in which, while he handles a subject
otherwise low and mean, he rises to God with his wonted elevation. Sending back
a runaway slave and thief, he supplicates pardon for him. But in pleading this
cause, he discourses about Christian forbearance 
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">fd1</font></sup><font face="Palatino"> with
such ability, that he appears to speak about the interests of the whole Church
rather than the private affairs of a single individual. In behalf of a man of
the lowest condition, he demeans himself so modestly and humbly, that nowhere
else is the meekness of his temper painted in a more lively
manner.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
A prisoner of Jesus Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In the same sense
in which he elsewhere calls himself an Apostle of Christ, or a minister of
Christ, he now calls himself &#8220;a prisoner of Christ;&#8221; because the
chains by which he was bound on account of the gospel, were the ornaments or
badges of that embassy which he exercised for Christ. Accordingly, he mentions
them for the sake of strengthening his authority; not that he was afraid of
being despised, (for Philemon undoubtedly had so great reverence and esteem for
him, that there was no need of assuming any title,) but because he was about to
plead the cause of a runaway slave, the principal part of which was entreaty for
forgiveness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To Philemon our friend and
fellow-laborer</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is probable that this
&#8220;Philemon&#8221; belonged to the order of pastors; for the title with
which he adorns him, when he calls him <i>fellow-laborer</i>, is a title which
he is not accustomed to bestow on a private
individual.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>2.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to Archippus our
fellow-soldier</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He next adds
&#8220;Archippus,&#8221; who appears also to have been a minister of the Church;
at least, if he be the same person who is mentioned towards the conclusion of
the Epistle to the Colossians,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;510417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
4:17,) which is not at all improbable; for the designation &#8212;
&#8221;fellow-soldier&#8221; &#8212; which he bestows on this latter individual,
belongs peculiarly to ministers. Although the condition of a soldier belongs to
all Christians universally, yet because teachers may be regarded as
standardbearers in the warfare, they ought to be ready more than all others to
fight, and Satan usually gives them greater annoyance. It is also possible, that
Archippus attended and shared in some contests which Paul maintained; and,
indeed, this is the very word that Paul makes use of, whenever he mentions
persecutions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to the Church which is in thy
house. </i></font><font face="Palatino">By employing these terms, he bestows the
highest praise on the family of Philemon. And certainly it is no small praise of
a householder, that he regulates his family in such a manner as to be an image
of the Church, and to discharge also the duty of a pastor within the walls of
his dwelling. Nor must we forget to mention that this good man had a wife of the
same character; for she, too, not without reason, is commended by
Paul.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>4.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I give thanks to my
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It deserves attention, that he at the same
time prays for that very thing for which he &#8220;gives thanks.&#8221; Even the
most perfect, so long as they live in the world, never have so good ground for
congratulation as not to need prayers, that God may grant to them, not only to
persevere till the end, but likewise to make progress from day to
day.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>5.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hearing of thy love and
faith.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This praise, which he bestows on
Philemon, includes briefly the whole perfection of a Christian man. It consists
of two parts, faith in Christ, and love towards our neighbors; for to these all
the actions and all the duties of our life relate. Faith is said to be in
Christ, because to him it especially looks; in like manner as in no other way
than through him alone can God the Father be known, and in no other than in Him
can we find any of the blessings which faith seeks.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And towards all saints.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He does not thus limit this <i>love</i> to the
<i>saints,</i> as if there ought to be none towards others; for, since the
doctrine of &#8220;love&#8221; is, that &#8220;we should not despise our flesh,
(Isaiah 53:7) and that we should honor the image of God which is engraven on our
nature, undoubtedly it includes all mankind. But since they that are of the
household of faith are united with us by a closer bond of relationship, and
since God peculiarly recommends them to us, for this reason they justly hold the
highest rank.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The arrangement of the passage is somewhat confused;
but there is no obscurity in the meaning, except that it is doubtful whether the
adverb
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>always</i></font><font face="Palatino">
(in the 4th verse) is connected with the first clause, &#8220;I give thanks
always to my God,&#8221; or with the second clause, &#8220;making mention of
thee always in my prayers.&#8221; The meaning may be brought out in this manner,
that, whenever the Apostle offered prayer for Philemon, he interwove
thanksgiving with it; that is, because Philemon&#8217;s piety afforded ground of
rejoicing; for we often pray for those in whom nothing is to be found but what
gives occasion for grief and tears. Yet the second mode of pointing is generally
preferred, that Paul &#8220;gives thanks for Philemon, and always makes mention
of him in his prayers.&#8221; Let my readers be at full liberty to judge for
themselves; but, for my own part, I think that the former meaning is more
appropriate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the rest of the passage there is an inversion of
the natural order; for, after having spoken of &#8220;love&#8221; and
&#8220;faith,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;towards Christ and towards saints,&#8221;
while, on the contrary, the contrast would demand that &#8220;Christ&#8221;
should be put in the second part of the clause as the object to which our faith
looks.
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">Fd2</font></sup><br><font face="Palatino"><b>6.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That the communication of thy
faith may be effectual</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This clause is somewhat
obscure; but I shall endeavor to elucidate it in such a manner that my readers
may somewhat understand Paul&#8217;s meaning. First, it ought to be known that
the Apostle is not continuing to give the praise of Philemon, but that, on the
contrary, he expresses those blessings for which he prays to God. These words
are connected with what he had formerly said, that he &#8220;makes mention of
him in his prayers.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;570104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philemon
1:4.) What blessing then did he ask for Philemon? That his faith, exercising
itself by good works, might be proved to be true, and not unprofitable. He calls
it &#8220;the communication of faith,&#8221; because it does not remain inactive
and concealed within, but is manifested to men by actual effects. Although faith
has a hidden residence in the heart, yet it communicates itself to men by good
works. It is, therefore, as if he had said, &#8220;That thy faith, by
communicating itself, may demonstrate its efficacy in every good
thing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The knowledge of every good
thing</i></font><font face="Palatino"> denotes experience. He wishes that, by
its effects, faith may be proved to be effectual. This takes place, when the men
with whom we converse know our godly and holy life; and therefore, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of every good thing which is in
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for everything in us that is good makes
known our faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Towards Christ
Jesus.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The phrase
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv
Cristo&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino"> may be explained to mean &#8220;through
Christ.&#8221; But, for my own part, if I were at liberty, I would rather
translate it as equivalent to </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn
Cristw~,</font><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;in Christ;&#8221; for the gifts of
God dwell in us in such a manner, that nevertheless, we are partakers of them
only so far as we are members of Christ. Yet because the words <i>in you</i> go
before, I am afraid that the harshness of the expression would give offense.
Accordingly, I have not ventured to make any alteration in the words, but only
wished to mention it to my readers, that, after full consideration, they may
choose either of those meanings which they
prefer.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>7.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have much grace and
consolation.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Although this reading is found in
the majority of Greek copies, yet I think that it ought to be translated
<i>joy</i>; for, since there is little difference between
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ca&gt;rin</font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">cara&gt;n</font><font face="Palatino">,
it would be easy to mistake a single letter. Besides, Paul elsewhere employs the
word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ca&gt;rin</font><font face="Palatino">
to mean &#8220;joy;&#8221; at least, if we believe Chrysostom on this matter.
What has &#8220;grace&#8221; to do with
&#8220;consolation?&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For thy
love.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is plain enough what he means, that he
has great joy and consolation, because Philemon administered relief to the
necessities of the godly. This was singular love, to feel so much joy on account
of the benefit received by others. Besides, the Apostle does not only speak of
his personal joy, but says that many rejoiced on account of the kindness and
benevolence with which Philemon had aided religious men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because the bowels of the saints
have been refreshed by thee, brother.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8220;To
refresh the bowels&#8221; is an expression used by Paul to mean, to give relief
from distresses, or to aid the wretched in such a manner that, having their
minds composed, and being free from all uneasiness and grief, they may find
repose. &#8220;The bowels&#8221; mean the affections, and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajna&gt;pausiv</font><font face="Palatino">
denotes tranquillity; and therefore they are greatly mistaken who torture this
passage so as to make it refer to the belly and the nourishment of the
body.</font><br><br></div>

&#8220;though I have authority so that I might justly command thee, yet thy love
makes me prefer to entreat
thee.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Being such a one</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He claims the right to
command on two grounds, that he is <i>an elder</i>, and that he is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a prisoner for
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He says that, on account of
Philemon&#8217;s love, he chooses rather to entreat, because we interpose
authority in commanding those things which we wish to extort by necessity even
from the unwilling, but there is no need of commanding those who willingly obey.
And because they who are ready of their own accord to do their duty listen more
willingly to a calm statement of what is necessary to be done than to the
exercise of authority, with good reason does Paul, when he has to deal with an
obedient man, use entreaty. By his example he shows that pastors should endeavor
to draw disciples gently rather than to drag them by force; and indeed, when, by
condescending to entreaty, he foregoes his right, this has far greater power to
obtain his wish than if he issued a command. Besides, he claims nothing for
himself, but in Christ, that is, on account of the office which he has received
from him; for he does not mean that they whom Christ has appointed to be
apostles are destitute of authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What is
proper.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By adding this, he means that teachers
have not power to enact whatever they please, but that their authority is
confined within these limits, that they must not command anything but
&#8220;what is proper,&#8221; and, in other respects, consistent with every
man&#8217;s duty. Hence (as I said a little before) pastors are reminded that
the hearts of their people must be soothed with all possible gentleness,
wherever this method is likely to be more advantageous, but yet so as to know
that they who are treated so gently have nothing less exacted from them than
what they ought to do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The designation &#8220;elder,&#8221; here, denotes
not age, but office. He calls himself an apostle for this reason, that the
person with whom he has to deal, and with whom he talks familiarly, is a
fellow-laborer in the ministry of the
word.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>10.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I beseech thee for my
son</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Since less weight is commonly attached to
those prayers which are not founded in some cause of just commendation, Paul
shows that Onesimus is so closely related to him as to afford a good reason for
supplicating in his behalf. Here it is of importance to consider how deep is his
condescension, when he gives the name of &#8220;son&#8221; to a slave, and a
runaway, and a thief.</font><br></div>

him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>this must be understood to mean,
that it was done by his ministry, and not by his power. To renew a soul of man
and form it anew to the image of God &#8212; is not a human work, and it is of
this spiritual regeneration that he now speaks. Yet because the soul is
regenerated by faith, and &#8220;faith is by hearing,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;451017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:17,) on that, account he who administers the doctrine holds the place of a
parent. Moreover, because the word of God preached by man is the seed of eternal
life, we need not wonder that he from whose mouth we receive that seed is called
a father. Yet, at the same time, we must believe that, while the ministry of a
man is efficacious in regenerating the soul, yet, strictly speaking, God himself
regenerates by the power of his Spirit. These modes of expression, therefore, do
not imply any opposition between God and man, but only show what God does by
means of men. When he says that he had
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>begotten him in his
bonds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>this circumstance adds weight to
the commendation.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>12.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Receive him, that is, my
bowels</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Nothing could have been more powerful
for assuaging the wrath of Philemon; for if he had refused to forgive his slave,
he would thus have used cruelty against &#8220;the bowels&#8221; of Paul. This
is remarkable kindness displayed by Paul, that he did not hesitate to receive,
as it were into his bowels, a contemptible slave, and thief, and runaway, so as
to defend him from the indignation of his master. And, indeed, if the conversion
of a man to God were estimated by us, at its proper value, we too would embrace,
in the same manner, those who should give evidence that they had truly and
sincerely repented.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom I was desirous to keep
beside me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is another argument for the
purpose of appeasing Philemon, that Paul sends him back a slave, of whose
services, in other respects, he stood greatly in need. It would have been
extreme cruelty, to disdain so strong affection manifested by Paul. He likewise
states indirectly, that it will be a gratification to himself to have Onesimus
sent back to him rather than that he should be harshly treated at
home.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he might minister to me
instead of thee in the bonds of the gospel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He
now mentions other circumstances: first, Onesimus will supply the place of his
master, by performing this service; secondly, Paul himself, through modesty, was
unwilling to deprive Philemon of his right; and, thirdly, Philemon will receive
more applause, if, after having had his slave restored to him, he shall
willingly and generously send him back. From this last consideration we infer,
that we ought to aid the martyrs of Christ by every kind office in our power,
while they are laboring for the testimony of the gospel; for if exile,
imprisonment stripes, blows, and violent seizing of our property, are believed
by us to belong to the gospel, as Paul here calls them, whoever refuses to share
and partake of them separates himself even from Christ. Undoubtedly the defense
of the gospel belongs alike to all. Accordingly, he who endures persecution, for
the sake of the gospel, ought not to be regarded as a private individual, but as
one who publicly represents the whole Church. Hence it follows, that all
believers ought to be united in taking care of it, so that they may not, as is
frequently done, leave the gospel to be defended in the person of one
man.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>14.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That thy benefit might not be
by constraint</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is drawn from the general
rule, that no sacrifices are acceptable to God but those which are freely
offered. Paul speaks of almsgiving in the same manner.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;470907&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 9:7.) </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">To&gt;
ajgaqon</font><font face="Palatino"> is here put for &#8220;acts of
kindness,&#8221; and willingness is contrasted with constraint, when there is no
other opportunity of putting to the test a generous and cheerful act of the
will; for that duty which is generously performed, and not through influence
exercised by others, is alone entitled to full praise. It is also worthy of
observation, that Paul, while he acknowledges that Onesimus was to blame in past
time, affirms that he is changed; and lest Philemon should have any doubt that
his slave returns to him with a new disposition and different conduct, Paul says
that he has made full trial of his repentance by personal
knowledge.</font><br><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For perhaps he was
separated</i></font><font face="Palatino">. If we are angry on account of
offenses committed by men, our minds ought to be soothed, when we perceive that
those things which were done through malice have been turned to a different end
by the purpose of God. A joyful result may be regarded as a remedy for evils,
which is held out to us by the hand of God for blotting out offenses. Thus
Joseph &#8212; when he takes into consideration, that the wonderful providence
of God brought it about, that, though he was sold as a slave, yet he was
elevated to that high rank, from which he could provide food for his brethren
and his father &#8212; forgets the treachery and cruelty of his brethren, and
says, that he was sent before on their account.
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;014505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
45:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul therefore reminds Philemon that he ought not to
be so greatly offended at the flight of his slave, for it was the cause of a
benefit not to be regretted. So long as Onesimus was at heart a runaway,
Philemon, though he had him in his house, did not actually enjoy him as his
property; for he was wicked and unfaithful, and could not be of real advantage.
He says, therefore, that he was a wanderer for a little time, that, by changing
his place, he might be converted and become a new man. And he prudently softens
everything, by calling the flight a departure, and adding, that it was
only</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> for a
time.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That thou mightest receive him for
ever</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Lastly, he contrasts the perpetuity of
the advantage with the short duration of the loss.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But above a servant, a beloved
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He next brings forward another
advantage of the flight, that Onesimus has not only been corrected by means of
it, so as to become a useful slave, but that he has become the
&#8220;brother&#8221; of his master.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Especially to
me.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Lest the heart of Onesimus, wounded by the
offense which was still fresh, should be reluctant to admit the brotherly
appellation, Paul claims Onesimus first of all, as his own
&#8220;brother.&#8221; Hence he infers that Philemon is much more closely
related to him, because both of them had the same relationship in the Lord
according to the Spirit, but, according to the flesh, Onesimus is a member of
his family. Here we behold the uncommon modesty of Paul, who bestows on a
worthless slave the title of a brother, and even calls him a dearly beloved
brother to himself. And, indeed, it would be excessive pride, if we should be
ashamed of acknowledging as our brother those whom God accounts to be his
sons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>How much more to
thee</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By these words he does not mean that
Philemon is higher in rank according to the Spirit; but the meaning is,
&#8220;Seeing that he is especially a brother to me, he must be much more so to
thee; for there is a twofold relationship between you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must hold it to be an undoubted truth, that Paul
does not rashly or lightly (as many people do) answer for a man of whom he knows
little, or extol his faith before he has ascertained it by strong proofs, and
therefore in the person of Onesimus there is exhibited a memorable example of
repentance. We know how wicked the dispositions of slaves were, so that scarcely
one in a hundred ever came to be of real use. As to Onesimus, we may conjecture
from his flight, that he had been hardened in depravity by long habit and
practice. It is therefore uncommon and wonderful virtue to lay aside the vices
by which his nature was polluted, so that the Apostle can truly declare that he
has now become another man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From the same source proceeds a profitable doctrine,
that the elect of God are sometimes brought to salvation by a method that could
not have been believed, contrary to general expectation, by circuitous windings,
and even by labyrinths. Onesimus lived in a religious and holy family, and,
being banished from it by his own evil actions, he deliberately, as it were,
withdraws far from God and from eternal life. Yet God, by hidden providence,
wonderfully directs his pernicious flight, so that he meets with
Paul.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If, therefore, thou holdest me to
be thy associate</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here he lowers himself still
further, by giving up his right and his honor to a runaway, and putting him in
his own room, as he will shortly afterwards offer himself to be his cautioner.
He reckoned it to be of vast importance that Onesimus should have a mild and
gentle master, that immoderate severity might not drive him to despair. That is
the object which Paul toils so earnestly to accomplish. And his example warns us
how affectionately we ought to aid a sinner who has given us proof of his
repentance. And if it is our duty to intercede for others, in order to obtain
forgiveness for those who repent, much more should we ourselves treat them with
kindness and gentleness.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If in any thing he hath done thee
injury</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Hence we may infer that Onesimus had
likewise stolen something from his master, as was customary with fugitives; and
yet he softens the criminality of the act, by adding, or <i>if he oweth thee
anything. </i>Not only was there a bond between them recognised by civil law,
but the slave had become indebted to his master by the wrong which he had
inflicted on him. So much the greater, therefore, was the kindness of Paul, who
was even ready to give satisfaction for a
crime.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not to tell thee that thou owest
to me thyself</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this expression he intended
to describe how confidently he believes that he will obtain it; as if he had
said, &#8220;There is nothing that thou couldest refuse to give me, even though
I should demand thyself.&#8221; To the same purpose is what follows about
lodging and other matters, as we shall immediately see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There remains one question. How does Paul-who, if he
had not been aided by the churches, had not the means of living sparingly and
frugally &#8212; promise to pay money? Amidst such poverty and want this does
certainly appear to be a ridiculous promise; but it is easy to see that, by this
form of expression, Paul beseeches Philemon not to ask anything back from his
slave. Though he does not speak ironically, yet, by an indirect figure, he
requests him to blot out and cancel this account. The meaning, therefore, is
&#8212; &#8221;I wish that thou shouldest not contend with thy slave, unless
thou choosest to have me for thy debtor in his stead.&#8221; For he immediately
adds that Philemon is altogether his own; and he who claims the whole man as his
property, need not give himself uneasiness about paying
money.</font><br><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea,
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This affirmation is used in order to
increase the ardor of the exhortation; as if he had said &#8212; &#8220;Now
shall it be clearly proved that there hath been no variance between thee and me,
but that, on the contrary, thou art sincerely attached to me, and that all that
thou hadst is at my disposal, if thou pardon offenses and receive into favor him
who is so closely related to me.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Refresh my bowels in the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He again repeats the same form of
expressions which he had previously employed. Hence we infer that the faith of
the gospel does not overturn civil government, or set aside the power and
authority which masters have over slaves. For Philemon was not a man of the
ordinary rank, but a fellow-laborer of Paul in cultivating Christ&#8217;s
vineyard; and yet that power over a slave which was permitted by the law is not
taken away, but he is only commanded to receive him kindly by granting
forgiveness, and is even humbly besought by Paul to restore him to his former
condition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When Paul pleads so humbly in behalf of another, we
are reminded how far distant they are from true repentance who obstinately
excuse their vices, or who, without shame and without tokens of humility,
acknowledge indeed that they have sinned, but in such a manner as if they had
never sinned. When Onesimus saw so distinguished an apostle of Christ plead so
eagerly in his behalf, he, must undoubtedly have been much more humbled, that he
might bend the heart of his master to be merciful to him. To the same purpose is
the excuse which he offers (Philemon 1:21) for writing so boldly, because he
knew that Philemon would do more than he had been
requested.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>21</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But at the same time prepare for
me a lodging</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This confidence must have
powerfully excited and moved Philemon; and next, he holds out to him the hope of
being gratified by his own arrival. Although we do not know whether or not Paul
was afterwards released from prison, yet there is no absurdity in this
statement, even though he was disappointed of the hope which he cherished about
God&#8217;s temporal kindness. He had no confident hope of his release, further
than if it pleased God. Accordingly, he always kept his mind in suspense, till
the will of God was made known by the result.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That through your prayers I shall
be given to you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here it deserves notice, that
he says that everything that believers obtain &#8220;through their
prayers,&#8221; is &#8220;given&#8221; to them; for hence we infer that our
prayers, though they are not unsuccessful, yet have no power through their own
merit; for what is yielded to them is of free
grace.</font><br><font face="Palatino"><b>24</b>.

&#8220;Here we see more clearly, that Paul did not merely condemn in this
passage doctrines which are altogether false, and which contain some
blasphemies, but likewise all those useless speculations which serve to turn
aside believers from the pure simplicity of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is what
Paul includes under the word &#8220;fables,&#8221; for he means not only
deliberate and manifest falsehoods, but likewise everything that is of no use,
and this is implied in the word which he employs. What, then, does Paul set
aside in this passage? All curious inquiries, all speculations which serve only
to annoy and distress the mind, or in which there is nothing but a fair show and
display, and which do not promote the salvation of those who hear them. This
must be carefully remembered, for we shall afterwards see that the reason why
Paul speaks of them in this manner is, that the word of God must be profitable.

<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fta9</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;This word <i>edify </i>is sufficiently common in the Holy Scripture, but
is not understood by all. In order to understand it aright, let us observe that
it is a comparisons which is set before us; for we ought to be temples of God,
because he wishes to dwell in us. &#8212; Those who profit in a right manner,
that is, in faith, in the fear of God, in holiness of life, are said to be
edified; that is, God builds them to be his temples, and wishes to dwell in
them; and also that we should unitedly form a temple of God, for each of us is a
stone of that temple. Thus, when each of us shall be well instructed in his
duty, and when we shall all be united in holy brotherhood, then shall we be
edified in God. It is true, that men may sometimes be edified in pride: as we
see that they who take delight in their vain imaginations, and who spread their
wings, and swell themselves out like toads, think that they are well edified.
Alas! what a poor building is this! But Paul expressly says, that we must be
edified according to God. By which he shews, that when we shall be instructed to
serve God, to render to him pure worship, to place all our confidence in him,
this is the edification at which we must aim; and every doctrine that has that
tendency is good and holy, and ought to be received I but all that is opposed to
it must be rejected without farther dispute: it is unnecessary to make any
longer inquiry. And why must this or that be rejected? Because it does not
contribute to the edification of God.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Fr.

&#8220;Here he makes use of a metaphor taken from those who shoot with a bow;
for they have their mark at which they aim, and do not shoot carelessly, or at
random. Thus Paul shews that God, by giving us the law, has determined to give
us a sure road, that we may not be liable to wander like vagabonds. And, indeed,
it is not without reason that Moses exhorteth the people, &#8216;This is the
way, walk ye in it,&#8217; as if he had said that men do not know where they
are, till God has declared to them his will; but then they have an infallible
rule. &#8212; Let us carefully observe that God intends to address us in such a
manner that it shall not be possible for us to go astray, provided that we take
him for our guide, seeing that he is ready and willing to perform that office,
when we do not refuse such a favor. This is what Paul meant by this metaphor; as
we are told that all who have it not as their object to rely on the grace of
God, in order that they may call on God as their Father, and may expect
salvation from him, and who do not walk with a good conscience, and with a pure
heart toward their neighborhood, are like persons who have wandered and gone

&#8220;And in Popery what are the articles that shall be held as most certain?
What angel, or what devil, revealed to them that there is a purgatory? They have
fabricated it out of their own brain, and, after having attempted to produce
some passages of the Holy Scriptures, they have at length become bewildered, so
that they have no defense of their purgatory, but its antiquity. &#8216;There it
is! It has been always held.&#8217; Such is the foundation of faith, according
to the learned Papists. And then we must not call in question that we ought to
apply to the departed saints as our advocates and intercessors. To go to God
without baying as our guide St. Michael, or the Virgin Mary, or some other saint
whom the Pope shall have inserted in his calendar for the occasion, would be of
no avail. And why? On what ground? Will they find in all the Holy Scriptures a
single word, a single syllable, to shew that creatures, that is, deceased
persons, intercede for us? For in this world we ought to pray for one another,
and that is a mutual obligation; but as to deceased persons, not a word is said
about them.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Fr. Ser.</i></font><br></div>
<div><sup><font color="Maroon">fta15</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;All vices are contrary to sound doctrine. For what is the advantage to be
derived from the Word of God? It is the pasture of our souls; and, next, it is a
medicine. We have bread and various kinds of food for the nourishment of our
body: the word of God is of the same use for our souls. But it is more
advantageous in this respect, that, when we are diseased with our vices, when
there are many corruptions and wicked desires, we must be purged of them; and
the Word of God serves us for various purposes, for purging, for blood &#8212;
letting, for drink, and for diet. In short, all that physicians can apply to the
human body, for healing its diseases, is not a tenth part of what the Word of
God accomplishes for the health of our souls On that account Paul speaks here of
sound doctrine. For inquisitive and ambitious persons are always in a diseased
state; they have no health in them they are like those unhappy patients who have
lost their appetite, and who suck and lick, but cannot receive any nourishment.
But when the Word of God is applied in a right manner, there must be a contest;
there was a war against every vice; and the Word of God must condemn them in
such a manner that the hearts of men shall be touched and pierced &#8212; shall
be humbled and laid low with sincere repentance to groan before God; and, if
there be nothing else, that they shall at least be convinced, that they shall
have remorse within themselves, that they may so be an example to all that are
not altogether incorrigible. This is the way in which the Lord wishes that his
word may be applied to a good use.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Fr.

&#8220;Here is Paul, who was slandered by many people, as we see that there are
always dogs that bark against God&#8217;s servants, aiming at nothing but to
bring them into contempt, or rather to make their doctrine be despised and
abhorred. Wishing to shut the mouths of such people, Paul says that he is
satisfied with having the authority and warrant of Christ. As if he had said,
&#8216;Men may reject me, but it is enough that I am declared to be faithful by
him who has all authority in himself, and who, being the heavenly Judge, hath
pronounced it. When he put me into that office, he declared that he reckoned me
to be his servant, and that he intended to employ me in preaching his gospel.
That is enough for me. Let men contrive and calumniate as much as they may,
provided that I have Christ on my side, let men jeer at me, it will be of no
avail; For the decision pronounced by the Lord Jesus Christ can never be
recalled.&#8217; Thus we see what was Paul&#8217;s intention, namely, that he
does not here mean that Christ foresaw in him anything as the reason why he
called him to so honorable an office, but only that, by putting him into it, he
declared and made it evident to men, that he intended to make use of him.&#8221;

but for this, all the virtues that are visible, and that are highly valued by
men, have no solid value; they are so many vices which God condemns. After we
have loudly praised a man, and placed him in the rank of angels, he shall be
rejected by God, with all his fine reputation, unless he have that obedience of
faith. Thus it will be in vain for men to say, &#8216;I did not intend it, that

reputation, they must be condemned before God as rebels. This would, at first
sight, seem hard to digest. And why? For we see how men always endeavor to
escape from the hand of God, and resort to many indirect means. And when can
they find this palliation, &#8216;I intended to do what was right, and why not

&#8220;What is human life, and what is the whole of its course? A navigation Not
only are we travelers, as the Scripture tells us,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;600211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 2:11,) but we have no solidity. They who travel by land, either on foot or
on horseback, have still their sure and firm road; but in the world, instead of
being on foot or on horseback, we must be, as it were, on a sea, and we have no
solid footing. We are like people who are in a boat, and who are always within
half a foot of their death; and the boat is a sort of grave, because they see
the water all around ready to swallow them up. Thus is it with us, while we live
here below. For, on the one hand, there is the frailly that is in us, which is
more fluid than water; and then all that surrounds us is like water, which flows
on all sides, while at every minute winds, and storms. and tempests arise. Let
us therefore learn that our life is but a kind of navigation, which we perform
by water, and that we are, at the same time, exposed to many winds and storms.
And if it be so, what shall become of us when we have not a good boat or a good
pilot?&#8221; &#8212; <i>Fr. Ser</i>.</font><br></div>

one. They might as well have had another Creator besides God, as another

&#8220;Let us know that the Holy Spirit, speaking of those who are ordained
ministers of the word of God, and who are elected to govern the Church, calls
them Pastors. And why? Because God wishes us to be a flock of sheep, to be
guided by him, hearing his voice, following his guidance, and living peaceably.
Since, therefore the Church is compared to a flock, they who have the charge of
guiding the Church by the word of God are called Pastors. And next, the word
Pastor means Elder not by age, but by of office: as, at all times, they who
govern have been called Elders, even among heathen nations. Now the Holy Spirit
has retained this metaphor, giving the name Elder to those who are chosen to
proclaim the word of God. He likewise calls them Bishops, that is persons who
watch over the flock to show that it is not a rank unaccompanied by active
exertion, when a man is called to, that office, and that he must not make an
idol of it, but must know that he is sent to obtain the salvation of souls, and
must be employed, and watch, and labor, for that purpose. We see then the reason
of these words; and since the Holy Spirit hath given them to us, we must retain
them, provided that they be applied to a good and holy use.&#8221; &#8212;

&#8220;The house of a believer ought to be like a little church. Heathens, who
did not know what a church is, said that a house is but an image and figure of
any public government. A poor man, living with his wife and children and
servants, ought to be in his house like a public governor But Christians ought
to go beyond this. Every father of a family should know that God has appointed
him to that place, that he may know how to govern his wife and children and
servants; so that God shall be honored in the midst of them, and all shall do
Him homage. Paul speaks of children; and why? Because he who wishes to discharge
his duty as pastor of a church must be like a father to all believers. Now, let
us suppose that a man cannot govern two or three children which he has in the
house. They are his own children, and yet he cannot keep them in subjection;
they are deaf to all that he says to them. How then shall he be able to govern
those who are at a distance, and who may be said to be unknown to him, who even
refuse to become wiser, and think that they have no need of being instructed?
How shall he be able to keep men in dread when his own wife is not subject to
him? Let us not, therefore, think it strange if it is required in all pastors,
that they be good fathers of a family, and know what it is to govern their own
children well. It is not enough to condemn the children, but we must condemn the
fathers, when they permit their children to be worse than others.&#8221; &#8212;

&#8220;By the word <i>flesh </i>Paul declares that Christ was true man, and that
he was clothed with our nature; but, at the same time, by the word
<i>manifested, </i>he shows that there were two natures. We must not imagine a
Jesus Christ who is God, and another Jesus Christ who is man; but we must know
that he alone is both God and man. Let us distinguish his two natures, so as to
know that this is the Son of God who is our brother. Now I have said that God
permits the ancient heresies, with which the church was troubled, to be revived
in our time, in order to excite us to greater activity. But, on the other hand,
let us observe, that the devil is constrained to do his utmost to overthrow this
article of faith, because he sees clearly that it is the foundation of our
salvation. For if we have not that mystery of which Paul speaks, what will
become of us? We are all children of Adam, and therefore we are accursed; we are
in the pit of death; in short, we are deadly enemies of God, and thus there is
nothing in us but. condemnation and death, till we know that God came to seek
us, and that, because we could not rise to him, he came down to us. Till we have
known this, are we not more than wretched? For this reason the Devil wished, as
far as he could, to destroy that knowledge, or rather to mix it with his lies,
so as to be perverted. On the other hand, when we see that there is such majesty
in God, how shall we dare to approach unto Him, seeing that we are full of
misery? We must therefore come to this union of the majesty of God with human
nature. And thus, in every respect, till we have known the divine majesty that
is in Jesus Christ, and our human weakness which he hath taken upon him, it is
impossible for us to have any hope, or to be capable of having recourse to the
goodness of God, or of having the boldness to call upon him, and return to him.
In a word, we are entirely shut out from the heavenly kingdom, the gate is shut
against us, and we cannot approach to it in any way whatever.&#8221; &#8212;

&#8220;He who wishes to be faithfully employed in the service of God must not
only avoid, as Paul says, the lies and superstitions that tend to poison souls;
but he must avoid profane fables, that is, subtleties that cannot edify, and
that contain no instruction which is good for the salvation of souls. Here is a
passage that well deserves to be considered; for we see that it was a part of
the corruptions which came into the world, and which, even at the present day,
prevail in Popery. True, there will be doctrines in the highest degree absurd,
and errors most foolish and debasing. We know that idolatry is as gross and
flagrant among them as it ever was among the heathens, that the whole worship of
God is corrupted, and, in short, that there is nothing which is not spurious.
Such errors ought to be held in abhorrence by us; but there is an evil which is
still more concealed, and which is unknown to the common people. For although
the doctrine of the Papists were not false as it really is, though it were not
perverse; yet it is &#8220;profane,&#8221; as Paul calls it here. And why? They
have questions which they debate, about things in which there is no profit. Were
a man to know all the questions that are debated in the schools of theology of
Popery, there would be nothing but wind. Yet they give themselves the greatest
trouble about these matters, and can never succeed; for they put forward
questions that cannot be answered but by divination; and though a man should
wish to search out the secrets of God, about which nothing is said in the Holy
Scripture, does he not plunge into an abyss? Now the Papists have had that pride
and audacity, to wish to inquire into those matters which ought to be unknown to
us. And thus it was that God withdrew his truth, when the world so corrupted
it.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Fr. Ser.</i></font><br></div>

&#8220;The word <i>Savior is </i>not here taken in what we call its proper and
strict meaning, in regard to the eternal salvation which God promises to his
elect, but it is taken for one who delivers and protects. Thus we see that even
unbelievers are protected by God, as it is said
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;400546&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:46) that &#8220;he maketh his sun to shine on the good and the bad;&#8221; and
we see that all are fed by his goodness, that all are delivered from many
dangers. In this sense he is called &#8220;the Savior of all men,&#8221; not in
regard to the spiritual salvation of their souls, but because he supports all
his creatures. In this way, therefore, our Lord is the Savior of all men, that
is, his goodness extends to the most wicked, who are estranged from him, and who
do not deserve to have any intercourse with him, who ought to have been struck
off from the number of the creatures of God and destroyed; and yet we see how
God hitherto extends his grace to them; for the life which he gives to them is a
testimony of his goodness. Since, therefore God shows such favor towards those
who are strangers to him, how shall it be with us who are members of his
household?: Not that we are better or more excellent than those whom we see to
be cast off by him, but the whole proceeds from his mercy and free grace, that
he is reconciled to us through our Lord Jesus Christ, since he hath called us to
the knowledge of the gospel, and then confirms us, and seals his bounty toward
us, so that we ought to be convinced that he reckons us to be his children.
Since, therefore, we see that he nourishes those who are estranged from him, let
us go and hide ourselves under his wings; for, having taken us under his
protection, he has declared that he will show himself to be a Father toward
us.&#8221; &#8212; Fr. Ser.</font><br></div>

&#8220;From what the Fathers and Greek commentators tell us, it appears that
those persons were maintained from the funds of the Church; and from what
follows, it is clear that they filled an office; the name
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ch&gt;rai</font><font face="Palatino">
being as much one of office as
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dia&gt;conev</font><font face="Palatino">,
though the exact nature of its duties has not been determined. That the persons
who held it instructed the younger females in the principles of the Christian
faith, is pretty certain; but whether they were, as some say, &#8216;the same as
the deaconesses,&#8217; is yet a disputed point. It would seem that they were
not necessarily the same; but that, having once been such, during the life of
their husbands, they were not removed from that office. Otherwise, it would seem
their duties were different from those of the deaconesses; and if we were to
call them by such a name as would designate their chief duties, we might call
them &#8216;Female Catechists.&#8217; That these differed from the deaconesses
is certain from the positive testimony of Epiphanius. Yet they might
occasionally <i>assist</i> them in their duty of visiting the sick. Be that as
it may, the existence of such an order as the
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ch&gt;rai</font><font face="Palatino">
requires no very strong testimony from ecclesiastical history; since, from the
extremely retired life of the women in Greece and other parts of the East, and
their almost total separation from the other sex, they would much <i>need</i>

They who would wish to be reckoned pastors ought to devote themselves especially
to that word. And how? In order to study it secretly in their closet? Not at
all; but for the general instruction of the Church. That is the reason why Paul
chose to add the term <i>doctrine. </i>It was quite enough to have said,
<i>word; </i>but he shews that we must not privately speculate what we shall
think fit, but that, when we have studied, it is that others may profit along
with us, and that the instruction may be common to the whole Church. &#8212;

speaking, and let us know that there is no accepting of persons, but that,
knowing what was profitable to the whole Church, and perceiving that many were

&#8220;Let us remark that he wishes to distinguish them from those who rebelled.
For the devils were not created wicked and malicious as they now are, enemies of
all that is good, and false and cursed in their nature. They were angels of God,
but they were not elected to persevere, and so they fell. Thus God reserved what
he chose among the angels. And so we have already a mirror of God&#8217;s
election of us to heaven, by free grace before we came into the world. Now, if
we see the grace of God displayed even to angels, what shall become of us? For
all mankind were lost and ruined in Adam, and we are an accursed, and, as the
Scripture tells us, are born &#8220;children of wrath.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:3.) What must we become if God do not choose us by pure goodness, since from
our mother&#8217;s womb
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;195106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
51:6) we are corrupted, and are alienated from him? This gracious election must
prevail, m order to separate us from the reprobate, who remain in their
perdition. We ought, therefore, carefully to remark this passage, that Paul,
when speaking of the angels, shews that their high rank proceeds from their
having been chosen and elected by God. And so, by a still stronger reason, we
are separated from all other visible creatures, only because: God separates us
by his mercy.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Fr. Ser.</i></font><br></div>

&#8220;In the year 1084, was instituted the famous order of the Carthusians, so
called from Chartreux, a dismal and wild spot of ground near Grenoble in
Dauphine, surrounded with barren mountains and craggy rocks. The founder of this
monastic society, which surpassed all the rest in the extravagant austerity of
their manners and discipline, was Bruno, a native of Cologne, and canon of the
cathedral of Rheims in France. This zealous ecclesiastic, who had neither power
to reform, nor patience to bear, the dissolute manners of his Archbishop
Manasse, retired from his church, with six of his companions and, having
obtained the permission of Hugh, bishop of Grenoble, fixed his residence in the
miserable desert already mentioned. He adopted at first the rule of St.
Benedict, to which he added a considerable number of severe and rigorous
precepts. His successors, however, went still farther, and imposed upon the
Carthusians new laws, much more intolerable than those of their founder, &#8212;
laws which inculcated the highest degrees of austerity that the most gloomy

shews us that we have good reason for attending to this warning of the Apostle
Paul. For to what a pitch has religion arrived! Has it not been made like a
public fair? What has it become in Popery? The Sacraments are exposed to sale,
and everything else belonging to our religion has a fixed price put upon it. Not
more did Judas sell the Son of God in his own person than the Pope and all that
filth of his clergy have sold the graces of the Holy Spirit, and all that

&#8221;And thus we see that not without reason does Paul add this word
<i>piety,</i> which means religion and the fear of God, and that he connects it
with faith, saying that, when we have put our confidence in God, and when we
expect from him the means of our support, we must also attend to this, not to
live in this world as if it were our end, and not to fix our heart upon it, but
to look upwards to the heavenly kingdom. having said this, he next leads us
onwards to the love of our fellow &#8212; men and to meekness, as we are also
bound to walk in all good friendship with our neighbors; otherwise we shall not
shew that we have the righteousness which he has mentioned. And thus let us see
that, by all these words, he means nothing more than to confirm the exhortation
which he had given, to follow righteousness and sincerity. And how shall we
follow it? First, by placing our confidence in God; secondly, by raising our
thoughts to the heavenly kingdom; and thirdly, by living in good friendship with
each other.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Fr. Ser.</i></font><br></div>

&#8221;We see princes whose ambition leads them to risk all that they have, and
to place themselves in danger of being striped of all their power. We see

fields, go and expose their life at a venture. And what leads them to this? A
doubtful hope, nothing certain. And though they have gained, and have obtained a
victory over their enemies, what advantage do they reap from it? But when God
calls us to fight, and wishes us to be soldiers under his banner, it is on no
such condition, but we are made certain that the war will be good and
successful. And thus Paul intended to comfort believers while he exhorted them,
as God also condescends to us by strewing to us what is our duty, and, at the

Lamb without spot, which was shed. As anciently, under the Law, the book was
sprinkled with the blood of the sacrifice, so now, whenever we are spoken to in

sport with religion as with a ball. We even see that they are deadly enemies of

&#8220;It will be useless to say to us, What are the riches of this world? We
see that there is no certainty of them. What are honors? They are but smoke.
What is even this life? It is but a dream. There is but a turn of the hand, and
we become dust and ashes. It will be useless to argue with us on these grounds.
All this will serve no purpose, till God has been presented to our minds, till
it has been demonstrated to us that we must direct all our affections and
confidence to him alone. And that is the reason why all the fine remonstrances
urged by the philosophers had no effect. For they spoke of the frailty of this
earthly life and the uncertain condition of men. They showed that it was vain to
think of finding happiness in our possessions, in our lordships, or in anything
else. They showed that it is delusive to think of having anything here below on
which we might vaunt ourselves. Those great philosophers knew nothing about God,
yet being convinced by experience, discussed and argued ably on these subjects.
But still they did no good, because they did not seek the true remedy, to fix
the hearts of men on God, and to inform them, that it is He alone in whom they
can find contentment, and till we have come to this, we shall always be involved

it is God who speaks to us by the mouth of a mortal man, and that all his
doctrine ought to be received with such authority and reverence as if God
visibly appeared from heaven, yet still there is in this epistle a special
object to be kept in view, that Paul, being in prison and perceiving his death
to be at hand, wished to ratify his faith, as if he had sealed it with his
blood. So then, as often as we read this epistle, let the condition in which
Paul was at that time come before our eyes, namely, that he was looking for
nothing but to die for the testimony of the gospel (which he actually did) as
its standard-bearer, in order to give us stronger assurance of his doctrine, and
that will affect us in a more lively manner. Indeed, if we read this epistle
carefully, we shall find that the Spirit of God has expressed himself in it in
such a manner, with such majesty and power, that we are constrained to be
captivated and overwhelmed. For my own part, I know that this epistle has been
more profitable to me than any other book of Scripture, and still is profitable
to me every day; and if any person shall examine it carefully, there can be no
doubt that he will experience the same effect. And if we desire to have a
testimony of the truth of God, which pierces our heart, we may well fix on this

&#8220;May the Lord grant that he may find favor at his coming, on the day of
our redemption, when he shall appear again to judge the world!&#8221; But he
says, &#8220;On that day;&#8221; as if he presented the Lord Jesus visibly, with

&#8220;If we wish to be victorious over all the temptations of Satan, we must
have great steadfastness, and must know that it is not at random that we believe
in Jesus Christ, that this is not a doubtful matter, but that he came to us from
God to be our Redeemer. And for this reason Paul here points out that he is of
the lineage of David, and of his seed, for we know the promises that are
contained in the Holy Scriptures, namely, that the whole world should be blessed
in the seed of Abraham. Now, God confirmed this to David, by shewing that from
him the Redeemer should proceed, that is, from the tribe of Judah, and from the
house of David. Thus, the reason why Paul claims for him this title is, that,
having the promises which God had formerly made to the fathers, concerning that
Redeemer who hath been given to us, we may not doubt that we ought to receive
him with full conviction, and have no reason to doubt whether he is, or is not,
the Messiah. Why? He is descended from the house of David; and, although at that
time, it had no royal dignity, yet that defect could not lessen the glory of our
Lord Jesus Christ, but, on the contrary, was fitted to confirm more fully our
belief that it was he who should be sent. And why? The Prophet Isaiah did not
say that he would be born in a palace, or that he would be brought up in great
splendor; but he said, that he would grow as a small twig
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;231101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
11:1) from the root of Jesse; as if he had said, that, although Jesus Christ was
of royal lineage, nevertheless his parents were poor, and were held of no
account in worldly matters, having no rank or grandeur.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Fr.

&#8220;It might be replied, that it is superfluous that Paul should
&#8216;endure for the elect.&#8217; &#8216;Cannot God save those whom he elected
and adopted before the creation of the world, without the assistance of men? Has
the immutable decree of God any need of human help, or of creatures? Why then
does Paul say that he endures on account of the elect?&#8217; Now, it us true
that God will conduct his people to the inheritance which is prepared for them
but yet he is pleased to make use of the labor of men. Not that he is under a
necessity of borrowing anything from us, but he confers on us this honor by his
undeserved goodness, and wishes that we should be instruments of his power. Thus
Paul does not boast that the salvation of the children of God depends on his
steadfastness or on the afflictions which he had to endure; but he only means
that God wishes to conduct his people by means of the word, and that he employs
men whom he has chosen for that purpose, as for his own work, and makes them
instruments of the power of his Holy Spirit.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Fr.

not be annoyed at it; for every person who carefully examines this subject will
find it to be highly necessary for him to be reminded of the lesson which he had
learned, that he may practice it well. If, therefore, God refreshes our memory
with it, he has conferred on us a great favor. That is what we have to remark on
this passage, when Paul says, &#8216;Remind them of these things.&#8217; For
undoubtedly he intended to prevent what we frequently meet with, when it is
said, &#8216;We have heard this before. Is not that a very common remark? Where

&#8220;When he says, that we must be &#8220;gentle towards all, &#8220;he means
that we ought to be easy and affable in receiving all who come to be taught in
the gospel, for if we do not give them access it is like shutting the door
against them, so that they shall never have it in their power to approach to
God. We must, therefore, have that mildness and humanity dwelling in us, so as
to be ready to receive all who wish to be instructed. And therefore, he adds,
that we must be `qualified for teaching,&#8217; as if he had said, that those
things are connected with each other, gentleness and skill in teaching. The
reason is, if a man be fierce and inaccessible, it will never be possible for us
to receive instruction from him. He who wishes to be a good teacher must conduct
himself with civility, and must have some way of drawing those who come to him,
so as to gain their affections; and that cannot be, unless he have that
&#8216;gentleness&#8217; of which Paul speaks. Thus we see how he intended to
confirm what he had briefly stated, that a man who is quarrelsome, and addicted
to disputes and contentions, is in no degree a servant of God. And why? As
servants of God, must we not labor to gain poor ignorant persons? And that
cannot be, unless we are mild, unless we hear patiently what they say, unless we

&#8220;Why does the holy Apostle, both here and elsewhere, speak of the
&#8216;last days,&#8217; when he forewarns believers that they most prepare
themselves, and make provision for many troubles and annoyances? It is because
this fancy was so common, that matters would go much better than before;
because, formerly, the prophets, when speaking of the kingdom of our Lord Jesus
Christ, said that everything would be astonishingly reformed, that the world
would obey God, that his majesty would be adored by the high and the low, that
every mouth would sing his praise, and every knee would bow before him. In
short, when we hear such promises, we think that we must be in a state of
angelical holiness, now that Christ has appeared. Many concluded, in their
mistaken fancy, that, since the coming of the Redeemer, nothing but the most
correct virtue and modesty would ever be seen, and that everything would be so

fortify us. When we see that Satan opposes, and that the truth of God is not
received by all, but that there are bad men who labor to pervert everything, and
who slander and falsify the truth, here are consolations provided for us. In the
first place, that our Lord treats us in the same manner as he has treated the
Church in all ages, that those who lived before us were not better situated in
this respect; for God tried them by sending false pastors, or rather by giving
free scope to Satan for sending them. Let us know what has happened since the
law was published. Here is Moses, who was before the other prophets. Yet already
the war was begun, and that evil has never ceased. If we must now endure the
like, let us bear it with patience; for it is not reasonable to expect that our
condition shall be better or easier than that of Moses, and of others who
followed him. That is one argument. The second is that the result shall be
prosperous and successful. Although we dislike fighting, and though it appears
as if the truth of God were about to perish utterly, let us wait till God come
forth in defense of it, for he will cause wicked men to be completely disgraced.
After they have triumphed, God will, undoubtedly, discover their baseness, and

And where could we find it but in the Holy Scripture, by which it is
communicated to us? Woe to us if we will not listen to God when he speaks to us,

for what need has he of it? We are likewise reminded not to read the Holy
Scripture so as to gratify our fancies, or to draw from it useless questions.
Why? Because it is profitable for salvation, says Paul. Thus, when I expound the
Holy Scripture, I must be guided by this consideration, that those who hear me
may receive profit from the doctrine which I teach, that they may be edified for
salvation. If I have not that desire, and do not aim at the edification of those
who hear me, I am a sacrilegious person, profaning the word of God. On the other

language, they think that all is lost. Never was the world so obstinately wicked

adhere to the Protestant Reformation of the Gospel. We see that they would wish

the adversity which we must endure. If this warning ever was advantageous, how
exceedingly necessary is it at the present day! Has not the world arrived at the
highest pitch of iniquity? We see that the majority furiously reject the gospel.
As to others who pretend to welcome the gospel, what sort of obedience do they
render to it? There is so much contempt and so much pride, that, as soon as
vices are reproved, or more sharpness is used than suits the taste of those who
would wish to have full permission to act wickedly, and whose sole aim is to
destroy everything, they are filled with spite. Although Papists will permit
their preaching Friars to cry out and storm against them, and at the same time

&#8220;The Papists themselves ought to observe carefully what was said by one of
those whom they call their Doctors. &#8216;How would God render the crown as a
righteous Judge, if he had not first given grace as a merciful Father? And how
would there have been righteousness in us, had it not been preceded by the grace
which justifies us? And how would that crown have been rendered as due, had not
all that we have &#8212; been given when it was not due?&#8217; These are the
words of Augustin; and although the Papists do not choose to keep by the Holy

pretend to hold. But even this is not all. It is true that it is a doctrine
which well deserves to be embraced, that God cannot be a righteous Judge to save
us, unless he have been previously declared to be in the highest degree a
merciful Father; that there will be no righteousness in us but that which he has
placed there; and that he cannot reward us but by crowning his gifts. But it is
also true, that, though God has given us grace to serve him, though we have
laboriously done, according to our ability, all that was possible for us, though
we have done so well that God accepts of it all; still there will be much to

&#8220;If faith be the fruit of election, the prescience of faith does not
influence the electing act of God. It is called &#8216;the faith of God&#8217;s
elect,&#8217; Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of
God&#8217;s elect,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;560101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:1,) that is, settled in this office to bring the elect of God to faith. If men
be chosen by God upon the foresight of faith, or not chosen till they have
faith, they are not so much God&#8217;s elect as God is their elect: they choose
God by faith, before God chooseth them by love. It had not been the faith of
God&#8217;s elect, that is, of those already chosen, but the faith of those that
were to be chosen by God afterwards. Election is time cause of faith, and not
faith the cause of election. Fire is the cause of heat, and not heat of fire;
the sun is the cause of day, and not the day the cause of the rising of the sun.
Men are not chosen because they believe, but they believe because they are
chosen. The Apostle did ill else to appropriate that to the elect, which they
had no more interest in by virtue of their election than the veriest reprobate
in time world. If the foresight of what works might be done by his creatures was
the motive of his choosing them why did he not choose the devils to redemption,
who could have done him better service, by the strength of their nature, than
the whole mass of Adam&#8217;s posterity? Well, then, there is no possible way
to lay the original foundation of this act of election and preterition in
anything but the absolute sovereignty of
God.&#8221;&#8211;<i>Charnock</i>.</font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">ftc3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;Thus he shews that it will never be possible for men to dedicate
themselves entirely to the service of God, if they do not think more about God
than about all things else. In short, there is no living root, no faith no
religion, till we have been led to heaven, that is, till we know that God has
not created us to keep us here in an earthly life with brute beasts, but that he
has adopted us to be his heritage, and reckons us to be his children. If,
therefore, we do not look up to heaven, it is impossible that we<b> </b>shall
have true devotion to surrender ourselves to God, or that there shall be any
faith or Christianity in us. And that is the reason why &#8212; among all who,
in the present day, are accounted Christians, and give themselves out to be
such&#8211;there are very few who have this true mark, which Paul has here given
to all the children of God. It is because all are occupied with the present
life, and are so firmly bound to it, that they cannot rise higher. Now
perceiving this vice to be so common, so much the more ought we to guard against
it, and break the force of that which we cannot altogether destroy, till we come
into close fellowship with God, which will only be, when the hope of eternal
life shall be actually and sincerely formed in our hearts.&#8221;<i>&#8212;Fr.

on the first day; they would wish to enjoy such reputation as to have it thought
that they discharged their duty so faithfully that nothing more could be

the Church of God, still we shall not succeed to the full extent. Let us
therefore know that we must not presume so far on our industry or our virtues,
that he who is endued with more abundant graces call suddenly have edified the
Church of God to perfection; but we must assist each other. He who is farthest
advanced must know that he cannot do everything, and must bend his shoulders and
ask assistance from those whom God has appointed, and must be well pleased that
others make progress, provided that all aim at serving God and advancing the

Jesus Christ; so that he lived without reproach, and was a mirror and a jewel of
holiness. Indeed he know not what he did, for hitherto he had not been directed
by the Spirit of God; but he led a life so good that it was not liable to any
reproach. And yet he tells us that he was pointed at with the finger, was mocked
at, was reproached, was even accursed among believers, whose ingratitude was
such that in his absence he was reviled and loaded with many slanders. So it is
with the servants of God. But when Paul demands that they shall be without
crime, he means that we should inquire and ascertain if the life of a man be
pure and without blame, and if he continues to conduct himself in that manner.
Although we cannot shut the mouths of all slanderers, that they shall not revile

&#8220;The general character of the Cretans, noticed in Paul&#8217;s Epistle to
Titus, is confirmed by the testimony of antiquity. The Apostle, writing to
Titus, who had been left in Crete to regulate the affairs of the Christian
Church in that island, complains of many disorderly men there, &#8212;
&#8216;many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, who subvert whole houses, (or
families,) teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre&#8217;s sake,
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;560110&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Titus
1:10, 11); and he quotes the following verse from &#8216;one of themselves, a
prophet of their own,&#8217; namely, Epimenides, who was a Cretan poet, and
whose writings were by the ancients termed

&#8216;a prophet&#8217; is sufficiently explained by the fact of the words Poet
and Prophet being often used promiscuously by the Greeks and
Romans,&#8211;probably because their poets pretended to be inspired, and were by
some believed to be so. The Apostle adds, that the testimony of Epimenides is

&#8220;We have to observe that here, in a single word, Paul declares to us by
what means men may defend themselves. It is, by keeping the purity of faith. If,
then, we do not turn aside from the simple doctrine of the gospel, but wish to
be governed according to the will of God; if we are not carried away by our
volatile passions, and do not walk according to our groveling appetites; in
short, if we are good scholars of our God, and reckon it enough to have received
the doctrine which he teaches us; if that be the case, we shall be fortified
against all evil. It is true, the devil will seek to poison the whole world with
his venom, and will spread his filth everywhere, so that the world will be full
of so many corruptions that every place shall be infected by them. But however
that may be, we must not turn aside from time simplicity of our faith, and must
always seek to be instructed simply by our God. When we follow this course,

that is good, to everything that is worthy of praise. &#8216;The word may be
taken, as it is observed, either actively or passively, and so may signify not
only to be disappointed by others, but to disapprove themselves; in which latter
sense we must, at present, principally understand the phrase. They disapprove
all that which claims their approbation and esteem; and are disaffected to all
that good which the religion they profess would oblige them to the practice of.
The expression, therefore, does not so much signify their omission of what is
good, as their disinclination to it; but it further denotes that, if they do
anything at all in religion, it is what they neither delight in, nor can endure.
&#8216;Every good work&#8217; is an expression of such latitude, that it may
comprehend all the works of piety, mercy, and common justice. And so it is fit
we should understand it in this place. Whatever they do of this kind, their

&#8220;Let the doctrine which proceeds from thy mouth be sound. For he expressly
uses this word, because it is the means of upholding us in true integrity, that
time word of God, which is preached to us, be our spiritual pasture. This will
not be perceived at first sight, but such is the fact. And why do we not
perceive it? Because we are too sensual and earthly. For when we are in want of
food for our body, we are immediately terrified we become alarmed, we have not a
moment of repose, for it touches us nearly. We are sensitive as to this fading
life, but we are insensible to all that affects our souls; there is such brutal
stupidity that we do not know our wants, though they press heavily upon us. Yet
let it be observed that there is nothing but weakness in us, if we are not fed
with the doctrine of God. And that is the reason why it is called
&#8216;sound,&#8217; for in this consists the health of our souls. As our bodies
are kept in their proper condition by well-regulated nourishment, so our souls
are supported by that doctrine which serves not only for nourishment but for
medicine. For we are full of vices which are worse than diseases; and therefore
our soul must be purged, and we must be healed of them. &#8216;The method of
doing this is, that we profit by the word of God. And so it is not without good

ought to be employed; for when they shall unceasingly illustrate that wisdom
which God hath declared to us in the person of his Son, it is certain that the
time will not be lost. And this is what Paul says in another passage,

wishes that every person should be saved; the grace of God hath appeared for the
salvation of every person; it follows, then, that there is free-will, that there
is no election, that none have been predestinated to salvation.&#8217; If those

Timothy 2:6, anything else than that the great are called by God, though they

nevertheless adopted by God, who stretches out his hand to receive them. At that
time, because kings and magistrates were mortal enemies of the gospel, it might
be thought that God had rejected them, and that they cannot obtain salvation.
But Paul says that the door must not be shut against them, and that, eventually,
God may choose some of this company, though their case appear to be desperate
Thus, in this passage, after speaking of time poor slaves who were not reckoned
to belong to the rank of men, he says that God did not fail, on that account, to
show himself compassionate towards them, and that he wishes that the gospel
should be preached to those to whom men do not deign to utter a word. Here is a
poor man, who shall be rejected by us, we shall hardly say, God bless him! and
God addresses him in an especial manner, and declares that he is his Father, and
does not merely say a passing word, but stops him to say, &#8216;Thou art of my
flock, let my word be thy pasture, let it be the spiritual food of thy

closer than love? Here is love to our nature in his incarnation, love to us,
though enemies, in his death and passion: encouragements to obedience by the
proffers of pardon for former rebellions. By the disobedience of man God
introduces his redeeming grace, and engages his creature to more ingenuous and
excellent returns than his innocent state could oblige him to. In his created
state he had goodness to move him, he hath the same goodness now to oblige him
as a creature, and a greater love and mercy to oblige him as a repaired
creature; and the terror of justice is taken off, which might envenom his heart
as a criminal. In his revolted state he had misery to discourage him; in his
redeemed state he hath love to<b> </b>attract him. Without such a way, black
despair had seized upon the creature exposed to a remediless misery, and God
would have hail no returns of love from the best of his earthly works; but if

rubbish of our corrupted estate, we can no more co-operate to the removal of it
than a man buried under the ruins of a fallen house can contribute to the
removal of that great weight that lies upon him. Neither would a man in<b>
</b>that state help such a work, because his lusts are pleasures; pleasuers; he
serves his lusts, which are pleasures as well as lusts, and therefore served
with
delight.&#8221;&#8211;<i>Charnock.</i></font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">ftc47</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
&#8220;The Apostle speaks of what naturally we all were. This, then, is a most
merciful influence that is given forth in the regenerating work. It is as if God
should have said, I see those poor creatures are perishing, not only tending to
hell, but carrying with them their own hell into hell, &#8216;hell being at last
cast into hell&#8217; (as the expression in the Revelation is.) It is a throwing
hell into hell, when a wicked man comes to hell; for he was his own hell before.
God, beholding this forlorn case of wretched creatures, saith, I must either
renew them or lose them; I must either transform them, or they must perish: they
are in the fire of hell already. Such and such we were, but of his mercy he
saved us by the washing of regeneration, and renewing by the Holy Ghost. O! the
compassionate influence that is shed upon a soul in this case! The balmy dews
that descend from heaven upon a distempered soul, which quench the flames of
lust, and which implant and invigorate (after their implantation) a divine
principle, in-create a new life, that leads to God and Christ, and the way of
holiness and heaven at
last.&#8221;&#8211;Howe.</font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">ftc48
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Perhaps the reader will give me leave
to add a short expository lecture upon the most distinguished parts of this very
important paragraph. I.-We have the cause of our redemption; not works of
righteousness which we have done, but the kindness, the love, the mercy, of God
our Savior. To these, to these alone, every child of man must ascribe both his
fruition of present, and his expectation of future blessedness. II.&#8211; The
effects, which are&#8211;1. Justification, being justified, having our sins
forgiven and our persons accepted through the righteousness of Christ imputed;
all this without any the least deserving quality in us, solely by his grace and
most unmerited goodness. 2. Sanctification expressed by the washing of
regeneration&#8211;that washing in the Redeemer&#8217;s blood which cleanses the
soul from guilt, as the washing of water cleanseth the body from filth, which
reconciles to God, give&#8217; peace of conscience, and thereby lays the
foundation of an universal spiritual change&#8211;the renewing of the Holy
Ghost, whose influences, testifying of Christ, and applying his merits,
introduce an improvement into all the faculties of the mind, something like that
annual renovation and general smile which the return of spring diffuses over the
face of nature. III&#8211;The end and consummation of all&#8211;that we should
be made heirs of the heavenly kingdom, and live more in the assured hope,
hereafter in the full enjoyment, of
eternal.&#8221;&#8211;Hervey.</font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">ftc49
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8220;It remaineth that we declare what is
the office of the same, what he, is unto us, as the Holy Spirit; for although
the Spirit of God be of infinite, essential, and original holiness, as God, and
so may be called Holy in himself; though other spirits which were created be
either actually now unholy, or of defectible sanctity at first, and so having
the name of spirit common unto them, he may be termed holy, that he may be
distinguished from them; yet I conceive he is rather called the Holy Spirit, for
the Spirit of Holiness&#8217;
(</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;450104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:4,) because of the three persons in the blessed Trinity, it is his particular
office to sanctify or make us holy. As, therefore, what our Savior did and
suffered for us belonged to that office of a Redeemer which he took upon him; so
whatsoever the Holy Ghost worketh in order to the same salvation, we look upon
as belonging to his office. And because without holiness it is impossible to
please God, because we all are impure and unholy, and the purity and holiness
which is required in us to appear in the presence of God, whose eyes are pure,
must be wrought in us by the Spirit of God, who is called Holy, because he is
the cause of this holiness in us, therefore we acknowledge the office of the
Spirit of God to consist in the sanctifying of the servants of God, and the
declaration of this office, added to the description of his nature, to be a
sufficient explication of the object of faith contained in this
article&#8211;&#8217;I believe in the Holy Ghost<i>&#8211;Bp. Pearson on the
Creed.</i></font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">ftc50
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8220;When we wish to ascertain the method
of our salvation, we must begin with the Son of God. For it is he who hath
washed us <i>by </i>his blood&#8211;it is he who hath obtained righteousness for
us by his obedience &#8212; it is he who is our Advocate, and through whom we
now find grace it is he who procured for us the adoption by which we are made
children and heirs of God. Let us carefully observe that we must seek all the
parts of our salvation in Jesus Christ; for we shall not find a single drop of
it anywhere else.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Fr.

constantly insist on these truths; so that those who have believed in God may
maintain good works.&#8217; The cause of the obscurity, and consequent diversity
of interpretation, arose from the Apostle not having here strewn <i>how </i>it
should be, that the doctrine of salvation by grace should produce holiness of
life. But he has done it in another kindred passage, namely,
</font><sup><font color="Maroon">&lt;490209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
2:9,10, where, after having at large treated on the subject of salvation by
grace, (as here,) adding that it is not of works, lest any man should boast, he
subjoins, </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aujtou~ ga&gt;r ejsmen,

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ga&lt;r</font><font face="Palatino"><i>

it would seem that </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kalw~n

limited, with many eminent commentators, to works of benevolence, still less to
the business of our avocation, but be extended to good works of every
kind.&#8221;&#8211;<i>Bloomfield.</i></font><br><sup><font color="Maroon">ftc53
</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8220;The original word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">proi`&gt;stasqai</font><font face="Palatino">
has a beauty and an energy, which, I believe, it is impossible for our language
to preserve by any literal translation. It implies, that a believer should not
only be exercised in, but eminent for, all good works; should shew others the
way, and outstrip them in the honorable race; be both a pattern and a patron of
universal godliness.&#8221; &#8212;

consider what is the true excellence of the children of God; it is to shew that
they have profited well in doing good, and that this is the subject to which
they have given their study. And then he says, <i>Let them learn; </i>as if he
had said, Hitherto you have employed your time very ill, for there was nothing
but foolish ambition, you yielded too far to your vain fancy. You must now
follow a different course. Henceforth you must excel in doing good, and not in
rambling talk. Instead of being led by curiosity and ambition. let every man be
