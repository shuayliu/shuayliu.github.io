<div><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">TRANSLATOR&#8217;S
PREFACE</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE Dedication to King Edward the Sixth is remarkably
interesting, as it refers to the character of Popery at that day, and to its
manoeuvres with regard to a General Council. The language is strong, and perhaps
rougher than what would be at present used, but still true according to all we
gather from history as to the state of things in those days. The main principles
of Popery are still the same, and similar are its proceedings, though they may
be more disguised, and its spirit is equally intolerant and persecuting. Like
Mahomedanism, it is exclusive, and ever injurious to the harmony and peace of
society.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The order in which the Epistles are arranged is not
the same as in our version. There has not been a uniformity in this respect
among the ancients. The reason for the arrangement here adopted was probably
this, that the First Epistle of Peter, and the First of John, had, from the
beginning, been universally acknowledged as genuine, while the Epistle of James,
the Second of Peter, and that of Jude, had not from the first been universally
received as canonical, though they were eventually so received. The Second and
the Third Epistle of John were evidently not deemed by Calvin as
&#8220;catholic;&#8221; and for this reason, as it seems, he omitted
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word &#8220;Catholic,&#8221; or General, as
applied to the Epistles here explained, has been differently understood. Some
have thought that they have been thus called, because they contain catholic
truths; but other Epistles might, for this reason, be also called catholic.
Others have supposed that catholic is synonymous with canonical; but in this
case also there is no more reason for applying the word to these Epistles than
to any other Epistles. But the more probable opinion is, that they were called
Catholic, or General, because they were not written to any particular Church,
but to Jewish or to Gentile Christians generally. Moreover, the term was not
given them at first, but in subsequent ages.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The most probable <i>dates </i>of the <i>five</i>
Epistles here explained are the following : &#8212; </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This is the order according to the dates most
approved by the learned. There is, for the most part, a unanimity as to the
dates of the three first Epistles; but with regard to the Epistle of Jude, and
the First Epistle of John, there is not the same agreement. There are many who
fix later dates: to Jude, 90, and to John, 91 or 92. But this is a matter of no
great consequence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">No doubt can be justly entertained but that JAMES,
called the Less, was the author of the Epistle. He was the son of Alphaeus or
Cleopas, and of Mary, probably a cousin, not a sister, of Mary the mother of our
Lord. Hence he is called our Lord&#8217;s brother,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480119&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
1:19;) that is, a near relative, as the Word brother is often taken in
Scripture. He took a leading part in the council held at Jerusalem, mentioned in
Acts 15; and, according to <i>Jerome, </i>he resided there thirty years, and
presided over the Church. He was put to death, as Hegesippus relates, who
flourished in the second century, by a tumultuous mob, excited by Jewish
zealots, in the year 62.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The canonicity of James&#8217;s Epistle has been a
subject of dispute, though almost universally allowed in the present day. The
facts respecting it, according to <i>Basnage, </i>are these, &#8212; During the
three first centuries it was not extensively known; in the fourth century its
authenticity was by <i>some</i> disputed; but in the fifth century it was
universally acknowledged as genuine; and it has ever since been so acknowledged,
with a very few exceptions. What seems to be a sufficient evidence in its favor
is the fact, that it is found as a part of Holy Scripture in the first Syriac
Version, which was made early in the second century.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The occasion of writing the Epistle appears to have
been the abuse made of the doctrine of free grace by professing Christians,
&#8212; a subject referred to also by Paul in Romans vi., and in his other
Epistles. Abounding grace is at one time despised and rejected; at another time
it is turned into licentiousness: these are evils which have ever prevailed in
the Church. The Pharisee is too proud to receive grace; the Antinomian pretends
to receive and magnify grace, that he may gratify the inclinations of his sinful
nature. It was against the Antinomian that James wrote his
Epistle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">According to <i>Lardner </i>and <i>Macknight, </i>the
Epistle was addressed to the whole Jewish nation, at home and abroad, believers
and unbelievers; according to <i>Grotius </i>and <i>Wall, </i>to the Jews
dispersed abroad indiscriminately, believing and unbelieving; according to
<i>Michaelis, </i>to the believing Jews, while the unbelieving were not
overlooked; but according to <i>Beza </i>and <i>Scott, </i>to the scattered Jews
who professed the Christian faith. And this last opinion has the strongest
reasons and evidence in its favor. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">Fb1</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the <i>First </i>Epistle of PETER,
there has never been a doubt respecting its genuineness. This Apostle took a
prominent part at first in the cause of Christianity, but of his labors after
the council at Jerusalem, in the year 49, recorded in Acts 15., we have no
account in Scripture. Mention is indeed made, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480211&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
2:11, of his being afterwards at Antioch. It has been justly concluded from the
superscription of this Epistle that he exercised his ministry in those parts
which are here mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was thought by <i>Beza </i>and <i>Grotius </i>that
the Epistle was addressed to converted Jews; but by <i>Doddridge, Macknight,
</i>and <i>Scott,</i> to Christians in general, both Jews and Gentiles. The
latter opinion is the most probable. The arguments assigned by <i>Horne, </i>in
his Introduction, in favor of the former opinion, are by no means
satisfactory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">With regard to the <i>Second </i>Epistle of PETER,
doubts have been entertained by some as to its authenticity. It appears that it
was not at first so widely known as his First Epistle; and this was probably the
reason why there were some during the first three centuries who did not regard
it as genuine. But it has been quoted as a part of Scripture by some of the
earliest Fathers, and fully acknowledged as authentic by those of the fourth and
succeeding centuries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>First </i>Epistle of JOHN has from the
beginning been uniformly received as a portion of Divine Revelation. Some
difference has existed as to the persons for whom it was especially intended,
&#8212; a matter of no great importance. Some have supposed it to have been
written for the Jewish Christians in Judea; but others, with more probability,
for Christians generally, both Jewish and Gentile.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though there is no name attached to it, yet there has
been universal consent from the beginning that John was its author; and indeed
the style of it throughout is sufficient to shew that he was the writer of it;
for his Gospel and the Book of Revelation are in this respect exactly alike; and
it is a style peculiarly his own.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">JUDE, or Judas, was, as he says, the brother of
James, and therefore the son of Alphaeus or Cleopas. Though he does not call
himself an apostle, yet he proved himself to be so by saying that he was the
brother of James. He is called, as James was, the brother of our Lord,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401355&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
13:55. We have in Scripture no account of his ministry after the day of
Pentecost.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">His Epistle was not at first universally received as
canonical. This is acknowledged by <i>Origen, Eusebius, </i>and <i>Jerome;
</i>at the same time, they themselves so regarded it; and Jerome says that in
his day it was by most received as genuine; and it has been quoted as a part of
Scripture by <i>Clement </i>of Alexandria, <i>Tertullian, Cyril </i>of
Jerusalem, <i>Athanasius, Ambrose, </i>and <i>Augustine.</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb2</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That some of the Epistles were not universally
received as authentic at first is no matter of wonder, when we consider the
scattered condition of the Church, and the scanty means of communication. The
fact, that <i>some </i>had doubts respecting them does not in the least degree
invalidate their genuineness; on the contrary, it has conduced to strengthen the
evidence in their favor; for the doubts of some must have occasioned a more
minute inquiry as to their authenticity. And it was not long before all the
Epistles, about which there had been some doubts, had attained the universal
approbation of the Church; and what <i>Lardner </i>states is worthy of special
attention, &#8212; That no writings, received by the primitive Church as
genuine, have been since proved to be spurious; and that no writings, regarded
by it as spurious, have been since proved to be genuine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Editor must mention here, what perhaps he ought
to have mentioned before, &#8212; that in his translations he has not always
retained what is called the historical present tense, which is often used by
<i>Calvin, </i>according to the practice of Latin and Greek writers, and also of
the Prophets and the Evangelists. This mode of writing does not accord with the
usage of the present day.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our translators have not been uniform in this respect
either in the New or the Old Testament; for they sometimes departed from the
original as to this tense, though, for the most part, they retained it. As, for
instance, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431139&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
11:39-40, the historical present is <i>not </i>retained in the 39th, while it is
retained in the 40th verse. The anomalies as to the tenses often met with,
especially in the Psalms, have arisen from overlooking this peculiarity. The
future in Hebrew is very often used for the present; and this is the historical
present, and ought to be rendered in our language in the past
tense.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">JOHN

<div><font face="Palatino">BEHOLD, I return to you again, most excellent King.
For though I did not expect that the Commentaries on Isaiah, which I lately
dedicated to your Majesty, were a worthy gift, yet it was offered with my hearty
good wishes. I have, therefore, thought of adding the Catholic Epistles, as they
are commonly called, as a supplement to make up a full measure, so that both
might come to your hands at the same time. And doubtless, since they were
written either to Gentiles far distant, or to such as inhabited various
countries far asunder, it is nothing new to them to pass over the sea, and to
make a long circuit in coming to your Majesty. At the same time I thus as a
private individual offer to you, most illustrious King, my labors, that being
published under your name, they may profit all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And truly, if there has ever been a time when the
truth of God ought to have been freely and boldly maintained, it has never been
more necessary than in the present day, as all must see. Not to mention the
atrocious cruelty exercised towards its professors, to omit also all those
machinations by which Satan fights against it, sometimes covertly and sometimes
openly, there are places in which the pure doctrine of Religion lately
prevailed, but where now the satellites of the Roman Antichrist, by their
spurious deformations so mock Christ as though they gave a reed in his hand
instead of a scepter, and laid a crown of thorns on his head. When these crafty
corrupters of the purity of the Gospel hope by their arts gradually to
extinguish it, with what cowardice do they connive at these mockeries offered to
Christ, who ought to have hazarded their life a hundred times rather than to
redeem it for a very short time by their perfidious silence?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the meantime, the Pope himself, to complete the
last tragedy of crucifying the Son of God, is said to have summoned again his
own masked council. Though he marches with his savage soldiery to obliterate the
name of Christ and to destroy his Church, yet every kind of council is to him as
a sacred sword, to make slaughter as it were a solemn rite. Thus Paulus the
Third, when he had resolved to kill and destroy all by whom the defense of truth
was preferred to their own life, made a show at Trent of that odious spectre,
though disguised in fine colors, that he might put an end to the Gospel as it
were by its thunders. But all that preparation, when the good fathers had begun,
through some gleams emitted at the sessions, to dazzle the eyes of the simple,
was put an end to by a secret and sudden blast from the holy seat, and vanished
into smoke, except that for the purpose of continuing the terror, a little cloud
rested for a time on Bononia.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence Julius, his successor, who had performed his
part previously at Trent, is said to be preparing himself now for this
stratagem, as though this only remained as means to obliterate the Gospel from
the memory of men, that is, to fulminate against us with the horrible and
terrific decrees of council; though many think that he only makes a pretense.
But it signifies but little whether he pretends or really means to call a
council. It is indeed a thing clear and well proved, that since the Papacy began
to decline through the efforts of Luther, whoever occupied that citadel of
tyranny, though they might hope to obtain some support from a council, they yet
have shunned this kind of remedy in way similar to a sick man, who, being all
over full of ulcers, dreads even the touch of the most tender physician.
Therefore common even among children is the saying, that the Papacy cannot
otherwise be assisted by a council than by cauterizing or
amputation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But I see no cause why the Popes dread councils so
much, except that fear is an inseparable companion of a bad conscience. For
what, I pray, was the late rabble at Trent, (to which yet they gave the name of
a holy, general, and ecumenical synod,) but a sort of empty apparition, which no
more disturbed the pleasures of the Pope than the clangor of trumpets, or the
sound of drums, with which he daily amuses himself? Were, indeed, a synod from
all parts really assembled, here might be some cause of fear, lest a
disturbance, arising in so great a multitude, should occasion a greater tumult.
But by such fictitious councils as that of Trent, who can believe that a Pope
could be terrified any more than by children&#8217;s rattles, but that on the
contrary he would sweetly slumber as through the blandishments of a quieter
sleep? For example, two or three cardinals shall be chosen by the Pope, being
his bosom friends, who shall wield all the authority. The same tyrant will hire
from his courtiers some greedy fellow for a few ducats a month, who, being
clothed in the mask of a patriarch, will servilely declare as his own opinion
what had been dictated to him. Such was that blind Robert at Trent, whom I saw
some time ago at Ratisbon, busying himself, not less foolishly than wickedly, in
behalf of the Pope, when by his inveiglements he tried to draw me to a
conference with Contarenus. There will fly together from all Italy the
three-halfpenny bishops, of whom there will be a vast abundance. There will come
also from France and Spain some of the light-headed and fatuitous, and others
infamous for the vices of their former life; who afterwards returning home will
boast that they had rendered a good and faithful service to the Catholic Church.
Moreover, there will come forth from the caves of monks a great conflux of frogs
into that marsh, who by their eager croaking will banish far away every truth.
What! do I imagine here a new thing, or do I not, on the contrary, correctly
describe the assembly which was lately seen at Trent?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why then is it that the Pope dreads these guardians
of his own tribunal, who are all, in the <i>first </i>place, his own servile
creatures; and who, in the <i>second </i>place, seek no other thing than to gain
by any means his favor?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Our Julius especially, who is a veteran in matters of
this kind, can in mockery, whenever he pleases, compose such a council as this,
so as, in the meantime, to leave as usual the thing undone. And, indeed, as he
has given to many of the Dominicans the red cap, it seems to be no obscure
prelude of such an event. This order, as they say, has ever been in favor with
him; but such profusion arises from a higher cause. He, indeed, knows well, that
none are more shameless than these beggarly fellows, as he has often employed at
his nod their illiberal and sordid services. When he raised them again to this
dignity, he knew that whatever he might bid them to do, none would be more
audacious or more cruel than they. Besides, he is not ignorant that most of
these hungry dogs, feeding on the same rewards, would rush into any contentions
he wishes. I do not, however, say that they are mistaken who declare that he
does not desire a council. But when he has arranged his own theater, some sudden
storm will be raised with no great trouble, which will disturb the whole
proceeding. Hence, at the very beginning, if his own advantage so require it, he
will fold up the curtains. A council, however, though an empty phantom, he
thinks to be to him like Hercules&#8217;s club, to lay Christ prostrate, and to
break in pieces the remnant of the Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When this prince of impiety so wickedly tramples upon
the glory of our God and the salvation of men, does it become us by silence to
betray the sacred cause? nay, we ought to undergo hundred deaths, were that
possible, rather than to suffer so unworthy, wicked, and barbarous oppression of
sound doctrine to continue unknown through our sloth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us grant what is hardly credible, that the
Pope with his band does seriously intend to call a council. In that case Christ
will not, at the first view, be so grossly mocked; yet in this way a wicked
conspiracy would be formed Against him: nay, the greater the fame of the gravity
and splendor of the Papal council, the more injurious would it be to the Church,
and a more dreadful pest would it prove. For it cannot possibly be hoped, that
an assembly gathered under the authority of Antichrist, should be governed by
the Spirit, or that the slaves of Satan should exercise any moderation. In the
first place, the Pope, the professed and sworn enemy of Christ, would occupy
there the chief place of authority. Though he would especially pretend to ask
the opinions of the Fathers sitting there, yet being terrified by his presence,
they would all follow what would please him. But in an assembly fully agreeing
in every impiety, what need would there be of dissimulation? Such, I have no
doubt, is every one of the cardinals. In that very college, which pretends to be
a holier senate, there prevails, it is evident, an Epicurean contempt of God, a
savage hatred of truth, a rabid fury against all the pious. Then the order of
bishops, does it not consist nearly of the same monsters? except that many among
them are slothful asses, who neither openly despise God, nor hostilely oppose
sound doctrine; yet they are so enamoured with their own depraved state, that
they cannot endure any reformation. Add to this, that authority will reside
almost wholly with the few, who, being indeed altogether destitute of any
concern for true religion, will shew themselves the most fierce supporters of
the Roman See: others will make up the number. As every one of these will speak
the most atrocious things against us, there will be many not only of those who
may only give their votes, but also of the princes, who will subscribe either
willingly and gladly according to their own inclinations, or from ambition, or
from fear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I am not however, so unjust as not to concede that
some of these have a sounder judgment and are not otherwise ill disposed; but
they do not possess so much courage, that they will dare to resist the
wickedness of the whole body. There will be perhaps, amidst a thousand, two or
three who may dare to give a half-uttered word for Christ, (as Peter Paul
Vergerius at Trent) but the holy council of the Fathers will have a remedy at
hand, so that such may not create any further trouble; for being cast into
prison, they will be presently driven to a recantation, or they will have to pay
the penalty of death for too much freedom of speech, or they will have to drink
the cup of perpetual silence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But such is the equity with which we are treated,
that we are untameable and hopelessly perverse heretics, except we seek from the
holy council the rule for the necessary reformation, except we acquiesce without
any demur in its decrees, whatever they may be. We, indeed, do not shun the
authority of a legitimate council, (if such could be had,) as we have already
made sufficiently evident by clear proofs. But when they require that we are to
bow to the judgment of the chief adversary of Christ without any appeal, and
indeed on this condition, that religion is to be defined at their will and
pleasure, and not by the Word of God, what reason have we for submission, except
we are prepared willingly and knowingly to deny Christ? There is no reason for
any one to object and say, that we distrust before the time. Let them give us a
council in which there will be a free liberty given to defend the cause of
truth: if to that we refuse to come, and to give a reason for all that we have
done, then they will justly charge us with contumacy. But so far will a
permission be given us freely to speak, that there is no doubt but that we shall
be prevented from making even a suitable defense. For how can they listen to the
clear-sounding thunders of truth, who can by no means bear warnings however
bland and conveyed in soft whispers? But this they publicly do &#8212; They
invite us; is it that they may grant us some place on the lowest seats? Nay,
they declare that it is not lawful to admit any one to their sittings except the
anointed and the mitred. Then let them sit, provided we are heard, declaring the
truth while standing. They answer, that they freely promise a hearing; that is,
that having presented a suppliant petition, being ordered immediately to depart,
after the turbulent clamours of some days, we shall be recalled for the purpose
of being condemned. I say clamours, not that any altercation of dissidents is to
be in that assembly, but that the sacred ears of bishops having been so
irreverently offended by us, the indignity will appear to them intolerable. It
is not unknown how tumultuous is their violence. Surely, when hey ought to
determine the cause with reason, this can never be obtained from them, when not
even a slight hearing can be hoped for.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We shall endeavor to restore God&#8217;s worship to
its purity, purged from the innumerable superstitions by which it has been
corrupted. Here the profane orators will chatter about nothing but the
institutes, the old rites and ceremonies of the Fathers, as though the Church
taught by the celestial ministry of the prophets and of Christ knew no other way
of worshipping God than by adopting, in brutal stupidity, the dregs of Romulus,
made fascinating by the anile dotages of Numa Pompilius. But where is that
simplicity of obedience which the Lord everywhere makes so much of and so
distinctly requires?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If the controversy be concerning the depravity of
human nature, the miserable and lost state of mankind, the grace and power of
Christ, or the freeness of our salvation, they will immediately bring forward
and dogmatically allege the putid axioms of the schools, as things that ought to
be received without dispute. The Holy Spirit teaches us in Scripture, that our
mind is smitten with so much blindness, that the affections of our heart are so
depraved and perverted, that our whole nature is so vitiated, that we can do
nothing but sin, until he forms a new will within us. He constrains us,
condemned to eternal death, to renounce all confidence in our own works, and to
flee to our only asylum, the mercy of God, and to trust in it for all our
righteousness. He also, inviting us to God, testifies that God is reconciled to
us only through the blood of Christ, and bids us to rely on Christ&#8217;s
merits, and to come boldly to the heavenly tribunal. That none of these things
may be heard, those endless decrees are adduced, to violate which is deemed more
unlawful than to disbelieve God and all his angels.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Of the sacraments they will not permit a word to be
said, differing from the notions entertained of them. And what else is this but
to preclude the possibility of any reformation? But it is easy to show how
preposterous is the administration of the sacraments under the Papacy, so that
hardly anything bears an affinity to the genuine doctrine of Christ. What
spurious corruptions have crept in, nay, what disgraceful sacrileges have
entered! It is not lawful to move a question on this subject. Hence it is a
common saying with theologians, which they have published everywhere in their
books: That the Church may remain safe, care must especially be taken that the
council should not admit a doubt respecting the chief controversies of the
present day. Come forth also has lately, in the Italian language, the insipid
book of one Mutius, witlessly breathing nothing but carnage, in which he dwells
profusely on this point, that nothing else is to be done by the reverend
Fathers, when they meet in council, but to pronounce what already appears to
them right on the whole subject, and to compel us to subscribe to their
sanguinary edicts. I should not indeed have thought it necessary to mention the
hoarse chatterings of this unlucky owl, had not Pope Julius recommended the
work. Hence readers may judge what sort of council Mutius recommends, and is to
be expected from Julius his approver.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then we see that these antichrists rush on with
desperate pertinacity in order to destroy sound doctrine, and with equal
insolence boldly exult that they will set up a masked council for no other
purpose than that, having put to flight the gospel, they may celebrate their own
victory; let us also in our turn gather courage to follow the banner of our
leader, having put on the armor of truth. Were only the pure and simple doctrine
of Scripture to shine forth as it ought, every one, who refuses not to open his
eyes, would acknowledge the Papacy to be a savage and an execrable monster, made
up, through Satan&#8217;s arts, of innumerable masses of errors. For we make it
evident by the most solid proofs, that the glory of God is so distributed by a
sacrilegious rending among fictitious idols, that hardly a hundredth portion of
his right remains to him. And further, when they reserve for him some portion of
worship, we can show that no part of it is sincere, inasmuch as all things are
full of the superstitious inventions of men; the law of God is also loaded with
similar devices, for miserable consciences are held bound under the yoke of men,
rather than ruled by God&#8217;s commandments; and they groan and toil under the
unjust burden of so many traditions, nay, they are oppressed with a cruel
tyranny. We declare that, prevaricating obedience can avail nothing except to
lead men to a deeper labyrinth. We shew clearly from Scripture, that
Christ&#8217;s power under the Papacy is almost abolished, that his grace is in
a great measure made void, that unhappy souls removed from him, are inflated
with a fatal confidence in their own power and works. We prove that prayer to
God, such as is prescribed by his word, (which yet is the only true asylum of
salvation) is wholly subverted. We plainly shew that the sacraments are
adulterated by extraneous inventions, and are also transferred to a foreign
purpose; for the power of the Spirit is impiously tied to them, and what is
peculiar to Christ is ascribed to them. Then we disown the number <i>seven,
</i>which they have presumptuously adopted. The mass also, which they imagine to
be a sacrifice, we prove to be a disgraceful denial of the sacrifice of Christ.
There are many other sacrilegious things of which we make it evident that they
are guilty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Doubtless, were only the Scripture allowed its own
authority, there are none of these things respecting which our adversaries would
not be constrained to be mute. And this is what they by no means dissemble, when
they contend that owing to the ambiguous meaning of Scripture, we ought to stand
solely on the judgment of the Church. Who, I pray, does not see, that by laying
aside the word of God, the whole right of defining things is thus transferred to
them? Though they may kiss the closed copies of the Scripture as a kind of
worship, when yet they charge it with being obscure and ambiguous, they allow it
no more authority than if no part of it existed in writing. Let them assume
specious titles as they please, that they may not appear to allege anything
besides the dictates of the Spirit, (as they are wont to boast,) yet it is a
settled and fixed thing with them, that all reasons being laid aside, their will
alone ought to be believed
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aujto&gt;pistov</font><font face="Palatino">.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then, lest the faithful should be carried about by
every wind of imposture, lest they should be exposed to the crafty cavils of the
ungodly, being taught by the sure experiment of faith, let them know that
nothing is more firm or certain than the teaching of Scripture, and on that
support let them confidently recumb. And since we see that it is shamefully
deformed by the false comments of the Sophists, and that at this day the hired
rabble of the Pope are bent on this artifice, in order that by their smoke they
may obscure the light, it behoves us to be more intent on the restoration of its
brightness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I, indeed, have in an especial manner resolved to
devote myself to this work, as long as I live, whenever time and opportunity
shall be afforded me. In the first place, the Church to which I belong shall
thus receive the fruit of this labor, so that it may hereafter continue the
longer; for though a small portion of time remains to me from the duties of my
office, yet that, how small soever it may be, I have determined to devote to
this kind of writing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But to return to you, most, illustrious King, here
you have a small pledge, my Commentaries on the Catholic Epistles, where many
things have been deemed obscure and recondite, which I have endeavored so to
explain, that an easy access to the true meaning might be open to a reader not
altogether slothful. And as interpreters of Scripture, according to their
opportunity, are to supply weapons to fight against Antichrist, so also you must
bear in mind that it is a duty which belongs to your Majesty, to vindicate from
unworthy calumnies the true and genuine interpretation of Scripture, so that
pure religion may flourish. It was not without reason that God commanded by
Moses, that as soon as a king was appointed over his people, he should take care
to have a copy of the Law written out for himself. Why so, if he had, as a
private individual, already exercised himself diligently in this work, but that
he might know that kings have themselves need of this remarkable doctrine, and
are especially enjoined to defend and maintain it; the Lord has assigned to his
Law a sacred habitation in their palaces. Moreover, since the heroic greatness
of your mind far surpasses the measure of your age, there is no reason why I
should add more words to stimulate you.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Farewell, most noble King. May the Lord protect your
Majesty as he has already done, govern you and your counsellors with the spirit
of wisdom and fortitude, and keep your whole kingdom in safety and
peace.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>ON</b></font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" size="7" color="Blue">THE FIRST
EPISTLE OF PETER</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE ARGUMENT</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THE design of Peter in this Epistle is to exhort the
faithful to a denial of the world and a contempt of it, so that being freed from
carnal affections and all earthly hindrances, they might with their whole soul
aspire after the celestial kingdom of Christ, that being elevated by hope,
supported by patience, and fortified by courage and perseverance, they might
overcome all kinds of temptations, and pursue this course and practice
throughout life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence at the very beginning he proclaims in express
words the grace of God made known to us in Christ; and at the same time he adds,
that it is received by faith and possessed by hope, so that the godly might
raise up their minds and hearts above the world. Hence he exhorts them to
holiness, lest they should render void the price by which they were redeemed,
and lest they should suffer the incorruptible seed of the Word, by which they
had been regenerated into eternal life, to be destroyed or to die. And as he had
said, that they had been born again by God&#8217;s Word, he makes mention of
their spiritual infancy. Moreover, that their faith might not vacillate or
stagger, because they saw that Christ was despised and rejected almost by the
whole world, he reminds them that this was only the fulfillment of what had been
written of him, that he would be the stone of stumbling. But he further teaches
them that he would be a firm foundation to those who believe in him. Hence he
again refers to the great honor to which God had raised them, that they might be
animated by the contemplation of their former state, and by the perception of
their present benefits, to devote themselves to a godly life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards comes to particular exhortations,
&#8212; that they were to conduct themselves in humility and obedience under the
government of princes, that servants were to be subject to their masters, that
wives were to obey their husbands and to be modest and chaste, and that, on the
other hand, husbands were to treat their wives with kindness. And then he
commands them to observe what was just and right towards one another; and that
they might do this the more willingly, he sets before them what would be the
fruit &#8212; -a peaceable and happy life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, however, it happened to Christians, that how much
soever they sought peace, they were often harassed by many injuries, and had the
world for no just cause inimical to them, he exhorts them calmly to bear their
persecutions, which they knew would promote their salvation. For this purpose he
brings forward the example of Christ. On the other hand, he reminds them what
unhappy end awaits the ungodly, whilst in the meantime God wonderfully delivers
his Church from death by death. He still further refers to the example of Christ
to enforce the mortification of the flesh. To this exhortation he adds various
and brief sentences; but shortly after he returns to the doctrine of patience,
so that the faithful might mingle consolation with their evils, regarding it as
good for them to be chastised by the paternal hand of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the beginning of the fifth chapter he reminds the
elders of their duty, that they were not to tyrannize over the Church, but to
preside under Christ with moderation. He recommends to the young modesty and
teachableness. At length, after a short exhortation, he closes the Epistle with
a prayer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the place from which he wrote, all do not
agree. There is, however, no reason that I see why we should doubt that he was
then at Babylon, as he expressly declares. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But as the persuasion had prevailed, that he had moved from Antioch to Rome, and
that he died at Rome, the ancients, led by this sole argument, imagined that
Rome is here allegorically called Babylon. But as without any probable
conjecture they rashly believed what they have said of the Roman episcopate of
Peter, so also this allegorical figment ought to be regarded as nothing. It is
indeed much more probable that Peter, according to the character of his
apostleship, traveled over those parts in which most of the Jews resided; and we
know that a great number of them were in Babylon and in the surrounding
countries.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peter, an
apostle</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>What in this salutation is the
same with those of Paul, requires no new explanation. When Paul prayed for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>the verb is left out; but Peter adds it, and says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>be
multiplied</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>still the meaning is the
same; for Paul did not wish to the faithful the beginning of grace and peace,
but the increase of them, that is, that God would complete what he had
begun.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the
elect</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or the elected. It may be asked,
how could this be found out, for the election of God is hid, and cannot be known
without the special revelation of the Spirit; and as every one is made sure of
his own election by the testimony of the Spirit, so he can know nothing certain
of others. To this I answer, that we are not curiously to inquire about the
election of our brethren, but ought on the contrary to regard their calling, so
that all who are admitted by faith into the church, are to be counted as the
elect; for God thus separates them from the world, which is a sign of election.
It is no objection to say that many fall away, having nothing but the semblance;
for it is the judgment of charity and not of faith, when we deem all those elect
in whom appears the mark of God&#8217;s adoption. And that he does not fetch
their election from the hidden counsel of God, but gathers it from the effect,
is evident from the context; for afterwards he connects it with the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctification of the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As far then as they proved that
they were regenerated by the Spirit of God, so far did he deem them to be the
elect of God, for God does not sanctify any but those whom he has previously
elected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However, he at the same time reminds us whence that
election flows, by which we are separated for salvation, that we may not perish
with the world; for he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>according to the foreknowledge of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is the fountain and the first
cause: God knew before the world was created whom he had elected for
salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we ought wisely to consider what this
precognition or foreknowledge is. For the sophists, in order to obscure the
grace of God, imagine that the merits of each are foreseen by God, and that thus
the reprobate are distinguished from the elect, as every one proves himself
worthy of this or that lot. But Scripture everywhere sets the counsel of God, on
which is founded our salvation, in opposition to our merits. Hence, when Peter
calls them elect according to the precognition of God, he intimates that the
cause of it depends on nothing else but on God alone, for he of his own free
will has chosen us. Then the foreknowledge of God excludes every worthiness on
the part of man. We have treated this subject more at large in the first chapter
of the Epistle to the Ephesians, and in other places.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As however in our election he assigns the first place
to the gratuitous favor of God, so again he would have us to know it by the
effects, for there is nothing more dangerous or more preposterous than to
overlook our calling and to seek for the certainty of our election in the hidden
prescience of God, which is the deepest labyrinth. Therefore to obviate this
danger, Peter supplies the best correction; for though in the first place he
would have us to consider the counsel of God, the cause of which is alone in
himself; yet he invites us to notice the effect, by which he sets forth and
bears witness to our election. That effect is the sanctification of the Spirit,
even effectual calling, when faith is added to the outward preaching of the
gospel, which faith is begotten by the inward operation of the
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the
sojourners</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">Fb4</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
They who think that all the godly are thus called, because they are strangers in
the world, and are advancing towards the celestial country, are much mistaken,
and this mistake is evident from the word <i>dispersion </i>which immediately
follows; for this can apply only to the Jews, not only because they were
banished from their own country and scattered here and there, but also because
they had been driven out of that land which had been promised to them by the
Lord as a perpetual inheritance. He indeed afterwards calls all the faithful
sojourners, because they are pilgrims on the earth; but the reason here is
different. They were sojourners, because they had been dispersed, some in
Pontus, some in Galatia, and some in Bithynia. It is nothing strange that he
designed this Epistle more especially for the Jews, for he knew that he was
appointed in a particular manner their apostle, as Paul teaches us in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
2:8. In the countries he enumerates, he includes the whole of Asia Minor, from
the Euxine to Cappadocia. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb5</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unto
obedience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He adds two things to
sanctification, and seems to understand newness of life by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>obedience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>and by the <i>sprinkling </i>of the blood of Christ the remission of sins.
But if these be parts or <i>effects </i>of sanctification, then sanctification
is to be taken here somewhat different from what it means when used by Paul,
that is, more generally. God then sanctifies us by an effectual calling; and
this is done when we are renewed to an obedience to his righteousness, and when
we are sprinkled by the blood of Christ, and thus are cleansed from our sins.
And there seems to be an implied allusion to the ancient rite of sprinkling used
under the law. For as it was not then sufficient for the victim to be slain and
the blood to be poured out, except the people were sprinkled; so now the blood
of Christ which has been shed will avail us nothing, except our consciences are
by it cleansed. There is then to be understood here a contrast, that, as
formerly under the law the sprinkling of blood was made by the hand of the
priest; so now the Holy Spirit sprinkles our souls with the blood of Christ for
the expiation of our sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now state the substance of the whole; which
is, that our salvation flows from the gratuitous election of God; but that it is
to be ascertained by the experience of faith, because he sanctifies us by his
Spirit; and then that there are two effects or ends of our calling, even renewal
into obedience and ablution by the blood of Christ; and further, that both are
the work of the Holy Spirit. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb6</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We hence conclude, that election is not to be separated from calling, nor the
gratuitous righteousness of faith from newness of life.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed be
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We have said that he main object of
this epistle is to raise us above the world, in order that we may be prepared
and encouraged to sustain the spiritual contests of our warfare. For this end,
the knowledge of God&#8217;s benefits avails much; for, when their value appears
to us, all other things will be deemed worthless, especially when we consider
what Christ and his blessings are; for everything without him is but dross. For
this reason he highly extols the wonderful grace of God in Christ, that is, that
we may not deem it much to give up the world in order that we may enjoy the
invaluable treasure of a future life; and also that we may not be broken down by
present troubles, but patiently endure them, being satisfied with eternal
happiness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Further, when he gives thanks to God, he invites the
faithful to spiritual joy, which can swallow up all the opposite feelings of the
flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Understand the words thus,
&#8212; &#8221;Blessed be God who is the Father of Jesus Christ.&#8221; For, as
formerly, by calling himself the God of Abraham, he designed to mark the
difference between him and all fictitious gods; so after he has manifested
himself in his own Son, his will is, not to be known otherwise than in him.
Hence they who form their ideas of God in his naked majesty apart from Christ,
have an idol instead of the true God, as the case is with the Jews and the
Turks. Whosoever, then, seeks really to know the only true God, must regard him
as the Father of Christ; for, whenever our mind seeks God, except Christ be
thought of, it will wander and be confused, until it be wholly lost. Peter meant
at the same time to intimate how God is so bountiful and kind towards us; for,
except Christ stood as the middle person, his goodness could never be really
known by us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath begotten us
again</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He shews that supernatural life
is a gift, because we are born the children of wrath; for had we been born to
the hope of life according to the flesh, there would have been no necessity of
being begotten again by God. Therefore Peter teaches us, that we who are by
nature destined to eternal death, are restored to life by God&#8217;s mercy. And
this is, as it were, our second creation, as it is said in the first chapter of
the Epistle to the Ephesians. <i>Lively </i>or <i>living hope, </i>means the
hope of life. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb7</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
At the same time there seems to be an implied contrast between the hope fixed on
the incorruptible kingdom of God, and the fading and transient hopes of
man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to his abundant
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He first mentions the efficient
cause, and then he points out the mediating cause, as they say. He shews that
God was induced by no merits of ours to regenerate us unto a living hope,
because he assigns this wholly to his mercy. But that he might more completely
reduce the merits of works to nothing, he says, <i>great (multam)
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>All, indeed, confess that God is the only author of our salvation, but they
afterwards invent extraneous causes, which take away so much from his mercy. But
Peter commends mercy alone; and he immediately connects the way or manner,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the resurrection of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for God does not in any other
way discover his mercy; hence Scripture ever directs our attention to this
point. And that Christ&#8217;s death is not mentioned, but his resurrection,
involves no inconsistency, for it is included; because a thing cannot be
completed without having a beginning; and he especially brought forward the
resurrection, because he was speaking of a new life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4<i>.</i></b><i>

inheritance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb8</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The three words which follow are intended to amplify God&#8217;s grace; for
Peter (as I have before said) had this object in view, to impress our minds
thoroughly as to its excellency. Moreover, these two clauses, &#8220;to an
inheritance incorruptible,&#8221; etc., and &#8220;to salvation ready to be
revealed,&#8221; I deem as being in apposition, the latter being explanatory of
the former; for he expresses the same thing in two ways.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Every word which follows is weighty. The inheritance
is said to be <i>reserved, </i>or preserved, that we may know that it is beyond
the reach of danger. For, were it not in God&#8217;s hand, it might be exposed
to endless dangers. If it were in this world, how could we regard it as safe
amidst so many changes? That he might then free us from every fear, he testifies
that our salvation is placed in safety beyond the harms which Satan can do. But
as the certainty of salvation can bring us but little comfort, except each one
knows that it belongs to himself, Peter adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For consciences will calmly recumb
here, that is, when the Lord cries to them from heaven, &#8220;Behold, your
salvation is in my hand and is kept for you.&#8221; But as salvation is not
indiscriminately for all, he calls our attention to faith, that all who are
endued with faith, might be distinguished from the rest, and that they might not
doubt but that they are the true and legitimate heirs of God. For, as faith
penetrates into the heavens, so also it appropriates to us the blessings which
are in heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who are kept by the power of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>We are to notice the connection
when he says, that we are kept while in the world, and at the same time our
inheritance is reserved in heaven; otherwise this thought would immediately
creep in, &#8220;What does it avail us that our salvation is laid up in heaven,
when we are tossed here and there in this world as in a turbulent sea? What can
it avail us that our salvation is secured in a quiet harbour, when we are driven
to and fro amidst thousand shipwrecks?&#8221; The apostle, therefore,
anticipates objections of this kind, when he shews, that though we are in the
world exposed to dangers, we are yet kept by faith; and that though we are thus
nigh to death, we are yet safe under the guardianship of faith. But as faith
itself, through the infirmity of the flesh, often quails, we might be always
anxious about the morrow, were not the Lord to aid us. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb9</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And, indeed, we see that under the Papacy a
diabolical opinion prevails, that we ought to doubt our final perseverance,
because we are uncertain whether we shall be tomorrow in the same state of
grace. But Peter did not thus leave us in suspense; for he testifies that we
stand by the power of God, lest any doubt arising from a consciousness of our
own infirmity, should disquiet us. How weak soever we may then be, yet our
salvation is not uncertain, because it is sustained by God&#8217;s power. As,
then, we are begotten by faith, so faith itself receives its stability from
God&#8217;s power. Hence is its security, not only for the present, but also for
the future.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unto
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As we are by nature impatient
of delay, and soon succumb under weariness, he therefore reminds us that
salvation is not deferred because it is not yet prepared, but because the time
of its revelation is not yet come. This doctrine is intended to nourish and
sustain our hope. Moreover, he calls the day of judgment
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the last
time</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because the restitution of all
things is not to be previously expected, for the intervening time is still in
progress. What is elsewhere called the last time, is the whole from the coming
of Christ; it is so called from a comparison with the preceding ages. But Peter
had a regard to the end of the world.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherein ye greatly
rejoice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, In which ye exult. Though
the termination of the Greek verb is doubtful, yet the meaning requires that we
read, &#8220;ye exult,&#8221; rather than &#8220;exult ye.&#8221;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
which</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>refers to the whole that is said
of the hope of salvation laid up in heaven. But he rather exhorts than praises
them; for his object was to shew what fruit was to come from the hope of
salvation, even spiritual joy, by which not only the bitterness of all evil
might be mitigated, but also all sorrow overcome. At the same time to exult is
more expressive than to rejoice. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb10</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it seems somewhat inconsistent, when he says that
the faithful, who exulted with joy, were at the same time sorrowful, for these
are contrary feelings. But the faithful know by experience, how these things can
exist together, much better than can be expressed in words. However, to explain
the matter in a few words, we may say that the faithful are not logs of wood,
nor have they so divested themselves of human feelings, but that they are
affected with sorrow, fear danger, and feel poverty as an evil, and persecutions
as hard and difficult to be borne. Hence they experience sorrow from evils; but
it is so mitigated by faith, that they cease not at the same time to rejoice.
Thus sorrow does not prevent their joy, but, on the contrary, give place to it.
Again, though joy overcomes sorrow, yet it does not put an end to it, for it
does not divest us of humanity. And hence it appears what true patience is; its
beginning, and, as it were, its root, is the knowledge of God&#8217;s blessings,
especially of that gratuitous adoption with which he has favored us; for all who
raise hither their minds, find it an easy thing calmly to bear all evils. For
whence is it that our minds are pressed down with grief, except that we have no
participation of spiritual things? But all they who regard their troubles as
necessary trials for their salvation, not only rise above them, but also turn
them to an occasion of joy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye are in
heaviness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, Ye are made sorrowful. Is
not sorrow also the common lot of the reprobate? for they are not free from
evils. But Peter meant that the faithful endure sorrow willingly, while the
ungodly murmur and perversely contend with God. Hence the godly bear sorrow, as
the tamed ox the yoke, or as a horse, broken in, the bridle, though held by a
child. God by sorrow afflicts the reprobate, as when a bridle is by force put in
the mouth of a ferocious and refractory horse; he kicks and offers every
resistance, but all in vain. Then Peter commends the faithful, because they
willingly undergo sorrow, and not as though forced by
necessity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>though now for a
season</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, a little while, he supplied
consolation; for the shortness of time, however hard evils may be, does not a
little lessen them; and the duration of the present life is but a moment of
time. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If need
be</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>the condition is to be taken for a
cause; for he purposed to shew, that God does not, without reason, thus try his
people; for, if God afflicted us without a cause, to bear it would be grievous.
Hence Peter took an argument for consolation from the design of God; not that
the reason always appears to us, but that we ought to be fully persuaded that it
ought to be so, because it is God&#8217;s will.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must notice that he does not mention one
temptation, but many; and not temptations of one kind, but <i>manifold
temptations. </i>It is, however, better to seek the exposition of this passage
in the first chapter of James.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Much more precious than of
gold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The argument is from the less to
the greater; for if gold, a corruptible metal, is deemed of so much value that
we prove it by fire, that it may become really valuable, what wonder is it that
God should require a similar trial as to faith, since faith is deemed by him so
excellent? And though the words seem to have a different meaning, he yet
compares faith to gold, and makes it more precious than gold, that hence he
might draw the conclusion, that it ought to be fully proved. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb11</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is moreover uncertain how far he extends the meaning of the words,
&#8220;tried&#8221;
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dokima&gt;zesqai</font><font face="Palatino">
and &#8220;trial&#8221;
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">doki&gt;mion</font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Gold is, indeed, tried twice by fire; first. when it
is separated from its dross; and then, when a judgment. is to be formed of its
purity. Both modes of trial may very suitably be applied to faith; for when
there is much of the dregs of unbelief remaining in us, and when by various
afflictions we are refined as it were in God&#8217;s furnace, the dross of our
faith is removed, so that it. becomes pure and clean before God; and, at the
same time, a trial of it is made, as to whether it be true or fictitious. I am
disposed to take these two views, and what immediately follows seems to favor
this explanation; for as silver is without honor or value before it be refined,
so he intimates that our faith is not to be honored and crowned by God until it
be duly proved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At the appearing of Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, when Jesus Christ shall be
revealed. This is added, that the faithful might learn to hold on courageously
to the last day. For our life is now hidden in Christ, and will remain hidden,
and as it were buried, until Christ shall appear from heaven; and the whole
course of our life leads to the destruction of the external man, and all the
things we suffer are, as it were, the preludes of death. It is hence necessary,
that we should cast our own eyes on Christ, if we wish in our afflictions to
behold glory and praise. For trials as to us are full of reproach and shame, and
they become glorious in Christ; but that glory in Christ is not yet plainly
seen, for the day of consolation is not yet come. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb12</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom having not
seen</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, Whom though ye have not seen.
He lays down two things, that they loved Christ whom they had not seen, and that
they believed on him whom they did not then behold. But the first arises from
the Second; for the cause of love is faith, not only because the knowledge of
those blessings which Christ bestows on us, moves us to love him, but because he
offers us perfect felicity, and thus draws us up to himself. He then commends
the Jews, because they believed in Christ whom they did not see, that they might
know that the nature of faith is to acquiesce in those blessings which are hid
from our eyes. They had indeed given some proof of this very thing, though he
rather directs what was to be done by praising them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The first clause in order is, that faith is not to be
measured by sight. For when the life of Christians is apparently miserable, they
would instantly fail, were not their happiness dependent on hope. Faith, indeed,
has also its eyes, but they are such as penetrate into the invisible kingdom of
God, and are contented with the mirror of the Word; for it is the demonstration
of invisible things, as it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581101&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:1. Hence true is that saying of Paul, that we are absent from the Lord while
we are in the flesh; for we walk by faith and not by sight.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:6-7.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The second clause is, that faith is not a cold
notion, but that it kindles in our hearts love to Christ. For faith does not (as
the sophists prattle) lay hold on God in a confused and implicit manner, (for
this would be to wander through devious paths;) but it has Christ as its object.
Moreover, it does not lay hold on the bare name of Christ, or his naked essence,
but regards what he is to us, and what blessings he brings; for it cannot be but
that the affections of man should be led there, where his happiness is,
according to that saying,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Where your
treasure is, there is also your heart.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400621&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
6:21.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye
rejoice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, Ye exult. He again refers
to the fruit of faith which he had mentioned, and not without reason; for it is
an incomparable benefit, that consciences are not only at peace before God, but
confidently exult in the hope of eternal life. And he calls it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>joy
unspeakable</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or unutterable, because the
peace of God exceeds all comprehension. What is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>full of
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or glorified, admits of two
explanations. It means either what is magnificent and glorious, or what is
contrary to that which is empty and fading, of which men will soon be ashamed.
Thus <i>&#8220;glorified&#8221; </i>is the same with what is solid and
permanent, beyond the danger of being brought to nothing. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb13</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Those who are not elevated by this joy above the heavens, so that being content
with Christ alone, they despise the world, in vain boast that they have
faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Receiving the end of your
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He reminds the faithful where
they ought to direct all their thoughts, even to eternal salvation. For this
world holds all our affections ensnared by is allurements; this life and all
things belonging to the body are great impediments, which prevent us from
applying our minds to the contemplation of the future and spiritual life. Hence
the Apostle sets before us this future life as a subject of deep meditation, and
he indirectly intimates that the loss of all other things is to be deemed as
nothing, provided our souls be saved. By saying
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>receiving</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he takes away all doubt, in order that they might more cheerfully go on,
being certain of obtaining salvation. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb14</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In the meantime, however, he shews what the end of faith is, lest they should be
over-anxious, because it is as yet deferred. For our adoption ought now to
satisfy us; nor ought we to ask to be introduced before the time into the
possession of our inheritance. We may also take <i>the end </i>for reward; but
the meaning would be the same. For we learn from the Apostle&#8217;s words, that
salvation is not otherwise obtained than by faith; and we know that faith leans
on the sole promise of gratuitous adoption; but if it be so, doubtless salvation
is not owing to the merits of works, nor can it be hoped for on their
account.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why does he mention <i>souls </i>only, when the
glory of a resurrection is promised to our bodies? As the soul is immortal,
salvation is properly ascribed to it, as Paul sometimes is wont to speak,
&#8212; </font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;That the soul may
be saved in the day of the

<div><font face="Palatino">But it is the same as though he had said
&#8220;Eternal salvation.&#8221; For there is an implied comparison between it
and the mortal and fading life which belongs to the body. At the same time, the
body is not excluded from a participation of glory when annexed to the
soul.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He hence commends the value of salvation, because the
prophets had their minds intensely fixed on it; for it must have been a great
matter, and possessing peculiar excellency, which could have thus kindled in the
prophets a spirit of inquiry respecting it. But still more clearly does
God&#8217;s goodness toward us shine forth in this case, because much more is
now made known to us than what all the prophets attained by their long and
anxious inquiries. At the same time he confirms the certainty of salvation by
this very antiquity; for from the beginning of the world it had received a plain
testimony from the Holy Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">These two things ought to be distinctly noticed: he
declares that more has been given to us than to the ancient fathers, in order to
amplify by this comparison the grace of the gospel; and then, that what is
preached to us respecting salvation, cannot be suspected of any novelty, for the
Spirit had formerly testified of it by the prophets. When, therefore, he says
that the prophets searched and sedulously inquired, this does not belong to
their writings or doctrine, but to the private desire with which every one
boiled over. What is said afterwards is to be referred to their public
office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that each particular may be more evident, the
passage must be arranged under certain propositions. Let the first then be this,
&#8212; that the Prophets who foretold of the grace which Christ exhibited at
his coming, diligently inquired as to the time when full revelation was to be
made. The second is, &#8212; that the Spirit of Christ predicted by them of the
future condition of Christ&#8217;s kingdom, such as it is now, and such as it is
expected yet to be, even that it is destined that Christ and his whole body
should, through various sufferings, enter into glory. The third is, &#8212; that
the prophets ministered to us more abundantly than to their own age, and that
this was revealed to them from above; for in Christ only is the full exhibition
of those things of which God then presented but an obscure image. The fourth is,
&#8212; that in the Gospel is contained a clear confirmation of prophetic
doctrine, but also a much fuller and plainer explanation; for the salvation
which he formerly proclaimed as it were at a distance by the prophets, he now
reveals openly to us, and as it were before our eyes. The last proposition is,
&#8212; -that it hence appears evident how wonderful is the glory of that
salvation promised to us in the Gospel, because even angels, though they enjoy
God&#8217;s presence in heaven, yet burn with the desire of seeing it. Now all
these things tend to shew this one thing, that Christians, elevated to the
height of their felicity, ought to surmount all the obstacles of the world; for
what is there which this incomparable benefit does not reduce to nothing
?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of which
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Had not the fathers the same
salvation as we have? Why then does he say that the fathers
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>inquired</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>as though they possessed not what is now offered to us? The answer to this
is plain, that salvation is to be taken here for that clear manifestation of it
which we have through the coming of Christ. The words of Peter mean no other
thing than those of Christ, when he said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Many kings and
prophets have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen
them.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401317&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
13:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As then the prophets had but a limited knowledge of
the grace brought by Christ, as to its revelation they justly desired something
more. When Simeon, after seeing Christ, prepared himself calmly and with a
satisfied mind for death, he shewed that he was before unsatisfied and anxious.
Such was the feeling of all the godly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>. And what they inquired is pointed out when
he adds</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, Searching what, or what
manner of time</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There was a difference
between the law and the gospel, a veil as it were being interposed, that they
might not see those things nearer which are now set before our eyes. Nor was it
indeed proper, while Christ the Sun of righteousness was yet absent, that the
full light should shine as at mid-day. And though it was their duty to confine
themselves within their prescribed limits, yet it was no superstition to sigh
with a desire of having a nearer sight For when they wished that redemption
should be hastened, and desired daily to see it, there was nothing in such a
wish to prevent them patiently to wait as long as it pleased the Lord to defer
the time. Moreover, to seek as to prophecies the particular time, seems to me
unprofitable; for what is spoken of here is not what the prophets taught, but
what they wished. Where the Latin interpreters render, &#8220;of future
grace,&#8221; it is literally, &#8220;of the grace which is to you.&#8221; But
as the meaning remains the same, I was not disposed to make any
change.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is more worthy of observation, that he does not
say that the prophets searched according to their own understanding as to the
time when Christ&#8217;s kingdom would come, but that they applied their minds
to the revelation of the Spirit. Thus they have taught us by their example a
sobriety in learning, for they did not go beyond what the Spirit taught them.
And doubtless there will be no limits to man&#8217;s curiosity, except the
Spirit of God presides over their minds, so that they may not desire anything
else than to speak from him. And further, the spiritual kingdom is a higher
subject than what the human mind can succeed in investigating, except the Spirit
be the guide. May we also therefore submit to his guidance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Spirit of Christ which was in
them</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>First, &#8220;who was in
them,&#8221; and secondly, &#8220;testifying,&#8221; that is, giving a
testimony, by which expression he intimates that the prophets were endued with
the Spirit of knowledge, and indeed in no common manner, as those who have been
teachers and witnesses to us, and that yet they were not partakers of that light
which is exhibited to us. At the same time, a high praise is given to their
doctrine, for it was the testimony of the Holy Spirit; the preachers and
ministers were men, but he was the teacher. Nor does he declare without reason
that the Spirit of Christ then ruled; and he makes the Spirit, sent from heaven,
to preside over the teachers of the Gospel, for he shews that the Gospel comes
from God, and that the ancient prophecies were dictated by
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The sufferings of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>That they might bear
submissively their afflictions, he reminds them that they had been long ago
foretold by the Spirit. But he includes much more than this, for he teaches us,
that the Church of Christ has been from the beginning so constituted, that the
cross has been the way to victory, and death a passage to life, and that this
had been clearly testified. There is, therefore, no reason why afflictions
should above measure depress us, as though we were miserable under them, since
the Spirit of God pronounces us blessed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The order is to be noticed; he mentions sufferings
first, and then adds the glories which are to follow. For he intimates that this
order cannot be changed or subverted; afflictions must precede glory. So there
is to be understood a twofold truth in these words, &#8212; that Christians must
suffer many troubles before they enjoy glory, &#8212; and that afflictions are
not evils, because they have glory annexed to them. Since God has ordained this
connection, it does not behove us to separate the one from the other. And it is
no common consolation, that our condition, such as we find it to be, has been
foretold so many ages ago.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we learn, that it is not in vain that a happy
end is promised to us; secondly, we hence know that we are not afflicted by
chance, but through the infallible providence of God; and lastly, that
prophecies are like mirrors to set forth to us in tribulations the image of
celestial glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Peter, indeed, says, that the Spirit had testified of
the coming afflictions of Christ; but he does not separate Christ from his body.
This, then, is not to be confined to the person of Christ, but a beginning is to
be made with the head, so that the members may in due order follow, as Paul also
teaches us, that we must be conformed to him who is the first-born among his
brethren. In short, Peter does not speak of what is peculiar to Christ, but of
the universal state of the Church. But it is much fitted to confirm our faith,
when he sets forth our afflictions as viewed in Christ, for we thereby see
better the connection of death and life between us and him. And, doubtless, this
is the privilege and manner of the holy union, that he suffers daily in his
members, that after his sufferings shall be completed in us, glory also may have
its completion. See more on this subject in the third chapter of the Epistle to
the Colossians, and in the fourth of the first Epistle to
Timothy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unto whom it was
revealed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This passage has been
strangely perverted by fanatics, so as to exclude the fathers who lived under
the law from the hope of eternal salvation. For it does not deny that the
prophets usefully ministered to their own age, and edified the church, but
teaches us that their ministry is more useful to us, because we are fallen on
the ends of the world. We see how highly they extolled the kingdom of Christ,
how assiduous they were in adorning it, how diligently they stimulated all to
seek it; but they were by death deprived of the privilege of seeing it as it now
is. What else then was this, but that they spread the table, that others might
afterwards feed on the provisions laid on it. They indeed tasted by faith of
those things which the Lord has by their hands transmitted to be enjoyed by us;
and they also partook of Christ as the real food of their souls. But what is
spoken of now is the exhibition of this blessing, and we know that the prophetic
office was confined as it were within limits, in order that they might support
themselves and others with the hope of Christ, who was to come. They therefore
possessed him as one hidden, and as it were absent &#8212; absent, I say, not in
power or grace, but because he was not yet manifested in the flesh. Therefore
his kingdom also was as yet hid as it were under coverings. At length descending
on earth, he in a manner opened heaven to us, so that we might have a near view
of those spiritual riches, which before were under types exhibited at a
distance. This fruition then of Christ as manifested, forms the difference
between us and the prophets. Hence we learn how they ministered to us rather
than to themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But though the prophets were admonished from above
that the grace which they proclaimed would be deferred to another age, yet they
were not slothful in proclaiming it, so far were they from being broken down
with weariness. But if their patience was so great, surely we shall be twice and
thrice ungrateful, if the fruition of the grace denied to them will not sustain
us under all the evils which are to be endured.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which are now reported to
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or announced to you. He again marks
the difference between the ancient doctrine and the preaching of the gospel. For
as the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel, having a testimony from
the law and the prophets, so also the glory of Christ, of which the Spirit
testified formerly, is now openly proclaimed. And at the same time he hence
proves the certainty of the gospel, because it contains nothing but what had
been long ago testified by the Spirit of God. He further reminds them, that
under the banner of the same Spirit, by his dictation and guidance, the gospel
was preached, lest they might think of anything human in this
case.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which things the angels desire to
look into</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is indeed the highest
praise to the gospel, that it contains treasures of wisdom, as yet concealed and
hidden from angels. But some one may object, and say that it is not reasonable
that things should be open and known to us which are hidden from angels, who
always see the face of God, and are his ministers in ruling the church, and in
the administration of all his blessings. To this I answer, that things are open
to us as far as we see them in the mirror of the word; but our knowledge is not
said to be higher than that of angels; Peter only means that such things are
promised to us as angels desire to see fulfilled. Paul says that by the calling
of the Gentiles the wonderful wisdom of God was made known to angels. for it was
a spectacle to them, when Christ gathered into one body the lost world,
alienated for so many ages from the hope of life. Thus daily they see with
admiration the magnificent works of God in the government of his church. How
much greater will their admiration be, at witnessing the last display of divine
justice, when the kingdom of Christ shall be completed! This is as yet hidden,
the revelation of which they still expect and justly wish to
see.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The passage indeed admits of a twofold meaning;
either that the treasure we have in the gospel fills the angels with a desire to
see it, as it is a sight especially delightful to them; or that they anxiously
desire to see the kingdom of Christ, the living image of which is set forth in
the gospel. But the last seems to me to be the most suitable
meaning.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">From the greatness and excellency of grace he draws
an exhortation, that it surely behoved them the more readily to receive the
grace of God, as the more bountifully he bestowed it upon them. And we must
notice the connection: he had said, that so elevated was the kingdom of Christ,
to which the gospel calls us, that even angels in heaven desire to see it; what
then ought to be done by us who are in the world? Doubtless, as long as we live
on earth, so great is the distance between us and Christ, that in vain he
invites us to himself. It is hence necessary for us to put off the image of Adam
and to cast aside the whole world and all hinderances, that being thus set at
liberty we may rise upwards to Christ. And he exhorted those to whom he wrote,
to be prepared and sober, and to hope for the graces offered to them, and also
to renounce the world and their former life, and to be conformed to the will of
God. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb15</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the first part of the exhortation is, to gird up
the loins of their mind and to direct their thoughts to the hope of the grace
presented to them. In the second par, he prescribes the manner, that having
their minds changed, they were to be formed after the image of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore gird up the loins of
your mind</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is a similitude taken from
an ancient custom; for when they had long garments, they could not make a
journey, nor conveniently do any work, without being girded up. Hence these
expressions, to gird up one&#8217;s-self for a work or an undertaking. He then
bids them to remove all impediments, that being set at liberty they might go on
to God. Those who philosophize more refinedly about the loins, as though he
commanded lusts to be restrained and checked, depart from the real meaning of
the Apostle, for these words mean the same with those of
Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Let your loins be
girded about, and burning lamps in your hands,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421235&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
12:35,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">except that Peter doubles the metaphor by ascribing
loins to the mind. And he intimates that our minds are held entangled by the
passing cares of the world and by vain desires, so that they rise not upward to
God. Whosoever, then, really wishes to have this hope, let him learn in the
first place to disentangle himself from the world, and gird up his mind that it
may not turn aside to vain affections. And for the same purpose he enjoins
sobriety, which immediately follows; for he commends not temperance only in
eating and drinking, but rather spiritual sobriety, when all our thoughts and
affections are so kept as not to be inebriated with the allurements of this
world. For since even the least taste of them stealthily draws us away from God,
when one plunges himself into these, he must necessarily become sleepy and
stupid, and he forgets God and the things of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hope to the
end</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, Perfectly hope. He intimates
that those who let their minds loose on vanity, did not really and sincerely
hope for the grace of God; for though they had some hope, yet as they vacillated
and were tossed to and fro in the world, there was no solidity in their hope.
Then he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for the grace which
will be brought to you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>in order that
they might be more prompt to receive it. God ought to be sought, though far off;
but he comes of his own will to meet us. How great, then, must be our
ingratitude if we neglect the grace that is thus set before us! This
amplification, then, is especially intended to stimulate our
hope.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>At the revelation of Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>may be explained in two ways:
that the doctrine of the Gospel reveals Christ to us; and that, as we see him as
yet only through a mirror and enigmatically, a full revelation is deferred to
the last day. The first meaning is approved by Erasmus, nor do I reject it. The
second seems, however, to be more suitable to the passage. For the object of
Peter was to call us away beyond the world; for this purpose the fittest thing
was the recollection of Christ&#8217;s coming. For when we direct our eyes to
this event, this world becomes crucified to us, and we to the world. Besides,
according to this meaning, Peter used the expression shortly before. Nor is it a
new thing for the apostles to employ the preposition
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn</font><font face="Palatino">
in the sense of
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv</font><font face="Palatino">.
Thus, then, I explain the passage, &#8212; &#8221; You have no need to make a
long journey that you may attain the grace of God; for God anticipates you;
inasmuch as he brings it to you.&#8221; But as the fruition of it will not be
until Christ appears from heaven, in whom is hid the salvation of the godly,
there is need, in the meantime, of hope; for the grace of Christ is now offered
to us in vain, except we patiently wait until the coming of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As obedient
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He first intimates that we are
called by the Lord to the privilege and honor of adoption through the Gospel;
and, secondly, that we are adopted for this end, that he might have us as his
obedient children. For though obedience does not make us children, as the gift
of adoption is gratuitous, yet it distinguishes children from aliens. How far,
indeed, this obedience extends, Peter shews, when he forbids God&#8217;s
children to conform to or to comply with the desires of this world, and when he
exhorts them, on the contrary, to conform to the will of God. The sum of the
whole law, and of all that God requires of us, is this, that his image should
shine forth in us, so that we should not be degenerate children. But this cannot
be except we be renewed and put off the image of old Adam.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence we learn what Christians ought to propose to
themselves as all object throughout life, that is, to resemble God in holiness
and purity. But as all the thoughts and feelings of our flesh are in opposition
to God, and the whole bent of our mind is enmity to him, hence Peter begins with
the renunciation of the world; and certainly, whenever the Scripture speaks of
the renewal of God&#8217;s image in us, it begins here, that the old man with
his lusts is to be destroyed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In your
ignorance</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The time of ignorance he
calls that before they were called into the faith of Christ. We hence learn that
unbelief is the fountain of all evils. For he does not use the word ignorance,
as we commonly do; for that Platonic dogma is false, that ignorance alone is the
cause of sin. But yet, how much soever conscience may reprove the unbelieving,
nevertheless they go astray as the blind in darkness, because they know not the
right way, and they are without the true light. According to this meaning, Paul
says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Ye henceforth walk not as the
Gentiles, in the vanity of their mind, who have the mind darkened, being
alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in
them.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490417&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
4:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Where the knowledge of God is not, there darkness,
error, vanity, destitution of light and life, prevail. These things, however, do
not render it impossible that the ungodly should be conscious of doing wrong
when they sin, and know that their judge is in heaven, and feel an executioner
within them. In short, as the kingdom of God is a kingdom of light, all who are
alienated from him must necessarily be blind and go astray in a
labyrinth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We are in the meantime reminded, that we are for this
end illuminated as to the knowledge of God, that we may no longer be carried
away by roving lusts. Hence, as much progress any one has made in newness of
life, so much progress has he made in the knowledge of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here a question arises, &#8212; Since he addressed
the Jews, who were acquainted with the law, and were brought up in the worship
of the only true God, why did he charge them with ignorance and blindness, as
though they were heathens? To this I answer, that it hence appears how
profitless is all knowledge without Christ. When Paul exposed the vain boasting
of those who wished to be wise apart from Christ, he justly said in one short
sentence, that they did not hold the head.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:19.) Such were the Jews; being otherwise imbued with numberless corruptions,
they had a veil over the eyes, so that they did not see Christ in the Law. The
doctrine in which they had been taught was indeed a true light; but they were
blind in the midst of light, as long as the Sun of Righteousness was hid to
them. But if Peter declares that the literal disciples even of the Law were in
darkness like the heathens, as long as they were ignorant of Christ, the only
true wisdom of God, with how much greater care it behoves us to strive for the
knowledge of him!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>.
He who hath called you is holy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He
reasons from the end for which we are called. God sets us apart as a peculiar
people for himself; then we ought to be free from all pollutions. And he quotes
a sentence which had been often repeated by Moses. For as the people of Israel
were on every side surrounded by heathens, from whom they might have easily
adopted the worst examples and innumerable corruptions, the Lord frequently
recalled them to himself, as though he had said, &#8220;Ye have to do with me,
ye are mine; then abstain from the pollutions of the Gentiles.&#8221; We are too
ready to look to men, so as to follow their common way of living. Thus it
happens, that some lead others in troops to all kinds of evil, until the Lord by
his calling separates them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In bidding us to be <i>holy </i>like himself, the
proportion is not that of equals; but we ought to advance in this direction as
far as our condition will bear. And as even the most perfect are always very far
from coming up to the mark, we ought daily to strive more and more. And we ought
to remember that we are not only told what our duty is, but that God also adds,
&#8220;I am he who sanctify you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In all manner of
conversation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, in your whole conduct.
There is then no part of our life which is not to be redolent with this good
odour of holiness. For we see that in the smallest things and almost
insignificant, the Lord accustomed his people to the practice of holiness, in
order that they might exercise a more diligent care as to
themselves.</font><br></div>

God the Father, who professed themselves to be his children, as Moses says, that
the name of Jacob was called on Ephraim and Manasseh, that they might be counted
his children.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;014816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
48:16.) According to this meaning also, we say in French <i>reclamer. </i>But he
had a regard to what he had said before, &#8220;as obedient children.&#8221; And
from the character of the Father himself, he shews what sort of obedience ought
to be rendered. He <i>judges, </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>without looking on the
person</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, no outward mask is of
any account with him, as the case is with men, but he sees the heart,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;091607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Samuel 16:7;) and his eyes look on faithfulness.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;240503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
5:3.) This also is what Paul means when he says that God&#8217;s judgment is
according to truth,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450202&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
2:2;) for he there inveighs against hypocrites, who think that they deceive God
by a vain pretense. The meaning is, that we by no means discharge our duty
towards God, when we obey him only in appearance; for he is not a mortal man,
whom the outward appearance pleases, but he reads what we are inwardly in our
hearts. He not only prescribes laws for our feet and hands, but he also requires
what is just and right as to the mind and spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to every man&#8217;s
work</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he does not refer to merit or to
reward; for Peter does not speak here of the merits of works, nor of the cause
of salvation, but he only reminds us, that there will be no looking to the
person before the tribunal of God, but that what will be regarded will be the
real sincerity of the heart. In this place faith also is included in the work.
It hence appears evident how foolish and puerile is the inference that is drawn,
&#8212; &#8220;God is such that he judges every one of us by the integrity of
his conscience, not by the outward appearance; then we obtain salvation by
works.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>that is mentioned, stands opposed
to heedless security, such as is wont to creep in, when there is a hope of
deceiving with impunity. For, as God&#8217;s eyes are such that they penetrate
into the hidden recesses of the heart, we ought to walk with him carefully and
not negligently. He calls the present life a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sojourning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

sojourners, at the beginning of the Epistle, but because all the godly are in
this world pilgrims.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Forasmuch as ye

reason, drawn from the price of our redemption, which ought always to be
remembered when our salvation is spoken of. For to him who repudiates or
despises the grace of the gospel, not only his own salvation is worthless, but
also the blood of Christ, by which God has manifested its value. But we know how
dreadfully sacrilegious it is to regard as common the blood of the Son of God.
There is hence nothing which ought so much to stimulate us to the practice of
holiness, as the memory of this price of our redemption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Silver and
gold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For the sake of amplifying he
mentions these things in contrast, so that we may know that the whole world, and
all things deemed precious by men, are nothing to the excellency and value of
this price.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says that they had been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>redeemed

conversation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb16</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
in order that we might know that the whole life of man, until he is converted to
Christ, is a ruinous labyrinth of wanderings. He also intimates, that it is not
through our merits that we are restored to the right way, but because it is
God&#8217;s will that the price, offered for our salvation, should be effectual
in our behalf. Then the blood of Christ is not only the pledge of our salvation,
but also the cause of our calling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, Peter warns us to beware lest our unbelief
should render this price void or of no effect. As Paul boasts that he worshipped
God with a pure conscience from his forefathers,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;550103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 1:3,)and as he also commends to Timothy for his imitation the piety of
his grandmother Lois, and of his mother Eunice,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;550105&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 1:5,) and as Christ also said of the Jews that they knew whom they
worshipped
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430422&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
4:22,) it may seem strange that Peter should assert that the Jews of his time
learnt nothing from their fathers but mere vanity. To this I answer, that
Christ, when he declared that the way or the knowledge of true religion belonged
to the Jews, referred to the law and the commandments of God rather than to the
people; for the temple had not to no purpose been built at Jerusalem, nor was
God worshipped there according to the fancies of men, but according to what was
prescribed in the Law; he, therefore, said that the Jews were not going astray
while observing the Law. As to Paul&#8217;s forefathers, and as to Lois, Eunice,
and similar cases, there is no doubt but that God ever had at least a small
remnant among that people, in whom sincere piety continued, while the body of
the people had become wholly corrupt, and had plunged themselves into all kinds
of errors. Innumerable superstitions were followed, hypocrisy prevailed, the
hope of salvation was built on the merest trifles; they were not only imbued
with false opinions, but also fascinated with the grossest dotages; and they who
had been scattered to various parts of the world, were implicated in still
greater corruptions. In short, the greater part of that nation had either wholly
fallen away from true religion, or had much degenerated. When, therefore, Peter
condemned the doctrine of the fathers, he viewed it as unconnected with Christ,
who is the soul and the truth of the Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we hence learn, that as soon as men depart from
Christ, they go fatally astray. In vain is pretended in this case the authority
of the Fathers or an ancient custom. For the Prophet Ezekiel cried to the
Jews,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Walk ye not in the
statutes of your
fathers.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;262018&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ezekiel
20:18.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This ought also to be no less attended to by us in
the present day; for, in order that the redemption of Christ may be effectual
and useful to us, we must renounce our former life, though derived from the
teaching and practice of our fathers. Thrice foolish, then, are the Papists, who
think that the name of Fathers is a sufficient defense for all their
superstitions, so that they boldly reject whatever is brought forward from the
Word of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As of a
lamb</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He means by this similitude, that
we have ill Christ whatever had been shadowed forth by the ancient sacrifices,
though he especially alludes to the Paschal lamb. But let us hence learn what
benefit the reading of the Law brings us in this respect; for, though the rite
of sacrificing is abolished, yet it assists our faith not a little, to compare
the reality with the type, so that we may seek in the former what the latter
contains. Moses ordered a whole or perfect lamb, without blemish, to be chosen
for the Passover. The same thing is often repeated as to the sacrifices, as in
Leviticus 23; in Numbers 28; and in other places. Peter, by applying this to
Christ, teaches us that he was a suitable victim, and approved by God, for he
was perfect, without any blemish; had he had any defect in him, he could not
have been rightly offered to God, nor could he pacify his
wrath.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who verily was
foreordained</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He again by a comparison
amplifies the grace of God, with which he had peculiarly favored the men of that
age. For it was not a common or a small favor that God deferred the
manifestation of Christ to that time, when yet he had ordained him in his
eternal council for the salvation of the world. At the same time, however, he
reminds us, that it was not a new or a sudden thing as to God that Christ
appeared as a Savior; and this is what ought especially to be known. For, in
addition to this, that novelty is always suspicious, what would be the stability
of our faith, if we believed that a remedy for mankind had suddenly occurred at
length to God after some thousands of years? In short, we cannot confidently
recumb on Christ, except we are convinced that eternal salvation is in him, and
always has been in him. Besides, Peter addressed the Jews, who had heard that he
had already been long ago promised; and though they understood nothing true or
clear or certain respecting his power and office, yet there remained among them
a persuasion, that a Redeemer had been promised by God to the
fathers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may yet be asked, As Adam did not fall before the
creation of the world, how was it that Christ had been appointed the Redeemer?
for a remedy is posterior to the disease. My reply is, that this is to be
referred to God&#8217;s foreknowledge; for doubtless God, before he created man,
foresaw that he would not stand long in his integrity. Hence he ordained,
according to his wonderful wisdom and goodness, that Christ should be the
Redeemer, to deliver the lost race of man from ruin. For herein shines forth
more fully the unspeakable goodness of God, that he anticipated our disease by
the remedy of his grace, and provided a restoration to life before the first man
had fallen into death. If the reader wishes for more on this subject, he may
find it in my Institutes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But was
manifest</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or manifested. Included in
these words, as I think, is not only the personal appearance of Christ, but also
the proclamation of the Gospel. For, by the coming of Christ, God executed what
he had decreed; and what he had obscurely indicated to the fathers is now
clearly and plainly made known to us by the Gospel. He says that this was done
<i>in these last times, </i>meaning the same as when Paul says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;In the fullness of
time,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians

God in his counsel had appointed.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He does not exclude the fathers, to
whom the promise had not been useless; but as God has favored us more than them,
he intimates that the greater the amplitude of grace towards us, the more
reverence and ardor and care are required of us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who
believe</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The manifestation of Christ
refers not to all indiscriminately, but belongs to those only on whom he by the
Gospel shines. But we must notice the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who by him believe in
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>: </i>here is shortly expressed what
faith is. For, since God is incomprehensible, faith could never reach to him,
except it had an immediate regard to Christ. Nay, there are two reasons why
faith could not be in God, except Christ intervened as a Mediator: first, the
greatness of the divine glory must be taken to the account, and at the same time
the littleness of our capacity. Our acuteness is doubtless very far from being
capable of ascending so high as to comprehend God. Hence all knowledge of God
without Christ is a vast abyss which immediately swallows up all our thoughts. A
clear proof of this we have, not only in the Turks and the Jews, who in the
place of God worship their own dreams, but also in the Papists. Common is that
axiom of the schools, that God is the object of faith. Thus of hidden majesty,
Christ being overlooked, they largely and refinedly speculate; but with what
success? They entangle themselves in astounding dotages, so that there is no end
to their wanderings. For faith, as they think, is nothing else but an
imaginative speculation. Let us, therefore, remember, that Christ is not in vain
called the image of the invisible God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510115&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:15;) but this name is given to him for this reason, because God cannot be
known except in him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The second reason is, that as faith unites us to God,
we shun and dread every access to him, except a Mediator comes who can deliver
us from fear. For sin, which reigns in us, renders us hateful to God and him to
us. Hence, as soon as mention is made of God, we must necessarily be filled with
dread; and if we approach him, his justice is like fire, which will wholly
consume us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is hence evident that we cannot believe in God
except through Christ, in whom God in a manner makes himself little, that he
might accommodate himself to our comprehension; and it is Christ alone who can
tranquillize consciences, so that we may dare to come in confidence to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That raised him up from the
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He adds, that Christ had been
raised up from the dead, in order that their faith and hope, by which they were
supported, might have a firm foundation. And hereby again is confuted the gloss
respecting universal and indiscriminate faith in God; for had there been no
resurrection of Christ, still God would remain in heaven. But Peter says that he
would not have been believed in, except Christ had risen. It is then evident.,
that faith is something else than to behold the naked majesty of God. And
rightly does Peter speak in this manner; for it belongs to faith to penetrate
into heaven, that it may find the Father there: how could it do so, except it
had Christ as a leader?</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;By him,&#8221;
says Paul, &#8220;we have confidence of
access.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Ephesians
3:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is said also, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580416&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
4:16, that relying on our high priest, we can come with confidence to the throne
of grace. Hope is the anchor of the soul, which enter into the inner part of the
sanctuary; but not without Christ going before.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580619&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
6:19.) Faith is our victory against the world,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620504&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 5:4) and what is it that makes it victorious, except that Christ, the Lord
of heaven and earth, has us under his guardianship and protection
?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, our salvation depends on the resurrection
of Christ and his supreme power, faith and hope find here what can support them.
For, except he had by rising again triumphed over death, and held now the
highest sovereignty, to protect us by his power, what would become of us,
exposed to so great a power as that of our enemies, and to such violent attacks?
Let us, therefore, learn to what mark we ought to direct our aim, so that we may
really believe in God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seeing ye have purified your
souls</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, Purifying your souls. Erasmus
badly renders the words, &#8220;Who have purified,&#8221; etc. For Peter does
not declare what they had done, but reminds them of what they ought to do. The
participle is indeed in the past tense, but it may be rendered as a gerund,
&#8220;By purifying, etc.&#8221; The meaning is, that their souls would not be
capable of receiving grace until they were purified, and by this our uncleanness
is proved. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb17</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But that he might not seem to ascribe to us the power of purifying our souls, he
immediately adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;Your souls are to be purified, but as ye cannot do this, offer them to
God, that he may take away your filth by his Spirit.&#8221; He only mentions
souls, though they needed to be cleansed also from the defilements of the flesh,
as Paul bids the Corinthians,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470701&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 7:1;)but as the principal uncleanness is within, and necessarily
draws with it that which is outward, Peter was satisfied with mentioning only
the former, as though he had said, that not outward actions only ought to be
corrected, but the very hearts ought to be thoroughly reformed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He afterwards points out the manner, for purity of
soul consists in obedience to God.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Truth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is to be taken for the rule which God prescribes to us in the Gospel. Nor
does he speak only of works, but rather faith holds here the primacy. Hence Paul
specially teaches us in the first and last chapter of the Epistle to the Romans,
that faith is fiat by which we obey God; and Peter in Acts, the fifteenth
chapter, bestows on it this eulogy, that God by it purifies the
heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unto love of the
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> or, Unto brotherly love. He
briefly reminds us what God especially requires in our life, and the mark to
which all our endeavors should be directed. So Paul in the first chapter of the
Epistle to the Ephesians, when speaking of the perfection of the faithful, makes
it to consist in love. And this is what we ought the more carefully to notice,
because the world makes its own sanctity to consist of the veriest trifles, and
almost overlooks this the chief thing. We see how the Papists weary themselves
beyond measure with thousand invented superstitions: in the meantime, the last
thing is that love which God especially commends. This, then, is the reason why
Peter calls our attention to it, when speaking of a life rightly
formed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He had before spoken of the mortification of the
flesh, and of our conformity with the will of God; but he now reminds us of what
God would have us to cultivate through life, that is, mutual love towards one
another; for by that we testify also that we love God; and by this evidence God
proves who they are who really love him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls it

sincerity. For the love of ourselves rules, which is full of hypocrisy; and
besides, every one measures his love, which he shews to others, by his own
advantage, and not by the rule of doing good. He adds, <i>fervently; </i>for the
more slothful we are by nature, the more ought every one to stimulate himself to
fervor and earnestness, and that not only once, but more and more
daily.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Being born
again</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here is another reason for an
exhortation, &#8212; that since they were new men and born again of God, it
behoved them to form a life worthy of God and of their spiritual regeneration.
And this seems to be connected with a verse in the next chapter respecting the
milk of the word, which they were to seek, that their way of living might
correspond with their birth. It may, however, be extended wider, so as to be
connected also with what has gone before; for Peter collected together those
things which may lead us to an upright and a holy life. The object., then, of
Peter was to teach us that we cannot be Christians without regeneration; for the
Gospel is not preached, that it may be only heard by us, but that it may, as a
seed of immortal life, altogether reform our hearts.  
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">Fb18</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Moreover, the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>corruptible
seed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>is set in opposition to God&#8217;s
word, in order that the faithful might know that they ought to renounce their
former nature, and that it might be more evident how much is the difference
between the children of Adam who are born only into the world, and the children
of God who are renewed into a heavenly life. But as the construction of the
Greek text is doubtful, we may read, &#8220;the living word of God,&#8221; as
well as, &#8220;the word of the living God.&#8221; As, however, the latter
reading is less forced, I prefer it; though it must be observed, that the term
is applied to God owing to the character of the passage. For, as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580412&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
4:12, because God sees all things, and nothing is hid from him, the apostle
argues that the word of God penetrates into the inmost marrow, so as to discern
thoughts and feelings; so, when Peter in this place calls him the living God,
who abides for ever, he refers to the word, in which the perpetuity of God
shines forth as in a living mirror.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For all
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He aptly quotes the passage from
Isaiah to prove both clauses; that is, to make it evident how fading and
miserable is the first birth of man, and how great is the grace of the new
birth. For as the Prophet there speaks of the restoration of the Church, to
prepare the way for it, he reduces men to nothing lest they should flatter
themselves. I know that the words are wrongly turned by some to another sense;
for some explain them of the Assyrians, as though the Prophet said, that there
was no reason for the Jews to fear so much from flesh, which is like a fading
flower. Others think that the vain confidence which the Jews reposed in human
aids, is reproved. But the Prophet himself disproves both these views, by
adding, that the people were as grass; for he expressly condemns the Jews for
vanity, to whom he promised restoration in the name of the Lord. This, then, is
what I have already said, that until their own emptiness has been shewn to men,
they are not prepared to receive the grace of God. In short, such is the meaning
of the Prophet: as exile was to the Jews like death, he promised them a new
consolation, even that God would send prophets with a command of this kind. The
Lord, he says, will yet say, &#8220;Comfort ye my people;&#8221; and that in the
desert and the waste, the prophetic voice would yet be heard, in order that a
way might be prepared for the Lord.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;234006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
40:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And as the obstinate pride which filled them, must
have been necessarily purged from their minds, in order that an access might be
open for God, the Prophet added what Peter relates here respecting the vanishing
glory of the flesh. What is man? he says &#8212; grass; what is the glory of
man? the flower of the grass. For as it was difficult to believe that man, in
whom so much excellency appears, is like grass, the Prophet made a kind of
concession, as though he had said, &#8220;Be it, indeed, that flesh has some
glory; but lest that should dazzle your eyes, know that the flower soon
withers.&#8221; He afterwards shews how suddenly everything that seems beautiful
in men vanishes, even through the blowing of the Spirit of God; and by this he
intimates, that man seems to be something until he comes to God, but that his
whole brightness is as nothing in his presence; that, in a word, his glory is in
this world, and has no place in the heavenly kingdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The grass
withereth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, has withered. Many think
that this refers only to the outward man; but they are mistaken; for we must
consider the comparison between God&#8217;s word and man. For if he meant only
the body and what belongs to the present life, he ought to have said, in the
second place, that the soul was far more excellent. But what he sets in
opposition to the grass and its flower, is the word of God. It then follows,
that in man nothing but vanity is found. Therefore, when Isaiah spoke of flesh
and its glory, he meant the whole man, such as he is in himself; for what he
ascribed as peculiar to God&#8217;s word, he denied to man. In short, the
Prophet speaks of the same thing as Christ does in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
3:3, that man is wholly alienated from the kingdom of God, that he is nothing
but an earthly, fading, and empty creature, until he is born
again.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the word of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet does not shew what the
word of God is in itself, but what we ought to think of it; for since man is
vanity in himself, it remains that he ought to seek life elsewhere. Hence Peter
ascribes power and efficacy to God&#8217;s word, according to the authority of
the Prophet, so that it can confer on us what is real, solid, and eternal. For
this was what the Prophet had in view, that there is no permanent life but in
God, and that this is communicated to us by the word. However fading, then, is
the nature of man, yet he is made eternal by the word; for he is re-moulded and
becomes a new creature.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the word which by the
gospel is preached unto you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, which
has been declared to you. He first reminds us, that when the word of God is
mentioned, we are very foolish if we imagine it to be remote from us in the air
or in heaven; for we ought to know that it has been revealed to us by the Lord.
What, then, is this word of the Lord, which gives us life? Even the Law, the
Prophets, the Gospel. Those who wander beyond these limits of revelation, find
nothing but the impostures of Satan and his dotages, and not the word of the
Lord. We ought the more carefully to notice this, because impious and Luciferian
men, craftily allowing to God&#8217;s word its own honor, at the same time
attempt to draw us away from the Scriptures, as that unprincipled man, Agrippa,
who highly extols the eternity of God&#8217;s word, and yet treats with
scurrility the Prophets, and thus indirectly laughs to scorn the Word of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, as I have already reminded you, no mention
is here made of the word which lies hid in the bosom of God, but of that which
has proceeded from his mouth, and has come to us. So again it ought to be borne
in mind, that God designed by the Apostles and Prophets to speak to us, and
their mouths is the mouth of the only true God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then, when Peter says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which has been
announced</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or declared, <i>to you,
</i>he intinates that the word is not to be sought elsewhere than in the Gospel
preached to us; and truly we know not the way of eternal life otherwise than by
faith. But there can be no faith, except we know that the word is destined for
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is what Moses said to the
people,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Say not in thine
heart, Who shall ascend into heaven, etc.; nigh is the word, in thy mouth and in
thy
heart.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;053012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
30:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That these words agree with what Peter says, Paul
shews
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451006&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:6, where he teaches us that it was the word of faith which he
preached.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is here, besides, no common eulogy on
preaching; for Peter declares that what is preached is the life-giving word. God
alone is indeed he who regenerates us; but for that purpose he employs the
ministry of men; and on this account Paul glories that the Corinthians had been
spiritually begotten by him.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:15.) It is indeed certain that those who plant and those who
water, are nothing; but whenever God is pleased to bless their labor, he makes
their doctrine efficacious by the power of his Spirit; and the voice which is in
itself mortal, is made an instrument to communicate eternal
life.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">After having taught the faithful that they had been
regenerated by the word of God, he now exhorts them to lead a life corresponding
with their birth. For if we live in the Spirit, we ought also to walk in the
Spirit, as Paul says.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480525&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
5:25.) It is not, then, sufficient for us to have been once called by the Lord,
except we live as new creatures. This is the meaning. But as to the words, the
Apostle continues the same metaphor. For as we have been born again, he requires
from us a life like that of infants; by which he intimates that we are to put
off the old man and his works. Hence this verse agrees with what Christ
says,</font><br></div>

leads to corruption; and under the word <i>milk, </i>lie includes all the
feelings of spiritual life. For there is also in part a contrast between the
vices which he enumerates and the sincere milk of the word; as though he had
said, &#8220;Malice and hypocrisy belong to those who are habituated to the
corruptions of the world; they have imbibed these vices: what pertains to
infancy is sincere simplicity, free from all guile. Men, when grown up, become
imbued with envy, they learn to slander one another, they are taught the arts of
mischief; in short, they become hardened in every kind of evil: infants, owing
to their age, do not yet know what it is to envy, to do mischief, or the like
things.&#8221; He then compares the vices, in which the oldness of the flesh
indulges, to strong food; and milk is called that way of living suitable to
innocent nature and simple infancy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>

which mark his whole character.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">and yet he does not enumerate them all; but in those
few things, as in a mirror, we may see that immense mass of filth which proceeds
from our flesh. So also in other passages, where he refers to the new life, he
touches only on a few things, by which we may understand the whole
character.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, then, he says amounts to this, &#8212;
&#8220;Having laid aside the works of your former life, such as malice, deceit,
dissimulations, envyings, and other things of this kind, devote yourselves to
things of an opposite character, cultivate kindness, honesty,&#8221; etc. He, in
short, urges this, that new morals ought to follow a new life.</font><br></div>

according to the rendering of Erasmus, &#8220;Milk not for the body but for the

metaphorically. I rather think that this passage agrees with that saying of
Paul,</font><br></div>

<i>rational and guileless,
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">logiko&lt;n kai&lt;

understanding are two things apparently opposite; but they ought to be mixed

should creep in for want of understanding. This mingling, well regulated, is

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580512&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
5:12. But in these passages those are compared to children who remain always
novices and ignorant scholars in the doctrine of religion, who continued in the
first elements, and never penetrated into the higher knowledge of God. <i>Milk
</i>is called the simpler mode of teaching, and one suitable to children, when
there is no progress made beyond the first rudiments. Justly, then, does Paul
charge this as a fault, as well as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. But
milk, here, is not elementary doctrine, which one perpetually learns; and never
comes to the knowledge of the truth, but a mode of living which has the savor of
the new birth, when we surrender ourselves to be brought up by God. In the same
manner infancy is not set in opposition to manhood, or full age in Christ, as
Paul calls it in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490413&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians

infancy of the new life is perpetual, so Peter recommends milk as a perpetual
aliment, for he would have those nourished by it to grow.</font><br></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Taste and see that
the Lord is good.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says that this taste is to be had in Christ,
as, doubtless, our souls can find no rest anywhere but in him. But he has drawn
the ground of his exhortation from the goodness of God, because his kindness,
which we perceive in Christ, ought to allure us; for what
follows,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To whom
coming</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>is not to be referred simply to
God, but to him as he is revealed to us in the person of Christ. Now, it cannot
be but that the grace of God must powerfully draw us to himself and inflame us
with the love of him by whom we obtain a real perception of it. If Plato
affirmed this of his Beautiful, of which a shadowy idea only he beheld afar off,
much more true is this with regard to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let it then be noticed, that Peter connects an access
to God with the taste of his goodness. For as the human mind necessarily dreads
and shuns God, as long as it regards him as rigid and severe; so, as soon as he
makes known his paternal love to the faithful, it immediately follows that they
disregard all things and even forget themselves and hasten to him. In short, he
only makes progress in the Gospel, who in heart comes to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he also shews for what end and to what purpose we
ought to come to Christ, even that we may have him as our foundation. For since
he is constituted a stone, he ought to be so to us, so that nothing should be
appointed for him by the Father in vain or to no purpose. But he obviates an
offense when he allows that Christ is rejected by men; for, as a great part of
the world reject him, and even many abhor him, he might for this reason be
despised by us; for we see that some of the ignorant are alienated from the
Gospel, because it is not everywhere popular, nor does it conciliate favor to
its professors. But Peter forbids us to esteem Christ the less, however despised
he may be by the world, because he, notwithstanding, retains his own worth and
honor before God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b><i>

stones, are built up</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The verb may be in
the imperative as well as in the indicative mood, for the termination in Greek
is ambiguous. But in whatever way it is taken, Peter no doubt meant to exhort
the faithful to consecrate themselves as a spiritual temple to God; for he aptly
infers from the design of our calling what our duty is. We must further observe,
that he constructs one house from the whole number of the faithful. For though
every one of us is said to be the temple of God, yet all are united together in
one, and must be joined together by mutual love, so that one temple may be made
of us all. Then, as it is true that each one is a temple in which God dwells by
his Spirit, so all ought to be so fitted together, that they may form one
universal temple. This is the case when every one, content with his own measure,
keeps himself within the limits of his own duty; all have, however, something to
do with regard to others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By calling us

</i>building, as he had before said that Christ is a living stone, he intimates
a comparison between us and the ancient temple; and this serves to amplify
divine grace. For the same purpose is what he adds as to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spiritual
sacrifices</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For by how much the more
excellent is the reality than the types, by so much the more all things excel in
the kingdom of Christ; for we have that heavenly exemplar, to which the ancient
sanctuary was conformable, and everything instituted by Moses under the
Law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A holy
priesthood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is a singular honor, that
God should not only consecrate us as a temple to himself, in which he dwells and
is worshipped, but that he should also make us priests. But Peter mentions this
double honor, in order to stimulate us more effectually to serve and worship
God. Of the spiritual sacrifices, the first is the offering of ourselves, of
which Paul speaks in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:1; for we can offer nothing, until we offer to him ourselves as a sacrifice;
which is done by denying ourselves. Then, afterwards follow prayers,
thanksgiving, almsdeeds, and all the duties of religion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Acceptable to
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It ought also to add not a little
to our alacrity, when we know that the worship we perform to God is pleasing o
him, as doubt necessarily brings sloth with it. Here, then, is the third thing
that enforces the exhortation; for he declares that what is required is
acceptable to God, lest. fear should make us slothful. Idolaters are indeed
under the influence of great fervor in their fictitious forms of worship; but it
is so, because Satan inebriates their minds, lest they should come to consider
their works; but whenever their consciences are led to examine things, they
begin to stagger. It is, indeed, certain that no one will seriously and from the
heart devote himself to God, until he is fully persuaded that he shall not labor
in vain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Apostle adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>There is never found in our
sacrifices such purity, that they are of themselves acceptable to God; our
self-denial is never entire and complete, our prayers are never so sincere as
they ought to be, we are never so zealous and so diligent in doing good, but
that our works are imperfect, and mingled with many vices. Nevertheless, Christ
procures favor for them. Then Peter here obviates that want of faith which we
may have respecting the acceptableness of our works, when he says, that they are
accepted, not for the merit of their own excellency, but through Christ. And it
ought to kindle the more the ardor of our efforts, when we hear that God deals
so indulgently with us, that in Christ he sets a value on our works, which in
themselves deserve nothing. At the same time, the words, <i>by </i>or through
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

<div><font face="Palatino">The sense, however, will remain the same; for we
offer sacrifices through Christ, that they may be acceptable to
God.</font><br></div>

another exposition, that Christ excels others; for Peter simply intended to
quote the testimony of Scripture. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb21</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He then shews what had been taught by the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures, or,
which is the same thing, that what he adds is contained in them. Nor is it an
unsuitable confirmation of the preceding verse. For we see for what slight
reasons, and almost for none, many reject Christ, and some fall away from him;
but this is a stumblingblock which above all other things stands in the way of
some; they are drawn away, because not only the common people despise and reject
Christ, but also those who are high in dignity and honor, and seem to excel
others. This evil has almost ever prevailed in the world, and at this day it
prevails much; for a great part of mankind judge of Christ according to the
false opinion of the world. Moreover, such is the ingratitude and impiety of
men, that Christ is everywhere despised. Thus it is, that while they regard one
another, few pay him his due honor. Hence Peter reminds us of what had been
foretold of Christ, lest the contempt or the rejection of him should move us
from the faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, the first passage, which he adduces, is taken
from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
28:16; where the Prophet, after having inveighed against the desperate
wickedness of his own nation, at length adds,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Your perfidy shall
not prevent God from restoring his church, which now through you lies wholly in
a ruinous
state.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;232816&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
28:16)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The manner of restoration he thus describes, &#8220;I
will lay in Sion a stone.&#8221; We hence learn that there is no building up of
the Church without Christ; for there is no other foundation but he, as Paul
testifies,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 3:11.) This is no matter of wonder, for all our salvation is found
only in him. Whosoever, then, turns away from him in the least degree, will find
his foundation a precipice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Therefore the Prophet not only calls him a
corner-stone, which connects the whole edifice, but also a stone of trial,
according to which the building is to be measured and regulated; and farther, he
calls him a solid foundation, which sustains the whole edifice. He is thus,
then, a corner-stone, that he might be the rule of the building, as well as the
only foundation. But Peter took from the words of the Prophet what was
especially suitable to his argument, even that he was a chosen stone, and in the
highest degree valuable and excellent, and also that on him we ought to build.
This honor is ascribed to Christ, that how much soever he may be despised by he
world, he may not be despised by us; for by God he is regarded as very precious.
But when he calls him a corner-stone, he intimates that those have no concern
for their salvation who do not recumb on Christ. What some have refined on the
word &#8220;corner,&#8221; as though it meant that Christ joins together Jews
and Gentiles, as two distinct walls, is not well founded. Let us, then, be
content with a simple explanation, that he is so called, because the weight of
the building rests on him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must further observe, that the Prophet introduces
God as the speaker, for he alone forms and plans his own Church, as it is said
in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;197869&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
78:69, that his hand had founded Sion. He, indeed, employs the labor and
ministry of men in building it; but this is not inconsistent with the truth that
it is his own work. Christ, then, is the foundation of our salvation, because he
has been ordained for this end by the Father.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
Sion</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because there God&#8217;s
spiritual temple was to have its beginning. That our faith, therefore, may
firmly rest on Christ, we must come to the Law and to the Prophets. For though
this stone extends to the extreme parts of the world, it was yet necessary for
it to be located first in Sion, for there at that time was the seat of the
Church. But it is said to have been then set, when the Father revealed him for
the purpose of restoring his Church. In short, we must hold this, that those
only rest on Christ, who keep the unity of the Church, for he is not set as a
foundation-stone except in Sion. As from Sion the Church went forth, which is
now everywhere spread, so also from Sion our faith has derived its beginning, as
Isaiah says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;From Sion shall go
forth the law,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and the word of the
Lord from Jerusalem.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
2:3.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Corresponding with this is what is said in the
Psalms,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The scepter of thy
power will the Lord send forth from Sion.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Psalm
110:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that
believeth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The Prophet does not say
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
him</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>but declares generally, &#8220;He
that believeth shall not make haste.&#8221; As, however, there is no doubt but
that God sets forth Christ there as the object of our faith, the faith of which
the Prophet speaks must look on him alone. And, doubtless, no one can rightly
believe, but he who is fully convinced that in Christ he ought wholly to
trust.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the words of the Prophet may be taken in two
ways, either as a promise or as an exhortation. The future time is referred to,
&#8220;He shall not make haste;&#8221; but in Hebrew the future is often to be
taken for an imperative, &#8220;Let him not make haste.&#8221; Thus the meaning
would be, &#8220;Be ye not moved in your minds, but quietly entertain your
desires, and check your feelings, until the Lord will be pleased to fulfill his
promise.&#8221; So he says in another place,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;In silence and in
quietness shall be your
strength,&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;233015&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
30:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as the other reading seems to come nearer to
Peter&#8217;s interpretation, I give it the preference. Then the sense would not
be unsuitable, &#8220;He who believeth shall not waver&#8221; or vacillate; for
he has a firm and permanent foundation. And it is a valuable truth, that relying
on Christ, we are beyond the danger of falling. Moreover, to be ashamed
(<i>pudefieri</i>)<i> </i>means the same thing. Peter has retained the real
sense of the Prophet, though he has followed the Greek version. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb22</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Unto you therefore which
believe</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>God having pronounced Christ to
be a precious and a chosen stone, Peter draws the inference that he is so to us.
For, no doubt, Christ is there described such as we apprehend him by faith, and
such as he proves himself to be by real evidences. We ought, then, carefully to
notice this inference: Christ is a precious stone in the sight of God; then he
is such to the faithful. It is faith alone which reveals to us the value and
excellency of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as the design of the Apostle was to obviate the
offense which the multitude of the ungodly creates, he immediately adds another
clause respecting the unbelieving, that by rejecting Christ, they do not take
away the honor granted him by the Father. For this purpose a verse in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19B822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
118:22, is quoted, that the stone which the builders rejected, is become,
nevertheless, the head of the corner. It hence follows, that Christ, though
opposed by his enemies, yet continues in that dignity to which he has been
appointed by the Father. But we must take notice of the two things here said,
&#8212; the first is, that Christ was rejected by those who bore rule in the
Church of God; and the other, that their efforts were all in vain, because
necessarily fulfilled must have been what God had decreed, that is, that he, as
the corner-stone, should sustain the edifice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, that this passage ought properly to be
understood of Christ, not only the Holy Spirit is a witness, and Christ himself,
who has thus explained it,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402142&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
21:42;) but it appears also evident from this, that it was thus commonly
understood before Christ came into the world; nor is there a doubt but this
exposition had been delivered as it were from hand to hand from the fathers. We
hence see that this was, as it were, a common saying even among children
respecting the Messiah. I shall, therefore, no longer discuss this point. We may
take it as granted, that David was thus rejected by his own age, that he might
typify Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us now, then, return to the first clause: Christ
was rejected by the builders. This was first shadowed forth in David; for they
who were in power counted him as condemned and lost. The same was fulfilled in
Christ; for they who ruled in the Church, rejected him as far as they could. It
might have greatly disturbed the weak, when they saw that Christ&#8217;s enemies
were so many, even the priests, the elders, and teachers, in whom alone the
Church was conspicuously seen. In order to remove this offense, Peter reminded
the faithful that this very thing had been predicted by David. He especially
addressed the Jews, to whom this properly applied; at the same time, this
admonition is very useful at this day. For they who arrogate to themselves the
first place of authority in the Church, are Christ&#8217;s most inveterate
enemies, and with diabolical fury persecute his Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Pope calls himself the vicar of Christ, and yet
we know how fiercely he opposes him. This spectacle frightens the simple and
ignorant. Why is this? even because they consider not that what David has
predicted happens now. Let us, then, remember that not those only were by this
prophecy warned who saw Christ rejected by the Scribes and Pharisees; but that
we are also by it fortified against daily offenses, which might otherwise upset
our faith. Whenever then, we see those who glory in the title of prelates,
rising up against Christ, let it come to our minds, that the stone is rejected
by the builders, according to the prediction of David. And as the metaphor of
building is common, when political or spiritual government is spoken of, so
David calls them builders, to whom is committed the care and power of governing;
not because they build rightly, but because they have the name of builders, and
possess the ordinary power. It hence follows, that those in office are not
always God&#8217;s true and faithful ministers. It is, therefore, extremely
ridiculous in the Pope and his followers to arrogate to themselves supreme and
indubitable authority on this sole pretense, that they are the ordinary
governors of the Church. In the first place, their vocation to govern the Church
is in no way more just or more legitimate than that of Heliogabalus to govern
the empire. But though we should allow them what they unblushingly claim, that
they are rightly called, yet we see what David declares respecting the ordinary
rulers of the Church, that they rejected Christ, so that they built a stye for
swine rather than a temple for God. The other part follows, that all the great,
proud of their power and dignity, shall not prevail, so that Christ should not
continue in his own place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And a stone of
stumbling</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>After having comforted the
faithful, that they would have in Christ a firm and permanent foundation, though
the greater part, and even the chief men, allowed him no place in the building,
he now denounces the punishment which awaits all the unbelieving, in order that
they might be terrified by their example. For this purpose he quotes the
testimony of
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;230814&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
8:14. The Prophet there declares that the Lord would be to the Jews a stone of
stumbling and rock of offense. This properly refers to Christ, as it may be seen
from the context; and Paul applies it to Christ,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450932&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:32.) For in him the God of hosts has plainly manifested
himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, then, the terrible vengeance of God is
denounced on all the ungodly, because Christ would be to them an offense and a
stumbling, inasmuch as they refused to make him their foundation. For as the
firmness and stability of Christ is such that it can sustain all who by faith
recumb on him; so his hardness is so great that it will break and tear in pieces
all who resist him. For there is no medium between these two things, &#8212; we
must either build on him, or be dashed against him. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb23</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which stumble at the
word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He points out here the manner in
which Christ becomes a stumbling, even when men perversely oppose the word of
God. This the Jews did; for though they professed themselves willing to receive
the Messiah, yet they furiously rejected him when presented to them by God. The
Papists do the same in the present day; they worship only the name of Christ,
while they cannot endure the doctrine of the Gospel. Here Peter intimates that
all who receive not Christ as revealed in the Gospel, are adversaries to God,
and resist his word, and also that Christ is to none for destruction, but to
those who, through headstrong wickedness and obstinacy, rush against the word of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is especially what deserves to be noticed,
lest our fault should be imputed to Christ; for, as he has been given to us as a
foundation, it is as it were an accidental thing that he becomes a rock of
offense. In short, his proper office is to prepare us for a spiritual temple to
God; but it is the fault of men that they stumble at him, even because unbelief
leads men to contend with God. Hence Peter, in order to set forth the character
of the conflict, said that they were the unbelieving.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whereunto also they were
appointed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, to which they had been
ordained. This passage may be explained in two ways. It is, indeed, certain that
Peter spoke of the Jews; and the common interpretation is, that they were
appointed to believe, for the promise of salvation was destined for them. But
the other sense is equally suitable, that they had been appointed to unbelief;
as Pharaoh is said to have been set up for this end, that he might resist God,
and all the reprobate are destined for the same purpose. And what inclines me to
this meaning is the particle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kai&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">
(also) which is put in. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb24</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
If, however, the first view be preferred, then it is a vehement upbraiding; for
Peter does hence enhance the sin of unbelief in the people who had been chosen
by God, because they rejected the salvation that had been peculiarly ordained
for them. And no doubt this circumstance rendered them doubly inexcusable, that
having been called in preference to others, they had refused to hear God. But,
by saying that they were appointed to believe, he refers only to their outward
call, even according to the covenant which God had made generally with the whole
nation. At the same time their ingratitude, as it has been said, was
sufficiently proved, when they rejected the word preached to
them.</font><br></div>

them from the unbelieving, lest driven by their example (as it is often the
case) they should fall away from the faith. As, then, it is unreasonable that
those whom God has separated from the world, should mix themselves with the
ungodly, Peter here reminds the faithful to what great honor they had been
raised, and also to what purpose they had been called. But with the same high
titles which he confers on them, Moses honored the ancient people,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;021906&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
19:6;) but the Apostle&#8217;s object was to shew that they had recovered again,
through Christ, the great dignity and honor from which they had fallen. It is at
the same time true, that God gave to the fathers an earthly taste only of these
blessings, and that they are really given in Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning then is, as though he had
said,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Moses called formerly your

<div><font face="Palatino">In the meantime, however, as the greater part of the
nation was unbelieving, the Apostle indirectly sets the believing Jews in
opposition to all the rest, though they exceeded them in number, as though he
had said, that those only were the children of Abraham, who believed in Christ,
and that they only retained possession of all the blessings which God had by a
singular privilege bestowed on the whole nation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls them

that they might be to him a peculiar possession or inheritance; for I take the

19:5.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is in the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>royal
priesthood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> a </i>striking inversion of the
words of Moses; for he says, &#8220;a priestly kingdom,&#8221; but the same
thing is meant. So what Peter intimated was this, &#8220;Moses called your
fathers a sacred kingdom, because the whole people enjoyed as it were a royal
liberty, and from their body were chosen the priests; both dignities were
therefore joined together: but now ye are royal priests, and, indeed, in a more
excellent way, because ye are, each of you, consecrated in Christ, that ye may
be the associates of his kingdom, and partakers of his priesthood. Though, then,
the fathers had something like to what you, have, yet ye far excel them. For
after the wall of partition has been pulled down by Christ, we are now gathered
from every nation, and the Lord bestows these high titles on all whom he makes
his people.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is further, as to these benefits, a contrast
between us and the rest of mankind, to be considered: and hence it appears more
fully how incomparable is God&#8217;s goodness towards us; for he sanctifies us,
who are by nature polluted; he chose us, when he could find nothing in us but
filth and vileness; he makes his peculiar possession from worthless dregs; he
confers the honor of the priesthood on the profane; he brings the vassals of
Satan, of sin, and of death, to the enjoyment of royal liberty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye should shew
forth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or declare. He carefully points
out the end of our calling, that he might stimulate us to give the glory to God.
And the sum of what he says is, that God has favored us with these immense
benefits and constantly manifests them, that his glory might by us be made
known: for by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>praises</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or virtues, he understands wisdom, goodness, power, righteousness, and
everything else, in which the glory of God shines forth. And further, it behoves
us to declare these virtues or excellencies not only by our tongue, but also by
our whole life. This doctrine ought to be a subject of daily meditation, and it
ought to be continually remembered by us, that all God&#8217;s blessings with
which he favors us are intended for this end, that his glory may be proclaimed
by us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also notice what he says, that we have been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>out of darkness into God&#8217;s marvellous or wonderful light; for by these
words he amplifies the greatness of divine grace. If the Lord had given us light
while we were seeking it, it would have been a favor; but it was a much greater
favor, to draw us out of the labyrinth of ignorance and the abyss of darkness.
We ought hence to learn what is man&#8217;s condition, before he is translated
into the kingdom of God. And this is what Isaiah says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Darkness shall cover the earth,
and gross darkness the people; but over thee shall the Lord be seen, and his
glory shall in thee shine forth.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;236002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
60:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And truly we cannot be otherwise than sunk in
darkness, after having departed from God, our only light. See more at large on
this subject in the second chapter of the Epistle to the
Ephesians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which in time past were not a
people</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He brings for confirmation a
passage from Hosea, and well accommodates it to his own purpose. For Hosea,
after having in God&#8217;s name declared that the Jews were repudiated, gives
them a hope of a future restoration. Peter reminds us that this was fulfilled in
his own age; for the Jews were scattered here and there, as the torn members of
a body; nay, they seemed to be no longer God&#8217;s people, no worship remained
among them, they were become entangled in the corruptions of the heathens; it
could not then be said otherwise of them, but that they were repudiated by the
Lord. But when they are gathered in Christ, from no people they really become
the people of God. Paul, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450926&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
9:26, applies also this prophecy to the Gentiles, and not without reason; for
from the time the Lord&#8217;s covenant was broken, from which alone the Jews
derived their superiority, they were put on a level with the Gentiles. It hence
follows, that what God had promised, to make a people of no people, belongs in
common to both.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which had not obtained
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This was added by the Prophet, in
order that the gratuitous covenant of God, by which he takes them to be his
people, might be more clearly set forth; as though he had said, &#8220;There is
no other reason why the Lord counts us his people, except that he, having mercy
on us, graciously adopts us.&#8221; It is then God&#8217;s gratuitous goodness,
which makes of no people a people to God, and reconciles the alienated.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As
strangers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or sojourners. There are two
parts to this exhortation, &#8212; that their souls were to be free within from
wicked and vicious lusts; and also, that they were to live honestly among men,
and by the example of a good life not only to confirm the godly, but also to
gain over the unbelieving to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And first, to call them away from the indulgence of
carnal lusts, he employs this argument, that they were sojourners and strangers.
And he so calls them, not because they were banished from their country, and
scattered into various lands, but because the children of God, wherever they may
be, are only guests in this world. In the former sense, indeed, he called them
sojourners at the beginning of the Epistle, as it appears from the context; but
what he says here is common to them all. For the lusts of the flesh hold us
entangled, when in our minds we dwell in the world, and think not that heaven is
our country; but when we pass as strangers through this life, we are not in
bondage to the flesh.</font><br></div>

concupiscences which we have in common with animals, as the Sophists hold, but
also all those sinful passions and affections of the soul, to which we are by
nature guided and led. For it is certain that every thought of the flesh, that
is, of unrenewed nature, is enmity against God.

<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which war against the
soul</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here is another argument, that
they could not comply with the desires of the flesh, except to their own ruin.
For he refers not here to the contest described by Paul in the seventh chapter
of Romans, and in the fifth of the Galatians, as he makes the soul to be an
antagonist to the flesh: but what he says here is, that the desires of the
flesh, whenever the soul consents to them, lead to perdition. He proves our
carelessness in this respect, that while we anxiously shun enemies from whom we
apprehend danger to the body, we willingly allow enemies hurtful to the soul to
destroy us; nay, we as it were stretch forth our neck to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your
conversation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The second part of the
exhortation is, that they were to conduct themselves honestly towards men. What,
indeed, precedes this in order is, that their minds should be cleansed before
God; but a regard should also be had to men, lest we should become a hindrance
to them. And he expressly says <i>among the Gentiles; </i>for the Jews were not
only hated everywhere, but were also almost abhorred. The more carefully,
therefore, ought they to have labored to wipe off the odium and infamy attached
to their name by a holy life and a well-regulated conduct. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb26</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For that admonition of Paul ought to be attended to, &#8220;To give no occasion
to those who seek occasion.&#8221; Therefore the evil speakings and the wicked
insinuations of the ungodly ought to stimulate us to lead an upright life; for
it is no time for living listlessly and securely, when they sharply watch us in
order to find out whatever we do amiss.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they &#8212; may glorify
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He intimates that we ought thus to
strive, not for our own sake, that men may think and speak well of us; but that
we may glorify God, as Christ also teaches us. And Peter shews how this would be
effected, even that the unbelieving, led by our good works, would become
obedient to God, and thus by their own conversion give glory to him; for this he
intimates by the words, <i>in the day of visitation. </i>I know that some refer
this to the last coming of Christ; but I take it otherwise, even that God
employs the holy and honest life of his people, as a preparation, to bring back
the wandering to the right way. For it is the beginning of our conversion, when
God is pleased to look on us with a paternal eye; but when his face is turned
away from us, we perish. Hence the day of visitation may justly be said to be
the time when he invites us to himself.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Submit
yourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He now comes to particular
exhortations: and as obedience with regard to magistrates is a part of honest or
good conversation, he draws this inference as to their duty, &#8220;Submit
yourselves,&#8221; or, Be ye subject; for by refusing the yoke of government,
they would have given to the Gentiles no small occasion for reproaching them.
And, indeed, the Jews were especially hated and counted infamous for this
reason, because they were regarded on account of their perverseness as
ungovernable. And as the commotions which they raised up in the provinces, were
causes of great calamities, so that every one of a quiet and peaceable
disposition dreaded them as the plague, &#8212; this was the reason that induced
Peter to speak so strongly on subjection. Besides, many thought the gospel was a
proclamation of such liberty, that every one might deem himself as free from
servitude. It seemed an unworthy thing that God&#8217;s children should be
servants, and that the heirs of the world should not have a free possession, no,
not even of their own bodies. Then there was another trial, &#8212; All the
magistrates were Christ&#8217;s adversaries; and they used their own authority,
so that no representation of God, which secures the chief reverence, appeared in
them. We now perceive the design of Peter: he exhorted the Jews, especially for
these reasons, to shew respect to the civil power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To every ordinance of
man</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Some render the words, &#8220;to
every creature;&#8221; and from a rendering so obscure and ambiguous, much labor
has been taken to elicit some meaning. But I have no doubt but that Peter meant
to point out the distinct manner in which God governs mankind: for the verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kti&gt;zein</font><font face="Palatino">
in Greek, from which
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kti&gt;siv</font><font face="Palatino">
comes, means to form and to construct a building. Suitable, then, is the word
&#8220;ordination;&#8221; by which Peter reminds us, that God the maker of the
world has not left the human race in a state of confusion, that they might live
after the manner of beasts, but as it were in a building regularly formed, and
divided into several compartments. And it is called a <i>human ordination,
</i>not because it has been invented by man, but because a mode of living, well
arranged and duly ordered, is peculiar to men. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb27</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whether it be to the
king</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>So he calls Caesar, as I think,
whose empire extended over all those countries mentioned at the beginning of the
Epistle. For though &#8220;king&#8221; was a name extremely hated by the Romans,
yet it was in use among the Greeks. They, indeed, often called him autocrat,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">aujtokra&gt;tora</font><font face="Palatino">
) but sometimes he was also called by them king,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">basileu&lt;v</font><font face="Palatino">.)
But as he subjoins a reason, that he ought to be obeyed because he excelled, or
was eminent or supreme, there is no comparison made between Caesar and other
magistrates. He held, indeed, the supreme power; but that eminence which Peter
extols, is common to all who exercise public authority. And so Paul, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451301&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:1, extends it to all magistrates. Now the meaning is, that obedience is due
to all who rule, because they have been raised to that honor not by chance, but
by God&#8217;s providence. For many are wont to inquire too scrupulously by what
right power has been attained; but we ought to be satisfied with this alone,
that power is possessed and exercised. And so Paul cuts off the handle of
useless objections when he declares that there is no power but from God. And for
this reason it is that Scripture so often says, that it is God who girds kings
with a sword, who raises them on high, who transfers kingdoms as he
pleases.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As Peter referred especially to the Roman Emperor, it
was necessary to add this admonition; for it is certain that the Romans through
unjust means rather than in a legitimate way penetrated into Asia and subdued
these countries. Besides, the Caesars, who then reigned, had possessed
themselves of the monarchy by tyrannical force. Hence Peter as it were forbids
these things to be controverted, for he shews that subjects ought to obey their
rulers without hesitation, because they are not made eminent, unless elevated by
God&#8217;s hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Or unto
governors</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, Whether to presidents. He
designates every kind of magistrates, as though he had said, that there is no
kind of government to which we ought not to submit. He confirms this by saying
that they are God&#8217;s ministers; for they who apply <i>him</i> to the king,
are greatly mistaken. There is then a common reason, which extols the authority
of all magistrates, that they rule by the command of God, and are sent by him.
It hence follows (as Paul also teaches us) that they resist God, who do not
obediently submit to a power ordained by him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the
punishment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is the second reason
why it behoves us reverently to regard and to respect civil authority, and that
is, because it has been appointed by the Lord for the common good of mankind;
for we must be extremely barbarous and brutal, if the public good is not
regarded by us. This, then, in short, is what Peter means, that since God keeps
the world in order by the ministry of magistrates, all they who despise their
authority are enemies to mankind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now he assumes these two things, which belong, as
Plato says, to a commonwealth, that is, reward to the good and punishment to the
wicked; for, in ancient times, not only punishment was allotted to evil-doers,
but also rewards to the doers of good. But though it often happens that honors
are not rightly distributed, nor rewards given to the deserving, yet it is an
honor, not to be despised, that the good are at the least under the care and
protection of magistrates, that they are not exposed to the violence and
injuries of the ungodly, that they live more quietly under laws and better
retain their reputation, than if every one, unrestrained, lived as he pleased.
In short, it is a singular blessing of God, that the wicked are not allowed to
do what they like.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may, however, be objected here and said, that
kings and magistrates often abuse their power, and exercise tyrannical cruelty
rather than justice. Such were almost all the magistrates, when this Epistle was
written. To this I answer, that tyrants and those like them, do not produce such
effects by their abuse, but that the ordinance of God ever remains in force, as
the institution of marriage is not subverted though the wife and the husband
were to act in a way not becoming them. However, therefore, men may go astray,
yet the end fixed by God cannot be changed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any one again to object and say, that we ought
not to obey princes who, as far as they can, pervert the holy ordinance of God,
and thus become savage wild beasts, while magistrates ought to bear the image of
God. My reply is this, that government established by God ought to be so highly
valued by us, as to honor even tyrants when in power. There is yet another reply
still more evident, &#8212; that there has never been a tyranny, (nor can one be
imagined,) however cruel and unbridled, in which some portion of equity has not
appeared; and further, some kind of government, however deformed and corrupt it
may be, is still better and more beneficial than anarchy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For so is the will of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He returns to his former doctrine,
lest an occasion should be given to the unbelieving to speak evil, though he
expresses less than what he had said before; for he says only that the mouths of
the foolish ought to be stopped. The phrase which he adopts, &#8220;to stop up
ignorance,&#8221; though it may seem harsh on account of its novelty, does not
yet obscure the sense. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb28</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For he not only calls the unbelieving foolish, but also points out the reason
why they slandered, even because they were ignorant of God. But inasmuch as he
makes the unbelieving to be without understanding and reason, we hence conclude,
that a right understanding cannot exist without the knowledge of God. How much
soever, then, the unbelieving may boast of their own acuteness, and may seem to
themselves to bewise and prudent, yet the Spirit of God charges them with folly,
in order that we may know that, apart from God, we cannot be really wise, as
without him there is nothing perfect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he prescribes the way in which the evil-speaking
of the unbelieving is to be restrained, even by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>well-doing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or, by doing good. In this expression he includes all the duties of humanity
and kindness which we ought to perform towards our neighbors. And in these is
included obedience to magistrates, without which concord among men cannot be
cultivated. Were any one to object and say, that the faithful can never be so
careful to do good, but that they will be evil-spoken of by the unbelieving: to
this the obvious answer is, that the Apostle here does not in any degree exempt
them from calumnies and reproaches; but he means that no occasion of slandering
ought to be given to the unbelieving, however much they may desire it. And lest
any one should further object and say, that the unbelieving are by no means
worthy of so much regard that God&#8217;s children should form their life to
please them, Peter expressly reminds us that we are bound by God&#8217;s command
to shut up their mouths.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As
free</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is said by way of
anticipation, that he might obviate those things which are usually objected to
with regard to the liberty of God&#8217;s children. For as men are naturally
ingenious in laying hold on what may be for their advantage, many, at the
commencement of the Gospel, thought themselves free to live only for themselves.
This doting opinion, then, is what Peter corrects; and he briefly shews how much
the liberty of Christians differed from unbridled licentiousness. And, in the
first place, he denies that there is any veil or pretext for wickedness, by
which he intimates, that there is no liberty given us to hurt our neighbors, or
to do any harm to others. True liberty, then, is that which harms or injures no
one. To confirm this, he declares that those are free who serve God. It is
obvious, hence, to conclude, that we obtain liberty, in order that we may more
promptly and more readily render obedience to God; for it is no other than a
freedom from sin; and dominion is taken away from sin, that men may become
obedient to righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, it is a free servitude, and a serving
freedom. For as we ought to be the servants of God, that we may enjoy this
benefit, so moderation is required in the use of it. In this way, indeed, our
consciences become free; but this prevents us not to serve God, who requires us
also to be subject to men.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This is a summary of what is gone before; for he
intimates that God is not feared, nor their just right rendered to men, except
civil order prevails among us, and magistrates retain their authority. That he
bids honor to be rendered to all, I explain thus, that none are to be neglected;
for it is a general precept, which refers to the social intercourse of men.

The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>honor</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>has a wide meaning in Hebrew, and we know that the apostles, though they
wrote in Greek, followed the meaning of words in the former language. Therefore,
this word conveys no other idea to me, than that a regard ought to be had for
all, since we ought to cultivate, as far as we can, peace and friendship with
all; there is, indeed, nothing more adverse to concord than
contempt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he adds respecting the love of brethren is
special, as contrasted with the first clause; for he speaks of that particular
love which we are bidden to have towards the household of faith, because we are
connected with them by a closer relationship. And so Peter did not omit this
connection; but yet he reminds us, that though brethren are to be specially
regarded, yet this ought not to prevent our love from being extended to the
whole human race. The word <i>fraternity, </i>or brotherhood, I take
collectively for brethren.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I have already said that all these
clauses are applied by Peter to the subject he was treating. For he means, that
honor paid to kings proceeds from the fear of God and the love of man; and that,
therefore, it ought to be connected with them, as though he had said,
&#8220;Whosoever fears God, loves his brethren and the whole human race as he
ought, and will also give honor to kings.&#8221; But, at the same time, he
expressly mentions <i>the king, </i>because that form of government was more
than any other disliked; and under it other forms are included.</font><br></div>

admonition, yet it is connected with what is gone before, as well as the other
things which follow; for the obedience of servants to masters, and of wives also
to their husbands, forms a part of civil or social subjection.

sincere and willing reverence, which they acknowledge by their office to be due.
He then sets this fear in opposition to dissimulation as well as to forced
subjection; for an eye-service
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ojfqalmodoulei&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510321&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:21,) as Paul calls it, is the opposite of this fear; and further, if servants
clamor against severe treatment, being ready to throw off the yoke if they
could, they cannot be said properly to fear. In short, fear arises from a right
knowledge of duty. And though no exception is added in this place, yet,
according to other places, it is to be understood. For subjection due to men is
not to be so far extended as to lessen the authority of God. Then servants are
to be subject to their masters, only as far as God permits, or as far as the
altars, as they say. But as the word here is not
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dou~loi</font><font face="Palatino">,
slaves, but
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oijke&gt;tai</font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

meant, though it be a difference of little moment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not only to the
good</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Though as to the duty of servants
to obey their masters, it is wholly a matter of conscience; if, however, they
are unjustly treated, as to themselves, they ought not to resist authority.
Whatever, then, masters may be, there is no excuse for servants for not
faithfully obeying them. For when a superior abuses his power, he must indeed
hereafter render an account to God, yet he does not for the present lose his
right. For this law is laid on servants, that they are to serve their masters,
though they may be unworthy. For <i>the froward </i>he sets in opposition to the
equitable or humane; and by this word he refers to the cruel and the perverse,
or those who have no humanity and kindness.

<div><font face="Palatino">It is a wonder what could have induced an interpreter

should say nothing of the gross ignorance of the Sorbons, who commonly
understand by wayward, (<i>dyscolos</i>,)<i> </i>the dissolute or dissipated,
were it not that they seek by this absurd rendering to build up for us an
article of faith, that we ought to obey the Pope and his horned wild beasts,
however grievous and intolerable a tyranny they may exercise. This passage,
then, shews how boldly they trifle with the Word of God.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this is
thankworthy</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word grace or favor,
has the meaning of praise; for he means that no grace or praise shall be found
before God, if we bear the punishment which we have by our faults deserved; but
that they who patiently bear injuries and wrongs are worthy of praise and
accepted by God. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb32</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
To testify that it was acceptable to God, when any one from conscience towards
God persevered in doing his duty, though unjustly and unworthily treated, was at
that time very necessary; for the condition of servants was very hard: they were
counted no better than cattle. Such indignity might have driven them to despair;
the only thing left for them was to look to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For conscience towards
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>means this, that one performs his
duty, not from a regard to men, but to God. For, when a wife is submissive and
obedient to her husband, in order to please him, she has her reward in this
world, as Christ says of the ambitious, who looked to the praise of men,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400616&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
6:16.) The same view is to be taken of other cases: When a son obeys his father
in order to secure his favor and bounty, he will have his reward from his
father, not from God. It is, in short, a general truth, that what we do is
approved by God, if our object be to serve him, and if we are not influenced by
a regard to man alone. Moreover, he who considers that he has to do with God,
must necessarily endeavor to overcome evil with good. For, God not only requires
that we should be such to every one as he is to us, but also that we should be
good to the unworthy and to such as persecute us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is not, however, an assertion without its
difficulty, when he says, that there is nothing praiseworthy in him who is
justly punished; for, when the Lord punishes our sins, patience is certainly a
sacrifice of sweet odour to him, that is, when we bear with a submissive mind
our punishment. But to this I reply, that Peter does not here speak simply but
comparatively; for it is a small and slender praise to bear with submission a
just punishment, in comparison with that of an innocent man, who willingly bears
the wrongs of men, only because he fears God. At the same time he seems
indirectly to refer to the motive; because they who suffer punishment for their
faults, are influenced by the fear of men. But the reply already given is
sufficient.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For even hereunto were ye
called</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For though his discourse was
respecting servants, yet this passage ought not to be confined to that subject.
For the Apostle here reminds all the godly in common as to what the condition of
Christianity is, as though he had said, that we are called by the Lord for this
end, patiently to bear wrongs; and as he says in another place that we are
appointed to this. Lest, however, this should seem grievous to us, he consoles
us with the example of Christ. Nothing seems more unworthy, and therefore less
tolerable, than undeservedly to suffer; but when we turn our eyes to the Son of
God, this bitterness is mitigated; for who would refuse to follow him going
before us?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice the words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Leaving us an
example</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb33</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>For as he treats of imitation, it is necessary to know what in Christ is to
be our example. He walked on the sea, he cleansed the leprous, he raised the
dead, he restored sight to the blind: to try to imitate him in these things
would be absurd. For when he gave these evidences of his power, it was not his
object that we should thus imitate him. It has hence happened that his fasting
for forty days has been made without reason an example; but what he had in view
was far otherwise. We ought, therefore, to exercise in this respect a right
judgment; as also Augustine somewhere reminds us, when explaining the following
passage,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Learn of me, for I
am meek and lowly in
heart.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
11:29.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the same thing may be learnt from the words of
Peter; for he marks the difference by saying that Christ&#8217;s patience is
what we ought to follow. This subject is handled more at large by Paul in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450829&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:29, where he teaches us that all the children of God are foreordained to be
made conformable to the image of Christ, in order that he might be the
first-born among many brethren. Hence, that we may live with him, we must
previously die with him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who did no
sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This belongs to the present
subject; for, if any one boasts of his own innocence, he must know that Christ
did not suffer as a malefactor. He, at the same time, shews how far we come
short of what Christ was, when he says, that there was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no guile found in his
mouth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for he who offends not by his
tongue, says James, is a perfect man.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;590302&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
3:2.) He then declares that there was in Christ the highest perfection of
innocency, such as no one of us can dare claim for himself. It hence appears
more fully how unjustly he suffered beyond all others. There is, therefore, no
reason why any one of us should refuse to suffer after his example, since no one
is so conscious of having acted rightly, as not to know that he is
imperfect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When he was
reviled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, reproached. Here Peter
points out what we are to imitate in Christ, even calmly to bear wrongs, and not
to avenge wrongs. For such is our disposition, that when we receive injuries,
our minds immediately boil over with revengeful feelings; but Christ abstained
from every kind of retaliation. Our minds, therefore, ought to be bridled, lest
we should seek to render evil for evil.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But
committed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>himself, or, his cause. The
word <i>cause </i>is not expressed, but it is obviously understood. And Peter
adds this for the consolation of the godly, that is, that if they patiently
endured the reproaches and violence of the wicked, they would have God as their
defender. For it would be a very hard thing for us, to be subjected to the will
of the ungodly, and not to have God caring for our wrongs. Peter, therefore,
adorns God with this high attribute, that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>judgeth
righteously</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>as though he had said,
&#8220;It behoves us calmly to bear evils; God in the meantime will not neglect
what belongs to him, but will shew himself to be a righteous judge.&#8221;
However wanton then the ungodly may be for a time, yet they shall not be
unpunished for the wrongs done now to the children of God. Nor is there any
cause for the godly to fear, as though they were without any protection; for
since it belongs to God to defend them and to undertake their cause, they are to
possess their souls in patience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, as this doctrine brings no small
consolation, so it avails to allay and subdue the inclinations of the flesh. For
no one can recumb on the fidelity and protection of God, but he who in a meek
spirit waits for his judgment; for he who leaps to take vengeance, intrudes into
what belongs to God, and suffers not God to perform his own office. In reference
to this Paul says, &#8220;Give place to wrath,&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:19;) and thus he intimates that the way is closed up against God that he
might not himself judge, when we anticipate him. He then confirms what he had
said by the testimony of Moses, &#8220;Vengeance is mine.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;053235&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
32:35.) Peter in short meant this, that we after the example of Christ shall be
more prepared to endure injuries, if we give to God his own honor, that is, if
we, believing him to be a righteous judge, refer our right and our cause to
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may however be asked, How did Christ commit his
cause to the Father; for if he required vengeance from him, this he himself says
is not lawful for us; for he bids us to do good to those who injure us, to pray
for those who speak evil of us.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400544&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:44.) To this my reply is, that it appears evident from the gospel-history,
that Christ did thus refer his judgment to God, and yet did not demand vengeance
to be taken on his enemies, but that, on the contrary, he prayed for them,
&#8220;Father,&#8221; he said, &#8220;forgive them.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;422334&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
23:34.) And doubtless the feelings of our flesh are far from being in unison
with the judgment of God. That any one then may commit his cause to him who
judgeth righteously, it is necessary that he should first lay a check on
himself, so that he may not ask anything inconsistent with the righteous
judgment of God. For they who indulge themselves in looking for vengeance,
concede not to God his office of a judge, but in a manner wish him to be an
executioner. He then who is so calm in his spirit as to wish his adversaries to
become his friends, and endeavors to bring them to the right way, rightly
commits to God his own cause, and his prayer is, &#8220;Thou, O Lord, knowest my
heart, how I wish them to be saved who seek to destroy me: were they converted,
I should congratulate them; but if they continue obstinate in their wickedness,
for I know that thou watchest over my safety, I commit my cause to thee.&#8221;
This meekness was manifested by Christ; it is then the rule to be observed by
us.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Had he commended nothing in Christ&#8217;s death
except as an example, it would have been very frigid: he therefore refers to a
fruit much more excellent. There are then three things to be noticed in this
passage. The first is, that Christ by his death has given us an example of
patience; the second, that by his death he restored us to life; it hence
follows, that we are so bound to him, that we ought cheerfully to follow his
example. In the third place, he refers to the general design of his death, that
we, being dead to sins, ought to live to righteousness. And all these things
confirm his previous exhortation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who his own self bare our
sins</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This form of speaking is fitted to
set forth the efficacy of Christ&#8217;s death. For as under the Law, the
sinner, that he might be released from guilt, substituted a victim in his own
place; so Christ took on himself the curse due to our sins, that he might atone
for them before God. And he expressly adds, on
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
tree</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,</i> because he could not offer such an
expiation except on the cross. Peter, therefore, well expresses the truth, that
Christ&#8217;s death was a sacrifice for the expiation of our sins; for being
fixed to the cross and offering himself a victim for us, he took on himself our
sin and our punishment. Isaiah, from whom Peter has taken the substance of his
doctrine, employs various forms of expression, &#8212; that he was smitten by
God&#8217;s hand for our sins, that he was wounded for our iniquities, that he
was afflicted and broken for our sake, that the chastisement of our peace was
laid on him. But Peter intended to set forth the same thing by the words of this
verse, even that we are reconciled to God on this condition, because Christ made
himself before his tribunal a surety and as one guilty for us, that he might
suffer the punishment due to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This great benefit the Sophists in their schools
obscure as much as they can; for they prattle that by the sacrifice of the death
of Christ we are only freed after baptism from guilt, but that punishment is
redeemed by satisfactions. But Peter, when he says that he bore our sins, means
that not only guilt was imputed to him, but that he also suffered its
punishment, that he might thus be an expiatory victim, according to that saying
of the Prophet, &#8220;The chastisement of our peace was upon him.&#8221; If
they object and say, that this only avails before baptism, the context here
disproves them, for the words are addressed to the faithful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this clause and that which follows,

He had before pointed out another end, even an example of patience; but here, as
it has been stated, it is made more manifest, that we are to live a holy and
righteous life. The Scripture sometimes mentions both, that is, that the Lord
tries us with troubles and adversities, that we might be conformed to the death
of Christ, and also that the old man has been crucified in the death of Christ,
that we might walk in newness of life.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
3:10;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:4.) At the same time, this end of which he speaks, differs from the former,
not only as that which is general from what is particular; for in patience there
is simply an example; but when he says that Christ suffered, that we being dead
to sins should live to righteousness, he intimates that there is power in
Christ&#8217;s death to mortify our flesh, as Paul explains more fully in the
sixth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. For he has not only brought this
great benefit to us, that God justifies us freely, by not imputing to us our
sins; but. he also makes us to die to the world and to the flesh, that we may
rise again to a new life: not that one day makes complete this death; but
wherever it is, the death of Christ is efficacious for the expiation of sins,
and also for the mortification of the flesh.</font><br></div>

emphasis is on what the Prophet adds, when he says that every one had turned to
his own way. The meaning then is, that we are all going astray from the way of
salvation, and proceeding in the way of ruin, until Christ brings us back from
this wandering.</font><br></div>

but that he will faithfully watch over the safety of those who are in his fold

his own spiritual protection unto eternal life.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">HE proceeds now to another instance of subjection,
and bids wives to be subject to their husbands. And as those seemed to have some
pretense for shaking off the yoke, who were united to unbelieving men, he
expressly reminds them of their duty, and brings forward a particular reason why
they ought the more carefully to obey, even that they might by their probity
allure their husbands to the faith. But if wives ought to obey ungodly husbands,
with much more promptness ought they to obey, who have believing
husbands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may seem strange that Peter should say, that a
husband might be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gained</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to the Lord </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>without the

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451017&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:17. To this I reply, that Peter&#8217;s words are not to be so understood as
though a holy life alone could lead the unbelieving to Christ, but that it
softens and pacifies their minds, so that they might have less dislike to
religion; for as bad examples create offenses, so good ones afford no small
help. Then Peter shews that wives by a holy and pious life could do so much as
to prepare their husbands, without speaking to them on religion, to embrace the
faith of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>While they
behold</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For minds, however alienated
from the true faith, are subdued, when they see the good conduct of believers;
for as they understood not the doctrine of Christ, they form an estimate of it
by our life. It cannot, then, be but that they will commend Christianity, which
teaches purity and fear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whose
adorning</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The other part of the
exhortation is, that wives are to adorn themselves sparingly and modestly: for
we know that they are in this respect much more curious and ambitious than they
ought to be. Then Peter does not without cause seek to correct in them this
vanity. And though he reproves generally sumptuous or costly adorning, yet he
points out some things in particular, &#8212; that they were not artificially to
curl or wreath their hair, as it was usually done by crisping-pins, or otherwise
to form it according to the fashion; nor were they to set gold around their
head: for these are the things in which excesses especially
appear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be now asked, whether the Apostle wholly
condemns the use of gold in adorning the body. Were any one to urge these words,
it may be said, that he prohibits precious garments no less than gold; for he
immediately adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the putting on
of apparel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, of clothes. But it would
be an immoderate strictness wholly to forbid neatness and elegance in clothing.
If the material is said to be too sumptuous, the Lord has created it; and we
know that skill in art has proceeded from him. Then Peter did not intend to
condemn every sort of ornament, but the evil of vanity, to which women are
subject. Two things are to be regarded in clothing, usefulness and decency; and
what decency requires is moderation and modesty. Were, then, a woman to go forth
with her hair wantonly curled and decked, and make an extravagant display, her
vanity could not be excused. They who object and say, that to clothe
one&#8217;s-self in this or that manner is an indifferent thing, in which all
are free to do as they please, may be easily confuted; for excessive elegance
and superfluous display, in short, all excesses, arise from a corrupted mind.
Besides, ambition, pride, affectation of display, and all things of this kind,
are not indifferent things. Therefore they whose minds are purified from all
vanity, will duly order all things, so as not to exceed
moderation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But let it be the hidden, man
of the heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The contrast here ought to
be carefully observed. Cato said, that they who are anxiously engaged in
adorning the body, neglect the adorning of the mind: so Peter, in order to
restrain this desire in women, introduces a remedy, that they are to devote
themselves to the cultivation of their minds. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heart</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>no doubt means the whole soul. He at the same time shews in what consists
the spiritual adorning of women, even in
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the incorruptness of a meek and
quiet spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.
</i>&#8220;Incorruptness,&#8221; as I think, is set in opposition to things
which fade and vanish away, things which serve to adorn the body. Therefore the
version of Erasmus departs from the real meaning. In short, Peter means that the
ornament of the soul is not like a fading flower, nor consists in vanishing
splendor, but is incorruptible. By mentioning <i>quiet </i>and a tranquil
<i>spirit, </i>he marks out what especially belongs to women; for nothing
becomes them more than a placid and a sedate temper of mind. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb36</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For we know how outrageous a being is an imperious and a self-willed woman. And
further, nothing is more fitted to correct the vanity of which Peter speaks than
a placid quietness of spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What follows, that it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the sight of God of great

previous sentence as well as to the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>the meaning indeed will remain the same. For why do women take so much care
to adorn themselves, except that they may turn the eyes of men on themselves?
But Peter, on the contrary, bids them to be more anxious for what is before God
of a great price.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He sets before them the example of pious women, who
sought for spiritual adorning rather than outward meretricious ornaments. But he
mentions Sarah above all others, who, having been the mother of all the
faithful, is especially worthy of honor and imitation on the part of her sex.
Moreover, he returns again to subjection, and confirms it by the example of
Sarah, who, according to the words of Moses, called her husband Lord.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;011812&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
18:12.) God, indeed, does not regard such titles; and it may sometimes be, that
one especially petulant and disobedient should use such a word with her tongue;
but Peter means, that Sarah usually spoke thus, because she knew that a command
had been given her by the Lord, to be subject to her husband. Peter adds, that
they who imitated her fidelity would be her daughters, that is, reckoned among
the faithful.</font><br></div>

women to be suspicious and timid, and therefore morose; for they fear lest by
their subjection, they should be more reproachfully treated. It was this that
Peter seems to have had in view in forbidding them to be disturbed by any fear,
as though he had said, &#8220;Willingly submit to the authority of your
husbands, nor let fear prevent your obedience, as though your condition would be
worse, were you to obey.&#8221; The words may be more general, &#8220;Let them
not raise up commotions at home.&#8221; For as they are liable to be frightened,
they often make much of a little thing, and thus disturb themselves and the
family. Others think that the timidity of women, which is contrary to faith, is
generally reproved, as though Peter exhorted them to perform the duties of their
calling with a courageous and intrepid spirit. However, the first explanation is
what I prefer, though the last does not differ much from it.

for dominion over their wives is not given them, except on this condition, that
they exercise authority prudently. Then let husbands remember that they need
prudence to do rightly their duty. And doubtless many foolish things must be
endured by them, many unpleasant things must be borne with; and they must at the
same time beware lest their indulgence should foster folly. Hence the admonition
of Peter is not in vain, that the husbands ought to cohabit with them as with a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>weaker
vessel.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Part of the prudence which he
mentions, is, that the husbands honor their wives. For nothing destroys the
friendship of life more than contempt; nor can we really love any but those whom
we esteem; for love must be connected with respect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, he employs a twofold argument, in order to
persuade husbands to treat their wives honourably and kindly. The first is
derived from the weakness of the sex; the other, from the honor with which God
favors them. These things seem indeed to be in a manner contrary, &#8212; that
honor ought to be given to wives, because they are weak, and because they excel;
but these things well agree together where love exists. It is evident, that God
is despised in his gifts, except we honor those on whom he has conferred any
excellency. But when we consider that we are members of the same body, we learn
to bear with one another, and mutually to cover our infirmities. This is what
Paul means when he says that greater honor is given to the weaker members,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 12:23;) even because we are more careful in protecting them from
shame. Then Peter does not without reason command that women should be cared
for, and that they should be honored with a kind treatment, because they are
weak. And then as we more easily forgive children, when they offend through
inexperience of age; so the weakness of the female sex ought to make us not to
be too rigid and severe towards our wives.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>vessel</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

word &#8220;living.&#8221; Some read &#8220;co-heirs&#8221; in the dative case,
which makes no difference in the sense. A conjunction is put by others between
manifold grace and life; which reading is the most suitable. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb38</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For since the Lord is pleased to bestow in common on husbands and wives the same
graces, he invites them to seek an equality in them; and we know that those
graces are manifold in which wives are partakers with their husbands. For some
belong to the present life, and some to God&#8217;s spiritual kingdom. He
afterwards adds, that they are co-heirs also of life, which is the chief thing.
And though some are strangers to the hope of salvation, yet as it is offered by
the Lord to them no less than to their husbands, it is a sufficient honor to the
sex.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That your prayers be not
hindered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For God cannot be rightly
called upon, unless our minds be calm and peaceable. Among strifes and
contentions there is no place for prayer. Peter indeed addresses the husband and
the wife, when he bids them to be at peace one with another, so that they might
with one mind pray to God. But we may hence gather a general doctrine &#8212;
that no one ought to come to God except he is united to his brethren. Then as
this reason ought to restrain all domestic quarrels and strifes, in order that
each one of the family may pray to God; so in common life it ought to be as it
were a bridle to check all contentions. For we are more than insane, if we
knowingly and wilfully close up the way to God&#8217;s presence by prayer, since
this is the only asylum of our salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some give this explanation, that an intercourse with
the wife ought to be sparing and temperate, lest too much indulgence in this
respect should prevent attention to prayer, according to that saying of
Paul,</font><br></div>

</i>or merciful, which is added, means that we are not only to help our brethren
and relieve their miseries, but also to bear with their infirmities. In what
follows there are two readings in Greek; but what seems to me the most probable
is the one I have put as the text; for we know that it is the chief bond to
preserve friendship, when every one thinks modestly and humbly of himself; as
there is nothing on the other hand which produces more discords than when we
think too highly of ourselves. Wisely then does Peter bid us to be humble-minded
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tapeino&gt;fronev</font><font face="Palatino">,)
lest pride and haughtiness should lead us to despise our neighbors.

revenge is forbidden; for in order to preserve love, we must bear with many
things. At the same time he does not speak here of mutual benevolence, but he
would have us to endure wrongs, when provoked by ungodly men. And though it is
commonly thought that it is an instance of a weak and abject mind, not to avenge
injuries, yet it is counted before God as the highest magnanimity. Nor is it
indeed enough to abstain from revenge; but Peter requires also that we should
pray for those who reproach us; for to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bless</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>here means to pray, as it is set in opposition to the second clause. But
Peter teaches us in general, that evils are to be overcome by acts of kindness.
This is indeed very hard, but we ought to imitate in this case our heavenly
Father, who makes his sun to rise on the unworthy. What the sophists imagine to
be the meaning, is a futile evasion; for when Christ said, &#8220;Love your
enemies,&#8221; he at the same time confirmed his own doctrine by saying,
&#8220;That ye might be the children of God.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Knowing that ye are thereunto
called</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He means that this condition was
required of the faithful when they were called by God, that they were not only
to be so meek as not to retaliate injuries, but also to bless those who cursed
them; and as this condition may seem almost unjust, he calls their attention to
the reward; as though he had said, that there is no reason why the faithful
should complain, because their wrongs would turn to their own benefit. In short,
he shews how much would be the gain of patience; for if we submissively bear
injuries, the Lord will bestow on us his blessing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The verb,

blessing would not be for a short time, but perpetual, if we be submissive in
bearing injuries. But God blesses in a way different, from men; for we express
our wishes to him, but he confers a blessing on us. And on the other hand, Peter
intimates that they who seek to revenge injuries, attempt what will yield them
no good, for they thus deprive themselves of God&#8217;s
blessing.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For
he</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> He confirms the last sentence by the
testimony of David. The passage is taken from the thirty-fourth Psalm, where the
Spirit testifies that it will be well with all who keep themselves from all
evil-doing and wrong-doing. The common feeling indeed favors what is very
different; for men think that they expose themselves to the insolence of
enemies, if they do not boldly defend themselves. But the Spirit of God promises
a happy life to none except to the meek, and those who endure evils; and we
cannot be happy except God prospers our ways; and it is the good and the
benevolent, and not the cruel and inhuman, that he will favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Peter has followed the Greek version, though the
difference is but little. David&#8217;s words are literally these, &#8212;
&#8220;He who loves life and desires to see good days,&#8221; etc. It is indeed
a desirable thing, since God has placed us in this world, to pass our time in
peace. Then, the way of obtaining this blessing is to conduct ourselves justly
and harmlessly towards all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The first thing he points out are the vices of the
tongue; which are to be avoided, so that we may not be contumelious and
insolent, nor speak deceitfully and with duplicity. Then he comes to deeds, that
we are to injure none, or cause loss to none, but to endeavor to be kind to all,
and to exercise the duties of humanity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let him seek
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is not enough to embrace it
when offered to us, but it ought to be followed when it seems to flee from us.
It also often happens, that when we seek it as much as we can, others will not
grant it to us. On account of these difficulties and hindrances, he bids us to
seek and pursue it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the eyes of the Lord are over
the righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, on the righteous. It
ought to be a consolation to us, sufficient to mitigate all evils, that we are
looked upon by the Lord, so that he will bring us help in due time. The meaning
then is, that the prosperity which he has mentioned depends on the protection of
God; for were not the Lord to care for his people, they would be like sheep
exposed to wolves. And that we for little reason raise a clamor, that we
suddenly kindle unto wrath, that we burn with the passion of revenge, all this,
doubtless, happens, because we do not consider that God cares for us, and
because we do not acquiesce in his aid. Thus in vain we shall be taught
patience, except our minds are first imbued with this truth, that God exercises
such care over us, that he will in due time succor us. When, on the contrary, we
are fully persuaded that God defends the cause of the righteous, we shall first
attend simply to innocence, and then, when molested and hated by the ungodly, we
shall flee to the protection of God. And when he says, that the <i>ears </i>of
the Lord are open to our prayers, he encourages us to pray.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the face of the
Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this clause he intimates that
the Lord will be our avenger, because he will not always suffer the insolence of
the ungodly to prevail; and at the same time he shews how it will be, if we seek
to defend our life from injuries, even that God will be an adversary to us. But
it may, on the other hand, be objected and said, that we experience it daily far
otherwise, for the more righteous any one is, and the greater lover of peace he
is, the more he is harassed by the wicked. To this I reply, that no one is so
attentive to righteousness and peace, but that he sometimes sins in this
respect. But it ought to be especially observed, that the promises as to this
life do not extend further than as to what is expedient for us to be fulfilled.
Hence, our peace with the world is often disturbed, that our flesh may be
subdued, in order that we may serve God, and also for other reasons; so that
nothing may be a loss to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is he that will harm
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He further confirms the previous
sentence by an argument drawn from common experience. For it happens for the
most part, that the ungodly disturb us, or are provoked by us, or that we do not
labor to do them good as it behoves us; for they who seek to do good, do even
soften minds which are otherwise hard as iron. This very thing is mentioned by
Plato in his first book on the Republic, &#8220;Injustice,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;causes seditions and hatreds and fightings one with another; but justice,
concord and friendship.&#8221; 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb41</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
However, though this commonly happens, yet it is not always the case; for the
children of God, how much soever they may strive to pacify the ungodly by
kindness, and shew themselves kind towards all, are yet often assailed
undeservedly by many.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>. Hence Peter adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if ye suffer for
righteousness&#8217; sake</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The meaning
is, that the faithful will do more towards obtaining a quiet life by kindness,
than by violence and prompfitude in taking revenge; but that when they neglect
nothing to secure peace, were they to suffer, they are still blessed, because
they suffer for the sake of righteousness. Indeed, this latter clause differs
much from the judgment of our flesh; but Christ has not without reason thus
declared; nor has Peter without reason repeated the sentence from his mouth; for
God will at length come as a deliverer, and then openly will appear what now
seems incredible, that is, that the miseries of the godly have been blessed when
endured with patience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To suffer
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>means not only to submit
to some loss or disadvantage in defending a good cause, but also to suffer
unjustly, when any one is innocently in fear among men on account of the fear of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be not afraid of their
terror</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He again points out the fountain
and cause of impatience, that we are beyond due measure troubled, when the
ungodly rise up against us. For such a dread either disheartens us, or degrades
us, or kindles within us a desire for revenge. In the meantime, we do not
acquiesce in the defense of God. Then the best remedy for checking the turbulent
emotions of our minds will be, to conquer immoderate terrors by trusting in the
aid of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Peter no doubt meant to allude to a passage in
the eighth chapter of Isaiah; for when the Jews against the prohibition of God
sought to fortify themselves by the aid of the Gentile world, God warned his
Prophet not to fear after their example. Peter at the same time seems to have
turned &#8220;fear&#8221; into a different meaning; for it is taken passively by
the Prophet., who accused the people of unbelief, because, at a time when they
ought to have relied on the aid of God and to have boldly despised all dangers,
they became so prostrate and broken down with fear, that they sent to all around
them for unlawful help. But Peter takes fear in another sense, as meaning that
terror which the ungodly are wont to fill us with by their violence and cruel
threatenings. He then departs from the sense in which the word is taken by the
Prophet; but in this there is nothing unreasonable; for his object was not to
explain the words of the Prophet; he wished only to shew that, nothing is fitter
to produce patience than what Isaiah prescribes, even to ascribe to God his
honor by recumbing in full confidence on his power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I do not, however, object, if any one prefers to
render Peter&#8217;s words thus,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear ye not their
fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>as though he had said, &#8220;Be
ye not afraid as the unbelieving, or the children of this world are wont to be,
because they understand nothing of God&#8217;s providence.&#8221; But this, as I
think, would be a forced explanation. There is, indeed, no need for us to toil
much on this point, since Peter here did not intend to explain every word used
by the Prophet, but only referred to this one thing, that the faithful will
firmly stand, and can never be moved from a right course of duty by any dread or
fear, if they will sanctify the Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this sanctification ought to be confined to the
present case. For whence is it that we are overwhelmed with fear, and think
ourselves lost, when danger is impending, except that we ascribe to mortal man
more power to injure us than to God to save us? God promises that he will be the
guardian of our salvation; the ungodly, on the other hand, attempt to subvert
it. Unless God&#8217;s promise sustain us, do we not deal unjustly with him, and
in a manner profane him? Then the Prophet teaches us that we ought to think
honourably of the Lord of hosts; for how much soever the ungodly may contrive to
destroy us, and whatever power they may possess, he alone is more than
sufficiently powerful to secure our safety. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb42</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Peter then adds, <i>in your hearts. </i>For if this conviction takes full
possession of our minds, that the help promised by the Lord is sufficient for
us, we shall be well fortified to repel all the fears of
unbelief.</font><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though this is a new precept, it yet depends on what
is gone before, for he requires such constancy in the faithful, as boldly to
give a reason for their faith to their adversaries. And this is a part of that
sanctification which he had just mentioned; for we then really honor God, when
neither fear nor shame hinders us from making a profession of our faith. But
Peter does not expressly bid us to assert and proclaim what has been given us by
the Lord everywhere, and always and among all indiscriminately, for the Lord
gives his people the spirit of discretion, so that they may know when and how
far and to whom it is expedient to speak. He bids them only to be ready to give
an answer, lest by their sloth and the cowardly fear of the flesh they should
expose the doctrine of Christ, by being silent, to the derision of the ungodly.
The meaning then is, that we ought to be prompt in avowing our faith, so as to
set it forth whenever necessary, lest the unbelieving through our silence should
condemn the religion we follow.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it ought to be noticed, that Peter here does not
command us to be prepared to solve any question that may be mooted; for it is
not the duty of all to speak on every subject. But it is the general doctrine
that is meant, which belongs to the ignorant and the simple. Then Peter had in
view no other thing, than that Christians should make it evident to unbelievers
that they truly worshipped God, and had a holy and good religion. And in this
there is no difficulty, for it would be strange if we could bring nothing to
defend our faith when any one made inquiries respecting it. For we ought always
to take care that all may know that we fear God, and that we piously and
reverently regard his legitimate worship.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This was also required by the state of the times: the
Christian name was much hated and deemed infamous; many thought the sect wicked
and guilty of many sacrileges. It would have been, therefore, the highest
perfidy against God, if, when asked, they had neglected to give a testimony in
favor of their religion. And this, as I think, is the meaning of the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>apology</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>which Peter uses, that is, that the Christians were to make it evident to
the world that they were far off from every impiety, and did not corrupt true
religion, on which account they were suspected by the ignorant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hope</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>here is by a metonymy to be taken for faith. Peter, however, as it has been
said, does not require them to know how to discuss distinctly and refinedly
every article of the faith, but only to shew that their faith in Christ was
consistent with genuine piety. And hence we learn how all those abuse the name
of Christians, who understand nothing certain respecting their faith, and have
nothing to give as an answer for it. But it behoves us again carefully to
consider what he says, when he speaks of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that hope that is in
you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>for he intimates that the
confession which flows from the heart is alone that which is approved by God;
for except faith dwells within, the tongue prattles in vain. It ought then to
have its roots within us, so that it may afterwards bring forth the fruit of
confession.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With
meekness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is a most necessary
admonition; for unless our minds are endued with meekness, contentions will
immediately break forth. And meekness is set in opposition to pride and vain
ostentation, and also to excessive zeal. To this he justly adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>;
</i>for where reverence for God prevails, it tames all the ferocity of our
minds, and it will especially cause us to speak calmly of God&#8217;s mysteries.
For contentious disputes arise from this, because many think less honourably
than they ought of the greatness of divine wisdom, and are carried away by
profane audacity. If, then, we would render approved of God the confession of
our faith, all boasting must be put aside, all contention must be
relinquished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having a good
conscience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>What we say without a
corresponding life has but little weight; hence he joins to confession a good
conscience. For we see that many are sufficiently ready with their tongue, and
prate much, very freely, and yet with no fruit, because the life does not
correspond. Besides, the integrity of conscience alone is that which gives us
confidence in speaking as we ought; for they who prattle much about the gospel,
and whose dissolute life is a proof of their impiety, not only make themselves
objects of ridicule, but also expose the truth itself to the slanders of the
ungodly. For why did he before bid us to be ready to defend the faith, should
any one require from us a reason for it, except that it is our duty to vindicate
the truth of God against those false suspicions which the ignorant entertain
respecting it. But the defense of the tongue will avail but little, except the
life corresponds with it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that they may be
ashamed</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>who blame your good
conversation in Christ, and who speak against you as evil-doers; as though he
had said, &#8220;If your adversaries have nothing to allege against you, except
that you follow Christ, they will at length be ashamed of their malicious
wickedness, or at least, your innocence will be sufficient to confute
them.&#8221;</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For it is

follows but to the whole context. He had spoken of the profession of faith,
which at that time was attended with great danger; he says now that it is much
better, if they sustained any loss in defending a good cause, to suffer thus
unjustly than to be punished for their evil deeds. This consolation is
understood rather by secret meditation, than by many words. It is what indeed
occurs everywhere in profane authors, that there is a sufficient defense in a
good conscience, whatever evils may happen, and must be endured. These have
spoken courageously; but then the only really bold man is he who looks to God.
Therefore Peter added this clause,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If the will of God be
so</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>For in these words he reminds us,
that if we suffer unjustly, it is not by chance, but according to the divine
will; and he assumes, that God wills nothing or appoints nothing but for the
best reason. Hence the faithful have always this comfort in their miseries, that
they know that they have God as their witness, and that they also know that they
are led by him to the contest, in order that they may under his protection give
a proof of their faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For Christ
also</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>It is another comfort, that if in
our afflictions we are conscious of having done well, we suffer according to the
example of Christ; and it hence follows that we are blessed. At the same time he
proves, from the design of Christ&#8217;s death, that it is by no means
consistent with our profession that we should suffer for our evil deeds. For he
teaches us that Christ suffered in order to bring us to God. What does this
mean, except that we have been thus consecrated to God by Christ&#8217;s death,
that we may live and die to him?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are, then, two parts in this sentence; the
first is, that persecutions ought to be borne with resignation, because the Son
of God shews the way to us; and the other is, that since we have been
consecrated to God&#8217;s service by the death of Christ, it behoves us to
suffer, not for our faults, but for righteousness&#8217; sake.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, however, a question may be raised, Does not God
chastise the faithful, whenever he suffers them to be afflicted? To this I
answer, that it indeed often happens, that God punishes them according to what
they deserve; and this is not denied by Peter; but he reminds us what a comfort
it is to have our cause connected with God. And how God does not punish sins in
them who endure persecution for the sake of righteousness, and in what sense
they are said to be innocent, we shall see in the next chapter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Being put to death in the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Now this is a great thing, that
we are made conformable to the Son of God, when we suffer without cause; but
there is added another consolation, that the death of Christ had a blessed
issue; for though he suffered through the weakness of the flesh, he yet rose
again through the power of the Spirit. Then the cross of Christ was not
prejudicial, nor his death, since life obtained the victory. This was said (as
Paul also reminds us in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470410&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:10) that we may know that we are to bear in our body the dying of
Christ, in order that his life may be manifested in us.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By which
also</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Peter added this, that we might
know that the vivifying power of the Spirit of which he spoke, was not only put
forth as to Christ himself, but is also poured forth with regard to us, as Paul
shews in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450505&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:5. He then says, that Christ did not rise only for himself, but that he made
known to others the same power of his Spirit, so that it penetrated to the dead.
It hence follows, that we shall not less feel it in vivifying whatever is mortal
in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as the obscurity of this passage has produced, as
usual, various explanations, I shall first disprove what has been brought
forward by some, and secondly, we shall seek its genuine and true
meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Common has been the opinion hat Christ&#8217;s
descent into hell is here referred to; but the words mean no such thing; for
there is no mention made of the soul of Christ, but only that he went by the
Spirit: and these are very different things, that Christ&#8217;s soul went, and
that Christ preached by the power of the Spirit. Then Peter expressly mentioned
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that he might take away the
notion of what may be called a real presence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Others explain this passage of the apostles, that
Christ by their ministry appeared to the dead, that is, to unbelievers. I,
indeed, allow that Christ by means of his apostles went by his Spirit to those
who were kept as it were in prison; but this exposition appears incorrect on
several accounts: First, Peter says that Christ went
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>to
spirits</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which he means souls
separated from their bodies, for living men are never called spirits; and
secondly, what Peter repeats in the fourth chapter on the same subject, does not
admit of such an allegory. Therefore the words must be properly understood of
the dead. Thirdly, it seems very strange, that Peter, speaking of the apostles,
should immediately, as though forgetting himself, go back to the time of Noah.
Certainly this mode of speaking would be most unsuitable. Then this explanation
cannot be right.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, the strange notion of those who think hat
unbelievers as to the coming of Christ, were after his death freed from their
sin, needs no long refutation; for it is an indubitable doctrine of Scripture,
that we obtain not salvation in Christ except by faith; then there is no hope
left for those who continue to death unbelieving. They speak what is somewhat
more probable, who say, that the redemption obtained by Christ availed the dead,
who in the time of Noah were long unbelieving, but repented a short time before
they were drowned by the deluge. They then understood that they suffered in the
flesh the punishment due to their perverseness, and yet were saved by Christ, so
that they did not perish for ever. But this interpretation cannot stand; it is
indeed inconsistent with the words of the passage, for Peter ascribes salvation
only to the family of Noah, and gives over to ruin all who were not within the
ark.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I therefore have no doubt but Peter speaks generally,
that the manifestation of Christ&#8217;s grace was made to godly spirits, and
that they were thus endued with the vital power of the Spirit. Hence there is no
reason to fear that it will not flow to us. But it may be inquired, Why he puts
in prison the souls of the godly after having quitted their bodies? It seems to
me that
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">fulakh&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">
rather means a watchtower in which watchmen stand for the purpose of watching,
or the very act of watching. for it is often so taken by Greek authors; and the
meaning would be very appropriate, that godly souls were watching in hope of the
salvation promised them, as though they saw it afar off. Nor is there a doubt
but that the holy fathers in life, as well as after death, directed their
thoughts to this object. But if the word <i>prison </i>be preferred, it would
not be unsuitable; for, as while they lived, the Law, according to Paul,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
3:23,) was a sort of prison in which they were kept; so after death they must
have felt the same desire for Christ; for the spirit of liberty had not as yet
been fully given. Hence this anxiety of expectation was to them a kind of
prison.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Thus far the Apostle&#8217;s words seem to agree
together, and with the thread of the argument; but what follows is attended with
some difficulty; for he does not mention the faithful here, but only the
unbelieving; and this seems to overturn the preceding exposition. Some have for
this reason been led to think that no other thing is said here, but that the
unbelieving, who had formerly persecuted the godly, found the Spirit of Christ
an accuser, as though Peter consoled the faithful with this argument, that
Christ, even when dead, punished them. But their mistake is discovered by what
we shall see in the next chapter, that the Gospel was preached to the dead, that
they might live according to God in the spirit, which peculiarly applies to the
faithful. And it is further certain that he repeats there what he now says.
Besides, they have not considered that what Peter meant was especially this,
that as the power of the Spirit of Christ shewed itself to be vivifying in him,
and was known as such by the dead, so it will be towards us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us, however, see why it is that he mentions only
the unbelieving; for he seems to say, that Christ in spirit appeared to those
who formerly were unbelieving; but I understand him otherwise, that then the
true servants of God were mixed together with the unbelieving, and were almost
hidden on account of their number. I allow that the Greek construction is at
variance with this meaning, for Peter, if he meant this, ought to have used the
genitive case absolute. But as it was not unusual with the Apostles to put one
case instead of another, and as we see that Peter here heaps together many
things, and no other suitable meaning can be elicited, I have no hesitation in
giving this explanation of this intricate passage; so that readers may
understand that those called unbelieving are different from those to whom he
said the Gospel was preached.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After having then said that Christ was manifested to
the dead, he immediately adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When there were formerly
unbelievers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>by which he intimated, that
it was no injury to the holy fathers that they were almost hidden through the
vast number of the ungodly. For he meets, as I think, a doubt, which might have
harassed the faithful of that day. They saw almost the whole world filled with
unbelievers, that they enjoyed all authority, and that life was in their power.
This trial might have shaken the confidence of those who were shut up, as it
were, under the sentence of death. Therefore Peter reminds them, that the
condition of the fathers was not different, and that though the multitude of the
ungodly then covered the whole earth, their life was yet preserved in safety by
the power of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then comforted the godly, lest they should be cast
down and destroyed because they were so few; and he chose an example the most
remarkable in antiquity, even that of the world drowned by the deluge; for then
in the common ruin of mankind, the family of Noah alone escaped. And he points
out the manner, and says that it was a kind of baptism. There is then in this
respect also nothing unsuitable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of what is said is this, that the world has
always been full of unbelievers, but that the godly ought not to be terrified by
their vast number; for though Noah was surrounded on every side by the ungodly,
and had very few as his friends, he was not yet drawn aside from the right
course of his faith. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb43</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When once the long-suffering of God
waited</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This ought to be applied to the
ungodly, whom God&#8217;s patience rendered more slothful; for when God deferred
his vengeance and did not immediately execute it, the ungodly boldly disregarded
all threatenings; but Noah, on the contrary, being warned by God, had the deluge
for a long time before his eyes. Hence his assiduity in building the ark; for
being terrified by God&#8217;s judgment, he shook off all
torpidity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The like figure
whereunto</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I fully think that the
relative ought to be read in the dative case, and that it has happened, through
a mistake, that
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">o{</font><font face="Palatino"> is
put, and not
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">w=|</font><font face="Palatino">.
The meaning, however, is not ambiguous, that Noah, saved by water, had a sort of
baptism. And this the Apostle mentions, that the likeness between him and us
might appear more evident. It has already been said that the design of this
clause is to shew that we ought not to be led away by wicked examples from the
fear of God, and the right way of salvation, and to mix with the world. This is
made evident in baptism, in which we are buried together with Christ, so that,
being dead to the world, and to the flesh, we may live to God. On this account,
he says that our baptism is an antitype
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnti&gt;tupon</font><font face="Palatino">)
to the baptism of Noah, not that Noah&#8217;s baptism was the first pattern, and
ours an inferior figure, as the word is taken in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
where the ceremonies of the law are said to be antitypes of heavenly things,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580904&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
9:4.) Greek writers apply the same word to sacraments, so that, when they speak
of the mystical bread of the holy Supper, they call it the antitype. But here
there is no comparison made between the greater and the less; the Apostle only
means that there is a likeness, and as they commonly say, a correspondence.
Perhaps it might more properly be said to be correspondency,
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnti&gt;strofon</font><font face="Palatino">,)
as Aristotle makes Dialectics to be the antistroph&egrave; of Rhetoric. But we
need not labor about words, when there is an agreement about the thing itself.
As Noah, then, obtained life through death, when in the ark, he was enclosed not
otherwise than as it were in the grave, and when the whole world perished, he
was preserved together with his small family; so at this day, the death which is
set forth in baptism, is to us an entrance into life, nor can salvation be hoped
for, except we be separated from the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not the putting away of the filth
of the flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This was added, because it
might be that the greatest part of men would profess the name of Christ; and so
it is with us, almost all are introduced into the church by baptism. Thus, what
he had said before would not be appropriate, that few at this day are saved by
baptism, as God saved only eight by the ark. This objection Peter anticipates,
when he testifies that he speaks not of the naked sign, but that the effect must
also be connected with it, as though he had said, that what happened in the age
of Noah would always be the case, that mankind would rush on to their own
destruction, but that the Lord would in a wonderful way deliver His very small
flock.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see what this connection means; for some one
might object and say, &#8220;Our baptism is widely different from that of Noah,
for it happens that most are at this day baptized.&#8221; To this he replies,
that the external symbol is not sufficient, except baptism be received really
and effectually: and the reality of it will be found only in a few. It hence
follows that we ought carefully to see how men commonly act when we rely on
examples, and that we ought not to fear though we may be few in
number.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the fanatics, such as Schuencfeldius, absurdly
pervert this testimony, while they seek to take away from sacraments all their
power and effect. For Peter did not mean here to teach that Christ&#8217;s
institution is vain and inefficacious, but only to exclude hypocrites from the
hope of salvation, who, as far as they can, deprave and corrupt baptism.
Moreover, when we speak of sacraments, two things are to be considered, the sign
and the thing itself. In baptism the sign is water, but the thing is the washing
of the soul by the blood of Christ and the mortifying of the flesh. The
institution of Christ includes these two things. Now that the sign appears often
inefficacious and fruitless, this happens through the abuse of men, which does
not take away the nature of the sacrament. Let us then learn not to tear away
the thing signified from the sign. We must at the same time beware of another
evil, such as prevails among the Papists; for as they distinguish not as they
ought between the thing and the sign, they stop at the outward element, and on
that fix their hope of salvation. Therefore the sight of the water takes away
their thoughts from the blood of Christ and the power of the Spirit. They do not
regard Christ as the only author of all the blessings therein offered to us;
they transfer the glory of his death to the water, they tie the secret power of
the Spirit to the visible sign.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What then ought we to do? Not to separate what has
been joined together by the Lord. We ought to acknowledge in baptism a spiritual
washing, we ought to embrace therein the testimony of the remission of sin and
the pledge of our renovation, and yet so as to leave to Christ his own honor,
and also to the Holy Spirit; so that no part of our salvation should be
transferred to the sign. Doubtless when Peter, having mentioned baptism,
immediately made this exception, that it is not the putting off of the filth of
the flesh, he sufficiently shewed that baptism to some is only the outward act,
and that the outward sign of itself avails nothing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the answer of a good
conscience</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The word <i>question, </i>or
questioning, is to be taken here for &#8220;answer,&#8221; or testimony. Now
Peter briefly defines the efficacy and use of baptism, when he calls attention
to conscience, and expressly requires that confidence which can sustain the
sight of God and can stand before his tribunal. For in these words he teaches us
that baptism in its main part is spiritual, and then that it includes the
remission of sins and renovation of the old man; for how can there be a good and
pure conscience until our old man is reformed, and we be renewed in the
righteousness of God? and how can we answer before God, unless we rely on and
are sustained by a gratuitous pardon of our sins? In short, Peter intended to
set forth the effect of baptism, that no one might glory in a naked and dead
sign, as hypocrites are wont to do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by the resurrection of Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By these words he teaches us
that we are not to cleave to the element of water, and that what is thereby
typified flows from Christ alone, and is to be sought from him. Moreover, by
referring to the resurrection, he has regard to the doctrine which he had taught
before, that Christ was vivified by the Spirit; for the resurrection was victory
over death and the completion of our salvation. We hence learn that the death of
Christ is not excluded, but is included in his resurrection. We then cannot
otherwise derive benefit from baptism, than by having all our thoughts fixed on
the death and the resurrection of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is on the right hand of
God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He recommends to us the ascension
of Christ unto heaven, lest our eyes should seek him in the world; and this
belongs especially to faith. He commends to our notice his session on the
Father&#8217;s right hand, lest we should doubt his power to save us. And what
his <i>sitting </i>at the right hand of the Father means, we have elsewhere
explained, that is, that Christ exercises supreme power everywhere as
God&#8217;s representative. And an explanation of this is what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>angels being made subject to
him;</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and he adds
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>powers</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>authorities</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>only for the sake of amplification, for angels are usually designated by
such words. It was then Peter&#8217;s object to set forth by these high titles
the sovereignty of Christ.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Forasmuch then as
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When he had before set forth
Christ before us, he only spoke of the suffering of the cross; for sometimes the
cross means mortification, because the outward man is wasted by afflictions, and
our flesh is also subdued. But he now ascends higher; for he speaks of the
reformation of the whole man. The Scripture recommends to us a twofold likeness
to the death of Christ, that we are to be conformed to him in reproaches and
troubles, and also that the old man being dead and extinct in us, we are to be
renewed to a spiritual life.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
3:10;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450604&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:4.) Yet Christ is not simply to be viewed as our example, when we speak of the
mortificaion of the flesh; but it is by his Spirit that we are really made
conformable to his death, so that it becomes effectual to the crucifying of our
flesh. In short, as Peter at the end of the last chapter exhorted us to patience
after the example of Christ, because death was to him a passage to life; so now
from the same death he deduces a higher doctrine, that we ought to die to the
flesh and to the world, as Paul teaches us more at large in the sixth chapter of
his Epistle to the Romans. He therefore says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>arm
yourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or be ye armed, intimating
that we are really and effectually supplied with invincible weapons to subdue
the flesh, if we partake as we ought of the efficacy of Christ&#8217;s
death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he that hath
suffered</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The particle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">o[ti</font><font face="Palatino">
does not, I think, denote here the cause, but is to be taken as explanatory; for
Peter sets forth what that thought or mind is with which Christ&#8217;s death
arms us, even that the dominion of sin ought to be abolished in us, so that God
may reign in our life. Erasmus has incorrectly, as I think, rendered the word
&#8220;he who did suffer,&#8221; (<i>patiebatur</i>) applying it to Christ. For
it is an indefinite sentence, which generally extends to all the godly, and has
the same meaning with the words of Paul in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450607&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:7,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;He who is dead is
justified or freed from sin;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">for both the Apostles intimate, that when we become
dead to the flesh, we have no more to do with sin, that it should reign in us,
and exercise its power in our life. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb44</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may, however, be objected, that Peter here speaks
unsuitably in making us to be conformable to Christ in this respect, that we
suffer in the flesh; for it is certain that there was nothing sinful in Christ
which required to be corrected. But the answer is obvious, that it is not
necessary that a comparison should correspond in all its parts. It is then
enough that we should in a measure be made conformable to the death of Christ.
In the same way is also explained, not unfitly, what Paul says, that we are
planted in the likeness of his death,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450605&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:5;) for the manner is not altogether the same, but that his death is become in
a manner the type and pattern of our mortification.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also notice that the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is put here twice, but in a different sense; for when he says that Christ
suffered in the flesh, he means that the human nature which Christ had taken
from us was made subject to death, that is, that Christ as a man naturally died.
In the second clause, which refers to us, <i>flesh </i>means the corruption, and
the sinfulness of our nature; and thus suffering in the flesh signifies the
denying of ourselves. We now see what is the likeness between Christ and us, and
what is the difference; that as he suffered in the flesh taken from us, so the
whole of our flesh ought to be crucified.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That he no
longer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here he sets forth the way of
ceasing from sin, that renouncing the covetings of men we should study to form
our life according to the will of God. And thus he includes here the two things
in which renovation consists, the destruction of the flesh and the vivification
of the spirit. The course of good living is thus to begin with the former, but
we are to advance to the latter.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, Peter defines here what is the rule of
right living, even when man depends on the will of God. It hence follows, that
nothing is right and well ordered in man&#8217;s life as soon as he wanders from
this rule. We ought further to notice the contrast between
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God&#8217;s
will</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>covetings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or lusts of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>men</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
We hence understand how great is our depravity, and how we ought to strive to
become obedient to God. When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the rest of time in the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>means the present life, as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
5:7.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the time past of our life
may suffice</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Peter does not mean that we
ought to be wearied with pleasures, as those are wont to be who are filled with
them to satiety; but that on the contrary the memory of our past life ought to
stimulate us to repentance. And doubtless it ought to be the sharpest goad to
make us run on well, when we recollect that we have been wandering from the
right way the greatest part of our life. And Peter reminds us, that it would be
most unreasonable were we not to change the course of our life after having been
enlightened by Christ. For he makes a distinction here between the time of
ignorance and the time of faith, as though he had said that it was but right
that they should become new and different men from the time that Christ had
called them. But instead of the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lusts</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or covetings of men, he now mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the will of the
Gentiles</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>by which he reproves the Jews
for having mixed with the Gentiles in all their pollutions, though the Lord had
separated them from the Gentiles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In what follows he shews that those vices ought to be
put off which prove men to be blind and ignorant of God. And there is a peculiar
emphasis in the words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the time
past of our life</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for he intimates that
we ought to persevere to the end, as when Paul says, that Christ was raised from
the dead, to die no more.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
6:6.) For we have been redeemed by the Lord for this end, that we may serve him
all the days of our life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
lasciviousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He does not give the
whole catalogue of sins, but only mentions some of them, by which we may briefly
learn what those things are which men, not renewed by God&#8217;s Spirit, desire
and seek, and to which they are inclined. And he names the grosser vices, as it
is usually done when examples are adduced. I shall not stop to explain the
words, for there is no difficulty in them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a question arises, that Peter seems to have
done wrong to many, in making all men guilty of lasciviousness, dissipation,
lusts, drunkenness, and revellings; for it is certain that all were not involved
in these vices; nay, we know that some among the Gentiles lived honourably and
without a spot of infamy. To this I reply, that Peter does not so ascribe these
vices to the Gentiles, as though he charged every individual with all these, but
that we are by nature inclined to all these evils, and not only so, but that we
are so much under the power of depravity, that these fruits which he mentions
necessarily proceed from it as from an evil root. There is indeed no one who has
not within him the seed of all vices, but all do not germinate and grow up in
every individual. Yet the contagion is so spread and diffused through the whole
human race, that the whole community appears infected with innumerable evils,
and that no member is free or pure from the common corruption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The last clause may also suggest another question,
for Peter addressed the Jews, and yet he says that they had been immersed in
abominable idolatries; but the Jews then living in every part of the world
carefully abstained from idols. A twofold answer may be adduced here, either
that by mentioning the whole for a part, he declares of all what belonged to a
few, (for there is no doubt but the Churches to which he wrote were made up of
Gentiles as well as of Jews,) or that he calls those superstitions in which the
Jews were then involved, idolatries; for though they professed to worship the
God of Israel, yet we know that no part of divine worship was genuine among
them. And how great must have been the confusion in barbarous countries and
among a scattered people, when Jerusalem itself, from whose rays they borrowed
their light, had fallen into extreme impiety! for we know that dotages of every
kind prevailed with impunity, so that the high-priesthood, and the whole
government of the Church, were in the power of the Sadducees.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherein they think it
strange</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>The words of Peter literally
are these, &#8220;In which they are strangers, you not running with them into
the same excess of riot, blaspheming.&#8221; But the word, to be strangers,
means to stop at a thing as new and unusual. This is a way of speaking which the
Latins also sometimes use, as when Cicero says that he was a stranger in the
city, because he knew not what was carried on there. But in this place, Peter
fortifies the faithful, lest they should suffer themselves to be disturbed or
corrupted by the perverse judgments or words of the ungodly. For it is no light
temptation, when they among whom we live, charge us that our life is different
from that of mankind in general. &#8220;These,&#8221; they say, &#8220;must form
for themselves a new world, for they differ from all mankind.&#8221; Thus they
accuse the children of God, as though they attempted a separation from the whole
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Apostle anticipated this, and forbade the
faithful to be discouraged by such reproaches and calumnies; and he proposed to
them, as a support, the judgment of God: for this it is that can sustain us
against all assaults, that is, when we patiently wait for that day, in which
Christ will punish all those who now presumptuously condemn us, and will shew
that we and our cause are approved by Him. And he expressly mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the living and the
dead</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>lest we should think that we shall
suffer any loss, if they remain alive when we are dead; for they shall not, for
this reason, escape the hand of God. And in what sense he calls them the living
and the dead, we may learn from the fifteenth chapter of the first Epistle to
the Corinthians.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this cause was the gospel
preached also to them that are dead</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or,
He has been evangelized to the dead. We see in what sense he takes the former
passage in the third chapter, even that death does not hinder Christ from being
always our defender. It is then a remarkable consolation to the godly, that
death itself brings no loss to their salvation. Though Christ, then, may not
appear a deliverer in this life, yet his redemption is not void, or without
effect; for his power extends to the dead. But as the Greek word is doubtful, it
may be rendered in the masculine, or in the neuter gender; but the meaning is
almost the same, that is, that Christ had been made known as a redeemer to the
dead, or that salvation had been made known to them by the gospel. But if the
grace of Christ once penetrated to the dead, there is no doubt but that we shall
partake of it when dead. We then set for it limits much too narrow, if we
confine it to the present life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they might be
judged</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>I omit the explanations of
others, for they seem to me to be very remote from the Apostle&#8217;s meaning.
This has been said, as I think, by way of anticipation, for it might have been
objected, that the gospel is of no benefit to the dead, as it does not restore
them to life. Peter concedes a part of this objection, and yet in such a way,
that they are not deprived of the salvation obtained by Christ. Therefore, in
the first clause, when he says, &#8220;that they might be judged in the flesh,
according to men,&#8221; it is a concession; and &#8220;judged&#8221; means
here, as often elsewhere, condemned; and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is the outward man. So that the meaning is, that though according to the
estimation of the world the dead suffer destruction in their flesh, and are
deemed condemned as to the outward man, yet they cease not to live with God, and
that in their spirit, because Christ quickens them by his
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we ought to add what Paul teaches us in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450810&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:10, that the Spirit is life; and hence it will be, that he will at length
absorb the relics of death which still cleave to us. The sum of what he says is,
that though the condition of the dead in the flesh is worse, according to man,
yet it is enough that the Spirit of Christ revives them, and will eventually
lead them to the perfection of life.

things is at hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Though the faithful
hear that their felicity is elsewhere than in the world, yet, as they think that
they should live long, this false thought renders them careless, and even
slothful, so that they direct not their thoughts to the kingdom of God. Hence
the Apostle, that he might rouse them from the drowsiness of the flesh, reminds
them that the end of all things was nigh; by which he intimates that we ought
not to sit still in the world, from which we must soon remove. He does not, at
the same time, speak only of the end of individuals, but of the universal
renovation of the world; as though he had said, &#8220;Christ will shortly come,
who will put an end to all things.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, then, no wonder that the cares of this world
overwhelm us, and make us drowsy, if the view of present things dazzles our
eyes: for we promise, almost all of us, an eternity to ourselves in this world;
at least, the end never comes to our mind. But were the trumpet of Christ to
sound in our ears, it would powerfully rouse us and not suffer us to lie
torpid.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be objected and said, that a long series
of ages has passed away since Peter wrote this, and yet that the end is not
come. My reply to this is, that the time seems long to us, because we measure
its length by the spaces of this fleeting life; but if we could understand the
perpetuity of future life, many ages would appear to us like a moment, as Peter
will also tell us in his second epistle. Besides, we must remember this
principle, that from the time when Christ once appeared, there is nothing left
for the faithful, but with suspended minds ever to look forward to his second
coming.

<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>watchfulness </i>and the <i>sobriety </i>to

The words are similar to those of Christ:</font><br></div>

know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of Man cometh.&#8221;

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prayer</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he points out an exercise especially necessary, in which the faithful ought
to be particularly occupied, since their whole strength depends on the Lord; as
though he had said, <i>&#8220;Since </i>ye are in yourselves extremely weak,
seek of the Lord to strengthen you.&#8221; He yet reminds them that they were to
pray earnestly, not formally.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8<i>.</i></b><i>

the first thing, for it is the bond of perfection. And he bids it to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fervent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or intense, or vehement, which is the same thing; for whosoever is
immoderately fervent in self-love, loves others coldly. And he commends it on
account of its fruit, because it buries innumerable sins, than which nothing is
more desirable. But the sentence is taken from Solomon, whose words are found in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;201012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
10:12,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Hatred discovers
reproaches, but love covers a multitude of sins.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What Solomon meant is sufficiently clear, for the two
clauses contain things which are set in contrast the one with the other. As then
he says in the first clause that hatred is the cause why men traduce and defame
one another, and spread whatever is reproachful and dishonorable; so it follows
that a contrary effect is ascribed to love, that is, that men who love one
another, kindly and courteously forgive one another; hence it comes that,
willingly burying each other&#8217;s vices, one seeks to preserve the honor of
another. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb47</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus Peter confirms his exhortation, that nothing is more necessary than to
cherish mutual love. For who is there that has not many faults? Therefore all
stand in need of forgiveness, and there is no one who does not wish to be
forgiven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This singular benefit love brings to us when it
exists among us, so that innumerable evils are covered in oblivion. On the other
hand, where loose reins are given to hatred, men by mutual biting and tearing
must necessarily consume one another, as Paul says
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480515&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
5:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it ought to be noticed that Solomon does not say
that only a few sins are covered, but a multitude of sins, according to what
Christ declares, when he bids us to forgive our brethren seventy times seven,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;401822&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
18:22.) But the more sins love covers, the more evident appears its usefulness
for the wellbeing of mankind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the plain meaning of the words. It hence
appears how absurd are the Papists, who seek to elicit from this passage their
own satisfactions, as though almsgiving and other duties of charity were a sort
of a compensation to God for blotting out their sins.

the duties of love. At that time hospitality was commonly used, and it was

then bids them mutually to exercise it, so that no one might require more from
others than what he himself was prepared to render. He adds,

murmurings</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>for it is a rare example
that one spends himself and his own on his neighbor without any disparaging
reflection. Then the Apostle would have us to show kindness willingly and with a
cheerful mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As every one hath
received</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He reminds us what we ought to
bear in mind when we do good to our neighbors; for nothing is more fitted to
correct our murmurings than to remember that we do not give our own, but only
dispense what God has committed to us. When therefore he says, &#8220;Minister
the gift which every one has received,&#8221; he intimates that to each had been
distributed what they had, on this condition, that in helping their brethren
they might be the ministers of God. And thus the second clause is an explanation
of the first, for instead of ministry he mentions stewardship; and for what he
had said, &#8220;as every one hath received the gift,&#8221; he mentions the
manifold graces which God variously distributes to us, so that each might confer
in common his own portion. If then we excel others in any gift, let us remember
that we are as to this the stewards of God, in order that we may kindly impart
it to our neighbors as their necessity or benefit may require. Thus we ought to
be disposed and ready to communicate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this consideration is also very important, that
the Lord hath so divided his manifold graces, that no one is to be content with
one thing and with his own gifts, but every one has need of the help and aid of
his brother. This, I say, is a bond which God hath appointed for retaining
friendship among men, for they cannot live without mutual assistance. Thus it
happens, that he who in many things seeks the aid of his brethren, ought to
communicate to them more freely what he has received. This bond of unity has
been observed and noticed by heathens. But Peter teaches us here that God had
designedly done this, that he might bind men one to another.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any man
speak</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As he had spoken of the right and
faithful use of gifts, he specifies two things as examples, and he has chosen
those which are the most
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>excellent</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or the most renowned. The office of teaching in the Church is a remarkable
instance of God&#8217;s favor. He then expressly commands those called to this
office to act faithfully; though he does not speak here only of what we owe to
men, but also of what we owe to God, so that we may not deprive him of his
glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He who speaks, then, that is, who is rightly
appointed by public authority,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>let him speak as the oracles of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>; </i>that is, let him reverently in
God&#8217;s fear and in sincerity perform the charge committed to him, regarding
himself as engaged in God&#8217;s work, and as ministering God&#8217;s word and
not his own. For he still refers to the doctrine, that when we confer any thing
on the brethren, we minister to them by God&#8217;s command what he has bestowed
on us for that purpose. And truly, were all those who profess to be teachers in
the Church duly to consider this one thing, there would be in them much more
fidelity and devotedness. For how great a thing is this, that in teaching the
oracles of God, they are representatives of Christ! Hence then comes so much
carelessness and rashness, because the sacred majesty of God&#8217;s word is not
borne in mind but by a few; and so they indulge themselves as in a worldly
stewardship.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the meantime, we learn from these words of Peter,
that it is not lawful for those who are engaged in teaching to do anything else,
but faithfully to deliver to others, as from hand to hand, the doctrine received
from God; for he forbids any one to go forth, except he who is instructed in
God&#8217;s word, and who proclaims infallible oracles as it were from his
mouth. He, therefore, leaves no room for human inventions; for he briefly
defines the doctrine which ought to be taught in the Church. Nor is the particle
of similitude introduced here for the purpose of modifying the sentence, as
though it were sufficient to profess that it is God&#8217;s word that is taught.
This was, indeed, commonly the case formerly with false prophets; and we see at
this day how arrogantly the Pope and his followers cover with this pretense all
their impious traditions. But Peter did not intend to teach pastors such
hypocrisy as this, to pretend that they had from God whatever doctrine it
pleased them to announce, but, he took an argument from the subject itself, that
he might exhort them to sobriety and meekness, to a reverence for God, and to an
earnest attention to their work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any man
minister</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This second clause extends
wider, it includes the office of teaching. But as it would have been too long to
enumerate each of the ministerial works, he preferred summarily to speak of them
all together, as though he had said, &#8220;Whatever part of the burden thou
bearest in the Church, know that thou canst do nothing but what has been given
time by the Lord, and that thou art nothing else but an instrument of God: take
heed, then, not to abuse the grace of God by exalting thyself; take heed not to
suppress the power of God, which puts forth and manifests itself in the ministry
for the salvation of the brethren.&#8221; Let him then minister
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as by God&#8217;s
power</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that is, let him regard nothing
as his own, but let him humbly render service to God and his
Church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That God in all things may be
glorified</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>the word may be in the masculine or
in the neuter gender; and thus men or gifts may be meant, and both meanings are
equally suitable. The sense is, that God does not adorn us with his gifts, that
he may rob himself and make himself as it were an empty idol by transferring to
us his own glory, but that, on the contrary, his own glory may everywhere shine
forth; and that it is therefore a sacrilegious profanation of God&#8217;s gifts
when men propose to themselves any other object than to glorify God. He says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>because whatever power we have
to minister, he alone bestows it on us; for he is the head, with which the whole
body is connected by joints and bindings, and maketh increase in the Lord,
according as he supplieth strength to every member.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To whom be
praise</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or glory. Some refer this to
Christ; but the context requires that it should be rather applied to God; for he
confirms the last exhortation, because God justly claims all the glory; and,
therefore, men wickedly take away from him what is his own, when they obscure in
anything, or in any part, his glory.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Beloved, think it not
strange</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, wonder not. There is a
frequent mention made in this Epistle of afflictions; the cause of which we have
elsewhere explained. But this difference is to be observed, that when he exhorts
the faithful to patience, he sometimes speaks generally of troubles common to
man&#8217;s life; but here he speaks of wrongs done to the faithful for the name
of Christ. And first, indeed, he reminded them that they ought not to have
deemed it strange as for a thing sudden and unexpected; by which he intimates,
that they ought by a long mediation to have been previously prepared to bear the
cross. For whosoever has resolved to fight under Christ&#8217;s banner, will not
be dismayed when persecution happens, but, as one accustomed to it, will
patiently bear it. That we may then be in a prepared state of mind when the
waves of persecutions roll over us, we ought in due time to habituate ourselves
to such an event by meditating continually on the cross.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, he proves that the cross is useful to us by
two arguments, &#8212; that God thus tries our faith, &#8212; and that we become
thus partakers with Christ. Then, in the first place, let us remember that the
trial of our faith is most necessary, and that we ought thus willingly to obey
God who provides for our salvation. However, the chief consolation is to be
derived from a fellowship with Christ. Hence Peter not only forbids us to think
it strange, when he sets this before us, but also bids us to rejoice. It is,
indeed, a cause of joy, when God tries our faith by persecution; but the other
joy far surpasses it, that is, when the Son of God allots to us the same course
of life with himself, that he might lead us with himself to a blessed
participation of heavenly glory. For we must bear in mind this truth, that we
have the dying of Christ in our flesh, that his life may be manifested in us.
The wicked also do indeed bear many afflictions; but as they are separated from
Christ, they apprehend nothing but God&#8217;s wrath and curse: thus it comes
that sorrow and dread overwhelm them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence, then, is the whole consolation of the godly,
that they are associates with Christ, that hereafter they may be partakers of
his glory; for we are always to bear in mind this transition from the cross to
the resurrection. But as this world is like a labyrinth, in which no end of
evils appears, Peter refers to the future revelation of Christ&#8217;s glory, as
though he had said, that the day of its revelation is not to be overlooked, but
ought to be expected. But he mentions a twofold joy, one which we now enjoy in
hope, and the other the full fruition of which the coming of Christ shall bring
to us; for the first is mingled with grief and sorrow, the second is connected
with exultation. For it is not suitable in the midst of afflictions to think of
joy, which can free us from all trouble; but the consolations of God moderate
evils, so that we can rejoice at the same time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b><i>.
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If ye be
reproached</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He mentions reproaches,
because there is often more bitterness in them than in the loss of goods, or in
the torments or agonies of the body; there is therefore nothing which is more
grievous to ingenuous minds. For we see that many who are strong to bear want,
courageous ill torments, nay, bold to meet death, do yet succumb under reproach.
To obviate this evil, Peter pronounces those blessed, according to what Christ
says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;410835&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Mark
8:35,) who are reproached for the sake of the Gospel. This is very contrary to
what men commonly think and feel; but he gives a reason,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because the Spirit of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>called also the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit of glory,
rests</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>on them. Some read the words
separately, &#8220;that which belongs to glory,&#8221; as though the words were,
<i>&#8220;</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>glory</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and the Spirit of God.&#8221; But the former reading is more suitable as to
the sense, and, as to language, more simple. Then Peter shews, that it is no
hindrance to the happiness of the godly, that they sustain reproach for the name
of Christ, because they nevertheless retain a complete glory in the sight of
God, while the Spirit, who has glory ever connected with him, dwells in them.
So, what seems to the flesh a paradox, the Spirit of God makes consistent by a
sure perception in their minds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On their
part</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This is a confirmation of the last
sentence; for he intimates that it is enough for the godly, that the Spirit of
God testifies that the reproaches endured for the sake of the Gospel, are
blessed and full of glory. The wicked, however, attempted to effect a far
different object; as though he had said, &#8220;Ye can boldly despise the
insolence of the ungodly, because the testimony respecting your glory, which
God&#8217;s Spirit gives you, remains fixed within.&#8221; And he says that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of God was reproached, because the unbelieving expose to ridicule whatever
he suggests and dictates for our consolation. But this is by anticipation; for
however the world in its blindness may see nothing but what is disgraceful in
the reproaches of Christ, he would not have the eyes of the godly to be dazzled
with this false opinion; but on the contrary they ought to look up to God. Thus
he does not conceal what men commonly think; but he sets the hidden perception
of faith, which God&#8217;s children possess in their own hearts, in opposition
to their presumption and insolence. Thus Paul boasted that he had the marks of
Christ, and he gloried in his bonds.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480617&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
6:17.) He had at the same time sufficiently found out what was the judgment
formed of them by the world; and yet he intimates that it thought foolishly, and
that those are blind together with the world, who esteem the slanders of the
flesh glorious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

let one of you</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Here also he anticipates
an objection. He had exhorted the faithful to patience, if it happened to them
to be persecuted for the cause of Christ; he now adds the reason why he had only
spoken of that kind of trouble, even because they ought to have abstained from
all evil-doing. Here, then, is contained another exhortation, lest they should
do anything for which they might seem to be justly punished. Therefore the
causal particle is not, here superfluous, since the Apostle wished to give a
reason why he so much exhorted the faithful to a fellowship with the sufferings
of Christ, and at the same time to remind them by the way to live justly and
harmlessly, lest they should bring on themselves a just punishment through their
own faults; as though he had said, that it behoved Christians to deserve well of
all, even when they were badly and cruelly treated by the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any one to object and say, that no one can be
found to be so innocent but that he deserves for many faults to be chastised by
God; to this I reply, that Peter here speaks of sins from which we ought to be
entirely freed, such as thefts and murders; and I give further this reply, that
the Apostle commands Christians to be such as they ought to be. It, is, then, no
wonder, that he points out a difference between us and the children of this
world, who being without God&#8217;s Spirit, abandon themselves to every kind of
wickedness. He would not have God&#8217;s children to be in the same condition,
so as to draw on themselves by a wicked life the punishment allotted by the
laws. But we have already said elsewhere, that though there are always many sins
in the elect, which God might justly punish, yet according to his paternal
indulgence he spares his own children, so that he does not inflict the
punishment they deserve, and that in the meantime, for honour&#8217;s sake, he
adorns them with his own tokens and those of his Christ, when he suffers them to
be afflicted for the testimony of the Gospel.</font><br></div>

if</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>any man suffer
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as a
Christian</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>After having forbidden the
Christians to do any hurt or harm, lest for their evil deeds, like the
unbelieving, they should become hateful to the world, he now bids them to give
thanks to God, if they suffered persecutions for the name of Christ. And truly
it is no common kindness from God, that he calls us, freed and exempted from the
common punishment of our sins, to so honorable a warfare as to undergo for the
testimony of his Gospel either exiles, or prisons, or reproaches, or even death
itself. Then he intimates that those are ungrateful to God, who clamor or murmur
on account of persecutions, as though they were unworthily dealt with, since on
the contrary they ought to regard it as gain and to acknowledge God&#8217;s
favor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as a
Christian</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he regards not so much the
name as the cause. It is certain that the adversaries of Christ omitted nothing
in order to degrade the Gospel. Therefore, whatever reproachful words they made
use of, it was enough for the faithful, that they suffered for nothing else but
for the defense of the Gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On this
behalf</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, In this respect. For since
all afflictions derive their origin from sin, this thought ought to occur to the
godly, &#8220;I am indeed worthy to be visited by the Lord with this and even
with greater punishment for my sins; but now he would have me to suffer for
righteousness, as though I were innocent.&#8221; For how much soever the saints
may acknowledge their own faults, yet as in persecutions they regard a different
end, such as the Lord sets before them, they feel that their guilt is blotted
out and abolished before God. </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On
this behalf</i></font><font face="Palatino">, then, they have reason to glorify
God.</font><br></div>

He amplifies the consolation, which the goodness of the cause for which we
suffer brings to us, while we are afflicted for the name of Christ. For this
necessity, he says, awaits the whole Church of God, not only to be subject to
the common miseries of men, but especially and mainly to be chastised by the
hand of God. Then, with more submission, ought persecutions for Christ to be
endured. For except we desire to be blotted out from the number of the faithful,
we must submit our backs to the scourges of God. Now, it is a sweet consolation,
that God does not execute his judgments on us as on others, but that he makes us
the representatives of his own Son, when we do not suffer except for his cause
and for his name.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, Peter took this sentence from the common
and constant teaching of Scripture; and this seems more probable to me than that
a certain passage, as some think, is referred to. It was formerly usual with the
Lord, as all the prophets witness, to exhibit the first examples of his
chastisements in his own people, as the head of a family corrects his own
children rather than those of strangers.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;231012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
10:12.) For though God is the judge of the whole world, yet he would have his
providence to be especially acknowledged in the government of his own Church.
Hence, when he declares that he would rise up to be the judge of the whole
world, he adds that this would be after he had completed his work on Mount Sion.
He indeed puts forth his hand indifferently against his own people and against
strangers; for we see that both are in common subjected to adversities; and if a
comparison be made, he seems in a manner to spare the reprobate, and to be
severe towards the elect. Hence the complaints of the godly, that the wicked
pass their life in continual pleasures, and delight themselves with wine and the
harp, and at length descend without pains in an instant into the grave &#8212;
that fatness covers their eyes &#8212; that they are exempt from troubles
&#8212; that they securely and joyfully spend their life, looking down with
contempt on others, so that they dare to set their mouth against heaven.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;182113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Job
21:13;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;197303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
73:3-9.) In short, God so regulates his judgments in this world, that he fattens
the wicked for the day of slaughter. He therefore passes by their many sins,
and, as it were, connives at them. In the meantime, he restores by corrections
his own children, for whom he has a <i>care, </i>to the right way, whenever they
depart from it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this sense it is that Peter says that judgment
begins at the house of God; for judgment includes all those punishments which
the Lord inflicts on men for their sins, and whatever refers to the reformation
of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why does he say that it was
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>now the
time</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>? </i>He means, as I think, what the
prophets declare concerning his own time, that it especially belonged to
Christ&#8217;s kingdom, that the beginning of the reformation should be in the
Church. Hence Paul says that Christians, without the hope of a resurrection,
would of all men be the most miserable,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461519&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:19;) and justly so, because, while others indulge themselves
without fear, the faithful continually sigh and groan; while God connives at the
sins of others, and suffers them to continue torpid, he deals rigidly with his
own people, and subjects them to the discipline of the cross.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">When the faithful see that it is well with the
wicked, they are necessarily tempted to be envious; and this is a very dangerous
trial; for present happiness is what all desire. Hence the Spirit of God
carefully dwells on this, in many places, as well as in the thirty-seventh
Psalm, lest the faithful should envy the prosperity of the ungodly. The same is
what Peter speaks of, for he shews that afflictions ought to be calmly borne by
the children of God, when they compare the lot of others with their own. But he
takes it as granted that God is the judge of the world, and that, therefore, no
one can escape his hand with impunity. He hence infers, that a dreadful
vengeance will soon overtake those whose condition seems now favorable. The
design of what he says, as I have already stated, is to shew that the children
of God should not faint under the bitterness of present evils, but that they
ought, on the contrary, calmly to bear their afflictions for a short time, as
the issue will be salvation, while the ungodly will have to exchange a fading
and fleeting prosperity for eternal perdition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the argument is from the less to the greater; for
if God spares not his own children whom he loves and who obey him, how dreadful
will be his severity against enemies and such as are rebellious! There is, then,
nothing better than to obey the Gospel, so that God may kindly correct us by his
paternal hand for our salvation.</font><br></div>

repeated a common and a proverbial saying, (which seems to me more probable,) 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb51</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
the meaning is, that God&#8217;s judgment would be dreadful against the ungodly,
since the way to salvation was so thorny and difficult to the elect. And this is
said, lest we should securely indulge ourselves, but carefully proceed in our
course, and lest we should also seek the smooth and easy road, the end of which
is a terrible precipice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when he says, that a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>righteous man is scarcely
saved</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he refers to the difficulties of
the present life, for our course in the world is like a dangerous sailing
between many rocks, and exposed to many storms and tempests; and thus no one
arrives at the port, except he who has escaped from thousand deaths. It is in
the meantime certain that we are guided by God&#8217;s hand, and that we are in
no danger of shipwreck as long as we have him as our pilot.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Absurd, then, are those interpreters who think that
we shall be hardly and with difficulty saved, when we shall come before God in
judgment; for it is the present and not the future time that Peter refers to;
nor does he speak of God&#8217;s strictness or rigour, but shews how many and
what arduous difficulties must be surmounted by the Christian before he reaches
the goal.

persecutions ought to be submissively endured, for the condition of the godly in
them is much happier than that of the unbelieving, who enjoy prosperity to their
utmost wishes. He, however, reminds us that we suffer nothing except according
to the permission of God, which tends much to comfort us; when he says,

means both; but the former meaning I prefer, for by bidding us to deposit our
life with God, he makes him its safe keeper. He adds,

retaliate the wrongs done to them, but that they might on the contrary contend

<div><font face="Palatino">IN exhorting pastors to their duty, he points out
especially three vices which are found to prevail much, even sloth, desire of
gain, and lust for power. In opposition to the first vice he sets alacrity or a
willing attention; to the second, liberality; to the third, moderation and
meekness, by which they are to keep themselves in their own rank or
station.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that pastors ought not to exercise care
over the flock of the Lord, as far only as they are constrained; for they who
seek to do no more than what constraint compels them, do their work formally and
negligently. Hence he would have them to do willingly what they do, as those who
are really devoted to their work. To correct avarice, he bids them to perform
their office with a ready mind; for whosoever has not this end in view, to spend
himself and his labor disinterestedly and gladly in behalf of the Church, is not
a minister of Christ, but a slave to his own stomach and his purse. The third
vice which he condemns is a lust for exercising power or dominion. But it may be
asked, what kind of power does he mean? This, as it seems to me, may be gathered
from the opposite clause, in which he bids them to be examples to the flock. It
is the same as though he had said that they are to preside for this end, to be
eminent in holiness, which cannot be, except they humbly subject themselves and
their life to the same common rule. What stands opposed to this virtue is
tyrannical pride, when the pastor exempts himself from all subjection, and
tyrannizes over the Church. It was for this that Ezekiel condemned the false
prophets, that is, that they ruled cruelly and tyrannically.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;263404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ezekiel
34:4.) Christ also condemned the Pharisees, because they laid intolerable
burdens on the shoulders of the people which they would not touch, no, not with
a finger.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402304&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:4.) This imperious rigour, then, which ungodly pastors exercise over the
Church, cannot be corrected, except their authority be restrained, so that they
may rule in such a way as to afford an example of a godly life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
elders</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>By this name he designates
pastors and all those who are appointed for the government of the Church. But
they called them presbyters or elders for honor&#8217;s sake, not because they
were all old in age, but because they were principally chosen from the aged, for
old age for the most part has more prudence, gravity, and experience. But as
sometimes hoariness is not wisdom, according to a Greek proverb, and as young
men are found more fit, such as Timothy, these were also usually called
presbyters, after having been chosen into that order. Since Peter calls himself
in like manner a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>presbyter</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>it appears that it was a common name, which is still more evident from many
other passages. Moreover, by this title he secured for himself more authority,
as though he had said that he had a right to admonish pastors, because he was
one of themselves, for there ought to be mutual liberty between colleagues. But
if he had the right of primacy he would have claimed it; and this would have
been most suitable on the present occasion. But though he was an Apostle, he yet
knew that authority was by no means delegated to him over his colleagues, but
that on the contrary he was joined with the rest in the participation of the
same office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A witness of the sufferings of
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This may be explained of
doctrine, yet I prefer to regard it as referring to his own life. At the same
time both may be admitted; but I am more disposed to embrace the latter view,
because these two clauses will be more in harmony, &#8212; that Peter speaks of
the sufferings of Christ in his own flesh, and that he would be also a partaker
of his glory. For the passage agrees with that of Paul, &#8220;If we suffer
together, we shall also reign together.&#8221; Besides, it avails much to make
us believe his words, that he gave a proof of his faith by enduring the cross.
For it hence appears evident that he spoke in earnest; and the Lord, by thus
proving his people, seals as it were their ministry, that it might have more
honor and reverence among men. Peter, then, had probably this in view, so that
he might be heard as the faithful minister of Christ, a proof of which he gave
in the persecutions he had suffered, and in the hope which he had of future
life. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb53</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must observe that Peter confidently declares
that he would be a partaker of that glory which was not yet revealed; for it is
the character of faith to acquiesce in hidden blessings.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Feed the flock of

presbyter imports, even that it includes the office of feeding. It is for a far
different end that the Pope makes presbyters, even that they may daily slay
Christ, there being no mention made of feeding in their ordination. Let us then
remember to distinguish between the institution of Christ and the confusion of
the Pope, it being as different as light is from darkness. Let us also bear in
mind the definition given of the word; for the flock of Christ cannot be fed
except with pure doctrine, which is alone our spiritual food.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpiskopou~ntev</font><font face="Palatino">
I doubt not but that Peter meant to set forth the office and title of the
episcopate. We may learn also from other parts of Scripture that these two
names, bishop and presbyter, are synonymous. He then shews how they were rightly
to perform the pastoral office, though the word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpiskopei~n</font><font face="Palatino">
generally means to preside or to oversee. What I have rendered &#8220;not
constraintally,&#8221; is literally, &#8220;not necessarily;&#8221; for when we
act according to what necessity prescribes, we proceed in our work slowly and
frigidly, as it were by constraint.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither as being
lords</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, as exercising dominion. The
preposition kata in Greek is taken, for the most part, in a bad sense: then
Peter here condemns unreasonable exercise of power, as the case is with those
who consider not themselves to be the ministers of Christ and his Church, but
seek something higher. And he calls particular churches &#8220;lots,&#8221;
(<i>cleros;</i>)<i> </i>for as the whole body of the Church is the Lord&#8217;s
heritage, so the churches, scattered through towns and villages, were as so many
farms, the culture of which he assigns to each presbyter. Some very ignorantly
think that those called clergy are meant here. It was, indeed, an ancient way of
speaking, to call the whole order of ministers, clergy; but I wish that it had
never occurred to the Fathers to speak thus; for what Scripture ascribes in
common to the whole Church, it was by no means right to confine to a few men.
And this way of speaking was spurious, at least it was a departure from
apostolic usage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Peter, indeed, expressly gives the churches this
title, in order that we may know that whatever men ascribe to themselves is
taken away from the Lord, as in many places he calls the Church his peculiar
treasure, and the rod of his heritage, when he intends to claim his entire
dominion over it; for he never delivers to pastors the government, but only the
care, so that his own right remains still complete.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When the chief Shepherd shall
appear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Except pastors retain this end
in view, it can by no means be that they will in good earnest proceed in the
course of their calling, but will, on the contrary, become often faint; for
there are innumerable hindrances which are sufficient to discourage the most
prudent. They have often to do with ungrateful men, from whom they receive an
unworthy reward; long and great labors are often in vain; Satan sometimes
prevails in his wicked devices. Lest, then, the faithful servant of Christ
should be broken down, there is for him one and only one remedy, &#8212; to turn
his eyes to the coming of Christ. Thus it will be, that he, who seems to derive
no encouragement from men, will assiduously go on in his labors, knowing that a
great reward is prepared for him by the Lord. And further, lest a protracted
expectation should produce languor, he at the same time sets forth the greatness
of the reward, which is sufficient to compensate for all delay:
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>An unfading crown of

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>elder</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is put here in a sense different from what it had before; for it is
necessary, when a contrast is made between them and the younger, that the two
clauses should correspond. Then he refers to the elders in age, having before
spoken of the office; and thus he comes from the particular to the general. And
in short, he bids every one that is inferior in age to obey the counsels of the
elders, and to be teachable and humble; for the age of youth is inconstant, and
requires a bridle. Besides, pastors could not have performed their duty, except
this reverential feeling prevailed and was cultivated, so that the younger
suffered themselves to be ruled; for if there be no subjection, government is
overturned. When they have no authority who ought by right or order of nature to
rule, all will immediately become insolently wanton.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea,
all</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He shews the reason why the younger
ought to submit to the elder, even that there might be an equable state of
things and due order among them. For, when authority is granted to the elders,
there is not given them the right or the liberty of throwing off the bridle, but
they are also themselves to be under due restraint, so that there may be a
mutual subjection. So the husband is the head of the wife, and yet he in his
turn is to be in some things subject to her. So the father has authority over
his children, and still he is not exempt from all subjection, but something is
due to them. The same thing, also, is to be thought of others. In short, all
ranks in society have to defend the whole body, which cannot be done, except all
the members are joined together by the bond of mutual subjection. Nothing is
more adverse to the disposition of man than subjection. For it was formerly very
truly said, that every one has within him the soul of a king. Until, then, the
high spirits, with which the nature of men swells, are subdued, no man will give
way to another; but, on the contrary, each one, despising others, will claim all
things for himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence the Apostle, in order that humility may dwell
among us, wisely reproves this haughtiness and pride. And the metaphor he uses
is very appropriate, as though he had said, &#8220;Surround yourselves with
humility on every side, as with a garment which covers the whole body.&#8221; He
yet intimates that no ornament is more beautiful or more becoming, than when we
submit one to another.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>or, because. It is a most grievous threatening, when he says, that all who
seek to elevate themselves, shall have God as their enemy, who will lay them
low. But, on the contrary, he says of the humble, that God will be propitious
and favorable to them. We are to imagine that; God has two hands; the one, which
like a hammer beats down and breaks in pieces those who raise up themselves; and
the other, which raises up the humble who willingly let down themselves, and is
like a firm prop to sustain them. Were we really convinced of this, and had it
deeply fixed in our minds, who of us would dare by pride to urge war with God?
But the hope of impunity now makes us fearlessly to raise up our horn to heaven.
Let, then, this declaration of Peter be as a celestial thunderbolt to make men
humble.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he calls those
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>humble</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>who being emptied of every confidence in their own power, wisdom, and
righteousness, seek every good from God alone. Since there is no coming to God
except in this way, who, having lost his own glory, ought not willingly to
humble himself?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Humble yourselves
therefore.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>We must ever bear in mind for
what; end he bids us to be humble before God, even that we may be more courteous
and kind to our brethren, and not refuse to submit to them as far as love
demands. Then they who are haughty and refractory towards men, are, he says,
acting insolently towards God. He therefore exhorts all the godly to submit to
God&#8217;s authority; and he calls God&#8217;s power his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hand</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>that he might make them to fear the more. For though hand is often applied
to God, yet it is to be understood here according to the circumstances of the
passage. But as we are wont commonly to fear, lest our humility should be a
disadvantage to us, and others might for this reason grow more insolent, Peter
meets this objection, and promises eminency to all who humble
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in due
time</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>that he might at the same time
obviate too much haste. He then intimates that it is necessary for us to learn
humility now, but that the Lord well knows when it is expedient for us to be
elevated. Thus it behoves us to yield to his counsel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Casting all our
care</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He more fully sets forth here the
providence of God. For whence are these proverbial sayings, &#8220;We shall have
to howl among wolves,&#8221; and, &#8220;They are foolish who are like sheep,
exposing themselves to wolves to be devoured,&#8221; except that we think that
by our humility we set loose the reins to the audacity of the ungodly, so that
they insult us more wantonly? But this fear arises from our ignorance of divine
providence. Now, on the other hand, as soon as we are convinced that God cares
for us, our minds are easily led to patience and humility. Lest, then, the
wickedness of men should tempt us to a fierceness of mind, the Apostle
prescribes to us a remedy, and also David does in the thirty-seventh Psalm, so
that having cast our care on God, we may calmly rest. For all those who recumb
not on God&#8217;s providence must necessarily be in constant turmoil and
violently assail others. We ought the more to dwell on this thought, that God
cares for us, in order, first, that we may have peace within; and, secondly,
that we may be humble and meek towards men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we are not thus bidden to cast all our care on
God, as though God wished us to have strong hearts, and to be void of all
feeling; but lest fear or anxiety should drive us to impatience. In like manner,
the knowledge of divine providence does not free men from every care, that they
may securely indulge themselves; for it ought not to encourage the torpidity of
the flesh, but to bring rest to faith.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be
sober</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This explanation extends wider,
that as we have war with a most fierce and most powerful enemy, we are to be
strenuous in resisting him. But he uses a twofold metaphor, that they were to be
sober, and that they were to exercise watchfulness. Surfeiting produces sloth
and sleep; even so they who indulge in earthly cares and pleasures, think of
nothing else, being under the power of spiritual lethargy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive what the meaning of the Apostle is.
We must, he says, carry on a warfare in this world; and he reminds us that we
have to do with no common enemy, but one who, like a lion, runs here and there,
ready to devour. He hence concludes that we ought carefully to watch. Paul
stimulates us with the same argument in the sixth chapter of the Epistle to the
Ephesians, where he says that we have a contest not with flesh and blood, but
with spiritual wickedness, etc. But we too often turn peace into sloth, and
hence it comes that the enemy then circumvents and overwhelms us; for, as though
placed beyond the reach of danger, we indulge ourselves according to the will of
the flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He compares the devil to a lion, as though he had
said, that he is a savage wild beast. He says that he
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>goes
round</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to devour, in order to rouse us to
wariness. He calls him the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>adversary</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>of the godly, that they might know that they worship God and profess faith
in Christ on this condition, that they are to have continual war with the devil,
for he does not spare the members who fights with the head.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9<i>.</i></b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whom
resist</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>As the power of an enemy ought
to stimulate us and make us more careful, so there would be danger lest our
hearts failed through immoderate fear, except the hope of victory were given us.
This then is what the Apostle speaks of; he shows that the issue of the war will
be prosperous, if we indeed fight under the banner of Christ; for whosoever
comes to this contest, endued with faith, he declares that he will certainly be
a conqueror.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Resist</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he says; but some one may ask, how? To this he answers, there is sufficient
strength in faith. Paul, in the passage which I have already quoted, enumerates
the various parts of our armor, but the meaning is the same,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490613&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
6:13,) for John testifies that faith alone is our victory over the
world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Knowing that the same
afflictions</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or sufferings. It is
another consolation, that we have a contest in common with all the children of
God; for Satan dangerously tries us, when he separates us from the body of
Christ. We have heard how he attempted to storm the courage of
Job,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Look to the
saints, has any one of them suffered such a thing
?&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8212;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;180501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Job
5:1.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Apostle on the other hand, reminds us here that
nothing happens to us but what we see does happen to other members of the
Church. Moreover a fellowship, or a similar condition, with all the saints,
ought by no means to be refused by us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying that the same sufferings are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>accomplished</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,
</i>he means what Paul declares in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510124&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:24, that what remains of the sufferings of Christ is daily fulfilled in the
faithful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The
words,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that are in the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>may be explained in two ways,
either that God proves his faithful people indiscriminately everywhere in the
world, or that the necessity of fighting awaits us as long as we are in the
world. But we must observe that having said before that we are assailed by
Satan, he then immediately refers to every kind of afflictions. We hence gather
that we have always to do with our spiritual enemy, however adversities may
come, or whatever they may be, whether diseases oppress us, or the barrenness of
the land threatens us with famine, or men persecute us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the God of all
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>After having sufficiently dwelt
on admonitions, he now turns to prayer; for doctrine is in vain poured forth
into the air, unless God works by his Spirit. And this example ought to be
followed by all the ministers of God, that is, to pray that he may give success
to their labors; for otherwise they effect nothing either by planting or by
watering.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some copies have the future tense, as though a
promise is made; but the other reading is more commonly received. At the same
time, the Apostle, by praying God, confirms those to whom he was writing, for
when he calls God the author of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>and reminds them that they were
called to eternal glory, his purpose no doubt was, to confirm them in the
conviction, that the work of their salvation, which he had begun, would be
completed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He is called the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God of all
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>from the effect, from the gifts he
bestows, according to the Hebrew manner. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb56</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And he mentions expressly </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>first that they might learn that
every blessing is to be ascribed to God; and secondly, that one grace is
connected with another, so that they might hope in future for the addition of
those graces in which they were hitherto wanting.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who hath called
us</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>This, as I have said, serves to
increase confidence, because God is led not only by his goodness, but also by
his gracious benevolence, to aid us more and more. He does not simply mention
calling, but he shews wherefore they were called, even that they might obtain
eternal glory. He further fixes the foundation of calling in Christ. Both these
things serve to give perpetual confidence, for if our calling is founded on
Christ, and refers to the celestial kingdom of God and a blessed immortality, it
follows that it is not transient nor fading.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may also be right, by the way, to observe that
when he says that we are called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>first, our calling is
established, because it is rightly founded; and secondly, that all respect to
our worthiness and merit is excluded; for that God, by the preaching of the
gospel, invites us to himself, it is altogether gratuitous; and it is still a
greater grace that he efficaciously touches our hearts so as to lead us to obey
his voice. Now Peter especially addresses the faithful; he therefore connects
the efficacious power of the Spirit with the outward doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the three words which follow, some copies have
them in the ablative case, which may be rendered in Latin by gerunds
(<i>fulciendo, roborando, stabiliendo</i>) by supporting, by strengthening, by
establishing. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fb57</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But in this there is not much importance with regard to the meaning. Besides,
Peter intends the same thing by all these words, even to confirm the faithful;
and he uses these several words for this purpose, that we may know that to
follow our course is a matter of no common difficulty, and that therefore we
need the special grace of God. The words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>suffered a
while</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>inserted here, shew that the time
of suffering is but short, and this is no small consolation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To him be
glory</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>That he might add more confidence
to the godly, he breaks out into thanksgiving. Though this be read in the
indicative as well as in the optative mood, still the meaning is nearly the
same.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By
Silvanus</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>He exhorts them at the
conclusion of the Epistle to constancy in the faith: yea, he declares that his
design in writing, was to retain them in obedience to the doctrine which they
had embraced. But he first commends the brevity of his Epistle, lest the reading
of it should be tedious to them; and, secondly, he adds a short commendation of
his messenger, that the living voice might be added to what was written; for
this was the design of the testimony he bears to his fidelity. But the
exception, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as I
suppose</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or think, was added, either as
token of modesty or to let them surely know, that he spoke according to the
conviction of his own mind; and it was unreasonable for them not to assent to
the judgment of so great an apostle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Exhorting and
testifying</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>How difficult it is to
continue in the faith! evidences of this are the daily defections of many: nor,
indeed, is such a thing to be wondered at, when we consider how great is the
levity and inconsistency of men, and how great is their inclination to vanity.
But as no doctrine can strike firm and perpetual roots in men&#8217;s hearts, if
it be accompanied with any doubt, he testifies that God&#8217;s truth, in which
they had been taught, was certain. And, doubtless, except its certainty appears
to our minds, we must at all times necessarily vacillate, and be ready to turn
at every wind of new doctrine. By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grace of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>he means faith with all its effects
and fruits.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That is at
Babylon</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>Many of the ancients thought
that Rome is here enigmatically denoted. This comment the Papists gladly lay
hold on, that Peter may appear to have presided over the Church of Rome: nor
does the infamy of the name deter them, provided they can pretend to the title
of an apostolic seat; nor do they care for Christ, provided Peter be left to
them. Moreover, let them only retain the name of Peter&#8217;s chair, and they
will not refuse to set Rome in the infernal regions. But this old comment has no
color of truth in its favor; nor do I see why it was approved by Eusebius and
others, except that they were already led astray by that error, that Peter had
been at Rome. Besides, they are inconsistent with themselves. They say that Mark
died at Alexandria, in the eighth year of Nero; but they imagine that Peter, six
years after this, was put to death at Rome by Nero. If Mark formed, as they say,
the Alexandrian Church, and had been long a bishop there, he could never have
been at Rome with Peter. For Eusebius and Jerome extend the time of
Peter&#8217;s presidency at Rome to twenty-five years; but this may be easily
disproved by what is said in the first and the second chapter of the Epistle to
the Galatians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Since, then, Peter had Mark as his companion when he
wrote this Epistle, it is very probable that he was at Babylon: and this was in
accordance with his calling; for we know that he was appointed an apostle
especially to the Jews. He therefore visited chiefly those parts where there was
the greatest number of that nation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In saying that the Church there was a partaker of the
same election, his object was to confirm others more and more in the faith; for
it was a great matter that the Jews were gathered into the Church, in so remote
a part of the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My
son</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>. </i>So he calls Mark for honor&#8217;s
sake; the reason, however, is, because he had begotten him in the faith, as Paul
did Timothy. Of the <i>kiss of love </i>we have spoken elsewhere. Now he bids
this to be the kiss of love,

that disciple who, above others, was loved by Christ, that he might exhibit him
as a friend to us. But it contains doctrines mixed with exhortations; for he
speaks of the eternal Deity of Christ, and at the same time of the incomparable
grace which he brought with him when he appeared in the world, and generally of
all his blessings; and he especially commends and extols the inestimable grace
of divine adoption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">On these truths he grounds his exhortations; and at
one time he admonishes us in general to lead a pious and holy life, and at
another time he expressly enjoins love. But he does none of these things in a
regular order; for he everywhere mixes teaching with exhortation. But he
particularly urges brotherly love: he also briefly touches on other things, such
as to beware of impostors, and similar things. But each particular shall be
noticed in its own place.</font><br></div>

of the subject requires that the truth should be certain, and fully proved, this
is what is here much dwelt upon. For these
words</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>, What we have seen, what we
have heard, what we have looked on,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>serve to strengthen our faith in the gospel. Nor does he, indeed, without
reason, make so many asseverations; for since our salvation depends on the
gospel, its certainty is in the highest degree necessary;<i> </i>and how
difficult it is for us to believe, every one of us knows too well by his own
experience.<i> </i>To believe is not lightly to form an opinion, or to assent
only to what is said, but a firm, undoubting conviction, so that we may dare to
subscribe to the truth as fully proved. It is for this reason that the Apostle
heaps together so many things in confirmation of the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That which was from the
beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As the passage is abrupt and
involved, that the sense may be made clearer, the words may be thus arranged;
&#8220;We announce to you the word of life, which was from the beginning and
really testified to us in all manner of ways, that life has been manifested in
him;&#8221; or, if you prefer, the meaning may be thus given, &#8220;What we
announce to you respecting the word of life, has been from the beginning, and
has been openly shewed to us, that life was manifested in him.&#8221; But the
words, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That which was from the
beginning,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>refer doubtless to the
divinity of Christ, for God manifested in the flesh was not from the beginning;
but he who always was life and the eternal Word of God, appeared in the fullness
of time as man. Again, what follows as to the looking on and the handling of the
hands, refers to his human nature. But as the two natures constitute but one
person, and Christ is one, because he came forth from the Father that he might
put on our flesh, the Apostle rightly declares that he is the same, and had been
invisible, and afterwards became visible.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa1</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hereby the senseless cavil of Servetus is disproved,
that the nature and essence of Deity became one with the flesh, and that thus
the Word was transformed into flesh, because the life-giving Word was seen in
the flesh. </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us then bear in mind, that this doctrine of the
Gospel is here declared, that he who in the flesh really proved himself to be
the Son of God, and was acknowledged to be the Son of God, was always
God&#8217;s invisible Word, for he does not refer here to the beginning of the
world, but ascends much higher.<i> </i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which we have heard, which we have
seen.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It was not the hearing of a
report, to which little credit is usually given, but John means, that he had
faithfully learnt from his Master those things which he taught, so that he
alleged nothing thoughtlessly and rashly. And, doubtless, no one is a fit
teacher in the Church, who has not been the disciple of the Son of God, and
rightly instructed in his school, since his authority alone ought to
prevail.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says, we have seen
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with our
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>it is no redundancy, but a fuller
expression for the sake of amplifying; nay, he was not satisfied with seeing
only, but added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>which we have
looked upon, and our hands have handled</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>By these words he shews that he taught nothing but what had been really made
known to him. </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may seem, however, that the evidence of the senses
little availed on the present subject, for the power of Christ could not be
perceived by the eyes nor felt by the hands. To this I answer, that the same
thing is said here as in the first chapter of the Gospel of John, &#8220;We have
seen his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father;&#8221; for he
was not known as the Son of God by the external form of his body, but because he
gave illustrious proofs of his Divine power, so that in him shone forth the
majesty of the Father, as in a living and distinct image. As the words are in
the plural number, and the subject equally applies to all the apostles, I am
disposed to include them, especially as the authority of testimony is what is
treated of.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But no less frivolous (as I have before said) than
impudent is the wickedness of Servetus, who urges these words to prove that the
Word of God became visible and capable of being handled; he either impiously
destroys or mingles together the twofold nature of Christ. It is, therefore, a
pure figment. Thus deifying the humanity of Christ, he wholly takes away the
reality of his human nature, at the same time denying that Christ is for any
other reason called the Son of God, except that he was conceived of his mother
by the power of the Holy Spirit, and taking away his own subsistence in God. It
hence follows that he was neither God nor man, though he seems to form a
confused mass from both. But as the meaning of the Apostle is evident to us, let
us pass by that unprincipled man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of the Word of
life</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The genitive here is used for an
adjective, vivifying, or life-giving; for in him, as it is said in the first
chapter of John&#8217;s Gospel, was life. At the same time, this distinction
belongs to the Son of God on two accounts, because he has infused life into all
creatures, and because he now restores life to us, which had perished, having
been extinguished by the sin of Adam. Moreover, the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Word</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>may be explained in two ways, either of Christ, or of the doctrine of the
Gospel, for even by this is salvation brought to us. But as its substance is
Christ, and as it contains no other thing than that he, who had been always with
the Father, was at length manifested to men, the first view appears to me the
more simple and genuine. Moreover, it appears more fully from the Gospel that
the wisdom which dwells in God is called the Word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>(or, and) </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the life was
manifested</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The copulative is
explanatory, as though he had said, &#8220;We<i> </i>testify of the vivifying
Word, as life has been manifested.&#8221; The sense may at the same time be
twofold, that Christ, who is life and the fountain of life, has been manifested,
or, that life has been openly offered to us in Christ. The latter, indeed,
necessarily follows from the former. Yet as to the meaning, the two things
differ, as cause and effect. When he repeats,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We
shew</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or announce
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>eternal
life</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he speaks, I have no doubt, of the
effect, even that he announces that life is obtained for us in Christ.
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn, that when Christ is preached to us,
the kingdom of heaven is opened to us, so that being raised from death we may
live the life of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which was with the
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This is true, not only from the
time when the world was formed, but also from eternity, for he was always God,
the fountain of life; and the power and the faculty of vivifying was possessed
by his eternal wisdom: but he did not actually exercise it before the creation
of the world, and from the time when God began to exhibit the Word, that power
which before was hid, diffused itself over all created things. Some
manifestation had already been made; the Apostle had another thing in view, that
is, that life was then at length manifested in Christ, when he in our flesh
completed the work of redemption. For though the fathers were even under the law
associates and partakers of the same life, yet we know that they were shut up
under the hope that was to be revealed. It was necessary for them to seek life
from the death and resurrection of Christ; but the event was not only far remote
from their eyes, but also hid from their minds. They depended, then, on the hope
of revelation, which at length in due time followed. They could not, indeed,
have obtained life, except it was in some way manifested to them; but the
difference between us and them is, that we hold him already revealed as it were
in our hands, whom they sought obscurely promised to them in
types.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the object of the Apostle is, to remove the idea
of novelty, which might have lessened the dignity of the Gospel; he therefore
says, that life had not now at length began to be, though it had but lately
appeared, for it was always with the Father.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>heard</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>that nothing might be wanting as to the real certainty of his doctrine. And
it ought to be carefully noticed, that the heralds of the Gospel chosen by
Christ were those who were fit and faithful witnesses of all those things which
they were to declare. He also testifies of the feeling of their heart, for he
says that he was moved by no other reason to write except to invite those to
whom he was writing to the participation of an inestimable good. It hence
appears how much care he had for their salvation; which served not a little to
induce them to believe; for extremely ungrateful we must be, if we refuse to
hear him who wishes to communicate to us a part of that happiness which he has
obtained.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He also sets forth the fruit received from the
Gospel, even that we are united thereby to God, and to his Son Christ in whom is
found the chief good. It was necessary for him to add this second clause, not
only that he might represent the doctrine of the Gospel as precious and lovely,
but that he might also show that he wished them to be his associates for no
other end but to lead them to God, so that they might be all one in him. For the
ungodly have also a mutual union between themselves, but it is without God, nay,
in order to alienate themselves more and more from God, which is the extreme of
all evils. It is, indeed, as it has been stated, our only true happiness, to be
received into God&#8217;s favor, so that we may be really united to him in
Christ; of which John speaks in the seventeenth chapter of his
gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, John declares, that as the apostles were
adopted by Christ as brethren, that being gathered into one body, they might
together be united to God, so he does the same with other colleagues; though
many, they are yet made partakers of this holy and blessed
union.</font><br></div>

at the same time he reminds the faithful where they ought to fix all their
affections. True is that saying,</font><br></div>

himself happy in having communion with God, and acquiesces in that alone; and
thus he prefers it to the whole world, so that he is ready for its sake to
relinquish all other things.</font><br></div>

This then is the message</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or promise. I
do not disapprove of the rendering of the old interpreter, &#8220;This is the
annunciation,&#8221; or message; for though
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpaggeli&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>means for the most part a promise, yet, as John speaks here generally of the
testimony before mentioned, the context seems to require the other meaning,
except you were to give this explanation, &#8220;The promise which we bring to
you, includes this, or has this condition annexed to it.&#8221;<i> </i>Thus, the
meaning of the Apostle would become evident to us.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa2</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For his object here was not to include the whole doctrine of the Gospel, but to
shew that if we desire to enjoy Christ and his blessings, it is required of us
to be conformed to God in righteousness and holiness. Paul says the same thing
in the second chapter of the Epistle to Titus, &#8220;Appeared<i> </i>has the
saving grace of God to all, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we may
live soberly and righteously and holily in this world;&#8221; except that here
he says metaphorically, that we are to walk in the light, because God is
light.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he calls God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>light</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and says that he is </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
light</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>such expressions are not to be
too strictly taken. Why Satan is called the prince of darkness is sufficiently
evident. When, therefore, God on the other hand is called the Father of light,
and also light, we first understand that there is nothing in him but what is
bright, pure, and unalloyed; and, secondly, that he makes all things so manifest
by his brightness, that he suffers nothing vicious or perverted, no spots or
filth, no hypocrisy or fraud, to lie hid. Then the sum of what is said is, that
since there is no union between light and darkness, there is a separation
between us and God as long as we walk in darkness; and that the fellowship which
he mentions, cannot exist except we also become pure and holy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In him is no darkness at
all.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This mode of speaking is commonly
used by John, to amplify what he has affirmed by a contrary negation. Then, the
meaning is, that God is such a light, that no darkness belongs to him. It hence
follows, that he hates an evil conscience, pollution, and wickedness, and
everything that pertains to darkness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If we
say</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It is, indeed, an argument from
what is inconsistent, when he concludes that they are alienated from God, who
walk in darkness. This doctrine, however, depends on a higher principle, that
God sanctifies all who are his. For it is not a naked precept that he gives,
which requires that our life should be holy; but he rather shews that the grace
of Christ serves for this end to dissipate darkness, and to kindle in us the
light of God; as though he had said, &#8220;What<i> </i>God communicates to us
is not a vain fiction; for it is necessary that the power and effect of this
fellowship should shine forth in our life; otherwise the possession of the
gospel is fallacious.&#8221; What he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and do not the
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>is the same as if he had said,
&#8220;We do not act truthfully. We do not regard what is true and right.&#8221;
And this mode of speaking, as I have before observed, is frequently used by
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if we walk in the
light.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now says, that the proof of
our union with God is certain, if we are conformable to him; not that purity of
life conciliates us to God, as the prior cause; but the Apostle means, that our
union with God is made evident by the effect, that is, when his purity shines
forth in us. And, doubtless, such is the fact; wherever God comes, all things
are so imbued with his holiness, that he washes away all filth; for without him
we have nothing but filth and darkness. It is hence evident, that no one leads a
holy life, except he is united to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have fellowship one with
another,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he does not speak simply of
men; but he sets God on one side, and us on the other. </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may, however, be asked, &#8220;Who<i> </i>among
men can so exhibit the light of God in his life, as that this likeness which
John requires should exist; for it would be thus necessary, that he should be
wholly pure and free from darkness.&#8221; To this I answer, that expressions of
this kind are accommodated to the capacities of men; he is therefore said to be
like God, who aspires to his likeness, however distant from it he may as yet be.
The example ought not to be otherwise applied than according to this passage. He
walks in darkness who is not ruled by the fear of God, and who does not, with a
pure conscience, devote himself wholly to God, and seek to promote his glory.
Then, on the other hand, he who in sincerity of heart spends his life, yea,
every part of it, in the fear and service of God, and faithfully worships him,
walks in the light, for he keeps<i> </i>the right way, though he may in many
things offend and sigh under the burden of the flesh. Then, integrity of
conscience is alone that which distinguishes light from
darkness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the blood of Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>After having taught what is the
bond of our union with God, he now shews what fruit flows from it, even that our
sins are freely remitted. And this is the blessedness which David describes<i>
</i>in the thirty-second Psalm, in order that we may know that we are most
miserable until, being renewed by God&#8217;s Spirit, we serve him with a
sincere heart. For who can be imagined more miserable than that man whom God
hates and abominates, and over whose head is suspended both the wrath of God and
eternal death? </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage is remarkable;<i> </i>and from it we
first learn, that the expiation of Christ, effected by his death, does then
properly belong to us, when we, in uprightness of heart, do what is right and
just for Christ is no redeemer except to those who turn from iniquity, and lead
a new life. If, then, we desire to have God propitious to us, so as to forgive
our sins, we ought not to forgive ourselves. In short, remission of sins cannot
be separated from repentance, nor can the peace of God be in those hearts, where
the fear God does not prevail.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Secondly, this passage shews that the gratuitous
pardon of sins is given us not only once, but that it is a benefit perpetually
residing in the Church, and daily offered to the faithful. For the Apostle here
addresses the faithful; as doubtless no man has ever been, nor ever will be, who
can otherwise please God, since all are guilty before him; for however strong a
desire there may be in us of acting rightly, we always go haltingly to God. Yet
what is half done obtains no approval with God. In the meantime, by new sins we
continually separate ourselves, as far as we can, from the grace of God. Thus it
is, that all the saints have need of the daily forgiveness of sins; for this
alone keeps us in the family of God. </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from all
sin,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he intimates that we are, on many
accounts, guilty before God; so that doubtless there is no one who has not many
vices. But he shews that no sins prevent the godly, and those who fear God, from
obtaining his favor. He also points out the manner of obtaining pardon, and the
cause of our cleansing, even because Christ expiated our sins by his blood; but
he affirms that all the godly are undoubtedly partakers of this
cleansing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The whole of his doctrine has been wickedly perverted
by the sophists; for they imagine that pardon of sins is given us, as it were,
in baptism. They maintain that there only the blood of Christ avails; and they
teach, that after baptism, God is not otherwise reconciled than by
satisfactions. They, indeed, leave some part to the blood of Christ; but when
they assign merit to works, even in the least degree, they wholly subvert what
John teaches here, as to the way of expiating sins, and of being reconciled to
God. For these two things can never harmonize together, to be cleansed by the
blood of Christ, and to be cleansed by works: for John assigns not the half, but
the whole, to the blood of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of what is said, then, is, that the faithful
know of a certainty, that they are accepted by God, because he has been
reconciled to them through the sacrifice of the death of Christ. And sacrifice
includes cleansing and satisfaction. Hence the power and efficiency of these
belong to the blood of Christ alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hereby is disproved and exposed the sacrilegious
invention of the Papists as to indulgences; for as though the blood of Christ
were not sufficient, they add, as a subsidy to it, the blood and merits of
martyrs. At the same time, this blasphemy advances much further among us; for as
they say that their keys, by which they hold as shut up the remission of sins,
open a treasure made up partly of the blood and merits of martyrs, and partly of
the worlds of supererogation, by which any sinner may redeem himself, no
remission of sins remains for them but what is derogatory to the blood of
Christ; for if their doctrine stands, the blood of Christ does not cleanse us,
but comes in, as it were, as a partial aid. Thus consciences are held in
suspense, which the Apostle here bids to rely on the blood of
Christ.</font><br></div>

If we say.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He now commends grace from
its necessity; for as no one is free from sin, he intimates that we are all lost
and undone, except the Lord comes to our aid with the remedy of pardon. The
reason why he so much dwells on the fact, that no one is innocent, is, that all
may now fully know that they stand in need of mercy, to deliver them from
punishment, and that they may thus be more roused to seek the necessary
blessing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sin</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>is meant here not only corrupt and vicious inclination, but the fault or
sinful act which really renders us guilty before God. Besides, as it is a
universal declaration, it follows, that none of the saints, who exist now, have
been, or shall be, are exempted from the number. Hence most fitly did Augustine
refute the cavil of the Pelagians, by adducing against them this passage: and he
wisely thought that the confession of guilt is not required for humility&#8217;s
sake, but lest we by lying should deceive ourselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and the truth is not in
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he confirms, according to his usual
manner, the former sentence by repeating it in other words; though it is not a
simple repetition, (as elsewhere,) but he says that they are deceived who glory
in falsehood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If we
confess</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He again promises to the
faithful that God will be propitious to them, provided they acknowledge
themselves to <i>be </i>sinners. It is of great moment to be fully persuaded,
that when we have sinned, there is a reconciliation with God ready and prepared
for us: we shall otherwise carry always a hell within us. Few, indeed, consider
how miserable and wretched is a doubting conscience; but the truth is, that hell
reigns where there is no peace with God. The more, then, it becomes us to
receive with the whole heart this promise which offers free pardon to all who
confess their sins. Moreover, this is founded even on the justice of God,
because God who promises is true and just. For they who think that he is called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>just</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>because he justifies us freely, reason, as I think, with too much
refinement, because justice or righteousness here depends on fidelity, and both
are annexed to the promise. For God might have been just, were he to deal with
us with all the rigor of justice; but as he has bound himself to us by his word,
he would not have himself deemed just, except he forgives.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa3</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this confession, as it is made to God, must be in
sincerity; and the heart cannot speak to God without newness of life. It then
includes true repentance. God, indeed, forgives freely, but in such a way, that
the facility of mercy does not become an enticement to sin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to cleanse
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The verb, to cleanse, seems to be
taken in another sense than before; for he had said, that we are cleansed by the
blood of Christ, because through him sins are not imputed; but now, having
spoken of pardon, he also adds, that God cleanses us from iniquity: so that this
second clause is different front the preceding. Thus he initiates that a twofold
fruit comes to us from confession, &#8212; that God being reconciled by the
sacrifice of Christ, forgives us, &#8212; and that he renews and reforms
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any one to object and say, that as long as we
sojourn in the world, we are never cleansed from all unrighteousness, with
regard to our reformation: this is indeed true; but John does not refer to what
God now performs in us. He is faithful, he says, to cleanse us, not today or
tomorrow; for as long as we are surrounded with flesh, we ought to be in a
continual state of progress; but what he has once begun, he goes on daily to do,
until he at length completes it. So Paul says, that we are chosen, that we may
appear without blame before God,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510122&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
1:22;) and in another place he says, that the Church is cleansed, that it might
be without spot or wrinkle.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490527&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
5:27.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If yet any one prefers another explanation, that he
says the same thing twice over, I shall not object.<b>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We make him a
liar</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He goes still further, that they
who claim purity for themselves blaspheme God. For we see that he everywhere
represents the whole race of man as guilty of sin. </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whosoever then tries to escape this charge carries on
war with God, and accuses him of falsehood, as though he condemned the
undeserving. To confirm this he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and his word is not in
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>as though he had said, that we
reject this great truth, that all are under guilt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn, that we then only make a due progress
in the knowledge of the word of the Lord, when we become really humbled, so as
to groan under the burden of our sins and learn to flee to the mercy of God, and
acquiesce in nothing else but in his paternal favor.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>My little
children.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>It is not only the sum and
substance of the preceding doctrine, but the meaning of almost the whole gospel,
that we are to depart from sin; and yet, though we are always exposed to
God&#8217;s judgment, we are certain that Christ so intercedes by the sacrifice
of his death, that the Father is propitious to us. In the meantime, he also
anticipates an objection, lest any one should think that he gave license to sin
when he spoke of God&#8217;s mercy, and shewed that it is presented to us all.
He then joins together two parts of the gospel, which unreasonable men separate,
and thus lacerate and mutilate. Besides, the doctrine of grace has always been
calumniated by the ungodly. When the expiation of sills by Christ is set forth,
they boastingly say that a license is given to sin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To obviate these calumnies, the Apostle testifies
first that the design of his doctrine was to keep men from sinning; for when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that ye sin
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>his meaning only is, that they,
according to the measure of human infirmity, should abstain from sins. And to
the same purpose is what I have already said respecting fellowship with God,
that we are to be conformable to him. He is not, however, silent as to the
gratuitous remission of sins; for though heaven should fall and all things be
confounded, yet this part of truth ought never to be omitted; but, on the
contrary, what Christ is ought to be preached clearly and
distinctly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So ought we also to do at this day. As the flesh is
inclined to wantonness, men ought to be carefully warned, that righteousness and
salvation are provided in Christ for this end, that we may become the holy
possession of God. Yet whenever it happens that men wantonly abuse the mercy of
God, there are many snarlish men who load us with calumny, as though we gave
loose reins to vices. We ought still boldly to go on and proclaim the grace of
Christ, in which especially shines forth the glory of God, and in which consists
the whole salvation of men. These barkings of the ungodly ought, I repeat it, to
be wholly disregarded; for we see that the apostles were also by these barkings
assailed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this reason he immediately adds the second
clause, that when we sin we have an
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>advocate</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>By these words he confirms what we have already said, that we are very far
from being perfectly righteous, nay, that we contract new guilt daily, and that
yet there is a remedy for reconciling us to God, if we flee to Christ; and this
is alone that in which consciences call acquiesce, in which is included the
righteousness of men, in which is founded the hope of
salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The conditional particle,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>if</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>ought to be viewed as causal; for it cannot be but that we sin. In short,
John means, that we are not only called away from sin by the gospel, because God
invites us to himself, and offers to us the Spirit of regeneration, but that a
provision is made for miserable sinners, that they may have God always
propitious to them, and that the sins by which they are entangled, do not
prevent them from becoming just, because they have a Mediator to reconcile them
to God. But in order to shew how we return into favor with God, he says that
Christ is our advocate; for he appears before God for this end, that he may
exercise towards us the power and efficacy of his sacrifice. That this may be
better understood, I will speak more homely. The intercession of Christ is a
continual application of his death for our salvation. That God then does not
impute to us our sins, this comes to us, because he has regard to Christ as
intercessor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the two names, by which he afterwards signalizes
Christ, properly belong to the subject of this passage. He calls him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>just</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>and a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>propitiation</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>It is necessary for him to be both, that he might sustain the office and
person of an Advocate; for who that is a sinner could reconcile God to us? For
we are excluded from access to him, because no one is pure and free from sin.
Hence no one is fit to be a high priest, except he is innocent and separated
from sinners, as it is also declared in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580726&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
7:26.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Propitiation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>is added, because no one is fit to be a high priest without a sacrifice.
Hence, under the Law, no priest entered the sanctuary without blood; and a
sacrifice, as a usual seal, was wont, according to God&#8217;s appointment, to
accompany prayers. By this symbol it was God&#8217;s design to shew, that
whosoever obtains favor for us, must be furnished with a sacrifice; for when God
is offended, in order to pacify him a satisfaction is required. It hence
follows, that all the saints who have ever been and shall be, have need of an
advocate, and that no one except Christ is equal to undertake this office. And
doubtless John ascribed these two things to Christ, to shew that he is the only
true advocate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now,<i> </i>as no small consolation comes to us, when
we hear that Christ not only died for us to reconcile us to the Father, but that
he continually intercedes for us, so that an access in his name is open to us,
that our prayers may be heard; so we ought especially to beware, lest this
honor, which belongs peculiarly to him, should be transferred to
another.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we know that under the Papacy this office is
ascribed indiscriminately to the saints. Thirty years ago, this so remarkable an
article of our faith, that Christ is our advocate, was nearly buried; but at
this day they allow that he is indeed one of many, but not the only one. They
among the Papists who have a little more modesty, do not deny that Christ excels
others; but they afterwards join with him a vast number of associates. But the
words clearly mean that he cannot be an advocate who is not a priest; and the
priesthood belongs to none but to Christ alone. In the meantime we do not
take<i> </i>away the mutual intercessions of saints, which they exercise in love
towards one another; but this has nothing to do with the dead who have removed
from their intercourse with men; and nothing with that patronage which they
feign for themselves, that they may not be dependent on Christ alone. For though
brethren pray for brethren, yet they all, without exception, look to one
advocate. There is, then, no doubt but the Papists set up against Christ so many
idols as the patrons or advocates they devise for themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also notice by the way, that those err very
grossly, who imagine that Christ falls on his knees before the Father to pray
for us. Such thoughts ought to be renounced, for they detract from the celestial
glory of Christ; and the simple truth ought to be retained, that the fruit of
his death is ever new and perpetual, that by his intercession he renders God
propitious to us, and that he sanctifies our prayers by the odor of his
sacrifice, and also aids us by pleading for us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And not for ours
only</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He added this for the sake of
amplifying, in order that the faithful might be assured that the expiation made
by Christ, extends to all who by faith embrace the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here a question may be raised, how have the sins of
the whole world been expiated? I pass by the dotages of the fanatics, who under
this pretense extend salvation to all the reprobate, and therefore to Satan
himself. Such a monstrous thing deserves no refutation. They who seek to avoid
this absurdity, have said that Christ<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa5</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
suffered sufficiently for the whole world, but efficiently only for the elect.
This solution has commonly prevailed in the schools. Though then I allow that
what has been said is true, yet I deny that it is suitable to this passage; for
the design of John was no other than to make this benefit common to the whole
Church. Then under the word <i>all </i>or whole, he does not include the
reprobate, but designates those who should believe as well as those who were
then scattered through various parts of the world. For then is really made
evident, as it is meet, the grace of Christ, when it is declared to be the only
true salvation of the world.</font><br></div>

And hereby</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or by this. After having
treated of the doctrine respecting the gratuitous remission of sins, he comes to
the exhortations which belong to it, and which depend on it. And first indeed he
reminds us that the knowledge of God, derived from the gospel, is not
ineffectual, but that obedience proceeds from it. He then shews what God
especially requires from us, what is the chief thing in life, even love to God.
What we read here of the living knowledge of God, the Scripture does not without
reason repeat everywhere; for nothing is more common in the world than to draw
the doctrine of religion to frigid speculations. In this way theology has been
adulterated by the Sorbonian sophists, so that from their whole science not even
the least spark of true religion shines forth. And curious men do everywhere
learn so much from God&#8217;s word, as enables them to prattle for the sake of
display. In short, no evil has been more common in all ages than vainly to
profess God&#8217;s name.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">John then takes this principle as granted, that the
knowledge of God is efficacious. He hence concludes, that they by no means know
God who keep not his precepts or commandments. Plato, though groping in
darkness, yet denied that &#8220;the<i> </i>beautiful&#8221; which he imagined,
could be known, without filling man with the admiration of itself; so he says in
his Phaedrus and in other places. How then is it possible for thee to know God,
and to be moved by no feeling? Nor does it indeed proceed only from God&#8217;s
nature, that to know him is immediately to love him; but the Spirit also, who
illuminates our minds, inspires our hearts with a feeling conformable to our
knowledge. At the same time the knowledge of God leads us to fear him and to
love him. For we cannot know him as Lord and Father, as he shews himself,
without being dutiful children and obedient servants. In short, the doctrine of
the gospel is a lively mirror in which we contemplate the image of God, and are
transformed into the same, as Paul teaches us in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:18. Where, therefore, there is no pure conscience, nothing can be
there but an empty phantom of knowledge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must notice the order when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We do know that we know
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>for he intimates that obedience is
so connected with knowledge, that the last is yet in order the first, as the
cause is necessarily before its effect.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If we keep his
commandments</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>But there is no one who in
everything keeps them; there would thus be no knowledge of God in the world. To
this I answer, that the Apostle is by no means inconsistent with himself; since
he has before shewed that all are guilty before God, he does not understand that
those who keep his commandments wholly satisfy the law (no such example can be
found in the world;) but that they are such as strive, according to the capacity
of human infirmity, to form their life in conformity to the will of God. For
whenever Scripture speaks of the righteousness of the faithful, it does not
exclude the remission of sins, but on the contrary, begins with
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we are not hence to conclude that faith recumbs
on works; for though every one receives a testimony to his faith from his works,
yet it does not follow that it is founded on them, since they are added as an
evidence. Then the certainty of faith depends on the grace of Christ alone; but
piety and holiness of life distinguish true faith from theft knowledge of God
which is fictitious and dead; for the truth is, that those who are in Christ, as
Paul says, have put off the old man.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that saith, I know
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>How does he prove that they are
liars who boast that they have faith without piety? even by the contrary effect;
for he has already said, that the knowledge<i> </i>of God is emcacious. For God
is not known by a naked<i> </i>imagination, since he reveals himself inwardly to
our hearts by the Spirit. Besides, as many hypocrites vainly boast that they
have faith, the Apostle charges all such with falsehood; for what he says would
be superfluous, were there no false and vain profession of Christianity made by
man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But whoso
keepeth</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<b><i> </i></b>He now defines what a
true keeping of God&#8217;s law is, even to love God. This passage is, I think,
incorrectly explained by those who understand that they please the true God who
keep<i> </i>his word. Rather take this as its meaning, &#8220;to love God in
sincerity of heart, is to keep<i> </i>his commandments.&#8221; For he intended,
as I have before reminded you, briefly to shew what God requires from us, and
what is the holiness of the faithful. Moses also said the same thing, when he

him.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;053019&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy

<div><font face="Palatino">For the law, which is spiritual, does not command
only external works, but enjoins this especially, to love God with the whole
heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That no mention is here made of what is due to men,
ought not to be viewed as unreasonable; for brotherly love flows immediately
from the love of God, as we shall hereafter see. Whosoever, then, desires that
his life should be approved by God, must have all his doings directed to this
end. If any one objects and says, that no one has ever been found who loved God
thus perfectly; to this I reply, that it is sufficient, provided every one
aspired to this perfection according to the measure of grace given unto him. In
the meantime, the definition is, that the perfect love of God is the complete
keeping of his law. To make progress in this as in knowledge, is what we ought
to do.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hereby know we that we are in
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He refers to that fruit of the
gospel which he had mentioned, even fellowship with the Father and the Son; and
he thus confirms the former sentence, by stating what follows, as a consequence.
for if it be the end of the gospel to hold communion with God, and no communion
can be without love, then no one makes a real progress in faith except he who
cleaves from the heart to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
He that saith he abideth in him</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As he
has before set before us God as light for an example, he now calls us also to
Christ, that we may imitate him. Yet he does not simply exhort us to imitate
Christ; but from the union we have with him, he proves that we ought to be like
him. A likeness in life and deeds, he says, will prove that we abide in Christ.
But from these words he passes on to the next clause, which he immediately adds
respecting love to the brethren.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Brethren, I write no new
commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This is an explanation of
the preceding doctrine, that to love God is to keep his commandments. And not
without reason did he largely dwell on this point. First, we know that novelty
is disliked or suspected. Secondly, we do not easily undertake an unwonted yoke.
In addition to these things, when we have embraced any kind of doctrine, we
dislike to have anything changed or made new in it. For these reasons John
reminds us, that he taught nothing respecting love but what had been heard by
the faithful from the beginning, and had by long usage become
old.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some explain oldness differently, even that Christ
now prescribes no other rule of life under the Gospel than what God did formerly
under the Law. This is indeed most true; nor do I object but that he afterwards
calls in this sense the word of the gospel
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the old
commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>But I think that he now
means only, that these were the first elements of the gospel, that they had been
thus taught from the beginning, that there was no reason why they should refuse
that as unusual by which they ought to have been long ago imbued. For the
relative seems to be used in a causative sense. He calls it then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>old</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>not because it was taught the fathers many ages before, but because it had
been taught them on their new entrance into a religious life. And it served much
to claim their faith, that it had <i>proceeded </i>from Christ himself from whom
they had received the gospel.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa6</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The old
commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>old</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>in this place, probably extends further; for the sentence is fuller, when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the word which ye have
heard from the beginning is the old
commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>And as I, indeed, think, he
means that the gospel ought not to be received as a doctrine lately born, but
what has proceeded from God, and is his eternal truth; as though he had said,
&#8220;Ye ought not to measure the antiquity of the gospel which is brought to
you, by time; since therein is revealed to you the eternal will of God: not only
then has God delivered to you this rule of a holy life, when ye were first
called to the faith of Christ, but the same has always been prescribed and
approved by him.&#8221; And, doubtless, this only ought to be deemed antiquity,
and deserves faith and reverence, which has its origin from God. For the
fictions of men, whatever long prescription of years they may have, cannot
acquire so much authority as to subvert the truth of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Again, a new
commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Interpreters do not appear
to me to have attained the meaning of the Apostle. He says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>new</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>because God, as it were, renews it by daily suggesting it, so that the
faithful may practice it through their whole life, for nothing more excellent
can be sought for by them. The elements which children learn give place in time
to what is higher and more solid. On the contrary, John denies that the doctrine
respecting brotherly love is of this kind, is one which grows old with time, but
that it is perpetually in force, so that it is no less the highest perfection
than the very beginning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was, however, necessary that this should be added,
for as men are more curious than what they ought to be, there are many who
always seek something new. Hence there is a weariness as to simple doctrine,
which produces innumerable prodigies of errors, when every one gapes continually
for new mysteries. Now, when it is known that the Lord proceeds in the same even
course, in order to keep us through life in that which we have learnt, a bridle
is east on desires of this kind. Let<b> </b>him, then, who would reach the goal
of wisdom, as to the right way of living, make proficiency in
love.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which then is
true</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or which is truth. He proves by
this reason what he had said; for this one command respecting love, as to our
conduct in life, constitutes the whole truth of Christ. Besides, what other
greater revelation can be expected? for Christ, doubtless, is the end and the
completion of all things. Hence the word <i>truth </i>means this, that they
stood, as it were at the goal, for it is to be taken for a completion or a
perfect<i> </i>state. He joins Christ to them, as the head to the members, as
though he had said, that the body of the Church has no other perfection, or,
that they would then be really united to Christ, if holy love existed
continually among them. </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some give another explanation, &#8220;That which is
the truth in Christ, is also in you.&#8221; But I do not see what the meaning of
this is.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Because the darkness is
past.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>The present time is here instead
of the past; for he means, that as soon as Christ brings light, we have the full
brightness of knowledge: not that every one of the faithful becomes wise the
first day as much as he ought to be, (for even Paul testifies that he labored to
apprehend what he had not apprehended,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
3:12,) but that the knowledge of Christ alone is sufficient to dissipate
darkness. Hence, daily progress is necessary; and the faith of every one has its
dawn before it reaches the noonday. But as God continues the inculcation of the
same doctrine, in which he bids us to make advances, the knowledge of the Gospel
is justly said to be the true light, when Christ, the Sun of righteousness,
shines. Thus the way is shut up against the audacity of those men who try to
corrupt the purity of the Gospel by their own fictions; and we may safely
denounce an anathema on the whole theology of the Pope, for it wholly obscures
the true light.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that saith he is in the
light</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He pursues the same metaphor. He
said that love is the only true rule according to which our life is to be
formed; he said that this rule or law is presented to us in the Gospel; he said,
lastly, that it is there as the meridian light, which ought to be continually
looked on. Now, on the other hand, he concludes that all are blind and walk in
darkness who are strangers to love. But that he mentioned before the love of God
and now the love of the brethren, involves no more contrariety than there is
between the effect and its cause. Besides, these are so connected together that
they cannot be separated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">John says in the third chapter, that we falsely boast
of love to God, except we love our brethren; and this is most true. But he now
takes love to the brethren as a testimony by which we prove that we love God. In
short, since love so regards God, that in God it embraces men, there is nothing
strange in this, that the Apostle, speaking of love, should refer at one time to
God, at another to the brethren; and this is what is commonly done in Scripture.
The whole perfection of life is often said to consist in the love of God; and
again, Paul teaches us, that the whole law is fulfilled by him who loves his
neighbor,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:8;) and Christ declares that the main points of the law are righteousness,
judgment, and truth.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;402323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
23:23.) Both these things are true and agree well together, for the love of God
teaches us to love men, and we also in reality prove our love to God by loving
men at his command. However this may be, it remains always certain that love is
the rule of life. And this ought to be the more carefully noticed, because all
choose rather almost anything else than this one command-merit of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is what follows,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and there is no occasion of
stumbling in him</i></font><font face="Palatino"> &#8212; that<i> </i>is, in him
who acts in love; for, he who thus lives will never stumble.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa7</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But he that hateth his
brother.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> He </i>again reminds us, that
whatever specious appearance of excellency thou shewest, there is yet nothing
but what is sinful if love be absent. This passage may be compared with the
thirteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians, and no long
explanation is needed. But this doctrine is not understood by the world, because
the greater part are dazzled by all sorts of masks or disguises. Thus,
fictitious sanctity dazzles the eyes of almost all men, while love is neglected,
or, at least, driven to the farthest corner.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Little

declaration, for he does not address those only of a tender age, but by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>little
children</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he means men of all ages, as in
the first verse, and also hereafter. I say this, because interpreters have
incorrectly applied the term to children. But John, when he speaks of children,
calls them
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">paidi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>a word expressive of age; but here, as a spiritual father, he calls the old
as well as the young,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tekni&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>He will, indeed, presently address special words to different ages; yet they
are mistaken who think that he begins to do so here. But, on the contrary, lest
the preceding exhortation should obscure the free remission of sins, he again
inculcates the doctrine which peculiarly belongs to faith, in order that the
foundation may with certainty be always retained, that salvation is laid up for
us in Christ alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Holiness of life ought indeed to be urged, the fear
of God ought to be carefully enjoined, men ought to be sharply goaded to
repentance, newness of life, together with its fruits, ought to be commended;
but still we ought ever to take heed, lest the doctrine of faith be smothered,
&#8212; that doctrine which teaches that Christ is the only author of salvation
and of all blessings; on the contrary, such moderation ought to be presented,
that faith may ever retain its own primacy. This is the rule prescribed to us by
John: having faithfully spoken of good works, lest he should seem to give them
more importance than he ought to have done, he carefully calls us back to
contemplate the grace of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your sins are forgiven
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Without this assurance, religion
would not be otherwise than fading and shadowy; nay, they who pass by the free
remission of sins, and dwell on other things, build without a foundation. John
in the meantime intimates, that nothing is more suitable to stimulate men to
fear God than when they are rightly taught what blessing Christ has brought to
them, as Paul does, when he beseeches by the bowels of God&#8217;s mercies.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
2:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence appears how wicked is the calumny of the
Papists, who pretend that the desire of doing what is right is frozen, when that
is extolled which alone renders us obedient children to God. For the Apostle
takes this as the ground of his exhortation, that we know that God is so
benevolent to us as not to impute to us our sins.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For his name&#8217;s
sake</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The material cause<i> </i>is
mentioned, lest we should seek other means to reconcile us to God. For it would
not be sufficient to know that God forgives us our sins, except we came directly
to Christ, and to that price which he paid on the cross for us. And this ought
the more to be observed, because we see that by the craft of Satan, and by the
wicked fictions of men, this way is obstructed; for foolish men attempt to
pacify God by various satisfactions, and devise innumerable kinds of
expiations<b> </b>for the purpose of redeeming themselves. For as many means of
deserving pardon we intrude on God, by so many <i>obstacles </i>are we prevented
from approaching him. Hence John, not satisfied with stating simply the
doctrine, that God remits to us our sins, expressly adds, that he is propitious
to us from a regard to Christ, in order that he might exclude all other reasons.
We also, that we may enjoy this blessing, must pass by and forget all other
names, and rely only on the name of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I write unto you,
fathers</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He comes now to enumerate
different ages, that he might shew that what he taught was suitable to every one
of them. For a general address sometimes produces less effect; yea, such is our
perversity, that few think that what is addressed to all belongs to them. The
old for the most part excuse themselves, because they have exceeded the age of
learning; children refuse to learn, as they are not yet old enough; men of
middle age do not attend, because they are occupied<i> </i>with other pursuits.
Lest, then, any should exempt themselves, he accommodates the Gospel to all. And
he mentions three ages, the most common division of human life. Hence also, the
Lacedemonian chorus had three orders; the first sang, &#8220;What ye are we
shall be;&#8221;<i> </i>the last, &#8220;What ye are we have been;&#8221; and
the middle, &#8220;We<i> </i>are what one of you have been and the other will
be.&#8221;<i> </i>Into these three degrees John divides human
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He, indeed, begins with the old, and says that the
Gospel is suitable to them, because they learnt from it to know the eternal Son
of God. Moroseness is the character of the old, but they become especially<i>
</i>unteachable, because they measure wisdom by the number of years. Besides,
Horace in his Art of Poetry, has justly noticed this fault in them, that they
praise the time of their youth and reject whatever is differently done or said.
This evil John wisely removes, when he reminds us that the Gospel contains not
only a knowledge that is ancient, but what also leads us to the yew eternity of
God. It hence follows that there is nothing here which they can dislike. He says
that Christ was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the
beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>I refer this to his Divine
presence, as being co-eternal with the Father, as well as to his power, of which
the Apostle speaks in Hebrews, that he was yesterday what he is today; as though
he had said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;If<i>
</i>antiquity delights you, ye have Christ, who is superior to all antiquity;
therefore his disciples ought not to be ashamed of him who includes all ages in
Himself.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581308&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Hebrews
13:8)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must, at the same time, notice what that religion
is which is really ancient, even that which is founded on Christ, for otherwise
it will be of no avail, however long it may have existed, if it derives its
origin from error.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I write unto you, young
men</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Though it be a diminutive word,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">neani&gt;skoi</font><font face="Palatino">,<b>
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa8</font></sup><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>yet there is no doubt but that he directs his word to all who were in the
flower of their age. We also know that those of that age are so addicted to the
vain cares of the world, that they think but little of the kingdom of God; for
the rigor of their minds and the strength of their bodies in a manner inebriate
them. Hence the Apostle reminds them where true strength is, that they might no
more exult as usual in the flesh.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye are
strong,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because ye have
overcome</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>Satan. The copulative here is
to be rendered causatively. And, doubtless, that strength is what we ought to
seek, even that which is spiritual. At the same time he intimates that it is not
had otherwise than from Christ, for he mentions the blessings which we receive
through the Gospel. He says that they had conquered who were as yet engaged in
the contest; but our condition is far otherwise than that of those who fight
under the banners of men, for war is doubtful to them and the issue is

needed another direction. That the Gospel is well adapted to young children the
Apostle concludes, because they find there the Father. We now see how diabolical
is the tyranny of the Pope, which drives away by threats all ages from the
doctrine of the Gospel, while the Spirit of God so carefully addresses them
all.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But these things which the Apostle makes particular,
are also general; for we should wholly fall off into vanity, except our
infirmity were sustained by the eternal truth of God. There is nothing in us but
what is frail and fading, except the power of Christ dwells in us. We are all
like orphans until we attain the grace of adoption by the Gospel. Hence, what he
declares respecting young children is also true as to the old. But yet his
object was to apply to each what was most especially necessary for them, that he
might shew that they all without exception stood in need of the doctrine of the
Gospel. The particle<b>

superfluous; and it is probable flint when unskillful readers falsely thought
that he spoke twice of little children, they rashly introduced the other two
clauses. It might at the same time be that John himself, for the sake of
amplifying, inserted the second time the sentence respecting the young men, (for
he adds, that they were strong, which he had not said before;) but that the
copyists presumptuously filled up the<i> </i>number.<b>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Love
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He had said before that the only
rule for living religiously, is to love God; but as, when we are occupied with
the vain love of the world, we turn away all our thoughts and affections another
way, this vanity must first be torn away from us, in order that the love of God
may reign within us. Until our minds are cleansed, the former doctrine may be
iterated a hundred times, but with no effect: it would be like pouring water on
a ball; you can gather, no, not a drop, because there is no empty place to
retain water.<b>

kingdom of God and the hope of eternal life. So he includes in it corruptions of
every kind, and the abyss of all evils. In the world are pleasures, delights,
and all those allurements by which man is captivated, so as to withdraw himself
from God. <b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa11</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, the love of the world is thus severely
condemned, because we must necessarily forget God and ourselves when we regard
nothing so much as the earth; and when a corrupt lust of this kind rules in man,
and so holds him entangled that he thinks not of the heavenly life, he is
possessed by a beastly stupidity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any man love the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He proves by an argument from
what is contrary, how necessary it is to east away the love of the world, if we
wish to please God; and this he afterwards confirms by an argument drawn from
what is inconsistent; for what belongs to the world is wholly at variance with
God. We must bear in mind what I have already said, that a corrupt mode of life
is here mentioned, which has nothing in common with the kingdom of God, that is,
when men become so degenerated, that they are satisfied with the present life,
and think no more of immortal life than mute animals. Whosoever, then, makes
himself thus a slave to earthly lusts, cannot be of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The lust of the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or, namely, the lust of the
flesh. The old interpreter renders the verse otherwise, for from one sentence he
makes two. Those Greek authors do better, who read these words together,
&#8220;Whatever<i> </i>is in the world is not of God;&#8221; and then the three
kinds of lusts they introduce parenthetically. For John, by way of explanation,
inserted these three particulars as examples, that he might briefly shew what
are the pursuits and thoughts of men who live for the world; but whether it be a
full and complete division, it does not signify much; though you will not find a
worldly man in whom these lusts do not prevail, at least one of them. It remains
for us to see what he understands by each of these.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The first clause is commonly explained of all sinful
lusts in general; for the flesh means the whole corrupt nature of man. Though I
am unwilling to contend, yet I am unwilling to dissemble that I approve of
another meaning. Paul, when forbidding, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451314&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
13:14, to make provision for the flesh as to its lusts, seems to me to be the
best interpreter of this place. What, then, is the flesh there? even the body
and all that belongs to it. What, then, is the lust or desire of the flesh, but
when worldly men, seeking to live softly and delicately, are intent only on
their own advantages? Well known from Cicero and others, is the threefold
division made by Epicurus; for he made this difference between lusts; he made
some natural and necessary, some natural and not necessary, and some neither
natural nor necessary. But John, well knowing the insubordination
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajtaxi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">)of
the human heart unhesitantly condemns the lust of the flesh, because it always
flows out immoderately, and never observes any due medium. He afterwards comes
gradually to grosser vices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The lust of the
eyes</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He includes, as I think,
libidinous looks as well as the vanity which delights in pomps and empty
splendor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the last place follows
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pride</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or haughtiness; with which is connected ambition, boasting, contempt of
others, blind love of self, headstrong self-confidence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of the whole is, that as soon as the world
presents itself, our lusts or desires, when our heart is corrupt, are captivated
by it, like unbridled wild beasts; so that various lusts, all which are adverse
to God, bear rule in us. The Greek word,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">bi&lt;ov</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>rendered life, (<i>vita</i>,)<i> </i>means the way or manner of
living.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the world passeth
away</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As there is nothing in the world
but what is fading, and as it were for a moment, he hence concludes that they
who seek their happiness from it, make a wretched and miserable provision for
themselves, especially when God calls us to the ineffable glory of eternal life;
as though he had said, &#8220;The<i> </i>true happiness which God offers to his
children, is eternal; it is then a shameful thing for us to be entangled with
the world, which with all its benefits will soon vanish away.&#8221; I take
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lust</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>here metonymically, as signifying what is desired or coveted, or what
captivates the desires of men. The meaning is, that what is most precious in the
world and deemed especially desirable, is nothing but a shadowy
phantom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying that they who do the will of God shall
abide </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>for
ever</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or perpetually, he means that they
who seek God shall be perpetually blessed. Were any one to object and say, that
no one doeth what God commands, the obvious answer is, that what is spoken of
here is not the perfect keeping of the law, but the obedience of faith, which,
however imperfect it may be, is yet approved by God. The will of God is first
made known to us in the law; but as no one satisfies the law, no happiness can
be hoped from it. But Christ comes to meet the despairing with new aid, who not
only regenerates us by his Spirit that we may obey God, but makes also that our
endeavor, such as it is, should obtain the praise of perfect
righteousness.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>It is the last
time</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or hour. He confirms the faithful
against offenses by which they might have been disturbed. Already many sects had
risen up, which rent the unity of faith and caused disorder in the churches. But
the Apostle not only fortifies the faithful, lest they should falter, but turns
the whole to a contrary purpose; for he reminds them that the last time had
already come, and therefore he exhorts them to a greater vigilance, as though he
had said, &#8220;Whilst<i> </i>various errors arise, it behooves you to be
awakened rather than to be overwhelmed; for we ought hence to conclude that
Christ is not far distant; let us then attentively look for him, lest he should
come upon us suddenly.&#8221; In the same way it behooves us to comfort
ourselves at this day, and to see by faith the near advent of Christ, while
Satan is causing confusion for the sake of disturbing the Church, for these are
the signs of the last time.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But so many ages having passed away since the death
of John, seem to prove that this prophecy is not true: to this I answer, that
the Apostle, according to the common mode adopted in the Scripture, declares to
the faithful, that nothing more now remained but that Christ should appear for
the redemption of the world. But as he fixes no time, he did not allure the men
of that age by a vain hope, nor did he intend to cut short in future the course
of the Church and the many successions of years during which the Church has
hitherto remained in the world. And doubtless, if the eternity of God&#8217;s
kingdom be borne in mind, so long a time will appear to us as a moment. We must
understand the design of the Apostle, that he calls that the last time, during
which all things shall be so completed, that nothing will remain except the last
revelation of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As ye have heard that antichrist
will come</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He speaks as of a thing well
known. We may hence conclude that the faithful had been taught and warned from
the beginning respecting the future disorder of the Church, in order that they
might, carefully keep themselves in the faith they professed, and also instruct
posterity in the duty of watchfulness. For it was God&#8217;s will that his
Church should be thus tried, lest any one knowingly and willingly should be
deceived, and that there might be no excuse for ignorance. But we see that
almost the whole world has been miserably deceived, as though not a word had
been said about Antichrist</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, under the Papacy there is nothing more
notorious and common than the future coming of Antichrist; and yet they are so
stupid, that they perceive not that his tyranny is exercised over them. Indeed,
the same thing happens altogether to them as to the Jews; for though they hold
the promises respecting the Messiah, they are yet further away from Christ than
if they had never heard his name; for the imaginary Messiah, whom they have
invented for themselves, turns them wholly aside from the Son of God; and were
any one to shew Christ to them from the Law and the Prophets, he would only
spend his labor in vain. The Popes have imagined an Antichrist, who for three
years and a half is to harass the Church. All the marks by which the Spirit of
God has pointed out Antichrist, clearly appear in the Pope; but the triennial
Antichrist lays fast hold on the foolish Papists, so that seeing they do not
see. Let us then remember, that Antichrist has not only been announced by the
Spirit of God, but that also the marks by which he may be distinguished have
been mentioned.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even now are there many
antichrists.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This may seem to have been
added by way of correction, as they falsely thought that it would be some one
kingdom; but it is not so. They who suppose that he would be only one man, are
indeed greatly mistaken. For Paul, referring to a future defection, plainly
shows that it would be a certain body or kingdom.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;530203&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Thessalonians 2:3.) He first predicts a defection that would prevail through the
whole Church, as a universal evil; he then makes the head of the apostasy the
adversary of Christ, who would sit in the temple of God, claiming for himself
divinity and divine honors. Except we desire willfully to err, we may learn from
Paul&#8217;s description to know Antichrist. That passage I have already
explained; it is enough now touch on it by the way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But how can that passage agree with the words of
John, who says that there were already many antichrists? To this I reply, that
John meant no other thing than to say, that some particular sects had already
risen, which were forerunners of a future Antichrist; for Cerinthus, Basilides,
Marcion, Valentinus, Ebion, Arrius, and others, were members of that kingdom
which the Devil afterwards raised up in opposition to Christ. Properly speaking,
Antichrist was not yet in existence; but the mystery of iniquity was working
secretly. But John uses the name, that he might effectually stimulate the care
and solicitude of the godly to repel frauds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if the Spirit of God even then commanded the
faithful to stand on their watch, when they saw at a distance only signs of the
coming enemy, much less is it now a time for sleeping, when he holds the Church
under his cruel and oppressive tyranny, and openly dishonors
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They went out from
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He anticipates another objection,
that the Church seemed to have produced these pests, and to have cherished them
for a time in its bosom. For certainly it serves more to disturb the weak, when
any one among us, professing the true faith, falls away, than when a thousand
aliens conspire against us. He then confesses that they had gone out from the
bosom of the Church; but he denies that they were ever of the Church. But the
way of removing this objection is, to say, that the Church is always exposed to
this evil, so that it is constrained to bear with many hypocrites who know not
Christ, really, however much they may by the mouth profess his
name.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By<i> </i>saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They went out from
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he means that they had previously
occupied a place in the Church, and were counted among the number of the godly.
He, however, denies that they were of them, though they had assumed the name of
believers, as chaff though mixed with wheat on the same floor cannot yet be
deemed wheat.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For if they had been of
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He plainly declares that those who
fell away had never been members of the Church. And doubtless the seal of God,
under which he keeps his own, remains sure, as Paul says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;550219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:19.) But here arises a difficulty, for it happens that many who seemed
to have embraced Christ, often fall away. To this I answer, that there are three
sorts of those who profess the Gospel; there are those who feign piety, while a
bad conscience reproves them within; the hypocrisy of others is more deceptive,
who not only seek to disguise themselves before men, but also dazzle their own
eyes, so that they seem to themselves to worship God aright; the third are those
who have the living root of faith, and carry a testimony of their own adoption
firmly fixed in their hearts. The two first have no stability; of the last John
speaks, when he says, that it is impossible that they should be separated from
the Church, for the seal which God&#8217;s Spirit engraves on their hearts
cannot be obliterated; the incorruptible seed, which has struck roots, cannot be
pulled up or destroyed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He does not speak here of the constancy of men, but
of God, whose election must be ratified. He does not then, without reason
declare, that where the calling of God is effectual, perseverance would be
certain. He, in short, means that they who fall away had never been thoroughly
imbued with the knowledge<i> </i>of Christ, but had only a light and a transient
taste of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That they might be made
manifest</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He shews that trial is useful
and necessary for the Church. It hence follows, on the other hand, that there is
no just cause for perturbation. Since the Church is like a threshing-floor, the
chaff must be blown away that the pure wheat may remain. This is what God does,
when he casts out hypocrites from the Church, for he then cleanses it from
refuse and filth.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But ye have an

himself for having so earnestly warned them, lest they should think that they
were indirectly reproved, as though they were rude and ignorant of those things
which they ought to have well known. So Paul conceded wisdom to the Romans, that
they were able and fit to admonish others. He at the same time shewed that they
stood in need of being reminded, in order that they might rightly perform their
duty.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:14, 15.) The Apostles did not, however, speak thus in order to flatter them;
but they thus wisely took heed lest their doctrine should be rejected by any,
for they declared what was suitable and useful, not only to the ignorant, but
also to those well instructed in the Lord&#8217;s school.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Experience teaches us how fastidious the ears of men
are. Such fastidiousness ought indeed to be far away from the godly; it yet
behooves a faithful and wise teacher to omit nothing by which he may secure a
hearing from all. And it is certain that we receive what is said with less
attention and respect, when we think that he who speaks disparages the knowledge
which has been given us by the Lord. The Apostle by this praise did at the same
time stimulate his readers, because they who were endued with the gift of
knowledge, had less excuse if they did not surpass others in their
proficiency.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The state of the case is, that the Apostle did not
teach them as though they were ignorant, and acquainted only with the first
elements of knowledge, but reminded them of things already known, and also
exhorted them to rouse up the sparks of the Spirit, that a full brightness might
shine forth in them. And in the next words he explained himself, having denied
that he wrote to them because they knew not the truth, but because they had been
well taught in it; for had they been wholly ignorant and novices, they could not
have comprehended his doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, when he says that they knew
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>it is not to be taken in the
widest sense, but ought to be confined to the subject treated of here. But when
he says that they had </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an unction
from the Holy One</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he alludes, no doubt,
to the ancient types. The oil by which the priests were anointed was obtained
from the sanctuary; and Daniel mentions the coming of Christ as the proper time
for anointing the Most Holy.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;270924&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Daniel
9:24.) For he was anointed by the Father, that he might pour forth on us a
manifold abundance from his own fullness. It hence follows that men are not
rightly made wise by the acumen of their own minds, but by the illumination of
the Spirit; and further, that we are not otherwise made partakers of the Spirit
than through Christ, who is the true sanctuary and our only high priest.<b>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And that no lie is of the
truth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He concedes to them a judgment,
by which they could distinguish truth from falsehood; for it is not the
dialectic proposition, that falsehood differs from truth, (such as are taught as
general rules in the schools;) but what is said is applied to that which is
practical and useful; as though he had said, that they did not only hold what
was true, but. were also so fortified against the impostures and fallacies of
the ungodly, that they wisely took heed to themselves. Besides, he speaks not of
this or of that kind of falsehood; but he says, that whatever deception Satan
might contrive, or in whatever way he might attack them, <i>they </i>would be
able readily to distinguish between light and darkness, because they had the
Spirit as their guide.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is a
liar</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He does not assert that they alone
were liars who denied that the Son of God appeared in the flesh, lest no one in
unloosing the knot should above measure torment himself; but that they surpassed
all others, as though he had said, that except<i> </i>this be deemed a lie,<i>
</i>no other could be so reckoned;<i> </i>as we are wont commonly to say,
&#8220;If perfidy towards God and men is not a crime, what else can we call a
crime?&#8221;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa13</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he had generally said of false prophets, he now
applies to the state of his own time; for he points out, as by the finger, those
who disturbed the Church. I readily agree with the ancients, who thought that
Cerinthus and Carpocrates are here referred to. But the denial of Christ extends
much wider; for it is not enough in words to confess that Jesus is the Christ,
except he is acknowledged to be such as the Father offers him to us in the
gospel. The two I have named gave the title of Christ to the Son of God, but
imagined him to be man only. Others followed them, such as Arius, who, adorning
him with the name of God, robbed him of his eternal divinity. Marcion dreamt
that he was a mere phantom. Sabellius imagined that he differed nothing from the
Father. All these denied the Son of God; for not one of them really acknowledged
the true Christ; but, adulterating, as far as they could, the truth respecting
him, they devised for themselves an idol instead of Christ. Then broke out
Pelagius, who, indeed, raised no dispute respecting Christ&#8217;s essence, but
allowed him to be true man and God; yet he transferred to us almost all the
honor that belongs to him. It is, indeed, to reduce Christ to nothing, when his
grace and power are set aside.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">So the Papists, at this day, setting up freewill in
opposition to the grace of the Holy Spirit, ascribing a part of their
righteousness and salvation to the merits of works, feigning for themselves
innumerable advocates, by whom they render God propitious to them, have a sort
of fictitious Christ, I know not what; but the lively and genuine image of God,
which shines forth in Christ, they deform by their wicked inventions; they
lessen his power, subvert and pervert his office.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that Christ, is denied, whenever those
things which peculiarly belong to him, are taken away from him. And as Christ is
the end of the law and of the gospel, and has in himself all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge, so he is the mark at which all heretics level and direct
their arrows. Therefore the Apostle does not, without reason, <i>make </i>those
the chief impostors, who fight against Christ, in whom the full truth is
exhibited to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He is
Antichrist</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He<i> </i>speaks not of that
prince of defection who was to occupy the seat of God; but all those who seek to
overthrow Christ, he puts them among that impious band. And that he might
amplify their crime, he asserts that the Father, no less than the Son, is denied
by them; as though he had said, &#8220;They have no longer any religion, because
they wholly cast away God.&#8221; And this he afterwards confirms, by adding
this reason, that the Father cannot be separated from the Son.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now this is a remarkable sentence, and ought to be
reckoned among the first axioms of our religion. yea, when we have confessed
that there is one true God, this second article ought necessarily<i> to </i>be
added, that he is no other but he who is made known in Christ. The Apostle does
not here treat distinctly of the unity of essence. It is, indeed, certain, that
the Son cannot be disunited from the Father, for he is of the same essence,<i>
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oJmoou&gt;siov</font><font face="Palatino">;)
but another thing is spoken of here, that is, that the Father, who is invisible,
has revealed himself only in his Son. Hence he is called the image of the
Father,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;580103&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
1:3,) because he sets forth and exhibits to us all that is necessary to be known
of the Father. For the naked majesty of God would, by its immense brightness,
ever dazzle our eyes; it is therefore necessary for us to look on Christ. This
is to come to the light, which is justly said to be otherwise
inaccessible.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I say, again, that there is not here a distinct
discussion respecting the eternal essence of Christ, which he has in common with
the Father. This passage is, indeed, abundantly sufficient to prove it: but John
calls us to this practical part of faith, that as God has given himself to us to
be enjoyed only in Christ, he is elsewhere sought for in vain; or (if any one
prefers what is clearer) that as in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Deity,
there is no God apart from him. It hence follows, that Turks, Jews, and such as
are like them, have a mere idol and not the true God. For by whatever titles
they may honor the God whom they worship, still, as they <i>reject </i>him
without whom they cannot come to God, and in whom God has really manifested
himself to us, what have they but some creature or fiction of their own? They
may flatter themselves as much as they please, with their own speculations, who,
without Christ, philosophize on divine things; it is still certain that they do
nothing but rave and rant, because, as Paul says, they hold not the Head.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510219&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:19.) It is obvious, hence, to conclude how necessary is the knowledge of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Many copies have the opposite sentence, &#8220;He who
confesses the Son,&#8221; etc. But as I think that a note by some copyist has
<i>crept </i>into the text, I hesitated not to omit it.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa14</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But if its insertion be approved, the meaning would be, that there is no right
confession of God except the Father be acknowledged in the Son.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any one to object and say, that many of the
ancients thought rightly of God, to whom Christ was not known: I allow that the
knowledge of Christ has not been always so explicitly revealed, nevertheless, I
contend that it has been always true, that as the light of the sun comes to us
by its rays, so the knowledge of God has been communicated through
Christ.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let that therefore abide in
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He annexes an exhortation to the
former doctrine; and that it might have more weight, he points out the fruit
they would receive from obedience. He then exhorts them to perseverance in the
faith, so that they might retain fixed in their hearts what they had
learnt.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>from the
beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he does not mean that
antiquity alone was sufficient to prove any doctrine true; but as he has already
shown that they had been rightly instructed in the pure gospel of Christ, he
concludes that they ought of right to continue in it. And this order ought to be
especially noticed; for were we unwilling to depart from that doctrine which we
have once embraced, whatever it may be, this would not be perseverance, but
perverse obstinacy. Hence, discrimination ought to be exercised, so that a
reason for our faith may be made evident from God&#8217;s word: then let
inflexible perseverance follow.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Papists boast of &#8220;a<i>
</i>beginning,&#8221; because they have imbibed their superstitions from
childhood. Under this pretense they allow themselves obstinately to reject the
plain truth. Such perverseness shews to us, that we ought always to begin with
the certainty of truth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In that which ye have
heard</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here is the fruit of
perseverance, that they in whom God&#8217;s truth remains, remain in God. We
hence learn what we are to seek in every truth pertaining to religion. He
therefore makes the greatest proficiency, who makes such progress as wholly to
cleave to God. But he in whom the Father dwells not through his Son, is
altogether vain and empty, whatever knowledge he may possess. Moreover, this is
the highest commendation of sound doctrine, that it unites us to God, and that
in it is found whatever pertains to the real fruition of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the last place, he reminds us that it is real
happiness when God dwells in us. The words he uses are ambiguous. They may be
rendered, &#8220;This<i> </i>is the promise which he has promised to us, even
eternal life.&#8221;<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa15</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
You may, however, adopt either of these renderings, for the meaning is still the
same. The sum of what is said is, that we cannot live otherwise than by
nourishing to the end the seed of life sown in our hearts. John insists much on
this point, that not only the beginning of a blessed life is to be found in the
knowledge of Christ, but also its perfection. But no repetition of it can be too
much, since it is well known that it has ever been a cause of ruin to men, that
being not content with Christ, they have had a hankering to wander beyond the
simple doctrine of the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These things have I written unto
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The apostle excuses himself again
for having admonished them who were well endued with knowledge and judgment. But
he did this, that they might apply for the guidance of the Spirit, lest his
admonition should be in vain; as though he had said, &#8220;I<i> </i>indeed do
my part, but still it is necessary that the Spirit of God should direct you in
all things; for in vain shall I, by the sound of my voice, beat your ears, or
rather the air, unless he speaks within you.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When we hear that he wrote concerning seducers, we
ought always to bear in mind, that it is the duty of a good and diligent pastor
not only to gather a flock, but also to drive away wolves&#8217; for what will
it avail to proclaim the pure gospel, if we connive at the impostures of Satan?
No one, then, can faithfully teach the Church, except he is diligent in
banishing errors whenever he finds them spread by seducers. What he says of the
<i>unction </i>having been received <i>from him</i>,<i> </i>I refer to
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye need
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Strange must have been the purpose
of John, as I have already said, if he intended to represent teaching as
useless. He did not ascribe to them so much wisdom, as to deny that they were
the scholars of Christ. He only meant that they were by no means so ignorant as
to need things as it were unknown to be taught them, and that he did not set
before them anything which the Spirit of God might not of himself suggest to
them. Absurdly, then, do fanatical men lay hold on this passage, in order to
exclude from the Church the use of the outward ministry. He says that the
faithful, taught by the Spirit, already understood what he delivered to them, so
that they had no need to learn things unknown to them. He said this, that he
might add more authority to his doctrine, while every one repeated in his heart
an assent to it, engraven as it were by the finger of God. But as every one had
knowledge according to the measure of his faith, and as faith in some was small,
in others stronger, and in none perfect, it hence follows, that no one knew so
much, that there was no room for progress.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is also another use to be made of this
doctrine, &#8212; that when men really understand what is needful for them, we
are yet to warn and rouse them, that they may be more confirmed. For what John
says, that they were taught all things by the Spirit, ought not to be taken
generally, but to be confined to what is contained in this passage. He had, in
short, no other thing in view than to strengthen their faith, while he recalled
them to the examination of the Spirit, who is the only fit corrector and
approver of doctrine, who seals it on our hearts, so that we may certainly know
that God speaks. For while faith ought to look to God, he alone can be a witness
to himself, so as to convince our hearts that what our ears receive has come
from him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the same is the meaning of these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the same anointing teaches you
of all things, and is truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">;<i> </i>that is,
the Spirit is like a seal, by which the truth of God is testified to you. When
he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and is no
lie</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he points out another office of the
Spirit, even that he endues us with judgment and discernment, lest we should be
deceived by lies, lest we should hesitate and be perplexed, lest we should
vacillate as in doubtful things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As it hath taught you, ye shall
abide in him</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or,<i> </i>abide in him.
He had said, that the Spirit abode in them; he now exhorts them to abide in the
revelation made by him, and he specifies what revelation it was,
&#8220;Abide,&#8221;<i> </i>he says, &#8220;in Christ, as the Spirit hath taught
you.&#8221; Another explanation, I know, is commonly given, &#8220;Abide<i>
</i>in it,&#8221; that is, the unction. But as the repetition which immediately
follows, cannot apply to any but to Christ, I have no doubt but that he speaks
here also of Christ; and this is required by the context; for the Apostle dwells
much on this point, that the faithful should retain the true knowledge of
Christ, and that they should not go to God in any other way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at the same time shews, that the children of God
are for no other end illuminated by the Spirit, but that they may know Christ.
Provided they turned not aside from him, he promised them the fruit of
perseverance, even confidence, so as not to be ashamed at his presence. For
faith is not a naked and a frigid apprehension of Christ, but a lively and real
sense of his power, which produces confidence. Indeed, faith cannot stand, while
tossed daily by so many waves, except it looks to the coming of Christ, and,
supported by his power, brings tranquillity to the conscience. But the nature of
confidence is well expressed, when he says that it can boldly sustain the
presence of Christ. For they who indulge securely in their vices, turn their
backs as it were on God; nor can they otherwise obtain peace than by forgetting
him. This is the security of the flesh, which stupefies men; so that turning
away from God, they neither dread sin nor fear death; and in the meantime they
shun the tribunal of Christ. But a godly confidence delights to look on God.
Hence it is, that the godly calmly wait for Christ, nor do they dread his
coming.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>9.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
If ye know that he is righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He
again passes on to exhortations, so that he mingles these continually with
doctrine throughout the Epistle; but he proves by many arguments that faith is
necessarily connected with a holy and pure life. The first argument is, that we
are spiritually begotten after the likeness of Christ; it hence follows, that no
one is born of Christ but he who lives righteously. It is at the same time
uncertain whether he means Christ or God, when he says that they who are born of
him do righteousness. It is a mode of speaking certainly used in Scripture, that
we are born of God in Christ; but there is nothing inconsistent in the other,
that they are born of Christ, who are renewed by his Spirit.<b>

</i>The second argument is from the dignity and excellency of our calling; for
it was not common honor, he says, that the heavenly Father bestowed on us, when
he adopted us as his children. This being so great a favor, the desire for
purity ought to be kindled in us, so as to be conformed to his image; nor,
indeed, can it be otherwise, but that he who acknowledges himself to be one of
God&#8217;s children should purify himself. And to make this exhortation more
forcible, he amplifies the favor of God; for when he says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>has been
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bestowed</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>he means that it is from mere bounty and benevolence that God makes us his
children; for whence comes to us such a dignity, except from the love of God?
Love, then, is declared here to be gratuitous. There is, indeed, an impropriety
in the language; but the Apostle preferred speaking thus rather than not to
express what was necessary to be known. He, in short, means that the more
abundantly God&#8217;s goodness has been manifested towards us, the greater are
our obligations to him, according to the teaching of Paul, when he besought the
Romans by the mercies of God to present themselves as pure sacrifices to him.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

<div><font face="Palatino">What the sophists say, that God foresees those who
are worthy to be adopted, is plainly refuted by these words, for, in this way
the gift would not be gratuitous. It behooves us especially to understand this
doctrine; for since the only cause of our salvation is adoption, and since the
Apostle testifies that this flows from the mere love of God alone, there is
nothing left to our worthiness or to the merits of works. For why are we sons?
Even because God began to love us freely, when we deserved hatred rather than
love. And as the Spirit is a pledge of our adoption, it hence follows, that if
there be any good in us, it ought not to be set up in opposition to the grace of
God, but, on the contrary, to be ascribed to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says that we are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>called</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>or named, the expression is not without its meaning; for it is God who with
his own mouth declares us to be sons, as he gave a name to Abraham according to
what he was.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa17</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therefore the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It is a trial that grievously
assaults our faith, that we are not so much regarded as God&#8217;s children, or
that no mark of so great an excellency appears in us, but that, on the contrary,
almost the whole world treats us with ridicule and contempt. Hence it can hardly
be inferred from our present state that God is a Father to us, for the devil so
contrives all things as to obscure this benefit. He obviates this offense by
saying that we are not as yet acknowledged to be such as we are, because the
world knows not God: a remarkable<i> </i>example of this very<i> </i>thing is
found in Isaac and Jacob; for though both were chosen by God, yet Ishmael
persecuted the former with laughter and taunts; and Esau, the latter with
threats and the sword. However, then, we may be oppressed by the world, still
our salvation remains safe and secure.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Now are we the sons of God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He comes now
to what every one knows and feels himself; for though the ungodly may not entice
us to give up our hope, yet our present condition is very short of the glow of
God&#8217;s children; for as to our body we are dust and a shadow, and death is
always before our eyes; we are also subject to thousand miseries, and the soul
is exposed to innumerable evils; so that we find always a hell within us. The
more necessary<i> </i>it is that all our thoughts should be withdrawn from the
present view of things, lest the miseries by which we are on every side
surrounded and almost overwhelmed, should shake our faith in that felicity which
as yet lies hid. For the Apostle&#8217;s meaning is this, that we act very
foolishly when we estimate what God has bestowed on us according to the present
state of things, but that we ought with undoubting faith to hold to that which
does not yet appear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But we know that when he shall
appear</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The conditional particle ought
to be rendered as an adverb of time,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>when</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>But the verb
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>appear</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>means not the same thing as when he used it before. The Apostle has just
said, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>it does not yet appear what
we shall be</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>because the fruit of our
adoption is as yet hid, for in heaven is our felicity, and we are now far away
traveling on the earth; for this fading life, constantly exposed to hundred
deaths, is far different from that eternal life which belongs to the children of
God; for being enclosed as slaves in the prison of our flesh, we are far distant
from the full sovereignty of heaven and earth. But the verb now refers to
Christ, <i>when</i>,<i> he shall appear</i>;<i> </i>for he teaches the same
thing with Paul, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
3:3, 4, where he says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Your<i> </i>life
is hid with Christ in God: when Christ, who is your life, shall appear, then
shall ye also appear with him in glow.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Colossians
3:3,4)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For our faith cannot stand otherwise than by looking
to the coming of Christ. The reason why God defers the manifestation of our
glory is this, because Christ is not manifested in the power of his kingdom.
This, then, is the only way of sustaining our faith, so that we may wait
patiently for the life promised to us. As soon as any one turns away the least
from Christ, he must necessarily fail.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa18</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>shews the certainty of faith, in order to distinguish it from opinion.
Neither simple nor universal knowledge is here intended, but that which every
one ought to have for himself, so that he may feel assured that he will be
sometime like Christ. Though, then, the manifestation of our glory is connected
with the coming of Christ, yet our knowledge of this is well
founded.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall be like
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He does not understand that we
shall be equal to him; for there must be some difference between the head and
the members; but we shall be like him, because he will make our vile body
conformable to his glorious body, as Paul also <i>teaches </i>us in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;500321&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Philippians
3:21. For the Apostle intended shortly to shew that the final end of our
adoption is, that what has in order preceded in Christ, shall at length be
completed in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The reason that is added may, however, seem
inappropriate. For if to see Christ makes us like him, we shall have this in
common with the wicked, for they shall also see his glory. To this I reply, that
this is to see him as a friend, which will not be the <i>case </i>with the
wicked, for they will dread his presence; nay, they will shun God&#8217;s
presence, and be filled with terror; his glow will so dazzle their eyes,<i>
</i>that they will be stupefied and confounded. For we see that Adam, conscious
of having done wrong, dreaded the presence of God. And God declared this by
Moses, as a general truth as to men,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;No man shall see
me and live.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;023320&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Exodus
33:20.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For how can it be otherwise but that God&#8217;s
majesty, as a consuming fire, will consume us as though we were stubble, so
great is the weakness of our flesh. But as far as the image of God is renewed in
us, we have eyes prepared to see God. And now, indeed, God begins to renew in us
his own image, but in what a small measure! Except then we be stripped of all
the corruption of the flesh, we shall not be able to behold God face to
face.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is also expressed here,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as he
is</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He does not, indeed, say, that there
is no seeing of God now; but as Paul says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;We<i> </i>see now
through a glass,
darkly.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">1
Corinthians 13:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he elsewhere makes a difference between this way
of living, and the seeing of the eye. In short, God now presents himself to be
seen by us, not such as he is, but such as we can comprehend. Thus is fulfilled
what is said by Moses, that we see only as it were his back,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;023323&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Exodus
33:23;) for there is too much brightness in his face.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must further observe, that the manner which the
Apostle mentions is taken from the effect, not from the cause; for he does not
teach us, that we shall be like him, because we shall see him; but he hence
proves that we shall be partakers of the divine glory, for except our nature
were spiritual, and endued with a heavenly and blessed immortality, it could
never come so nigh to God yet the perfection of glory will not be so great in
us, that our seeing will enable us to comprehend all that God is; for the
distance between us and him will be even then very great.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when the Apostle says, that we shall see him as
he is, he intimates a new and an ineffable manner of seeing him, which we enjoy
not now; for as long as we walk by faith, as Paul teaches us, we are absent from
him. And when he appeared to the fathers, it was not in his own essence, but was
ever seen under symbols. Hence the majesty of God, now hid, will then only be in
itself seen, when the veil of this mortal and corruptible nature shall be
removed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Refined questions I pass by: for we see how Augustine
tormented himself with these, and yet never succeeded, both in his Epistles to
Paulus and Fortunatus, and in the City of God, (2:2,) and in other places. What
he says, however, is worthy of being observed, that the way in which we live
avails more in this inquiry than the way in which we speak, and that we must
beware, lest by wrangling as to the manner in which God can be seen, we lose
that peace and holiness without which no one shall see him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And every man that hath this
hope</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He now draws this inference, that
the desire for holiness should not grow cold in us, because our happiness has
not as yet appeared, for that hope is sufficient; and we know that what is hoped
for is as yet hid. The meaning then is, that though we have not Christ now
present before our eyes, yet if we hope in him, it cannot be but that this hope
will excite and stimulate us to follow purity, for it leads us straight to
Christ, whom we know to be a perfect pattern of purity.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever
committeth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or doeth, sin. The Apostle has
already shown how ungrateful we must be to God, if we make but little account of
the honor of adoption, by which he of his own goodwill anticipates us, and if we
do not, at least, render him mutual love. He, at the same time, introduced this
admonition, that our love ought not to be diminished, because the promised
happiness is deferred. But now, as men are wont to indulge themselves more than
they ought, in evils, he reproves this perverse indulgence, declaring that all
they who sin are wicked and transgressors of the law. For it is probable that
there were then those who extenuated their vices by this kind of flattery,
&#8220;It is no wonder if we sin, because we are men; but there is a great
difference<i> </i>between sin and iniquity.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This frivolous excuse the Apostle now dissipates,
when he defines sin to be a transgression of the divine law; for his object was
to produce hatred and horror as to sin. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>seems light to some; but iniquity or transgression of the law cannot appear
to be so easily forgiven. But the Apostle does not make sins equal, by charging
all with iniquity who sin; but he means simply to teach us, that sin arises from
a contempt of God, and that by sinning, the law is violated. Hence this doctrine
of John has nothing in common with the delirious paradoxes of the
Stoics.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>here, does not mean to offend in some instances; nor is the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sin</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>to be taken for every fault or wrong a man may commit.; but he calls that
sin, when men with their whole heart run into evil, nor does he understand that
men sin, except those who are given up to sin. For the faithful, who are as yet
tempted by the lusts of the flesh, are not to be deemed guilty of iniquity,
though they are not pure or free from sin, but as sin does not reign in them,
John says that they do not sin, as I shall presently explain more
fully.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of the passage is, that the perverse life
of those who indulge themselves in the liberty of sinning, is hateful to God,
and cannot be borne with by him, because it is contrary to his Law. It does not
hence follow, nor can it be hence inferred, that the faithful are iniquitous;
because they desire to obey God, and abhor their own vices, and that in every
instance; and they also form their own life, as much as in <i>them </i>lieth,
according to the law. But when there is a deliberate purpose to sin, or a
continued course in sin, then the law is transgressed?<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa19</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And ye know that he was
manifested,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>or, hath appeared. He shews
by another argument how much sin and faith differ from one another; for it is
the office of Christ to take away sins, and for this end was he sent by the
Father; and it is by faith we partake of Christ&#8217;s virtue. Then he who
believes in Christ is necessarily cleansed from his sins. But it is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430129&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:29, that Christ takes away sins, because he atoned for them by the sacrifice
of his death, that they may not be imputed to us before God: John means in this
place that Christ really, and, so to speak, actually takes away sins, because
through him our old man is crucified, and his Spirit, by means of repentance,
mortifies the flesh with all its lusts. For the context does not allow us to
explain this of the remission of sins; for, as I have said, he thus reasons,
&#8220;They<i> </i>who cease not to sin, render void the benefits derived from
Christ, since he came to destroy the reigning power of sin.&#8221; This belongs
to the sanctification of the Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And in him is no
sin</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He does not speak of Christ
personally, but of his whole body.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa20</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Wherever Christ diffuses his efficacious grace, he denies that there is any more
room for sin. He, therefore, immediately draws this inference, that they sin not
who remain in Christ. For if he dwells in us by faith, he performs his own work,
that is, he cleanses us from sins. It hence appears what it is to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sin</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>For Christ by his Spirit does not perfectly renew us at once, or in an
instant, but he continues our renovation throughout life. It cannot then be but
that the faithful are exposed to sin as long as they live in the world; but as
far as the kingdom of Christ prevails in them, sin is abolished. In the meantime
they are designated according to the prevailing principle, that is, they are
said to be righteous and to live righteously, because they sincerely aspire to
righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They are said <i>not to sin</i>,<i> </i>because they
consent not to sin, though they labor under the infirmity of the flesh; but, on
the contrary, they struggle with groaning, so that they can truly testify with
Paul that they do the evil they would not.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that the faithful
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>abide</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in Christ, because we are by faith united to him, and made one with
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever sinneth hath not
seen him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>According to his usual manner
he added the opposite clause, that we may know that faith in Christ and
knowledge of him are vainly pretended, except there be newness of life. For
Christ is never dormant where he reigns, but the Spirit renders effectual his
power. And it may be rightly said of him, that he puts sin to flight, not
otherwise than as the sun drives away darkness by its own brightness. But we are
again taught in this place how strong and efficacious is the knowledge of
Christ; for it transforms us into his image. So by <i>seeing </i>and <i>knowing
</i>we are to understand no other thing than faith.</font><br></div>

he has spoken, that is between Christ and his members, appear, except by the
fruits they bring forth; as though he had said, &#8220;Since<i> </i>it behooves

sin,</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>This word, to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commit</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>or to do, refers also to outward works, so that the meaning is, that there
is no life of God and of Christ, where men act perversely and wickedly, but that
such are, on the contrary, the slaves of the devil; and by this way of speaking
he sets forth more fully how unlike they are to Christ. For as he has before
represented Christ as the fountain of all righteousness, so now, on the other
hand, he mentions the devil as the beginning of sin. He denied that any one
belongs to Christ except he who is righteous and shews himself to be such by his
works; he now assigns to the devil all others, and subjects them to his
government, in order that we may know that there is no middle condition, but
that Satan exercises his tyranny where the righteousness of Christ possesses not
the primacy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are not however two adverse principles, such as
the Manicheans have imagined; for we know that the devil is not wicked by nature
or by creation, but became so through defection. We know also that he is not
equal to God, so that he can with equal right or authority contend with him, but
that he is unwillingly under restraint, so that he can do nothing except at the
nod and with the permission of his Creator. John, in the last place, in saying
that some were born of God and some of the devil, imagined no tradition such as
the Manicheans dreamt of; but he means that. the former are governed and guided
by the Spirit of God, and that the others are led astray by Satan, as God grants
to him this power over the unbelieving.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For the Devil sinneth from the
beginning</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As before he spoke not of
Christ personally, when he said that he is righteous, but mentioned him as the
fountain and the cause of righteousness; so now, when he says that the Devil
sins, he includes his whole body, even all the reprobate; as though he had said,
this belongs to the Devil, to entice men to sin. It hence follows, that his
members, and all who are ruled by him, give themselves up to commit sin. But the
beginning which the Apostle mentions, is not from eternity, as when he says that
the Word is from the beginning, for there is a wide difference between God and
creatures. Beginning as to God, refers to no time. Since, then, the Word was
always with God, you can find no point of time in which he began to be, but you
must necessarily admit his eternity. But here John meant no other thing than
that the Devil had been an apostate since the creation of the world, and that
from that time he had never ceased to scatter his poison among
men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this purpose the Son of God was
manifested</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He repeats in other words
what he had before said, that Christ came to take away sins. Hence two
conclusions are to be drawn, that those in whom sin reigns cannot be reckoned
among the members of Christ, and that they can by no means belong to his body;
for wherever Christ puts forth his own power, he puts the Devil to flight as
well as sin. And this is what John immediately adds; for the next sentence,
where he says that those who sin not are born of God, is a conclusion from what
is gone before. It is an argument drawn from what is inconsistent, as I have
already said; for the kingdom of Christ, which brings righteousness with it,
cannot admit of sin. But I have already said what <i>not to sin </i>means. He
does not make the children of God wholly free from all sin; but he denies that
any can really glory in this distinction, except those who from the heart strive
to form their life in obedience to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Pelagians, indeed, and the Catharians did
formerly make a wrong use of this passage, when they vainly imagined that the
faithful are in this world endued with angelic purity; and in our own age some
of the Anabaptists have renewed this dotage. But all those who dream of a
perfection of this kind, sufficiently shew what stupid consciences they must
have. But the words of the Apostle are so far from countenancing their error,
that they are sufficient to confute it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that they <i>sin not </i>who are born of God.
Now, we must consider, whether God wholly regenerates us at once, or whether the
remains of the old man continue<i> </i>in us until death. If regeneration is not
as yet full and complete, it does not exempt us from the bondage of sin except
in proportion to its own extent. It hence appears that it cannot be but that the
children of God are not free from sins, and that they daily sin, that is, as far
as they have still some remnants of their old nature. Nevertheless, what the
Apostle contends for stands unalterable, that the design of regeneration is to
destroy sin, and that all who are born of God lead a righteous and a holy life,
because the Spirit of God restrains the lusting of sin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Apostle means the same thing by <i>the seed
</i>of God; for God&#8217;s Spirit so forms the hearts of the godly for holy
affections, that the flesh and its lusts do not prevail, but being subdued and
put as it were under a yoke, they are checked and restrained. In short, the
Apostle ascribes to the Spirit the sovereignty in the elect, who by his power
represses sin and suffers it not to rule and reign.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he cannot
sin</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here the Apostle ascends higher,
for he plainly declares that the hearts of the godly are so effectually governed
by the Spirit of God, that through an inflexible disposition they follow his
guidance. This is indeed far removed from the doctrine of the Papists. The
Sorbons, it is true, confess that the will of man, unless assisted by
God&#8217;s Spirit, cannot desire what is right; but they imagine such a motion
of the Spirit as leaves to us the free choice of good and evil. Hence they draw
forth merits, because<i> </i>we willingly obey<i> </i>the influence of the
Spirit, which it is in our power to resist. In short, they desire the grace of
the Spirit to be only this, that we are thereby enabled to choose right if we
will. John speaks here far otherwise; for he not only shews that we cannot sin,
but also that the power of the Spirit is so effectual, that it necessarily
retains us in continual obedience to righteousness. Nor is this the only passage
of Scripture which teaches us that the will is so formed that it cannot be
otherwise than right. For God testifies that he gives a new heart to his
children, and promises to do this, that they may walk in his commandments.
Besides, John not only shews how efficaciously God works once in man, but
plainly declares that the Spirit continues his grace in us to the last, so that
inflexible perseverance is added to newness of life. Let us not, then, imagine
with the Sophists that it is some neutral movement, which leaves men free either
to follow or to reject; but let us know that our own hearts are so ruled by
God&#8217;s Spirit, that they constantly cleave to
righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover; what the Sophists absurdly object, may be
easily refuted: they say that thus the will is taken away from man; but they say
so falsely: for the will is a natural power; but, as nature is corrupted, it has
only depraved inclinations. It is hence necessary that the Spirit of God should
renew it, in order that it may begin to be good. And, then, as men would
immediately fall away from what is good, it is necessary that the same Spirit
should carry on what he has begun, to the end.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to merit, the answer is obvious, for it cannot be
deemed strange that men merit nothing; and yet good works, which flow from the
grace of the Spirit, do not cease to be so deemed, because they are voluntary.
They have also a reward, for they are by grace ascribed to men as though they
were their own.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a question arises, Whether the fear and love
of God can be extinguished in any one who has been regenerated by the Spirit of
God? for that. this cannot be, seems to be the import of the Apostle&#8217;s
words. They who think otherwise refer to the example of David, who for a time
labored under such a beastly stupor, that not a spark of grace appeared in him.
Moreover, in the fifty-first Psalm, he prays for the restoration of the Spirit.
It hence follows that he was deprived of him. I, however, doubt not but that the
seed, communicated when God regenerates his elect, as it is incorruptible,
retains its virtue perpetually. I, indeed, grant that it may sometimes be
stifled, as in the case of David; but still, when all religion seemed to be
extinct in him, a live coal was hid under the ashes. Satan, indeed, labors to
root out whatever is from God in the elect; but when the utmost is permitted to
him, there ever remains a hidden root, which afterwards springs up. But John
does not speak of one act, as they say, but of the continued course of
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some fanatics dream of something I know not what,
that is, of an eternal seed in the elect, which they always bring from their
mother&#8217;s womb; but for this purpose they very outrageously pervert the
words of John; for he does not speak of eternal election, but begins with
regeneration.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are also those who are doubly frantic, who
hold, under this pretense, that, everything is lawful to the faithful, that is,
because John says that they cannot sin. They then maintain that we may follow
indiscriminately whatever our inclinations may lead us to. Thus they take the
liberty to commit adultery, to steal, and to murder, because there can be no sin
where God&#8217;s Spirit reigns. But far otherwise is the meaning of the
Apostle; for he denies that the faithful sin for this reason, because God has
engraven his law on their hearts, according to what the Prophet says
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;243133&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:33.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
In this the children of God are manifest.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>He shortly draws this conclusion, that those in vain claim a place and a
name among the children of God, who do not prove themselves to be such by a
pious and holy life, since by this evidence they shew that they differ from the
children of the devil. But he does not mean that they are rims manifested, so as
to be openly recognized by the whole world; but his meaning is only this, that
the fruit and adoption always appear in the life.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever doeth not
righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>To do righteousness and
to do sin, are here set in opposition the one to the other. Then, to do
righteousness is no other thing than to fear God from the heart, and to walk in
his commandments as far as human weakness will permit; for though righteousness
in a strict sense is a perfect keeping of the law, from which the faithful are
always far off; yet as offenses and fallings are not imputed to them by God,
righteousness is that imperfect obedience which they render to him. But John
declares that all who do not live righteously are not of God, because all those
whom God calls, he regenerates by his Spirit. Hence newness of life is a
perpetual evidence of divine adoption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither he who loveth not his
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He accommodates a general doctrine to
his own purpose. For hitherto he has been exhorting the faithful to brotherly
love; now, for the same end, he refers to true righteousness. Hence this clause
is added instead of an explanation. But I have already stated the reason why the
whole of righteousness is included in brotherly love. The love of God holds,
indeed, the first place; but as on it depends love towards men, it is often, as
a part for the whole, comprehended under it, and also the latter under the
former. Then he declares that every one who is endued with benevolence and
humanity, is thus just, and is to be so deemed, because love is rite fulfillment
of the law. He confirms this declaration by saying that the faithful had been so
<i>taught </i>from the beginning; for by these words he intimates that the
statement which he made ought not to have appeared new to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not as
Cain</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This is another confirmation,
taken from what is contrary; for in the reprobate and the children of the devil
hatred reigns, and it holds, as it were, the chief place in their life; and he
brings forward Cain as an instance. It served in the meantime to give them
consolation, as he at length concluded by saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Marvel not, if the world hate
you.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This explanation ought to be carefully noticed, for
men ever blunder as to the way of living, because they make holiness to consist
of fictitious works, and while they torment themselves with trifles, they think
themselves doubly acceptable to God, as the monks, who proudly call their mode
of living a state of perfection; nor is there any other worship of God under the
Papacy but a mass of superstitions. But the Apostle testifies that this
righteousness alone is approved by God, that is, if we love one another; and
further, that the devil reigns where hatred, dissimulation, envy, and enmity
prevail. We ought, however, at the same time, to bear in mind what I have
already touched upon, that brotherly love, as it proceeds from the love of God
as an effect from a cause, is not disjoined from it, but on the contrary is
commended by John on this account, because it is an evidence of our love to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cain</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>was driven to slay his brother, because his works were evil, he intimates
what I have already stated, that when impiety rules, hatred occupies the first
place. He refers to Abel&#8217;s righteous works, that we may learn to endure
patiently when the world hates us gratuitously, without any just,
provocation.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We
know.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>He commends love to us by a
remarkable eulogy, because it is an evidence of a transition from death to life.
It hence follows that if we love the brethren we are blessed, but that we are
miserable if we hate them. There is no one who does not wish to be freed and
delivered from death. Those then who by cherishing hatred willingly give
themselves up to death, must be extremely stupid and senseless. But when the
Apostle says, that it is known by love that we have passed into life, he does
not mean that man is his own deliverer, as though he could by loving the
brethren rescue himself from death, and procure life for himself; for he does
not here treat of the cause of salvation, but as love is the special fruit of
the Spirit, it is also a sure symbol of regeneration. Then the Apostle draws an
argument from the sign, and not from the cause. For as no one sincerely loves
his brethren, except he is regenerated by the Spirit of God, he hence rightly
concludes that the Spirit of God, who is life, dwells in all who love the
brethren. But it would be preposterous for ally one to infer hence, that life is
obtained by love, since love is in order of time posterior to
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The argument would be more plausible, were it said
that love makes us more certain of life: then confidence as to salvation would
recumb on works. But the answer to this is obvious; for though faith is
confirmed by all the graces of God as aids, yet it ceases not to have its
foundation in the mercy of God only. As for instance, when we enjoy the light,
we are certain that the sun shines; if the sun shines on the place in which we
are, we have a clearer view of it; but <i>yet </i>when the visible rays do not
come to us, we are satisfied that the sun diffuses its brightness for our
benefit. So when faith is founded on Christ, some things may happen to assist
it, still it rests on Christ&#8217;s grace alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is a
murderer</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>To stimulate us still more to
love, he shews how detestable before God is hatred. There is no one who dreads
not a murderer; nay, we all execrate the very name. But the Apostle declares
that all who hate their brethren are murderers. He could have said nothing more
atrocious; nor is what is said hyperbolical, for we wish him to perish whom we
hate. It does not matter if a man keeps his hands from mischief; for the very
desire to do harm, as well as the attempt, is condemned before God: nay, when we
do not ourselves seek to do an injury, yet if we wish an evil to happen to our
brother from some one else, we are murderers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the Apostle defines the thing simply as it is,
when he ascribes murder to hatred. Hence is proved the folly of men, that though
they abominate the name, they yet make no account of the crime itself. Whence is
this? even because the external face<i> </i>of things engrosses our thoughts;
but the inward feeling comes to an account before God. Let no one therefore
extenuate any more so grievous an evil. Let us learn to refer our judgments to
the tribunal of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hereby perceive
we</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or, By this we know. He now shews
what true love is; for it would not have been enough to commend it, unless its
power is understood. As an ill-stance of perfect love, he sets before us the
example of Christ; for he, by not sparing his own life, testified how much he
loved us. This then is the mark to which he bids them to advance. The sum of
what is said is, that our love is approved, when we transfer the love of
ourselves to our brethren, so that every one, in a manner forgetting himself,
should seek the good of others.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa21</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, indeed, certain, that we are far from being
equal to Christ: but the Apostle recommends to us the imitation of him; for
though we do not overtake him, it is yet meet, that we should follow his steps,
though at a distance. Doubtless, since it was the Apostle&#8217;s object to beat
down the vain boasting of hypocrites, who gloried that they had faith in Christ
though without brotherly love, he intimated by these words, that except this
feeling prevails in our hearts, we have no connection with Christ. Nor does he
yet, as I have said, set before us the love of Christ, so as to require us to be
equal to him; for what would this be but to drive us all to despair? But he
means that our feelings should be so formed and regulated, that we may desire to
devote our life and also our death, first to God, and then to our
neighbors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is another difference between us and Christ,
&#8212; the virtue or benefit of our death cannot be the same. For the wrath of
God is not pacified by our blood, nor is life procured by our death, nor is
punishment due to others suffered by us. But the Apostle, in this comparison,
had not in view the end or the effect of Christ&#8217;s death; but he meant only
that our life should be formed according to his example.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
But whose hath this world&#8217;s good</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>or, If any one has the world&#8217;s sustenance. He now speaks of the common
duties of love, which flow from that chief foundation, that is, when we are
prepared to serve our neighbors even to death. He, at the same time, seems to
reason from the greater to the less; for he who refuses to alleviate by his
goods the want of his brother, while his life is safe and secure, much less
would he expose for him his life to danger. Then he denies that there is love in
us, if we withhold help from our neighbors. But he so recommends this external
kindness, that at the same time he very fitly expresses the right way of doing
good, and what sort of feeling ought to be in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let this, then, be the first proposition, that no one
truly loves his brethren, except he really shews this whenever an occasion
occurs; the second, that as far as any one has the means, he is bound so far to
assist his brethren, for the Lord thus supplies us with the opportunity to
exercise love; the third, that the necessity of every one ought to be seen to,
for as any one needs food and drink or other things of which we have abundance,
so he requires our aid; the fourth, that no act of kindness, except accompanied
with sympathy, is pleasing to God. There are many apparently liberal, who yet do
not feel for the miseries of their brethren. But the Apostle requires that our
bowels should be opened; which is done, when we are endued with such a feeling
as to sympathize with others in their evils, no otherwise than as though they
were our own.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The love of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here he speaks of loving the
brethren; why then does he mention the love of God? even because this principle
is to be held, that it cannot be but that the love of God will generate in us
the love of the brethren.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa22</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

reproves their vanity, when he denies that there is reality except in the deed.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And hereby we
know</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or, by this we know. The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>he takes now in a different sense; but there is a striking similarity in the
words, &#8212; If we, in truth, love our neighbors, we have an evidence that we
are born of God, who is truth, or that the truth of God dwells in us. But we
must ever remember, that we have not from love the knowledge which the Apostle
mentions, as though we were to seek from it the certainty of salvation. And
doubtless we know not otherwise that we are the children of God, than as he
seals his free adoption on our hearts by his own Spirit., and as we receive by
faith the sure pledge of it offered in Christ. Then love is accessory or an
inferior aid, a prop to our faith, not a foundation on which it
rests.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why then does the Apostle say,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We shall assure our hearts before
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>He<i> </i>reminds us by these
words, that faith does not exist without a good conscience; not that assurance
arises from it or depends on it, but that then only we are really and not
falsely assured of our union with God, when by the efficacy of his Holy Spirit
he manifests himself in our love. For it is ever meet and proper to consider
what the Apostle handles; for as he condemns reigned and false profession of
faith, he says that a genuine assurance before God we cannot have, except his
Spirit produces in us the fruit of love. Nevertheless, though a good conscience
cannot be separated from faith, yet no one should hence conclude that we must
look to our works in order that our assurance may be certain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>0.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For if our heart condemn
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He proves, on the other hand, that
they hi vain possess the name and appearance of Christians, who have not the
testimony of a good conscience. For if any one is conscious of guilt, and is
condemned by his own heart, much less can he escape the judgment of God. It
hence follows, that faith is subverted by the disquiet of an evil
conscience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God is greater than our
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>with reference to judgment, that.
is, because he sees much more keenly than we do, and searches more minutely and
judges more severely. For this reason, Paul says, that though he was not
conscious of wrong himself, yet he was not therefore justified,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460404&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 4:4;) for he knew that however carefully attentive he was to his
office, he erred in many things, and through inadvertence was ignorant of
mistakes which God perceived. What then the Apostle means is, that he who is
harassed and condemned by his own conscience, cannot escape the judgment of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is what immediately follows, that
God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knoweth</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or seeth </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>For how can those things be hid
from him which we, who in comparison with him are dull and blind, are
constrained to see? Then take this explanation, &#8220;Since God sees all
things, he is far superior to our hearts.&#8221; For to render a copulative as a
causal particle is no new thing. The meaning is now clear, that since the
knowledge of God penetrates deeper than the perceptions of our conscience, no
one can stand before him except the integrity of his conscience sustains
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a question may be raised. It is certain that
the reprobate are sometimes sunk by Satan into such stupor, that they are no
longer conscious of their own evils, and. without alarm or fear, as Paul says,
rush headlong into perdition; it is also certain, that hypocrites usually
flatter themselves, and proudly disregard the judgment of God, for, being
inebriated by a false conceit as to their own righteousness, they feel no
convictions of sin. The answer to these things is not difficult; hypocrites are
deceived because they shun the light; and the reprobate feel nothing, because
they have departed from God; and, indeed there is no security for an evil
conscience but in hiding-places.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Apostle speaks here of consciences which God
draws forth to the light, forces to his tribunal, and fills with an apprehension
of his judgment. Yet; it is at the same time generally true, that we cannot have
a calm peace except that which God&#8217;s Spirit gives to purified hearts; for
those who, as we have said, are stupefied, often feel secret compunctions, and
torment themselves in their lethargy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If our heart condemns
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>I have already explained that this
refers not to <i>hypocrites </i>nor to the gross despisers of God. For how
muchsoever the reprobate may approve of their own lives, yet the Lord, as
Solomon says, weigheth their hearts.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;201602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
16:2.) This balance of God, by which he tries men, is such, that no one can
boast that he has a clean heart. The meaning, then, of the Apostle&#8217;s words
is, that then only we come in calm confidence into God&#8217;s presence, when we
bring with us the testimony of a heart conscious of what is right and honest.
That saying of Paul is indeed true, that by faith, which relies on the grace of
Christ, an <i>access </i>to God with confidence is opened to us,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:12;) and also, that peace is given us by faith, that our consciences may stand
peaceably before God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:1.) But there is not much difference between these sentences; for Paul shews
the cause of confidence, but John mentions only an inseparable addition, which
necessarily adheres to it, though it be not the cause.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here, however, arises a greater difficulty, which
seems to leave no confidence in the whole world; for who can be found whose
heart reproves him in nothing? To this I answer, that the godly are thus
reproved, that they may at the same time be absolved. For it is indeed necessary
that they should be seriously troubled inwardly for their sins, that terror may
lead them to humility and to a hatred of themselves; but they presently flee to
the sacrifice of Christ, where they have sure peace. Yet the Apostle says, in
another sense, that they are not condemned, because however deficient they may
confess themselves to be in many things, they are still relieved by this
testimony of conscience, that they truly and from the heart fear God and desire
to submit to his righteousness. All who possess this godly feeling, and at the
same time know that all their endeavors, how muchsoever they come short of
perfection, yet please God, are justly said to have a calm or a peaceful heart,
because there is no inward compunction to disturb their calm
cheerfulness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And whatsoever we
ask</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>These two things are connected,
confidence and prayer. As before he shewed that an evil conscience is
inconsistent with confidence, so now he declares that none can really pray to
God but those who with a pure heart, fear and rightly worship him. The latter
follows from the former. It is a general truth taught in Scripture, that the
ungodly are not heard by God, but that on the contrary, their sacrifices and
prayers are an abomination to him. Hence the door is here closed up against
hypocrites, lest they<i> </i>should in contempt of him rush into his
presence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He does not yet mean that a good conscience must be
brought, as though it obtained favor to our prayers. Woe<i> </i>to us if we look
on worlds, which have nothing in them but what is a cause of fear and trembling.
The faithful, then, cannot otherwise come to God&#8217;s tribunal than by
relying on Christ the Mediator. But as the love of God is ever connected with
faith, the Apostle, in order that he might the more severely reprove hypocrites,
deprives them of that singular privilege with which God favors his own children;
that is, lest they should think that their prayers have an access to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because we keep his
commandments</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he means not that
confidence in prayer is founded on our works; but he teaches this only, that
true religion and the sincere worship of God cannot be separated from faith. Nor
ought it to appear strange that he uses a causal particle, though he does not
speak of a cause; for an inseparable addition is sometimes mentioned as a cause
as when one says, Because the sun shines over us at midday, there is more heat;
but it does not follow that heat comes from light.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this is his
commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He<i> </i>again
accommodates a general truth to his own purpose. The meaning is, that such is
the discord between us and God, that we are kept off from an access to him,
except we are united by love to one another. At the same time he does not here
commend love alone, as before, but joins it as the companion and attendant of
faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Sophists by their glosses distort these words, as
though liberty to pray were obtained by us, partly by faith and partly by works.
As John requires us to keep God&#8217;s commandments that we may pray aright,
and afterwards teaches us that this keeping refers to faith and love, they
conclude, that from these two things ought we to derive confidence in prayer.
But I have already several times reminded you, that the subject here is not how
or by what means men may prepare themselves so that they may have confidence to
pray to God, for he speaks not here of the cause of ills or of any worthiness.
John only shews, that God favors none with the honor and privilege of
intercourse with himself but his own children, even those who have been
regenerated by his Spirit. The import, then, of what is said is, Where the fear
and love of God do not prevail, it cannot be that God will hear
prayer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But if it be our purpose to obey his commandments,
let us see what he commands. He does not, however, separate faith from love; but
he requires both together from us. And this is the reason why he uses the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commandment</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>in the singular number.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this is a remarkable passage; for he defines
briefly as well as lucidly in what the whole perfection of a holy life consists.
There is then no reason that we should allege ally difficulty, since God does by
no means lead us about through long labyrinths, but simply and shortly sets
before us what is right and what he approves. Besides, in this brevity there is
no obscurity, for he shews to us clearly the beginning and the end of a life
rightly formed. But that a mention is here only made of brotherly love, while
the love of God is omitted<b>,</b> the reason is, as we have elsewhere said,
that as brotherly love flows from the love of God, so it is a sure and real
evidence of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>On the name of his
Son</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The name refers to preaching; and
this connection deserves to be noticed, for few understand what it is to believe
on Christ; but from this mode of speaking, we may easily conclude that the only
right faith is that which embraces Christ as he is set forth in the Gospel.
Hence also it is, that there is no faith without teaching, as Paul also shews to
us in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451014&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
10:14. We must at the same time observe, that the Apostle includes faith in the
knowledge of Christ; for he is the living image of the Father, and in him are
laid up all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. As soon, then, as we turn
aside from him, we cannot do anything else but wander in error.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And he that keepeth his
commandments</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He confirms what. I have
already stated, that the union we have with God is evident when we entertain
mutual love: not that our union begins thereby, but that it cannot be fruitless
or without effect whenever it begins to exist. And he proves this by adding a
reason, because God does not abide in us, except his Spirit dwells in us. But
wherever the Spirit is, he necessarily manifests his power and efficiency. We
hence readily conclude, that none abide in God and are united to him, but those
who keep his commandments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, therefore, he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and by this we
know</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>the copulative,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>as a reason is here given, is to be rendered, &#8220;for,&#8221; or,
&#8220;because.&#8221; But the character of the present reason ought to be
considered; for though the sentence in words agrees with that of Paul, when he
says that the Spirit testifies to our hearts that we are the children of God,
and that we through him cry to God, Abba, Father, yet there is some difference
in the sense; for Paul speaks of the certainty of gratuitous adoption, which the
Spirit of God seals on our hearts; but John here regards the effects which the
Spirit produces while dwelling in us, as Paul himself does, when he says, that
those are God&#8217;s children who are led by the Spirit of God; for there also
he is speaking of the mortification of the flesh and newness of
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum of what is said is, that it hence appears
that we are God&#8217;s children, that is, when his Spirit rules and governs our
life. John at the same time teaches us, that whatever good works are done by us,
proceed from the grace of the Spirit, and that the Spirit is not obtained by our
righteousness, but is freely given to us.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">HE returns to his former doctrine, which he had
touched upon in the second chapter; for many (as it is usual in new things)
abused the name of Christ for the purpose of serving their own errors. Some made
a half profession of Christ; and when they obtained a place among his friends,
they had more opportunity to injure his cause. Satan took occasion to disturb
the Church, especially through Christ himself; for he is the stone of offense,
against whom all necessarily stumble who keep not on the right way, as shewn to
us by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what the Apostle says consists of three parts. He
first shews an evil dangerous to the faithful; and therefore he exhorts them to
beware. He <i>prescribes </i>how they were to beware, that is, by making a
distinction between the spirits; and this is the second part. In the third
place, he points out a particular error, the most dangerous to them, he
therefore forbids them to hear those who denied that the Son of God appeared in
the flesh. We shall now consider each in order.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But though in the passage this reason is added, that
many false prophets had gone forth into the world, yet it is convenient to begin
with it. The announcement contains a useful admonition; for if Satan had then
already seduced<i> </i>many, who under the name of Christ scattered their
impostures, similar instances at this day ought not to terrify us. For it is the
case perpetually with the Gospel, that Satan attempts to pollute and corrupt its
purity by variety of errors. This our age has brought forth some horrible and
monstrous sects; and for this reason many stand amazed; and not knowing where to
turn, they cast aside every<i> </i>care for religion; for they find no more
summary way for extricating themselves from the danger of errors. They thus,
indeed, act most, foolishly; for by shunning the light of truth, they cast
themselves into the darkness of errors. Let, therefore, this fact remain fixed
in our minds, that from the time the Gospel began to be preached, false prophets
immediately appeared; and the fact will fortify us against such
offenses.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The antiquity of errors keeps many, as it were, fast
bound, so that they dare not emerge from them. But John points out here all
intestine evil which was then in the Church. Now, if there were impostors mixed
then with the Apostles and other faithful teachers, what wonder is it, that the
doctrine of the Gospel has been long ago suppressed, and that many corruptions
have prevailed in the world? There is, then, no reason why antiquity should
hinder us to exercise our liberty in distinguishing between truth and
falsehood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Believe not every
spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>When the Church is disturbed by
discords and contentions, many, as it has been said, being frightened, depart
from the Gospel. But the Spirit prescribes to us a far different remedy, that
is, that the faithful should not receive any doctrine thoughtlessly and without
discrimination. We ought, then, to take heed lest, being offended at the variety
of opinions, we should discard teachers, and, together with them, the word of
God. But this precaution is sufficient, that all are not to be heard
indiscriminately.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>I take metonymically, as signifying him who boasts that he is endowed with
the gift of the Spirit to perform his office as a prophet. For as it was not
permitted to any one to speak in his own name, nor was credit given to speakers
but as far as they were the organs of the Holy Spirit, in order that prophets
might have more authority, God honored them with this name, as though he had
separated them from mankind in general. Those, then, were called spirits, who,
giving only a language to the oracles of the Holy Spirit, in a manner
represented him. They brought nothing of their own, nor came they forth in their
own name But the design of this honorable title was, that God&#8217;s word
should not lose the respect due to it through the humble condition of the
minister. For God would have his word to be always received from the mouth of
man no otherwise than if he himself had appeared from heaven.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here Satan interposed, and having sent false teachers
to adulterate God&#8217;s word, he gave them also this name, that they might
more easily deceive. Thus false prophets have always been wont superciliously
and boldly to claim for themselves whatever honor God had bestowed on his own
servants. But the Apostle designedly made use of this name, lest they who
falsely pretend God&#8217;s name should deceive us by their masks, as we see at
this day; for many are so dazzled by the mere name of a Church, that they
prefer, to their eternal ruin, to cleave to the Pope, than to deny him the least
part of his authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought, therefore, to notice this concession: for
the Apostle might have said that every sort of men ought not to be believed; but
as false teachers claimed the Spirit, so he left them to do so, having at the
same time reminded them that their claim was frivolous and nugatory, except they
really exhibited what they professed, and that those were foolish who, being
astonished at the very sound of so honorable a name, dared not to make any
inquiry on the subject.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Try the
spirits</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As all were not true prophets,
the Apostle here declares that they ought to have been examined and tried. And
he addresses not only the whole Church, but also every one of the
faithful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, whence have we this discernment?
They who answer, that the word of God is the rule by which everything that men
bring forward ought to be tried, say something, but not the whole. I grant that
doctrines ought to be tested by God&#8217;s word; but except the Spirit of
wisdom be present, to have God&#8217;s word in our hands will avail little or
nothing, for its meaning will not appear to us; as, for instance, gold is tried
by the or touchstone, but it. can only be done by those who understand the art;
for neither the touchstone nor the fire can be of any use to the unskillful.
That we may then be fit judges, we must necessarily be endowed with and directed
by the Spirit of discernment. But as the Apostle would have commanded this in
vain, were there no power of judging supplied, we may with certainty conclude,
that the godly shall never be left destitute of the Spirit of wisdom as to what
is necessary, provided they ask for him of the Lord. But the Spirit will only
thus guide us to a right discrimination, when we render all our thoughts subject
to God&#8217;s word; for it is, as it has been said, like the touchstone, yea,
it ought to be deemed most necessary to us; for that alone is true doctrine
which is drawn from it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a difficult question arises: If every one
has the right and the liberty to judge, nothing can be settled as certain, but
on the contrary the whole of religion will be uncertain. To this I answer, that
there is a twofold trial of doctrine, private and public. The private trial is
that by which every one settles his own faith, when he wholly acquiesces in that
doctrine which he knows has come from God; for consciences will never find a
safe and tranquil port otherwise than in God. Public trial refers to the common
consent and polity of the Church; for as there is danger lest fanatics should
rise up, who may presumptuously boast that they are endued with the Spirit of
God, it is a necessary remedy, that the faithful meet together and seek a way by
which they may agree in a holy and godly manner. But as the old proverb is too
true, &#8220;So many heads, so many opinions,&#8221; it is doubtless a singular
work of God, when he subdues our perverseness and makes us to think the same
thing, and to agree in a holy unity of faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what Papists under this pretense hold, that
whatever has been decreed in councils is to be deemed as certain oracles,
because the Church has once proved them to be from God, is extremely frivolous.
For though it be the ordinary way of seeking consent, to gather a godly and holy
council, when controversies may be determined according to God&#8217;s word; yet
God has never bound himself to the decrees of any council. Nor does it
necessarily follow, that as soon as a hundred bishops or more meet together in
any place, they have duly called on God and inquired at his mouth what is true;
nay, nothing is more clear that they have often departed from the pure word of
God. Then in this case also the trial which the Apostle prescribes ought to take
place, so that the spirits may be proved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.<i>

</i>or by this, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know
ye</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He lays down a special mark by which
they might more easily distinguish between true and false prophets. Yet he only
repeats here what we have met with before, that as Christ is the object at which
faith aims, so he is the stone at which all heretics stumble. As long then as we
abide in Christ, there is safety; but when we depart from him, faith is lost,
and all truth is rendered void.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa24</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us consider what this confession includes;
for when the Apostle says that Christ
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>came</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>we hence conclude that he was before with the Father; by which his eternal
divinity is proved. By saying that he came
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in the
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he means that by putting on
flesh, he became a real man, of the same nature with us, that he might become
our brother, except that he was free from every sin and corruption. And lastly,
by saying that he came, the cause of his coming must be noticed, for he was not
sent by the Father for nothing. Hence on this depend the office and merits of
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As, then, the ancient heretics departed from the
faith, in one instance, by denying the divine, and in another by denying the
human nature of Christ; so do the Papists at this day: though they confess
Christ to be God and man, yet they by no means retain the confession which the
Apostle requires, because they rob Christ of his own merit; for where freewill,
merits of works, fictitious modes of worship, satisfactions, the advocacy of
saints, are set up, how very little remains for Christ!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Apostle then meant this, that since the knowledge
of Christ includes the sum and substance of the doctrine respecting true
religion, our eyes ought to be directed to and fixed on that, so that we may not
be deceived. And doubtless Christ is the end of the law and the prophets; nor do
we learn anything else from the gospel but his power and grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this is that spirit of
Antichrist</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The Apostle added this, to
render more detestable the impostures which lead us away from Christ. We have
already said that the doctrine respecting the kingdom of Antichrist was well
known; so that the faithful had been warned as to the future scattering of the
Church, in order that they might exercise vigilance. Justly then did they dread
the name as something base and ominous. The Apostle says now, that all those who
depreciated Christ were members of that kingdom.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says that the spirit of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>antichrist</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>would
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>come</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>and that <i>it was </i>already in the world, but in a different sense. He
means that it was already in the world, because it carried on in secret its
iniquity. As, however, the truth of God had not as yet been subverted by false
and spurious dogmas, as superstition had not as yet prevailed in corrupting the
worship of God, as the world had not as yet perfidiously departed from Christ,
as tyranny, opposed to the kingdom of Christ, had not as yet openly exalted
itself, he therefore says, that it <i>would come</i>.</font><br></div>

now mentions many. But the many were the false prophets who had come forth
before the head appeared.<b>

But the Apostle&#8217;s object was to animate the faithful, that they might
courageously and boldly resist impostors, for alacrity is weakened when the
issue of the contest is doubtful. Besides, it might have caused the good to
fear, when they saw that hardly the kingdom of Christ had been set up, when
enemies stood ready to suppress it. Though then they must contend, yet he says
that they had conquered, because they would have a successful issue, as though
he had said that they were already, though in the middle of the contest;, beyond
any danger, because they would surely be conquerors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this truth ought to be farther extended, for
whatever contests we may have with the world and the flesh, a certain victory is
to follow. Hard and fierce conflicts indeed await us, and some continually
succeed others; but as by Christ&#8217;s power we fight and are furnished with
God&#8217;s weapons, we even by fighting and striving become conquerors. As to
the main subject of this passage, it is a great consolation, that with whatever
wiles Satan may assail us, we shall stand through the power of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must observe the reason which is immediately
added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>because
greater</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or stronger, is he who is in
you than he who is in the world. For such is our infirmity, that we succumb
before we engage with an enemy, for we are so immersed in ignorance that we are
open to all kinds of fallacies, and Satan is wonderfully artful in deceiving.
Were we to hold out for one day, yet a doubt may creep into our minds as to what
would be the case<i> </i>tomorrow; we should thus be in a state of perpetual
anxiety. Therefore the Apostle reminds us that we become strong, not by our own
power, but by that of God. He hence concludes, that we can no more be conquered
than God himself, who has armed us with his own power to the end of the world.
But in this whole spiritual warfare this thought ought; to dwell in our hearts,
that; it would be all over with us immediately were we to fight in our own
strength; but that as God repels our enemies while we are reposing, victory is
certain.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa26</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They are of the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It is no small consolation that
they who dare to assail God in us, have only the world to aid and help them. And
by the world the Apostle means that portion of which Satan is the prince.
Another consolation is also added, when he says that the world embraces through
the false prophets that which it acknowledges as its own.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa27</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We see what great propensity to vanity and falsehood there is in men. Hence
false doctrines easily penetrate and spread far and wide. The Apostle intimates
that there is no reason why we should on this account be disturbed, for it is
nothing new or unusual that the world, which is wholly fallacious, should
readily hearken to what is false.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We are of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Though this really applies to all
the godly, yet it refers properly to the faithful ministers of the Gospel; for
the Apostle, through the confidence imparted by the Spirit, glories here that he
and his fellow-ministers served God in sincerity, and derived from him whatever
they taught. It happens that false prophets boast of the same thing, for it is
their custom to deceive under the mask of God; but faithful ministers differ
much from them, who declare nothing of themselves but what they really manifest
in their conduct.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We ought, however, always to bear in mind the subject
which he here handles; small was the number of the godly, and unbelief prevailed
almost everywhere; few really adhered to the Gospel, the greater part were
running headlong into errors. Hence was the occasion of stumbling. John, in
order to obviate this, bids us to be content with the fewness of the faithful,
because all God&#8217;s children honored him and submitted to his doctrine. For
he immediately sets in opposition to this a contrary clause, that they who are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>not of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>do not hear the pure doctrine of
the Gospel. By these words he intimates that the vast multitude to whom the
Gospel is not acceptable, do not hear the faithful and true servants of God,
because they are alienated from God himself. It is then no diminution to the
authority of the Gospel that many reject it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But to this doctrine is added a useful admonition,
that by the obedience of faith we are to prove ourselves to be of God. Nothing
is easier than to boast that we are of God; and hence nothing is more common
among men, as the case is at this day with the Papists, who proudly vaunt that
they are the worshippers of God, and yet they no less proudly reject the word of
God. For though they pretend to believe God&#8217;s word, yet when they are
brought to the test, they close their ears and will not hear, and yet to revere
God&#8217;s word is the only true evidence that we fear him. Nor can the excuse,
made by many, have any place here, that they shun the doctrine of the Gospel
when proclaimed to them, because they are not fit to form a judgment; for it
cannot be but that every one who really fears and obeys God, knows him in his
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any one to object and say, that many of the
elect do not immediately attain faith, nay, that at first they stubbornly
resist; to this I answer, that at that time they are not to be regarded, as I
think, as God&#8217;s children; for it is a sign of a reprobate man when the
truth is perversely rejected by him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And by the way, it must be observed, that the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hearing</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>mentioned by the Apostle, is to be understood of the inward and real hearing
of the heart, which is done by faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hereby know
we</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The antecedent to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>hereby</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>or, by this, is included in the two preceding clauses, as though he had
said, &#8220;Hence the truth is distinguished from falsehood, because some speak
from God, others from the world.&#8221; But by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>spirit of truth and the spirit of
error</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>some think that hearers are
meant, as though he had said, that those who give themselves up to be
deceived<i> </i>by impostors, were born to error, and had in them the seed of
falsehood; but that they who obey the word of God shew themselves by this
<i>very </i>fact to be the children of the truth. This view I do not approve of.
For as the Apostle takes spirits here metonymically<i> </i>for teachers or
prophets, he means, I think, no other thing than that the trial of doctrine must
be referred to these two things, whether it be from God or from the world.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa28</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However, by thus speaking he seems to say nothing;
for all are ready to declare, that they do not speak except from God. So the
Papists at this day boast with magisterial gravity, that all their inventions
are the oracles of the Spirit. Nor does Mahomet assert that he has drawn his
dotages except from heaven. The Egyptians also, in former times, pretended that
all their mad absurdities, by which they infatuated themselves and others, had
been revealed from above. But, to all this I reply, that we have the word of the
Lord, which ought especially to be consulted. When, therefore, false spirits
pretend the name of God, we must inquire from the Scriptures whether things are
so. Provided a devout attention be exercised, accompanied with humility and
meekness, the spirit of discernment will be given us, who, as a faithful
interpreter, will open to us the meaning of what is said in
Scripture.</font><br></div>

</i>He returns to that exhortation which he enforces almost throughout the
Epistle. We have, indeed, said, that it is filled with the doctrine of faith and
exhortation to love. On these two points he so dwells, that he continually
passes from the one to the other.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><i>When </i>he commands <i>mutual </i>love, he does
not mean that we discharge this duty when we love our friends, because they love
us; but as he addresses in common the faithful, he could not have spoken
otherwise than that they were to exercise mutual love. He confirms this sentence
by a reason often adduced before, even because<i> </i>no one can prove himself
to be the son of God, except he loves his neighbors, and because the true
knowledge of God necessarily produces love in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He also sets in opposition to this, according to his
usual manner, the contrary clause, that there is no knowledge of God where there
is no love. And he takes as granted a general principle or truth, that God is
love, that is, that his nature is to love men. I know that many reason more
refinedly, and that the ancients especially<i> </i>have perverted this passage
in order to prove the divinity of the Spirit. But the meaning of the Apostle is
simply this, &#8212; that as God is the fountain of love, this effect flows from
him, and is diffused wherever the knowledge of him comes, as he had at the
beginning called him light, because there is nothing dark in him, but on the
contrary he illuminates all things by his own brightness. Here then he does not
speak of the essence of God, but only shews what he is found to be by
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But two things in the Apostle&#8217;s words ought to
be noticed, &#8212; that the true knowledge of God is that which regenerates and
renews us, so that we become new creatures; and that hence it cannot be but that
it must conform us to the image of God. Away, then, with that foolish gloss
respecting unformed faith. For when any one separates faith from love, it is the
same as though he attempted to take away heat from the sun.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In this was
manifested</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>or, has appeared. We have
the love of God towards us testified also by many other proofs. For if it be
asked, why the world has been created, why we have been placed in it to possess
the dominion of the earth, why we are preserved in life to enjoy innumerable
blessings, why we are endued with light and understanding, no other reason can
be adduced, except the gratuitous love of God. But the Apostle here has chosen
the principal evidence of it, and what far surpasses all other things. For it
was not only an immeasurable love, that God spared not his own Son, that by his
death he might restore us to life; but it was goodness the most marvelous, which
ought to fill our minds with the greatest wonder and amazement. Christ, then, is
so illustrious and singular a proof of divine love towards us, that whenever we
look upon him, he fully confirms to us the truth that God is
love.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls him his
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>only
begotten</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>for the sake of amplifying.
For in this he more clearly shewed how singularly he loved us, because he
exposed his only Son to death for our sakes. In the meantime, he who is his only
Son by nature, makes many sons by grace and adoption, even all who, by faith,
are united to his body. He expresses the end for which Christ has been sent by
the Father, even that we may live through him, for without him we are all dead,
but by his coming he brought life to us; and except our unbelief prevents the
effect of his grace, we feel it in ourselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Herein is
love</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He amplifies God&#8217;s love by
another reason, that he gave us his own Son at the time when we were enemies, as
Paul teaches us, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450508&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:8; but he employs other words, that God, induced by no love of men, freely
loved them. He meant by these words to teach us that God&#8217;s love towards us
has been gratuitous. And though it was the Apostle&#8217;s object to set forth
God as an example to be imitated by us; yet the doctrine of faith which he
intermingles, ought not to be overlooked. God freely loved us, &#8212; how so?
because he loved us before we were born, and also when, through depravity of
nature, we had hearts turned away from him, and influenced by no right and pious
feelings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were the prattlings of the Papists entertained, that
every one is chosen by God as he foresees him to be worthy of love, this
doctrine, that he first loved us, would not stand; for then our love to God
would be first in order, though hi time posterior. But the Apostle assumes this
as an evident truth, taught in Scripture (of which these profane Sophists are
ignorant,) that we are born so corrupt and depraved, that there is in us as it
were an innate hatred to God, so that we desire nothing but what is displeasing
to<b> </b>him, so that all the passions of our flesh carry on continual war with
his righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And sent his
Son</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It was then from God&#8217;s
goodness alone, as from a fountain, that Christ with all his blessings has come
to us. And as it is necessary to know, that we have salvation in Christ, because
our heavenly Father has freely loved us; so when a real and full certainty of
divine love towards us is sought for, we must look nowhere else but to Christ.
Hence all who inquire, apart from Christ, what is settled respecting them in
God&#8217;s secret counsel, are mad to their own ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he again points out the cause of Christ&#8217;s
coming and his office, when he says that he was sent to be a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>propitiation for our
sins</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>And first, indeed, we are taught
by these words, that we were all through sin alienated from God, and that this
alienation and discord remains until Christ intervenes to reconcile us. We are
taught, secondly, that it is the beginning of our life, when God, having been
pacified by the death of his Son, receives us unto favor: for
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>propitiation</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>properly refers to the sacrifice of his death. We find, then, that this
honor of expiating for the sins of the world, and of thus taking away the enmity
between God and us, belongs only to Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here some appearance of inconsistency arises. For
if God loved us before Christ offered himself to death for us, what need was
there for another reconciliation? Thus the death of Christ may seem to be
superfluous. To this I answer, that when Christ is said to have reconciled the
Father to us, this is to be referred to our apprehensions; for as we are
conscious of being guilty, we cannot conceive of God otherwise than as of one
displeased and angry with us, until Christ absolves us from guilt. For God,
wherever sin appears, would have his wrath, and the judgment of eternal death,
to be apprehended. It hence follows, that we cannot be otherwise than terrified
by the present prospect. as to death, until Christ by his death abolishes sin,
until he delivers us by his own blood from death. Further, God&#8217;s love
requires righteousness; that we may then be persuaded that we are loved, we must
necessarily come to Christ, in whom alone righteousness is to be
found.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now see that the variety of expressions, which
occurs in Scripture, according to different aspects of things, is most
appropriate and especially useful with regard to faith. God interposed his own
Son to reconcile himself to us, because he loved us; but this love was hid,
because we were in the meantime enemies to God, continually provoking his wrath.
Besides, the fear and terror of an evil conscience took away from us all
enjoyment of life. Thence as to the apprehension of our faith, God began to love
us in Christ. And though the Apostle here speaks of the first reconciliation,
let us yet know that to propitiate God to us by expiating sins is a perpetual
benefit proceeding from Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This the Papists also in part concede; but afterwards
they extenuate and almost annihilate this grace, by introducing their fictitious
satisfactions. For if men redeem themselves by their works, Christ cannot be the
only true propitiation, as he is called here.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Beloved</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>Now the Almighty accommodates to his own purpose what he has just taught us
respecting the love of God; for he exhorts us by God&#8217;s example to
brotherly love; as also Paul sets before us Christ, who offered himself to the
Father a sacrifice of pleasant fragrance, that every one of us might labor to
benefit his neighbors.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
5:2.) And John reminds us, that our love ought not to be mercenary, when he bids
us to love our neighbors as God has loved us; for we ought to remember this,
that we have been loved freely. And doubtless when we regard our own advantage,
or return good offices to friends, it is self-love, and not love to
others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>No man hath seen
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The same words are found in the
first chapter of John&#8217;s Gospel; but John the Baptist had not there exactly
the same thing in view, for he meant only that God could not be otherwise known,
but as he has revealed himself in Christ. The Apostle here extends the same
truth farther, that the power of God is comprehended by us by faith and love, so
as to know that we are his children and that he dwells in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He speaks, however, first of love, when he says, that
God </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>dwells in
us</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>if we love one another; for
perfected, or really proved to be, in us is then his love; as though he had
said, that God shews himself as present, when by his Spirit he forms our hearts
so that they entertain brotherly love. For the same purpose he repeats what he
had already said, that we know by the Spirit whom he has given us that he dwells
in us; for it is a confirmation of the former sentence,<i> </i>because love is
the effect or fruit of the Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The sum, then, of what is said is, that since love is
from the Spirit of God, we cannot truly and with a sincere heart love the
brethren, except the Spirit puts forth his power. In this way he testifies that
he dwells in us. But God by his Spirit dwells in us; then, by love we prove that
we have God abiding in us. On the other hand, whosoever boasts that he has God
and loves not the brethren, his falsehood is proved by this one thing, because
he separates God front himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and his love is
perfected</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>the conjunction is to be
taken as a causative, <i>for</i>,<i> </i>or, <i>because</i>.<i> </i>And <i>love
</i>here may be explained in two ways, either that which God shews to us, or
that which he implants in us. That God has given his Spirit to us, or given us
of his Spirit, means the same thing; for we know that the Spirit in a measure is
given to each individual.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we have
seen</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He now explains the other part of
the knowledge of God, which we have referred to, that he communicates himself to
us in his Son, and offers himself to be enjoyed in him. It hence follows, that
he is by faith received<i> </i>by us. For the design of the Apostle is to shew,
that God is so united to us by faith and love, that he really dwells in us and
renders himself in a manner visible by the effect of his power, who otherwise
could not be seen by us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When the Apostle says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have, seen and do
testify</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he refers to himself and
others. And by seeing, he does not mean any sort of seeing, but what belongs to
faith by which they recognized the glory of God in Christ, according to what
follows, that he was <i>sent </i>to be the <i>Savior of the world</i>;<i>
</i>and this knowledge flows from the illumination of the
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever shall
confess</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He repeats the truth, that we
are united to God by Christ, and that we cannot be connected with Christ except,
God abides in us. <i>Faith </i>and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>confession</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>are used indiscriminately in the same sense; for though hypocrites may
wisely boast of faith, yet the apostle here acknowledges none of those who
ordinarily confess, but such as truly and from the heart believe. Besides, when
he says </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that Jesus is the Son, of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he briefly includes the sum and
substance of faith; for there is nothing necessary for salvation which faith
finds not in Christ</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After having said in general, that men are so united
to Christ by faith, that Christ unites them to God, he subjoined what they
themselves had seen so that he accommodated a general truth to those to whom he
was writing. Then follows the exhortation, to love one another as they were
loved by God. Therefore the order and connection of his discourse is this,
&#8212; Faith in Christ, makes God<i> </i>to dwell in men, and we are partakers
of this grace; but as God is love, no one dwells in him except he loves his
brethren. Then love ought to reign in us, since God<i> </i>unites himself to
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we have known and
believed</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>It is the same as though he
had said, &#8220;We<i> </i>have known by believing;&#8221; for such knowledge is
not. attained but by faith. But we hence learn how different, is an uncertain or
doubtful opinion from faith. Besides, though he meant here, as I have already
said, to accommodate the last sentence to his readers, yet he defines faith in
various ways. He had said before, that it is to confess that Jesus is the Son of
God; but, he now says, We know by<b> </b>faith God&#8217;s love towards us. It
hence appears, that the paternal love of God is found in Christ, and that
nothing certain is known of Christ, except by those who know themselves to be
the children of God by his grace. For the Father sets his own, Son daily before
us for this end, that he may adopt us in him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God is
love</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This is as it were the minor
proposition in an argument; for from faith to love he reasons in this way: By
faith God dwells in us, and God is love; then, wherever God abides, love ought
to be there. Hence it follows that love is necessarily connected with
faith.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Herein is our love made
perfect</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<b><i> </i></b>There are two clauses in
this passage, &#8212; that we are then partakers of divine adoption, when we
resemble God as children their father; and<b>, </b>secondly, that. this
confidence is invaluable, for without it we must be most
miserable.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then in the first place, he shews to what purpose God
has in love embraced us, and how we enjoy that grace manifested to us in
Christ.. Then, God&#8217;s love to us is what is to be understood here. He says
it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>perfected</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>because it is abundantly poured forth and really given, that it appears to
be complete. But he asserts that no others are partakers of this blessing; but
those who, by being conformed to God, prove themselves to be his children. It
is, then, an argument taken from what is an inseparable
condition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That we may have
boldness</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He now begins to shew the
fruit of divine love towards us, though he afterwards shews it more clearly from
the contrary effect. It is, however, an invaluable benefit, that we can dare
boldly to stand before God. By nature, indeed, we dread the presence of God, and
that justly; for, as he is the Judge of the world, and our sins hold us guilty,
death and hell must come to our minds whenever we think of God. Hence is that
dread which I have mentioned, which makes men shun God as much as they can. But
John says that the faithful do not fear, when mention is made to them of the
last judgment, but that on the contrary they go to God&#8217;s tribunal
confidently and cheerfully, because they are assured of his paternal love. Every
one, then, has made so much proficiency in faith, as he is well prepared in his
mind to look forward to the day of judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As he
is</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>By these words, as it has been
already said, he meant that it is required of us at our turn to resemble the
image of God. What God then in heaven is, such he bids us to be in this world,
in order that we may be deemed his children; for the image of God, when it
appears in us, is as it were the seal of his adoption.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he seems thus to place a part of our confidence
on works. Hence the Papists raise their crests here, as though John denied that
we, relying on God&#8217;s grace alone, can have a sure confidence as to
salvation without the help of works. But in this they are deceived, because they
do not consider that the Apostle here does not refer to the cause of salvation,
but to what is added to it. And we readily allow that no one is reconciled to<i>
</i>God through Christ, except he is also renewed after God&#8217;s image, and
that the one cannot be disjoined from the other. Right then is what is done by
the Apostle, who excludes from the confidence of grace all those in whom no
image of God is seen; for it is certain that such are wholly aliens to the
Spirit of God and to Christ. Nor do we deny that newness of life, as it is the
effect of divine adoption, serves to confirm confidence, as a prop, so to speak,
of the second order; but in the meantime we ought to have our foundation on
grace alone.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa29</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Nor indeed does the doctrine of John appear otherwise consistent with itself;
for experience proves, and even Papists are forced to confess, that as to works
they always give an occasion for trembling. Therefore no one can come with a
tranquil mind to God&#8217;s tribunal, except he believes that he is freely
loved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that none of these things please the Papists,
there is no reason for any one to wonder, since being miserable they know no
faith except that which is entangled with doubts. Besides, hypocrisy<i>
</i>brings darkness over them, so that they do not seriously consider how
formidable is God&#8217;s judgment when Christ the Mediator is not present, and
some of them regard the resurrection as fabulous. But that we may cheerfully and
joyfully go forth to meet Christ, we must have our faith fixed on his grace
alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is no
fear</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He now commends the excellency of
this blessing by stating the contrary effect, for he says that we are
continually tormented until God delivers us from misery and anguish by the
remedy of his own love towards us. The meaning is, that as there is nothing more
miserable than to be harassed by continual inquietude, we obtain by knowing
God&#8217;s love towards us the benefit of a peaceful calmness beyond the reach
of fear. It hence appears what a singular gift of God it is to be favored with
his love. Moreover from this doctrine, he will presently draw an exhortation;
but before he exhorts us to duty, he commends to us this gift of God, which by
faith removes our fear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage, I know, is explained otherwise by many;
but I regard what the Apostle means, not what others think. They say that there
is no fear in love, because, when we voluntarily love God, we are not
constrained by force and fear to serve him. Then according to them, servile fear
is here set in opposition to voluntary reverence; and hence has arisen the
distinction between servile and filial fear. I indeed allow it to be true, that
when we willingly love God as a Father, we are no longer constrained by the fear
of punish-merit; but this doctrine has nothing in common with this passage, for
the Apostle only teaches us, that when the love of God is by us seen and known
by faith, peace is given to our consciences, so that they no longer tremble and
fear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may, however, be asked, when does perfect love
expel fear, for since we are endued with some taste only of divine love towards
us, we can never be wholly freed from fear? To this I answer, that, though fear
is not wholly shaken off, yet when we flee to God as to a quiet harbor, safe and
free from all danger of shipwreck and of tempests, fear is really expelled, for
it gives way to faith. Then fear is not so expelled, but that it assails our
minds, but it is so expelled that it does not torment us nor impede that peace
which we obtain by faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Fear hath
torment</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Here the Apostle amplifies
still further the greatness of that grace of which he speaks; for as it is a
most miserable condition to suffer continual torments, there is nothing more to
be wished than to present ourselves before God with a quiet conscience and a
calm mind. What some say, that servants fear, because they have before their
eyes punishment and the rod, and that they do not their duty except when forced,
has nothing to do, as it has been already stated, with what the Apostle says
here. So in the next clause, the exposition given, that he who fears is not
perfect in love, because<i> </i>he submits not willingly to God, but would
rather free himself from his service, does not comport at all with the context.
For the Apostle, on the contrary, reminds us, that it is owing to unbelief when
any one fears, that is, has a disturbed mind; for the love of God, really known,
tranquilizes the heart.<b>

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajgapw~men</font><font face="Palatino">
may be either in the indicative or imperative mood; but the former is the more
suitable here, for the Apostle, as I think, repeats the preceding sentence, that
as God has anticipated us by his free love, we ought to return to render love to
him, for he immediately infers that he ought to be loved in men, or that the
love we have for him ought to be manifested towards men. If, however, the
imperative mood be preferred, the meaning would be nearly the same, that as God
has freely loved us, we also ought now to love him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this love cannot exist, except it generates
brotherly love. Hence he says, that they are liars who boast that they love God,
when they hate their brethren.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the reason he subjoins seems not sufficiently
valid, for it is a comparison between the less and the greater: If, he says, we
love not our brethren whom we see, much less can we love God who is invisible.
Now there are obviously two exceptions; for the love which God has to us is from
faith and does not flow from sight, as we find in<b>
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;600108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Peter 1:8; and secondly, far different is the love of God from the love of men;
for while God leads his people to love him through his infinite goodness, men
are often worthy of hatred. To this I answer, that the Apostle takes here as
granted what ought no doubt to appear evident to us, that God offers himself to
us in those men who bear his image, and that he requires the duties, which he
does not want himself, to be performed to them, according to

argument, drawn from the authority and doctrine of Christ; for he not, only gave
a commandment respecting the love of God, but bade us also to love our brethren.
We must therefore so begin with God, as that there may be at the same time a
transition made to men.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whosoever
believeth</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He confirms by another
reason, that faith and brotherly love are united; for since God regenerates us
by faith he must necessarily be loved by us as a Father; and this love embraces
all his children. Then faith cannot be separated from love.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The first truth is, that all, born of God, believe
that, Jesus is the Christ; where, again, you see that Christ alone is set forth
as the object of faith, as in him it finds righteousness, life, and every
blessing that can be desired, and God in all that he is.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa31</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Hence the only true way of believing is when we direct our minds to him.
Besides, to believe that he is the Christ, is to hope from him all those things
which have been promised as to the Messiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Nor is the title, Christ, given him here without
reason, for it designates the office to which he was appointed by the Father.
As, under the Law, the full restoration of all things, righteousness and
happiness, were promised through the Messiah; so at this day the whole of this
is more clearly set forth in the gospel. Then Jesus cannot be received as
Christ, except salvation be sought from him, since for this end he was sent by
the Father, and is daily offered to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence the Apostle declares that all they who really
believe have been born of God; for faith is far above the reach of the human
mind, so that we must be drawn to Christ by our heavenly Father; for not any of
us can ascend to him by his own strength. And this is what the Apostle teaches
us in his Gospel, when he says, that those who believe in the name of the
only-begotten, were not born of blood nor of the flesh.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430113&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
1:13.) And Paul says, that we are endued, not with the spirit of this world, but
with the Spirit that is from God, that we may know the things given us by him.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460212&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:12.) For eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor the mind conceived,
the reward laid up for those who love God; but the Spirit alone penetrates into
this mystery. And further, as Christ is given to us for sanctification, and
brings with it the Spirit of regeneration, in short, as he unites us to his own
body, it is also another reason why no one can have faith, except he is born of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Loveth him also that is begotten of
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Augustine and some others of the
ancients have applied this to Christ, but not correctly. For though the Apostle
uses the singular number, yet he includes all the faithful; and the context
plainly shows that his purpose was no other than to trace up brotherly love to
faith as its fountain. It is, indeed, an argument drawn from the common course
of nature; but what. is seen among men is transferred to God.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa32</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must observe, that the Apostle does not so
speak of the faithful only, and pass by those who are without, as though the
former are alone to be loved, and no care and no account to be had for the
latter; but he teaches us as it were by this first exercise to love all without
exception, when he bids us to make a beginning with the godly.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa33</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By this we
know</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He briefly shows in these words
what true love is, even that which is towards God. He has hitherto taught us
that there is never a true love to God, except when our brethren are also loved;
for this is ever its effect. But he now teaches us that men are rightly and duly
loved, when God holds the primacy. And it is a necessary definition; for it
often happens, that we love men apart from God, as unholy and carnal friendships
regard only private advantages or some other vanishing objects. As, then, he had
referred first to the effect, so he now refers to the cause; for his purpose is
to shew that mutual love ought to be in such a way cultivated that God may be
honored.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the love of God he joins the keeping of the law,
and justly so; for when we love God as our Father and Lord, reverence must
necessarily be connected with love. Besides, God cannot be separated from
himself. As, then, he is the fountain of all righteousness and equity, he who
loves him must necessarily have his heart prepared to render obedience to
righteousness. The love of God, then, is not idle or inactive.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa34</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But from this passage we also learn what is the
keeping of the law. For if, when constrained only by fear, we obey God by
keeping his commandments, we are very far off from true obedience. Then, the
first thing is, that our hearts should be devoted to God in willing reverence,
and then,<i> </i>that our life should be formed according to the rule of the
law. This is what Moses meant when, in giving a summary of the law, he
said,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;O<i> </i>Israel,
what does the Lord thy God require of thee, but to love him and to obey
him?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;051012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Deuteronomy
10:12.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>His commandments are not
grievous</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This has been added, lest
difficulties, as it is usually the case, should damp or lessen our zeal. For
they who with a. cheerful mind and great ardor have pursued a godly and holy
life, afterwards grow weary, finding their strength inadequate. Therefore John,
in order to rouse our efforts, says that God&#8217;s commandments are not
grievous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may, on the other hand, be objected and said
that we have found it far otherwise by experience, and that Scripture testifies
that the yoke of the law is insupportable.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441502&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:2.) The reason also is evident, for as the denial of self is, as it were, a
prelude<i> </i>to the keeping of the law, can we say that it is easy for a man
to deny himself? nay, since the law is spiritual, as Paul, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450714&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
7:14, teaches us, and we are nothing but flesh, there must be a great discord
between us and the law of God. To this I answer, that this difficulty does not
arise from the nature of the law, but from our corrupt flesh; and this is what
Paul expressly declares; for after having said that it was impossible for the
Law to confer righteousness on us, he immediately throws<b> </b>the blame on our
flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This explanation fully reconciles what is said by
Paul and by David, which apparently seems wholly contradictory. Paul makes the
law the master of death, declares that it effects nothing but to bring on us the
wrath of God, that if, was given to increase sin, that it lives in order to kill
us. David, on the other hand, says that it is sweeter than honey, and more
desirable than gold; and among other recommendations he mentions the following
&#8212; that it cheers hearts, converts to the Lord, and quickens. But Paul
compares the law with the corrupt nature of man; hence arises the conflict: but
David shews how they think and feel whom God by his Spirit has renewed; hence
the sweetness and delight of which the flesh knows nothing. And John has not
omitted this difference; for he confines to God&#8217;s children these words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God&#8217;s commandments are not
grievous</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>lest any one should take them
literally; and he intimates that, it comes through the power of the Spirit, that
it is not grievous nor wearisome to us to obey God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The question, however, seems not as yet to be fully
answered; for the faithful, though ruled by the Spirit, of God, yet, carry on a
hard contest with their own flesh; and how muchsoever they may toil, they yet
hardly perform the half of their duty; nay, they almost fail under their burden,
as though they stood, as they say, between the sanctuary and the steep. We see
how Paul groaned as one held captive, and exclaimed that he was wretched,
because he could not fully serve God. My reply to this is, that the law is said
to be easy, as far as we are endued with heavenly power, and overcome the lusts
of the flesh. For however the flesh may resist, yet the faithful find that there
is no real enjoyment except in following God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It must further be observed, that John does not speak
of the law only, which contains nothing but commands, but connects with it the
paternal indulgence of God, by which the rigor of the law is mitigated. As,
then, we know that we are graciously forgiven by the Lord, when our works do not
come up to the law, this renders us far more prompt to obey, according to what
we find in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;19D004&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
130:4,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;With thee is
propitiation, that thou mayest be feared.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence, then, is the facility of keeping the law,
because the faithful, being sustained by pardon, do not despond when they come
short of what they ought to be. The Apostle, in the meantime, reminds us that we
must fight, in order that we may serve the Lord; for the whole world hinders us
to go where the Lord calls us. Then, he only keeps the law who courageously
resists the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the
victory</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As he had said that all who are
born of God overcome the world, he also sets forth the way of overcoming it. For
it might be still asked, whence comes this victory? He then makes the victory
over the world to depend on faith.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa35</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage is remarkable for though Satan
continually repeats his dreadful and horrible onsets, yet the Spirit of God,
declaring that we are beyond the reach of danger, removes fear, and animates us
to fight with courage. And the past time is more emphatical than the present or
the future; for he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that has
overcome</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>in order that we might feel
certain, as though the enemy had been already put to flight. It is, indeed,
true, that our warfare continues through life, that our conflicts are daily,
nay, that new and various battles are every moment on every side stirred up
against us by the enemy; but as God does not arm us only for one day, and as
faith is not that of one day, but is the perpetual work of the Holy Spirit, we
are already partakers of victory, as though we had already
conquered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This confidence does not, however, introduce
indifference, but renders us always anxiously intent on fighting. For the Lord
thus bids his people to be certain, while yet he would not have them to be
secure; but on the contrary, he declares that they have already overcome, in
order that they may fight more courageously and more
strenuously.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>world</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>has here a wide meaning, for it includes whatever is adverse to the Spirit
of God: thus, the corruption of our nature is a part of the world; all lusts,
all the crafts of Satan, in short, whatever leads us away from God. Having such
a force to contend with, we have an immense war to carry on, and we should have
been already conquered before coming to the contest, and we should be conquered
a hundred times daily, had not God promised to us the victory. But God
encourages us to fight by promising us the victory. But as this promise secures
to us perpetually the invincible power of God, so, on the other hand, it
annihilates all the strength of men. For the Apostle does not teach us here that
God only brings some help to us, so that being aided by him, we may be
sufficiently able to resist; but he makes victory to depend on faith alone; and
faith receives from another that by which it overcomes. They then take away from
God what is his own, who sing triumph to their own power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is he that overcometh the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This is a reason for the previous
sentence; that is, we conquer by faith, because we derive strength from Christ;
as Paul also says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I<i> </i>can do
all things through him that strengtheneth me,&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino">He only then can conquer Satan and the world, and not
succumb to his own flesh, who, diffident as to himself, recumbs on
Christ&#8217;s power alone. For by<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

by which we apply his power to ourselves.</font><br></div>

</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is he than
came</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>That our faith may rest safely on
Christ, he says the real substance of the shadows of the law appears in him. For
I doubt not but that he alludes by the words
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>water and
blood</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>to the ancient rites of the law.
The comparison, moreover, is intended for this end, not only that we may know
that the Law of Moses was abolished by the coming of Christ, but that we may
seek in him the fulfillment of those things which the ceremonies formerly
typified. And though they were of various kinds, yet under these two the Apostle
denotes the whole perfection of holiness and righteousness, for by water was all
filth washed away, so that men might come before God pure and clean, and by
blood was expiation made, and a pledge given of a full reconciliation with God;
but the law only adumbrated by external symbols what was to be really and fully
performed by the Messiah.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">John then fitly proves that Jesus is the Christ of
the Lord formerly promised, because he brought. with. him that by which he
sanctifies us wholly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And, indeed, as to the blood by which Christ
reconciled God, there is no doubt, but how he came by water may be questioned.
But that the reference is to baptism is not probable. I certainly think that
John sets forth here the fruit and effect of what he recorded in the Gospel
history; for what he says there, that water and blood flowed from the side of
Christ, is no doubt to be deemed a miracle. I know that such a thing does happen
naturally to the dead; but it happened through God&#8217;s purpose, that
Christ&#8217;s side became the fountain of blood and water, in order that the
faithful may know that cleansing (of which the ancient baptisms were types) is
found in him, and that they might know that what all the sprinklings of blood
formerly presignified was fulfilled. On this subject we dwelt more at large on
the ninth and tenth chapters of the Epistle to the Hebrews.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And it is the Spirit that beareth
witness</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He shews in this clause how the
faithful know and feel the power of Christ, even because the Spirit renders them
certain; and that their faith might not vacillate, he adds, that a full and real
firmness or stability is produced by the testimony of the Spirit. And he calls
the Spirit
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>because his authority is indubitable, and ought to be abundantly sufficient
for us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There are three than bear
record in heaven</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The whole of this
verse has been by some omitted. Jerome thinks that this has happened through
design rather than through mistake, and that indeed only on the part of the
Latins. But as even the Greek copies do not agree, I dare not assert any thing
on the subject. Since, however, the passage flows better when this clause is
added, and as I see that it is found in the best and most approved copies, I am
inclined to receive it as the true reading.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa36</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
And the meaning would be, that God, in order to confirm most abundantly our
faith in Christ, testifies in three ways that we ought to acquiesce in him. For
as our faith acknowledges three persons in the one divine essence, so it is
called in so really ways to Christ that it may rest on him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These three are
one</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he refers not to essence, but on
the contrary to consent; as though he had said that the Father and his eternal
Word and Spirit harmoniously testify the same thing respecting Christ. Hence
some copies have </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">eijv
e{n</font><font face="Palatino">, &#8220;for one.&#8221; But though you read
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">e{n
eijsin</font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>as in other copies, yet there is no
doubt but that the Father, the Word and the Spirit are said to be one, in the
same sense in which afterwards the blood and the water and the Spirit are said
to agree in one.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as the Spirit, who is one witness, is mentioned
twice, it seems to be an unnecessary repetition. To this I reply, that since he
testifies of Christ in various ways, a twofold testimony is fitly ascribed to
him. For the Father, together with his eternal Wisdom and Spirit, declares Jesus
to be the Christ as it were authoritatively, then, in this ease, the sole
majesty of the deity is to be considered by us. But as the Spirit, dwelling in
our hearts, is an earnest, a pledge, and a seal, to confirm that decree, so he
thus again speaks on earth by his grace.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But inasmuch as all do not receive this reading, I
will therefore so expound what follows, as though the Apostle referred to the
witnesses only on the earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There are
three</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He applies what had been said of
water and blood to it&#8217;s own purpose, in order that they who reject Christ
might have no excuse; for by testimonies abundantly strong and clear, he proves
that it is he who had been formerly promised, inasmuch as water and blood, being
the pledges and the effects of salvation, really testify that he had been sent
by God. He adds a third witness, the Holy Spirit, who yet holds the first place,
for without him the wafer and blood would have flowed without any benefit; for
it is he who seals on our hearts the testimony of the water and blood; it is he
who by his power makes the fruit of Christ&#8217;s death to come to us; yea, he
makes the blood shed for our redemption to penetrate into our hearts, or, to say
all in one word, he makes Christ with all his blessings to become ours. So Paul,
in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:4, after having said that Christ by his resurrection manifested himself to be
the Son of God, immediately adds, &#8220;Through the sanctification of the
Spirit.&#8221; For whatever signs of divine glory may shine forth in Christ,
they would yet be obscure to us and escape our vision, were not the Holy Spirit
to open for us the eyes of faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Readers may now understand why John adduced the
Spirit as a witness together with the water and the blood, even because it is
the peculiar office of the Spirit, to cleanse our consciences by the blood of
Christ, to cause the cleansing effected<i> </i>by it to be efficacious. On this
subject some remarks are made at the beginning of the Second Epistle of Peter,
where he uses nearly the same mode of speaking, that is, that the Holy Spirit
cleanses our hearts by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ.<b> 
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa37</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But from these words we may learn, that faith does
not lay hold on a bare or an empty Christ, but. that his power is at the same
time vivifying. For to what purpose has Christ been sent on the earth, except to
reconcile God by the sacrifice of his death? except the office of washing had
been allotted to him by the Father?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may however be objected, that the distinction here
mentioned is superfluous, because Christ cleansed us by expiating our sins; then
the Apostle mentions the same thing twice. I indeed allow that cleansing is
included in expiation; therefore I made no difference between the water and the
blood, as though they were distinct; but if any one of us considers his own
infirmity, he will readily acknowledge that it is not in vain or without reason
that blood is distinguished from the water. Besides, the Apostle, as it has been
stated, alludes to the rites of the law; and God, on account of human infirmity,
had formerly appointed, not only sacrifices, but also washings. And the Apostle
meant distinctly to show that the reality of both has been exhibited in Christ,
and on this account he had said before, &#8220;Not<i> </i>by water only,&#8221;
for he means, that not only some part of our salvation is found in Christ, but
the whole of it, so that nothing is to be sought elsewhere.</font><br></div>

to the greater, how ungrateful men are when they reject Christ, who has been
approved, as he has related, by God; for if in worldly affairs we stand to the
words of men, who may lie and deceive, how unreasonable it is that God should
have less credit given to the, when sitting as it were on his own throne, where
he is the supreme judge. Then our own corruption alone prevents us to receive
Christ,, since he gives us full proof for believing in his power. Besides, he
calls not only that the testimony of God which the Spirit imprints on our
hearts, but also that which we derive from the water and the blood. For that
power of cleansing and expiating was not earthly, but heavenly. Hence the blood
of Christ is not to be estimated according to the common manner of men; but we
must rather look to the design of God, who ordained it for blotting out sins,
and also to that divine efficacy which flows from it.</font><br></div>

does not mean here the cause, but is to be taken as explanatory; for the
Apostle, after having reminded us that God deserves to be believed much more
than men, now adds, that we can have no faith in God, except by believing in
Christ, because God sets him alone before us and makes us to stand in him. He
hence infers that we believe safely and with tranquil minds in Christ, because
God by his authority warrants our faith. He does not say that God speaks
outwardly, but that every one of the godly feels within that God is the author
of his faith. It hence appears how different from faith is a fading opinion
dependent on something else.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that believeth
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As the faithful possess this
benefit, that they know themselves to be beyond the danger of erring, because
they have God as their foundation; so he makes the ungodly to be guilty of
extreme blasphemy, because they charge God with falsehood. Doubtless nothing is
more valued by God than his own truth, therefore no wrong more atrocious can be
done to him, than to rob him of this honor. Then in order to induce us to
believe, he takes an argument from the opposite side; for if to make God a liar
be a horrible and execrable impiety, because then what especially belongs to him
is taken away, who would not dread to withhold faith from the gospel, in which
God would have himself to be counted singularly true and faithful? This ought to
be carefully observed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some wonder why God commends faith so much, why
unbelief is so severely condemned. But the glory of God is implicated in this;
for since he designed to shew a special instance of his truth in the gospel, all
they who reject Christ there offered to them, leave nothing to him. Therefore,
though we may grant that a man in other parts of his life is like an angel, yet
his sanctity is diabolical as long&#8217; as he rejects Christ. Thus we see some
under the Papacy vastly pleased with the mere mask of sanctity, while they still
most obstinately resist the gospel. Let us then understand, that it is the
beginning of true religion, obediently to embrace this doctrine, which he has so
strongly confirmed by his testimony.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That God hath given, us
eternal life</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Having now set, forth the
benefit, he invites us to believe. It is, indeed, a reverence due to God,
immediately to receive, as beyond controversy, whatever he declares to us. But
since he freely offers life to us, our ingratitude will be intolerable, except
with prompt faith we receive a doctrine so sweet and so lovely. And, doubtless,
the words of the Apostle are intended to shew, that we ought, not only
reverently to obey the gospel, lest we should affront God; but, that we ought to
love it, because it brings to us eternal life. We hence also learn what is
especially to be sought in the gospel, even the free gift of salvation; for that
God there exhorts us to repentance and fear, ought not to be separated from the
grace of Christ</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Apostle, that he might keep us together in
Christ, again repeats that life is found in him; as though he had said, that no
other way of obtaining life has been appointed for us by God the Father. And the
Apostle, indeed, briefly includes here three things: that we are all given up to
death until God in his gratuitous favor restores us to life; for he plainly
declares that life is a gift from God: and hence also it follows that we are
destitute of it, and theft it. cannot be acquired by merits; secondly, he
teaches us that this life is conferred on us by the gospel, because there the
goodness and the paternal love of God is made known to us; lastly, he says that
we cannot otherwise become partakers of this life than by believing in
Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that hath not the
Son</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This is a confirmation of the last
sentence. It ought, indeed, to have been sufficient, that God made life to be in
none but in Christ, that it might be sought in him; but lest any one should turn
away to another, he excludes all from the hope of life who seek it not in
Christ. We know what it is to have Christ, for he is possessed by faith. He then
shews that all who are separated from the body of Christ are without
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this seems inconsistent with reason; for history
shews that there have been great men, endued with heroic virtues, who yet were
wholly unacquainted with Christ; and it seems unreasonable that men of so great
eminence had no honor. To this I answer, that we are greatly mistaken if we
think that whatever is eminent in our eyes is approved by God; for, as it is
said in Luke,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;What<i> </i>is
highly esteemed by men is an abomination with God.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421615&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
16:15)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For as the filthiness of the heart is hid from us, we
are satisfied with the external appearance; but God sees that under this is
concealed<i> </i>the foulest filth. It is, therefore, no wonder if specious
virtues, flowing from an impure heart, and tending to no right end, have an ill
odor to him. Besides, whence comes purity, whence a genuine regard for religion,
except from the Spirit of Christ? There is, then, nothing worthy of praise
except in Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is, further, another reason which removes every
doubt; for the righteousness of men is in the remission of sins. If you take
away this, the sure curse of God and eternal death awaits all. Christ alone is
he who <i>reconciles </i>the Father to us, as he has once for all pacified him
by the sacrifice of the cross. It hence follows, that God is propitious to none
but in Christ, nor is there righteousness but in him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any one to object and say, that Cornelius, as
mentioned by Luke,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441002&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
10:2,) was accepted of God before he was called to the faith of the gospel: to
this I answer shortly, that God sometimes so deals with us, that the seed of
faith appears immediately on the first day. Cornelius had no clear and distinct
knowledge of Christ; but as he had some perception of God&#8217;s mercy, he must
at the same time understand something of a Mediator. But as God acts in ways
hidden and wonderful, let us disregard those speculations which profit nothing,
and hold only to that plain way of salvation, which he has made known to
us.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>These things have I written unto
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As there ought to be a daily
progress in faith, so he says that he wrote to those who had already believed,
so that they might believe more firmly and with greater certainty, and thus
enjoy a fuller confidence as to eternal life. Then the use of doctrine is, not
only to initiate the ignorant in the knowledge of Christ, but also to confirm
those more and more who have been already taught. It therefore becomes us
assiduously to attend to the duty of learning, that our faith may increase
through the whole course of our life. For there are still in us many remnants of
unbelief, and so weak is our faith that what we believe is not yet really
believed except there be a fuller confirmation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we ought to observe the way in which faith is
confirmed, even by having the office and power of Christ explained to us. For
the Apostle says that he wrote these things, that is, that eternal life is to be
sought nowhere else but in Christ, in order that they who were believers already
might believe, that is, make progress in believing. It is therefore the duty of
a godly teacher, in order to confirm disciples in the faith, to extol as much as
possible the grace of Christ, so that being satisfied with that, we may seek
nothing else.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As the Papists obscure this truth in various ways,
and extenuate it, they shew sufficiently by this one thing that they care<i>
</i>for nothing less than for the right doctrine of faith; yea, on this account,
their schools ought to be more shunned than all the Scyllas and Charybdises in
the world; for hardly any one can enter them without a sure shipwreck to his
faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Apostle teaches further ill this passage, that
Christ is the peculiar object of faith, and that to the faith which we have in
his name is annexed the hope of salvation. For in this case the end of believing
is, that we become the children and the heirs of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And this is the
confidence</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He commends the faith which
he mentioned by its fruit, or he shews that in which our confidence especially
is, that is, that the godly dare confidently to call on God; as also Paul speaks
in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490312&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
3:12, that we have by faith access to God with confidence; and also in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450815&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:15,<i> </i>that the Spirit gives us a mouth to cry Abba, Father. And
doubtless, were we driven away from an access to God, nothing could make us more
miserable; but, on the other hand, provided this asylum be opened to us, we
should be happy even in extreme evils; nay, this one thing renders our troubles
blessed, because we surely know that God will be our deliverer, and relying on
his paternal love towards us, we flee to him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us, then, bear in mind this declaration of the
Apostle, that calling on God is the chief trial of our faith, and that God is
not rightly nor in faith called upon except we be fully persuaded that our
prayers will not be in vain. For the Apostle denies that those who, being
doubtful, hesitate, are endued with faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence appears that the doctrine of faith is buried
and nearly extinct under the Papacy, for all certainty is taken away. They
indeed mutter many prayers, and prattle much about praying to God; but they pray
with doubtful and fluctuating hearts, and bid us to pray; and yet they even
condemn this confidence which the Apostle requires as
necessary.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According to his
will</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>By this expression he meant by the
way to remind us what is the right way or rule of praying, even when men subject
their own wishes to God. For though God has promised to do whatsoever his people
may ask, yet he does not allow them an unbridled liberty to ask whatever may
come to their minds; but he has at the same time prescribed to them a law
according to which they are to pray. And doubtless nothing is better for us than
this restriction; for if it was allowed to every one of us to ask what he
pleased, and if God were to indulge us in our wishes, it would be to provide
very badly for us. For what may be expedient we know not; nay, we boil over with
corrupt and hurtful desires. But God supplies a twofold remedy, lest we should
pray otherwise than according to what his own will has prescribed; for he
teaches us by his word what he would have us to ask, and he has also set over us
his Spirit as our guide and ruler, to restrain our feelings, so as not to suffer
them to wander beyond due bounds. For what or how to pray, we know not, says
Paul, but the Spirit helpeth our infirmity, and excites in us unutterable
groans.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450826&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:26.) We ought also to ask the mouth of the Lord to direct and guide our
prayers; for God in his promises has fixed for us, as it has been said, the
right way of praying.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if we
know</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This is not a superfluous
repetition, as it seems to be; for what the Apostle declared in general
respecting the success of prayer, he now affirms in a special manner that the
godly pray or ask for nothing from God but what they obtain. But when he says
that all the petitions of the faithful are heard, he speaks of right and humble
petitions, and such as are consistent with the rule of obedience. For the
faithful do not give loose reins to their desires, nor indulge in anything that
may please them, but always regard in their prayers what God
commands.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This, then, is an application of the general doctrine
to the special and private benefit of every one, lest the faithful should doubt
that God is propitious to prayers of each individual, so that<i> </i>with quiet
minds they may wait until the Lord should perform what they pray for, and that
being thus relieved from all trouble and anxiety, they may cast on God the
burden of their cares. This ease and security ought not, however, to abate in
them their earnestness in prayer, for he who is certain of a happy event ought
not to abstain from praying to God. For the certainty of faith by no means
generates indifference or sloth. The Apostle meant; that every one should be
tranquil in these necessities when he has deposited his sighs in the bosom of
God.</font><br></div>

man</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>The Apostle extends still further
the benefits of that faith which he has mentioned, so that our prayers may also
avail for our brethren. It is a great thing, that as soon as we are oppressed,
God kindly invites us to himself, and is ready to give us help; but that he
hears us asking for others, is no small confirmation to our faith in order that
we may be fully assured that we shall never meet with a repulse in our own
case.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Apostle in the meantime exhorts us to be mutually
solicitous for the salvation of one another; and he would also have us to regard
the falls of the brethren as stimulants to prayer. And surely it is an iron
hardness to be touched with no pity, when we see souls redeemed by
Christ&#8217;s blood going to ruin. But he shews that there is at hand a remedy,
by which brethren can aid brethren. He who will pray for the perishing, will, he
says, restore life to him; though the words, &#8220;he shall give,&#8221; may be
applied to God, as though it was said, God will grant to your prayers the life
of a brother. But the sense will still be the same, that the prayers of the
faithful so far avail as to rescue a brother from death. If we understand man to
be intended, that he will give life to a brother, it is a hyperbolical
expression; it however contains nothing inconsistent; for what is given to us by
the gratuitous goodness of God, yea, what is granted to others for our sake, we
are said to give to others. So great a benefit ought to stimulate us not a
little to ask for our brethren the forgiveness of sins. And when the Apostle
recommends sympathy to us, he at the same time reminds us how much we ought to
avoid the cruelty of condemning our brethren, or an extreme rigor in despairing
of their salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A sin which is not unto
death</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>That we may not cast away all
hope of the salvation of those who sin, he shews that God does not so grievously
punish their falls as to repudiate them. It hence follows that we ought to deem
them brethren, since God retains them in the number of his children. For he
denies that sins are to death, not only those by which the saints daily offend,
but even when it happens that God&#8217;s wrath is grievously provoked by them.
For as long as room for pardon is left, death does not wholly retain its
dominion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Apostle, however, does not here distinguish
between venial and mortal sin, as it was afterwards commonly done. For
altogether foolish is that distinction which prevails under the Papacy. The
Sorbons acknowledge that there is hardly a mortal sin, except there be the
grossest baseness, such as may be, as it were, tangible. Thus in venial sins
they think that there may be the greatest filth, if hidden in the soul. In
short, they suppose that all the fruits of original sin, provided they appear
not outwardly, are washed away by the slight sprinkling of holy water! And what
wonder is it, since they regard not as blasphemous sins, doubts respecting
God&#8217;s grace, or any lusts or evil desires, except they are consented to?
If the soul of man be assailed by unbelief, if impatience tempts him to rage
against God, whatever monstrous lusts may allure him, all these are to the
Papists lighter than to be deemed sins, at least after baptism. It is then no
wonder, that they make venial offenses of the greatest crimes; for they weigh
them in their own balance and not in the balance of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But among the faithful this ought to be an
indubitable truth, that whatever is contrary to God&#8217;s law is sin, and in
its nature mortal; for where there is a transgression of the law, there is sin
and death.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, then, is the meaning of the Apostle? He denies
that sins are mortal, which, though worthy of death, are yet not thus punished
by God. He therefore does not estimate sins in themselves, but forms a judgment
of them according to the paternal kindness of God, which pardons the guilt,
where yet the fault is. In short, God does not give over to death those whom he
has restored to life, though it depends not on them that they are not alienated
from life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is a sin unto
death</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>I have already said that the sin
to which there is no hope of pardon left, is thus called. But it may be asked,
what this is; for it must be very atrocious, when God thus so severely punishes
it. It may be gathered from the context, that it is not, as they say, a partial
fall, or a transgression of a single commandment, but apostasy, by which men
wholly alienate themselves from God. For the Apostle afterwards adds, that the
children of God do not sin, that is, that they do not forsake God, and wholly
surrender themselves to Satan, to be his slaves. Such a defection, it is no
wonder that it is mortal; for God never thus deprives his own people of the
grace of the Spirit; but they ever retain some spark of true religion. They must
then be reprobate and given up to destruction, who thus fall away so as to have
no fear of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any one to ask, whether the door of salvation is
closed against their repentance; the answer is obvious, that as they are given
up to a reprobate mind, and are destitute of the Holy Spirit, they cannot do
anything else, than with obstinate minds, become worse and worse, and add sins
to sins. Moreover, as the sin and blasphemy against the Spirit ever brings with
it a defection of this kind, there is no doubt but that it is here pointed
out.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked again, by what evidences can we
know that a man&#8217;s fall is fatal; for except the knowledge of this was
certain, in vain would the Apostle have made this exception, that they were not
to pray for a sin of this kind. It is then right to determine sometimes, whether
the fallen is without hope, or whether there is still a place for a remedy.
This, indeed, is what I allow, and what is evident beyond dispute from this
passage; but as this very seldom happens, and as God sets before us the infinite
riches of his grace, and bids us to be merciful according to his own example, we
ought not rashly to conclude that any one has brought on himself the judgment of
eternal death; on the contrary, love should dispose us to hope well. But if the
impiety of some appear to us not otherwise than hopeless, as though the Lord
pointed it out by the finger, we ought not to contend with the just judgment of
God, or seek to be more merciful than he is.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All
unrighteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>This passage may be
explained variously. If you take it adversatively, the sense would not be
unsuitable, &#8220;Though all unrighteousness is sin, yet every sin is not unto
death.&#8221; And equally suitable is another meaning, &#8220;As sin is every
unrighteousness, hence it follows that every sin is not unto death.&#8221; Some
take </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>all
unrighteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>for complete
unrighteousness, as though the Apostle had said, that the sin of which he spoke
was<i> </i>the summit of unrighteousness. I, however, am more disposed to
embrace the first or the second explanation; and as the result is nearly the
same, I leave it to the judgment of readers to determine which of the two is the
more appropriate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We know that whosoever is
born of God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>If you suppose that
God&#8217;s children are wholly <i>pure </i>and free from all sin, as the
fanatics contend, then the Apostle is inconsistent with himself; for he would
thus take away the duty of mutual prayer among brethren. Then he says that those
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sin
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>who do not wholly fall away from the
grace of God; and hence he inferred that prayer ought to be made<i> </i>for all
the children of God, because they sin not unto death. A proof is added, That
every one, born of God, keeps himself, that is, keeps himself in the fear of
God; nor does he suffer himself to be so led away, as to lose all sense of
religion, and to surrender himself wholly to the devil and the
flesh.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For when he says, that he is not
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>touched</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>by </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that wicked
one</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>reference is made to a deadly
wound; for the children of God do not remain untouched by the assaults of Satan,
but they ward off his strokes by the shield of faith, so that they do not
penetrate into the heart. Hence spiritual life is never extinguished in them.
This is not to sin. Though the faithful indeed fall through the infirmity of the
flesh, yet they groan under the burden of sin, loathe themselves, and cease not
to fear God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keepeth
himself</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What properly belongs to God he
transfers to us; for were any one of us the keeper of his own salvation, it
would be a miserable protection. Therefore Christ asks the Father to keep us,
intimating that it is not done by our own strength. The advocates of freewill
lay hold on this expression, that they may thence prove, that we are preserved
from sin, partly by God&#8217;s grace, and partly by our own power. But they do
not perceive that the faithful have not from themselves the power of
preservation of which the Apostle speaks. Nor does he, indeed, speak of their
power, as though they could keep themselves by their own strength; but he only
shews that they ought to resist Satan, so that they may never be fatally wounded
by his darts. And we know that we fight with no other weapons but those of God.
Hence the faithful keep themselves from sin, as far as they are kept by God.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We are of
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>He deduces an exhortation from his
previous doctrine; for what he had declared in common as to the children of God,
he now applies to those he was writing to; and this he did, to stimulate them to
beware of sin, and to encourage them to repel the onsets of
Satan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let readers observe, that it is only true faith, that
applies to us, so to speak, the grace of God; for the Apostle acknowledges none
as faithful, but those who have the dignity of being God&#8217;s children. Nor
does he indeed put probable conjecture, as the Sophists speak, for confidence;
for he says that we
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>know</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i>
</i>The meaning is, that as we have been born of God, we ought to strive to
prove by our separation from the world, and by the sanctity of our life, that we
have not been in vain called to so great all honor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, this is an admonition very necessary for all the
godly; for wherever they turn their eyes, Satan has his allurements prepared, by
which he seeks to draw them away from God. It would then be difficult for them
to hold on in their course, were they not so to value their calling as to
disregard all the hindrances of the world. Then, in order to be well prepared
for the contest, these two things must be borne in mind, that the world is
wicked, and that our calling is from God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Under the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>world</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>the Apostle no doubt includes the whole human race. By saying that it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lieth in the
wicked</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>one, he represents it as being
under the dominion of Satan. There is then no reason why we should hesitate to
shun the world, which condemns God and delivers up itself into the bondage of
Satan: nor is there a reason why we should fear its enmity, because it is
alienated from God. In short, since corruption pervades all nature, the faithful
ought to study self-denial; and since nothing is seen in the world but
wickedness and corruption, they must necessarily<i> </i>disregard flesh and
blood that they may follow God. At the same time the other thing ought to be
added, that God is he who has called them, that under this protection they may
oppose all the machinations of the world and Satan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And we know that the Son of God
is come</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>As the children of God are
assailed on every side, he, as we have said, encourages and exhorts them to
persevere in resisting their enemies, and for this reason, because they fight
under the banner of God, and certainly know that they are ruled by his Spirit;
but he now reminds them where this knowledge is especially to be
found.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then says that God has been so made known to us,
that now there is no reason for doubting. The Apostle does not without reason
dwell on this point; for except our faith is really founded on God, we shall
never stand firm in the contest. For this purpose the Apostle shews that we have
obtained through Christ a sure knowledge of the true God, so that we may not
fluctuate in uncertainty.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>true</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>true</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;This is eternal
life, to know thee, the only true
God,</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and him whom thou hast sent,
Jesus Christ.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;431703&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">John
17:3)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he justly ascribes to Christ this office of
illuminating our minds as to the knowledge of God. For, as he is the only true
image of the invisible God, as he is the only interpreter of the Father, as he
is the only guide of life, yea, as he is the life and light of the world and the
truth, as soon as we depart from him, we necessarily become vain in our own
devices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And Christ is said to have
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>given us an
understanding</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>not<i> </i>only because
he shews us in the gospel what sort of being is the true God, and also
illuminates us by his Spirit; but because in Christ himself we have God
manifested in the flesh, as Paul says, since in him dwells all the fullness of
the Deity, and are hid all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;510209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Colossians
2:9.) Thus it is that the face of God in a manner appears to us in Christ; not
that there was no knowledge, or a doubtful knowledge of God, before the coming
of Christ,, but that now he manifests himself more fully and more clearly. And
this is what Paul says in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470406&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 4:6, that God, who formerly commanded light to shine out of darkness
at the creation of the world, hath now shone in our hearts through the
brightness of the knowledge of his glory in the face of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it must be observed, that this gift is peculiar
to the elect. Christ, indeed, kindles for all indiscriminately the torch of his
gospel; but all have not the eyes of their minds opened to see it, but on the
contrary Satan spreads the veil of blindness over many. Then the Apostle means
the light which Christ kindles within in the hearts of his people, and which
when once kindled, is never extinguished, though in some it may for a time be
smothered.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We are in him that is
true</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>By these words he reminds us how
efficacious is that knowledge which he mentions, even because by it we are
united to Christ; and become one with God; for it has a living root, fixed in
the heart, by which it comes that God lives in us and we in him. As he says,
without a copulative, that: we are
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>in him that is true, in his
Son</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>he seems to express the manner of
our union with God, as though he had said, that we are in God through Christ.<b>
</b></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fa38</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the true
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Though the Arians have attempted to
elude this passage, and some agree with them at this day, yet we have here a
remarkable testimony to the divinity of Christ. The Arians apply this passage to
the Father, as though the Apostle should again repeat that he is the true God.
But nothing could be more frigid than such a repetition. It has already twice
testified that the true God is he who has been made known to us in Christ, why
should he again add, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is the
true God</i></font><font face="Palatino">?<i> </i>It applies, indeed, most
suitably to Christ; for after having taught us that Christ is the guide by whose
hand we are led to God, he now, by way of amplifying, affirms that Christ is
that God, lest we should think that we are to seek further; and he confirms this
view by what is added, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>and
eternal life</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It<i> </i>is doubtless the same
that is spoken of, as being the true God and eternal life. I pass by this, that
the relative
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ou=tov</font><font face="Palatino">
usually refers to the last person. I say, then, that Christ is properly called
eternal life; and that this mode of speaking perpetually occurs in John, no one
can deny.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that when we have Christ, we enjoy
the true and eternal God, for nowhere else is he to be sought; and, secondly,
that we become thus partakers of eternal life, because it is offered to us in
Christ though hid in the Father. The origin of life is, indeed, the Father; but
the fountain from which we are to draw it, is Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep yourselves from
idols</i></font><font face="Palatino">.<i> </i>Though this be a separate
sentence, yet it is as it were an appendix to the preceding doctrine. For the
vivifying light of the Gospel ought to scatter and dissipate, not only darkness,
but also all mists, from the minds of the godly. The Apostle not only condemns
idolatry, but commands us to beware of all images and idols; by which he
intimates, that the worship of God cannot continue uncorrupted and pure whenever
men begin to be in love with idols or images. For so innate in us is
superstition, that the least occasion will infect us with its contagion. Dry
wood will not so easily burn when coals are put under it, as idolatry will lay
hold on and engross the minds of men, when an occasion is given to them. And who
does not see that images are the sparks? What sparks do I say? nay, rather
torches, which are sufficient to set the whole world on fire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Apostle at the same time does not only speak of
statues, but also of altars, and includes all the instruments of superstitions.
Moreover, the Papists are ridiculous, who pervert this passage and apply it to
the statues of Jupiter and Mercury and the like, as though the Apostle did not
teach generally, that there is a corruption of religion whenever a corporeal
form is ascribed to God, or whenever statues and pictures form a part of his
worship. Let us then remember that we ought carefully to continue in the
spiritual worship of God, so as to banish far from us everything that may turn
us aside to gross and carnal superstitions.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>END OF THE FIRST EPISTLE OF
JOHN</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE ARGUMENT</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It appears from the writings of Jerome and Eusebius,
that this Epistle was not formerly received by many Churches without opposition.
There are also at this day some who do not think it entitled to authority. I,
however, am inclined to receive it without controversy, because I see no just
cause for rejecting it. For what seems in the second chapter to be inconsistent
with the doctrine of free justification, we shall easily explain in its own
place. Though he seems more sparing in proclaiming the grace of Christ than it
behooved an Apostle to be, it is not surely required of all to handle the same
arguments. The writings of Solomon differ much from those of David; while the
former was intent on forming the outward man and teaching the precepts of civil
life, the latter spoke continually of the spiritual worship of God, peace of
conscience, God&#8217;s mercy and gratuitous promise of salvation. But this
diversity should not make us to approve of one, and to condemn the other.
Besides, among the evangelists themselves there is so much difference in setting
forth the power of Christ, that the other three, compared with John, have hardly
sparks of that full brightness which appears so conspicuous in him, and yet we
commend them all alike.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is enough to make men to receive this Epistle,
that it contains nothing unworthy of an Apostle of Christ. It is indeed full of
instruction on various subjects, the benefit of which extends to every part of
the Christian life; for there are here remarkable passages on patience, prayer
to God, the excellency and fruit of heavenly truth, humility, holy duties, the
restraining of the tongue, the cultivation of peace, the repressing of lusts,
the contempt of the world, and the like things, which we shall separately
discuss in their own places.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as to the author, there is somewhat more reason
for doubting. It is indeed certain that he was not the Son of Zebedee, for Herod
killed him shortly after our Lord&#8217;s resurrection. The ancients are nearly
unanimous in thinking that he was one of the disciples named Oblias and a
relative of Christ, who was set over the Church at Jerusalem; and they supposed
him to have been the person whom Paul mentioned with Peter and John, who he says
were deemed pillars,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480209&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
2:9.) But that one of the disciples was mentioned as one of the three pillars,
and thus exalted above the other Apostles, does not seem to me probable. I am
therefore rather inclined to the conjecture, that he of whom Paul speaks was the
son of Alpheus. I do not yet deny that another was the ruler of the Church at
Jerusalem, and one indeed from the college of the disciples; for the Apostles
were not tied to any particular place. But whether of the two was the writer of
this Epistle, it is not for me to say. That Oblias was actually a man of great
authority among the Jews, appears even from this, that as he had been cruelly
put to death by the faction of an ungodly chief-priest, Josephus hesitated not
to impute the destruction of the city in part to his death.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To the twelve
tribes</i></font><font face="Palatino">. When the ten tribes were banished, the
Assyrian king placed them in different parts. Afterwards, as it usually happens
in the revolutions of kingdoms (such as then took place,) it is very probable
that they moved here and there in all directions. And the Jews had been
scattered almost unto all quarters of the world. He then wrote and exhorted all
those whom he could not personally address, because they had been scattered far
and wide. But that he speaks not of the grace of Christ and of faith in him, the
reason seems to be this, because he addressed those who had already been rightly
taught by others; so that they had need, not so much of doctrine, as of the
goads of
exhortations.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd1</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>All
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The first exhortation is, to bear trials
with a cheerful mind. And it was especially necessary at that time to comfort
the Jews, almost overwhelmed as they were with troubles. For the very name of
the nation was so infamous, that they were hated and despised by all people
wherever they went; and their condition as Christians rendered them still more
miserable, because they held their own nation as their most inveterate enemies.
At the same time, this consolation was not so suited to one time, but that it is
always useful to believers, whose life is a constant warfare on
earth.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But that we may know more fully what he means, we
must doubtless take
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>temptations</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or trials as including all adverse things; and they are so called, because they
are the tests of our obedience to God. He bids the faithful, while exercised
with these, to rejoice; and that not only when they fall into one temptation,
but into many, not only of one kind, but of various kinds. And doubtless, since
they serve to mortify our flesh, as the vices of the flesh continually shoot up
in us, so they must necessarily be often repeated. Besides, as we labor under
diseases, so it is no wonder that different remedies are applied to remove
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Lord then afflicts us in various ways, because
ambition, avarice, envy, gluttony, intemperance, excessive love of the world,
and the innumerable lusts in which we abound, cannot be cured by the same
medicine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he bids us to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>count it all
joy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, it is the same as though he had said, that
temptations ought to be so deemed as gain, as to be regarded as occasions of
joy. He means, in short, that there is nothing in afflictions which ought to
disturb our joy. And thus, he not only commands us to bear adversities calmly,
and with an even mind, but shews us that this is a reason why the faithful
should rejoice when pressed down by them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is, indeed, certain, that all the senses of our
nature are so formed, that every trial produces in us grief and sorrow; and no
one of us can so far divest himself of his nature as not to grieve and be
sorrowful whenever he feels any evil. But this does not prevent the children of
God to rise, by the guidance of the Spirit, above the sorrow of the flesh. Hence
it is, that in the midst of trouble they cease not to rejoice.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Knowing</i></font><font face="Palatino">
this,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> that the
trying</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We now see why he called adversities
<i>trials </i>or temptations, even because they serve to try our faith. And
there is here a reason given to confirm the last sentence. For it might, on the
other hand, be objected, &#8220;How comes it, that we judge that sweet which to
the sense is bitter?&#8221; He then shews by the effect that we ought to rejoice
in afflictions, because they produce fruit that ought to be highly valued, even
patience. If God then provides for our salvation, he affords us an occasion of
rejoicing. Peter uses a similar argument at the beginning of his first Epistle,
&#8220;That the trial of your faith, more precious than gold, may be,&#8221;
etc. We certainly dread diseases, and want, and exile, and prison, and reproach,
and death, because we regard them as evils; but when we understand that they are
turned through God&#8217;s kindness unto helps and aids to our salvation, it is
ingratitude to murmur, and not willingly to submit to be thus paternally dealt
with.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul says, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450503&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
5:3, that we are to glory in tribulations; and James says here, that we are to
rejoice. &#8220;We glory,&#8221; says Paul, &#8220;in tribulations, knowing that
tribulation worketh patience.&#8221; What immediately follows seems contrary to
the words of James; for he mentions probation in the third place, as the effect
of patience, which is here put first as though it were the cause. But the
solution is obvious; the word there has an active, but here a passive meaning.
Probation or trial is said by James to produce patience; for were not God to try
us, but leave us free from trouble, there would be no patience, which is no
other thing than fortitude of mind in bearing evils. But Paul means, that while
by enduring we conquer evils, we experience how much God&#8217;s help avails in
necessities; for then the truth of God is as it were in reality manifested to
us. Hence it comes that we dare to entertain more hope as to futurity; for the
truth of God, known by experience, is more fully believed by us. Hence Paul
teaches that by such a probation, that is, by such an experience of divine
grace, hope is produced, not that hope then only begins, but that it increases
and is confirmed. But both mean, that tribulation is the means by which patience
is produced.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, the minds of men are not so formed by
nature, that affliction of itself produces patience in them. But Paul and Peter
regard not so much the nature of men as the providence of God through which it
comes, that the faithful learn patience from troubles; for the ungodly are
thereby more and more provoked to madness, as the example of Pharaoh
proves.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd2</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But let patience have her perfect
work.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As boldness and courage often appear in
us and soon fail, he therefore requires perseverance. &#8220;Real
patience,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is that which endures to the end.&#8221; For
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>work</i></font><font face="Palatino">
here means the effort not only to overcome in one contest, but to persevere
through life. His perfection may also he referred to the sincerity of the soul,
that men ought willingly and not feignedly to submit to God; but as the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>work</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is added, I prefer to explain it of constancy. For there are many, as we have
said, who shew at first an heroic greatness, and shortly after grow weary and
faint. He therefore bids those who would be <i>perfect</i> and
<i>entire</i>,</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
to persevere to the end. But what he means by these two words, he afterwards
explains of those who fail not, or become not wearied: for they, who being
overcome as to patience, be broken down, must, by degrees, be necessarily
weakened, and at length wholly fail.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any of you lack
wisdom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As our reason, and all our feelings are
averse to the thought that we can be happy in the midst of evils, he bids us to
ask of the Lord to give us wisdom. For <i>wisdom</i> here, I confine to the
subject of the passage, as though he had said, &#8220;If this doctrine is higher
than what your minds can reach to, ask of the Lord to illuminate you by his
Spirit; for as this consolation alone is sufficient to mitigate all the
bitterness of evils, that what is grievous to the flesh is salutary to us; so we
must necessarily be overcome with impatience, except we be sustained by this
kind of comfort.&#8221; Since we see that the Lord does not so require from us
what is above our strength, but that he is ready to help us, provided we ask,
let us, therefore, learn, whenever he commands anything, to ask from him the
power to perform it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though in this place to be wise is to submit to God
in the endurance of evils, under a due conviction that he so orders all things
as to promote our salvation; yet the sentence may be generally applied to every
branch of right knowledge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why does he say
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any
one,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as though all of them did not want wisdom.
To this I answer, that all are by nature without it; but that some are gifted
with the spirit of wisdom, while others are without it. As, then, all had not
made such progress as to rejoice in affliction, but few there were to whom this
had been given, James, therefore, referred to such cases; and he reminded those
who were not as yet fully convinced that by the cross their salvation was
promoted by the Lord, that they were to ask to be endued with wisdom. And yet
there is no doubt, but that necessity reminds us all to ask the same thing; for
he who has made the greatest progress, is yet far off from the goal. But to ask
an increase of wisdom is another thing than to ask for it at
first.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he bids us to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>ask of the
Lord,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he intimates, that he alone can heal our
diseases and relieve our wants.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That giveth to all men
liberally</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By <i>all</i>, he means those who
ask; for they who seek no remedy for their wants, deserve to pine away in them.
However, this universal declaration, by which every one of us is invited to ask,
without exception, is very important; hence no man ought to deprive himself of
so great a privilege.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is the promise which immediately
follows; for as by this command he shews what is the duty of every one, so he
affirms that they would not do in vain what he commands; according to what is
said by Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Knock, and it
shall be
opened.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400707&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew
7:7;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;421109&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Luke
11:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word <i>liberally</i>, or freely, denotes
promptitude in giving. So Paul, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451208&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
12:8, requires simplicity in deacons. And in 2 Corinthians 8 and 2 Corinthians
9, when speaking of charity or love, he repeats the same word several times. The
meaning, then, is, that God is so inclined and ready to give, that he rejects
none, or haughtily puts them off, being not like the niggardly and grasping, who
either sparingly, as with a closed hand, give but little, or give only a part of
what they were about to give, or long debate with themselves whether to give or
not.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd4</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And upbraideth
not.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is added, lest any one should fear to
come too often to God. Those who are the most liberal among men, when any one
asks often to be helped, mention their formal acts of kindness, and thus excuse
themselves for the future. Hence, a mortal man, however open-handed he may be,
we are ashamed to weary by asking too often. But James reminds us, that there is
nothing like this in God; for he is ready ever to add new blessings to former
ones, without any end or limitation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
But let him ask in faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He shews here, first
the right way of praying; for as we cannot pray without the word, as it were,
leading the way, so we must believe before we pray; for we testify by prayer,
that we hope to obtain from God the grace which he has promised. Thus every one
who has no faith in the promises, prays dissemblingly. Hence, also, we learn
what is true faith; for James, after having bidden us to ask in faith, adds this
explanation, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nothing
wavering</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, doubting nothing. Then faith is
that which relies on God&#8217;s promises, and makes us sure of obtaining what
we ask. It hence follows, that it is connected with confidence and certainty as
to God&#8217;s love towards us. The
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diakri&gt;nesqai</font><font face="Palatino">,
whichhe uses, means properly to inquire into both sides of a question, after the
manner of pleaders. He would have us then to be so convinced of what God has
once promised, as not to admit a doubt whether he shall be heard or
not.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that
wavereth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or doubteth. By this similitude he
strikingly expresses how God punishes the unbelief of those who doubt his
promises; for, by their own restlessness, they torment themselves inwardly; for
there is never any calmness for our souls, except they recumb on the truth of
God. He, at length, concludes, that such are unworthy to receive anything from
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable passage, fitted to disprove that
impious dogma which is counted as an oracle under the whole Papacy, that is,
that we ought to pray doubtingly, and with uncertainty as to our success. This
principle, then, we hold, that our prayers are not heard by the Lord, except
when we have a confidence that we shall obtain. It cannot indeed be otherwise,
but that through the infirmity of our flesh we must be tossed by various
temptations, which are like engines employed to shake our confidence; so that no
one is found who does not vacillate and tremble according to the feeling of his
flesh; but temptations of this kind are at length to be overcome by faith. The
case is the same as with a tree, which has struck firm roots; it shakes, indeed,
through the blowing of the wind, but is not rooted up; on the contrary, it
remains firm in its own place.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A double-minded
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, a man of a double mind. This sentence
may be read by itself, as he speaks generally of hypocrites. It seems, however,
to me to be rather the conclusion of the preceding doctrine; and thus there is
an implied contrast between the simplicity or liberality of God, mentioned
before, and the double-mindedness of man; for as God gives to us with a
stretched out hand, so it behooves us in our turn to open the bosom of our
heart. He then says that the unbelieving, who have tortuous recesses, are
<i>unstable</i>; because they are never firm or fixed, but at one time they
swell with the confidence of the flesh, at another they sink into the depth of
despair.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd5</font></sup><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let the brother of low

submissively to bear their lot, sets before them this consolation, that they
were the free-men of God, having been set free by his grace from the most
miserable bondage of Satan, and reminds them, though free, yet to remember that
they were the servants of God; so here James in the same manner bids the lowly
to glory in this, that they had been adopted by the Lord as his children; and
the rich, because they had been brought down into the same condition, the
world&#8217;s vanity having been made evident to them. Thus the first he would
have to be content with their humble and low state; and he forbids the rich to
be proud. Since it is incomparably the greatest dignity to be introduced into
the company of angels, nay, to be made the associates of Christ, he who
estimates this favor of God aright, will regard all other things as worthless.
Then neither poverty, nor contempt, nor nakedness, nor famine nor thirst, will
make his mind so anxious, but that he will sustain himself with this
consolation. &#8220;Since the Lord has conferred on me the principal thing, it
behooves me patiently to bear the loss of other things, which are
inferior.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Behold, how a lowly brother ought to glory in his
elevation or exaltation; for if he be accepted of God, he has sufficient
consolation in his adoption alone, so as not to grieve unduly for a less

But the rich, in that he is made low</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or; in
his lowness. He has mentioned the particular for the general; for this
admonition pertains to all those who excel in honor; or in dignity, or in any
other external thing. He bids them to glory in their lowness or littleness, in
order to repress the haughtiness of those who are usually inflated with
prosperity. But he calls it <i>lowness</i>, because the manifested kingdom of
God ought to lead us to despise the world, as we know that all the things we
previously greatly admired, are either nothing or very little things. For
Christ, who is not a teacher except of babes, checks by his doctrine all the
haughtiness of the flesh. Lest, then, the vain joy of the world should captivate
the rich, they ought to habituate themselves to glory in the casting down of
their carnal
excellency.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd6</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>As the flower of the

to the words of Isaiah, I would not much object; but I cannot allow that he
quotes the testimony of the Prophet, who speaks not only of the things of this
life and the fading character of the world, but of the whole man, both body and
soul; but here what is spoken of is the pomp of wealth or of riches. And the
meaning is, that glorying in riches is foolish and preposterous, because they
pass away in a moment. The philosophers teach the same thing; but the song is
sung to the deaf, until the ears are opened by the Lord to hear the truth
concerning the eternity of the celestial kingdom. Hence he mentions
<i>brother</i>; intimating that there is no place for this truth, until we are
admitted into the order of God&#8217;s children.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Blessed is the
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">. After having applied consolation, he
moderated the sorrow of those who were severely handled in this world, and again
humbled the arrogance of the great. He now draws this conclusion, that they are
happy who magnanimously endure troubles and other trials, so as to rise above
them. The word temptation may indeed be otherwise understood, even for the
stings of lusts which annoy the soul within; but which is here commended, as I
think, is fortitude of mind in enduring adversities. It is, however, a paradox,
that they are not happy to whom all things come according to their wishes, but
such as are not overcome with evils.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For when he is
tried</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He gives a reason for the preceding
sentence; for the crown follows the contest. If, then, it be our chief happiness
to be crowned in the kingdom of God, it follows, that the contests with which
the Lord tries us, are aids and helps to our happiness. Thus the argument is
from the end or the effect: hence we conclude, that the faithful are harassed by
so many evils for this purpose, that their piety and obedience may be made
manifest, and that they may be thus at length prepared to receive the crown of
life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But they reason absurdly who hence infer that we by
fighting merit the crown; for since God has gratuitously appointed it for us,
our fighting only renders us fit to receive it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds, that it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>promised</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to those who
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>love</i></font><font face="Palatino">
God. By speaking thus, he means not that the love of man is the cause of
obtaining the crown, (for God anticipates us by his gratuitous love;) but he
only intimates that the elect who love him are alone approved by God. He then
reminds us that the conquerors of all temptations are those who love God, and
that we fail not in courage when we are tried, for no other cause than because
the love of the world prevails in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let no man, when he is
tempted</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here, no doubt, he speaks of another
kind of temptation. It is abundantly evident that the external temptations,
hitherto mentioned, are sent to us by God. In this way God tempted Abraham,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;012201&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
22:1,) and daily tempts us, that is, he tries us as to what are we by laying
before us an occasion by which our hearts are made known. But to draw out what
is hid in our hearts is a far different thing from inwardly alluring our hearts
by wicked lusts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then treats here of inward temptations which are
nothing else than the inordinate desires which entice to sin. He justly denies
that God is the author of these, because they flow from the corruption of our
nature.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This warning is very necessary, for nothing is more
common among men than to transfer to another the blame of the evils they commit;
and they then especially seem to free themselves, when they ascribe it to God
himself. This kind of evasion we constantly imitate, delivered down to us as it
is from the first man. For this reason James calls us to confess our own guilt,
and not to implicate God, as though he compelled us to sin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the whole doctrine of scripture seems to be
inconsistent with this passage; for it teaches us that men are blinded by God,
are given up to a reprobate mind, and delivered over to filthy and shameful
lusts. To this I answer, that probably James was induced to deny that we are
tempted by God by this reason, because the ungodly, in order to form an excuse,
armed themselves with testimonies of Scripture. But there are two things to be
noticed here: when Scripture ascribes blindness or hardness of heart to God, it
does not assign to him the beginning of this blindness, nor does it make him the
author of sin, so as to ascribe to him the blame: and on these two things only
does James dwell.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Scripture asserts that the reprobate are delivered up
to depraved lusts; but is it because the Lord depraves or corrupts their hearts?
By no means; for their hearts are subjected to depraved lusts, because they are
already corrupt and vicious. But since God blinds or hardens, is he not the
author or minister of evil? Nay, but in this manner he punishes sins, and
renders a just reward to the ungodly, who have refused to be ruled by his
Spirit.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
1:6.) It hence follows that the origin of sin is not in God, and no blame can be
imputed to him as though he took pleasure in evils.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010606&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
6:6.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that man in vain evades, who attempts
to cast the blame of his vices on God, because every evil proceeds from no other
fountain than from the wicked lust of man. And the fact really is, that we are
not otherwise led astray, except that every one has his own inclination as his
leader and impeller. But that God tempts no one, he proves by this, because he
is not </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>tempted with
evils</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd8</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For it is the devil who allures us to sin, and for this reason, because he
wholly burns with the mad lust of sinning. But God does not desire what is evil:
he is not, therefore, the author of doing evil in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When he is drawn away by his own
lust.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As the inclination and excitement to sin
are inward, in vain does the sinner seek an cause from an external impulse. At
the same time these two effects of lust ought to be noticed &#8212; that it
ensnares us by its allurements, and that it does us away; each of which is
sufficient to render us
guilty.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd9</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Then when lust hath
conceived</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He first calls that <i>lust</i>
which is not any kind of evil affection or desire, but that which is the
fountain of all evil affections; by which, as he shews, are conceived vicious
broods, which at length break forth into sins. It seems, however, improper, and
not according to the usage of Scripture, to restrict the word <i>sin</i> to
outward works, as though indeed lust itself were not a sin, and as though
corrupt desires, remaining closed up within and suppressed, were not so many
sins. But as the use of a word is various, there is nothing unreasonable if it
be taken here, as in many other places, for actual sin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And the Papists ignorantly lay hold on this passage,
and seek to prove from it that vicious, yea, filthy, wicked, and the most
abominable lusts are not sins, provided there is no assent; for James does not
shew when sin begins to be born, so as to be sin, and so accounted by God, but
when it breaks forth. For he proceeds gradually and shews that the consummation
of sin is eternal death, and that sin arises from depraved desires, and that
these depraved desires or affections have their root in lust. It hence follows
that men gather fruit in eternal perdition, and fruit which they have procured
for themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By perfected sin, therefore, I understand, not any
one act of sin perpetrated, but the completed course of sinning. For though
death is merited by every sin whatever, yet it is said to be the reward of an
ungodly and wicked life. Hence is the dotage of those confuted who conclude from
these words, that sin is not mortal until it breaks forth, as they say, into an
external act. Nor is this what James treats of; but his object was only this, to
teach that there is in us the root of our own destruction. </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b>.<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do not
err</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is an argument from what is opposite;
for as God is the author of all good, it is absurd to suppose him to be the
author of evil. To do good is what properly belongs to him, and according to his
nature; and from him all good things come to us. Then, whatever evil he does, is
not agreeable to his nature. But as it sometimes happens, that he who quits
himself well through life, yet in some things fails, he meets this doubt by
denying that God is mutable like men. But if God is in all things and always
like himself, it hence follows that well-doing is his perpetual
work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This reasoning is far different from that of Plato,
who maintained that no calamities are sent on men by God, because he is good;
for though it is just that the crimes of men should be punished by God, yet it
is not right, with regard to him, to regard among evils that punishment which he
justly inflicts. Plato, indeed, was ignorant; but James, leaving to God his
right and office of punishing, only removes blame from him. This passage teaches
us, that we ought to be so affected by God&#8217;s innumerable blessings, which
we daily receive from his hand, as to think of nothing but of his glory; and
that we should abhor whatever comes to our mind, or is suggested by others,
which is not compatible with his praise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God is called the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Father of
lights</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as possessing all excellency and the
highest dignity. And when he immediately adds, that there is in him
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>no shadow of
turning</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he continues the metaphor; so that we
may not measure the brightness of God by the irradiation of the sun which
appears to
us.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd10</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of his own
will</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now brings forward a special proof of
the goodness of God which he had mentioned, even that he has regenerated us unto
eternal life. This invaluable benefit every one of the faithful feels in
himself. Then the goodness of God, when known by experience, ought to remove
from them all a contrary opinion respecting him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says that God
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of his own
will</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or spontaneously, <i>hath begotten
</i>us, he intimates that he was induced by no other reason, as the will and
counsel of God are often set in opposition to the merits of men. What great
thing, indeed, would it have been to say that God was not constrained to do
this? But he impresses something more, that God according to his own goodwill
hath begotten us, and has been thus a cause to himself. It hence follows that it
is natural to God to do good.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this passage teaches us, that as our election
before the foundation of the world was gratuitous, so we are illuminated by the
grace of God alone as to the knowledge of the truth, so that our calling
corresponds with our election. The Scripture shews that we have been
gratuitously adopted by God before we were born. But James expresses here
something more, that we obtain the right of adoption, because God does also call
us gratuitously.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;490104&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Ephesians
1:4, 5.) Farther, we hence learn, that it is the peculiar office of God
spiritually to regenerate us; for that the same thing is sometimes ascribed to
the ministers of the gospel, means no other thing than this, that God acts
through them; and it happens indeed through them, but he nevertheless alone
doeth the work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word <i>begotten</i> means that we become new
men, so that we put off our former nature when we are effectually called by God.
He adds how God begets us, even by the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>word of
truth</i></font><font face="Palatino">, so that we may know that we cannot enter
the kingdom of God by any other door.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That we should be a kind of
firstfruits of his creatures</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tina&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">,
&#8220;some,&#8221; has the meaning of likeness, as though he had said, that we
are in a manner firstfruits. But this ought not to be restricted to a few of the
faithful; but it belongs to all in common. For as man excels among all
creatures, so the Lord elects some from the whole mass and separates them as a
holy offering, to
himself.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd11</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is no common nobility into which God extols his own children. Then justly are
they said to be excellent as firstfruits, when God&#8217;s image is renewed in
them. </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Let every man</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Were this a general sentence,
the inference would be farfetched; but as he immediately adds a sentence
respecting the word of truth suitable to the last verse, I doubt not but that he
accommodates this exhortation peculiarly to the subject in hand. Having then set
before us the goodness of God, he shews how it becomes us to be prepared to
receive the blessing which he exhibits towards us. And this doctrine is very
useful, for spiritual generation is not a work of one moment. Since some
remnants of the old man ever abide in us, we must necessarily be through life
renewed, until the flesh be abolished; for either our perverseness, or
arrogance, or sloth, is a great impediment to God in perfecting in us his work.
Hence, when James would have us to be swift to hear, he commends promptitude, as
though he had said, &#8220;When God so freely and kindly presents himself to
you, you also ought to render yourselves teachable, lest your slowness should
cause him to desist from speaking.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But inasmuch as we do not calmly hear God speaking to
us, when we seem to ourselves to be very wise, but by our haste interrupt him
when addressing us, the Apostle requires us to be silent, to be
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>slow to
speak</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And, doubtless, no one can be a true
disciple of God, except he hears him in silence. He does not, however, require
the silence of the Pythagorean school, so that it should not be right to inquire
whenever we desire to learn what is necessary to be known; but he would only
have us to correct and restrain our forwardness, that we may not, as it commonly
happens, unseasonably interrupt God, and that as long as he opens his sacred
mouth, we may open to him our hearts and our ears, and not prevent him to
speak.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Slow to
wrath</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Wrath also, I think, is condemned with
regard to the hearing which God demands to be given to him, as though making a
tumult it disturbed and impeded him, for God cannot be heard except when the
mind is calm and sedate. Hence, he adds, that as long as wrath bears rule there
is no place for the righteousness of God. In short, except the heat of
contention be banished, we shall never observe towards God that calm silence of
which he has just spoken.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore lay
apart</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He concludes by saying how the word of
life is to be received. And first, indeed, he intimates that it cannot be
rightly received except it be implanted, or strike roots in us. For the
expression, to receive the implanted word, ought to be thus explained, &#8220;to
receive it, that it may be really implanted.&#8221; For he alludes to seed often
sown on and ground, and not received into the moist bosom of the earth; or to
plants, which being cast on the ground, or laid on dead wood, soon wither. He
then requires that it should be a living implanting, by which the word becomes
as it were united with our heart.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He at the same time shews the way and manner of this
reception, even </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>with
meekness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By this word he means humility and
the readiness of a mind disposed to learn, such as Isaiah describes when he
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;On whom does my
Spirit rest, except on the humble and meek?&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Isaiah
57:15.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hence it is, that so far profit in the school of God,
because hardly one in a hundred renounces the stubbornness of his own spirit,
and gently submits to God; but almost all are conceited and refractory. But if
we desire to be the living plantation of God, we must subdue our proud hearts
and be humble, and labor to become like lambs, so as to suffer ourselves to be
ruled and guided by our Shepherd.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as men are never thus tamed, so as to have a calm
and meek heart, except they are purged from depraved affections, so he bids us
to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lay aside uncleanness and
redundancy of wickedness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. And as James borrowed
a comparison from agriculture, it was necessary for him to observe this order,
to begin by rooting up noxious weeds. And since he addressed all, we may hence
conclude that these are the innate evils of our nature, and that they cleave to
us all; yea, since he addresses the faithful, he shews that we are never wholly
cleansed from them in this life, but that they are continually sprouting up, and
therefore he requires that care should be constantly taken to eradicate them. As
the word of God is especially a holy thing; to be fitted to receive it, we must
put off the filthy things by which we have been polluted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Under the
word</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kaki&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">he
comprehends hypocrisy and obstinacy as well as unlawful desires or lusts. Not
satisfied with specifying the seat of wickedness as being in the soul of man, he
teaches us that so abounding is the wickedness that dwells there, that it
overflows, or that it rises up as it were into a heap; and doubtless, whosoever
will well examine himself will find that there is within him an immense chaos of
evils.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd12</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Which is able to
save</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is a high eulogy on heavenly truth,
that we obtain through it a sure salvation; and this is added, that we may learn
to seek and love and magnify the word as a treasure that is incomparable. It is
then a sharp goad to chastise our idleness, when he says that the word which we
are wont to hear so negligently, is the means of our salvation, though for this
purpose the power of saving is not ascribed to the word, as if salvation is
conveyed by the external sound of the word, or as if the office of saving is
taken away from God and transferred elsewhere; for James speaks of the word
which by faith penetrates into the hearts of men, and only intimates that God,
the author of salvation, conveys it by his Gospel. </font><br></div>

before mentioned. We must further observe, that faith with all its works is
included by James, yea, faith especially, as it is the chief work which God
requires from us. The import of the whole is, that we ought to labor that the
word of the Lord should strike root in us, so that it may afterwards
fructify.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd13</font></sup><br></div>

which God presents himself to our view; but so that we may be transformed unto
his image, as Paul says in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470318&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 3:18. But here he speaks of the external glance of the eye, not of
the vivid and efficacious meditation which penetrates into the heart. It is a
striking comparison, by which he briefly intimates, that a doctrine merely heard
and not received inwardly into the heart avails nothing, because it soon
vanishes away.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The perfect law of
liberty</i></font><font face="Palatino">. After having spoken of empty
speculation, he comes now to that penetrating intuition which transforms us to
the image of God. And as he had to do with the Jews, he takes the word
<i>law</i>, familiarly known to them, as including the whole truth of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But why he calls it
a</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> perfect
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">, and a law of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>liberty</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
interpreters have not been able to understand; for they have not perceived that
there is here a contrast, which may be gathered from other passages of
Scripture. As long as the law is preached by the external voice of man, and not
inscribed by the finger and Spirit of God on the heart, it is but a dead letter,
and as it were a lifeless thing. It is, then, no wonder that the law is deemed
imperfect, and that it is the law of bondage; for as Paul teaches in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480424&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Galatians
4:24, separated from Christ, it generates to condemn and as the same shews to us
in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450813&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:13, it can do nothing but fill us with diffidence and fear. But the Spirit of
regeneration, who inscribes it on our inward parts, brings also the grace of
adoption. It is, then, the same as though James had said, &#8220;The teaching of
the law, let it no longer lead you to bondage, but, on the contrary, bring you
to liberty; let it no longer be only a schoolmaster, but bring you to
perfection: it ought to be received by you with sincere affection, so that you
may lead a godly and a holy life.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, since it is a blessing of the Old Testament
that the law of God should reform us, as it appears from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;243135&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Jeremiah
31:35, and other passages, it follows that it cannot be obtained until we come
to Christ. And, doubtless, he alone is the end and perfection of the law; and
James adds <i>liberty</i>, as an inseparable associate, because the Spirit of
Christ never regenerates but that he becomes also a witness and an earnest of
our divine adoption, so as to free our hearts from fear and
trembling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And
continueth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is firmly to persevere in the
knowledge of God; and when he adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>this man shall be blessed in his
deed</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or work, he means that blessedness is to
be found in doing, not in cold
hearing.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd14</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>26</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Seem to be
religious</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now reproves even in those who
boasted that they were doers of the law, a vice under which hypocrites commonly
labor, that is, the wantonness of the tongue in detraction. He has before
touched on the duty of restraining the tongue, but for a different end; for he
then bade silence before God, that we might be more fitted to learn. He speaks
now of another thing, that the faithful should not employ their tongue in evil
speaking.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was indeed needful that this vice should be
condemned, when the subject was the keeping of the law; for they who have put
off the grosser vices, are especially subject to this disease. He who is neither
an adulterer, nor a thief, nor a drunkard, but, on the contrary, seems brilliant
with some outward shew of sanctity will set himself off by defaming others, and
this under the pretense of zeal, but really through the lust of
slandering.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The object here, then, was to distinguish between the
true worshippers of God and hypocrites, who are so swollen with Pharisaic pride,
that they seek praise from the defects of others.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any
one,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>seems to be
religious,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that is, who has a show of sanctity,
and the meantime flatters himself by speaking evil of others, it is hence
evident that he does not truly serve God. For by saying that his religion is
vain, he not only intimates that other virtues are marred by the stain of
evil-speaking, but that the conclusion is, that the zeal for religion which
appears is not sincere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But deceiveth his own
heart</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I do not approve of the version of
Erasmus &#8212; &#8220;But suffers his heart to err;&#8221; for he points out
the fountain of that arrogance to which hypocrites are addicted, through which,
being blinded by an immoderate love of themselves, they believe themselves to be
far better than they really are; and hence, no doubt, is the disease of
slandering, because the wallet, as Aesop says in his Apologue, hanging behind,
is not seen. Rightly, then, has James, wishing to remove the effect, that is,
the lust of evil-speaking, added the cause, even that hypocrites flatter
themselves immoderately. For they would be ready to forgive were they in their
turn to acknowledge themselves to be in need of forgiveness. Hence the
flatteries by which they deceive themselves as to their own vices, make them
such supercilious censors of others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>27</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Pure
religion</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As he passes by those things which
are of the greatest moment in religion, he does not define generally what
religion is, but reminds us that religion without the things he mentions is
nothing; as when one given to wine and gluttony boasts that he is temperate, and
another should object, and say that the temperate man is he who does not indulge
in excess as to wine or eating; his object is not to express the whole of what
temperance is, but to refer only to one thing, suitable to the subject in hand.
For they are in vain religious of whom he speaks, as they are for the most part
trifling pretenders.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">James then teaches us that religion is not to be
estimated by the pomp of ceremonies; but that there are important duties to
which the servants of God ought to attend.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To <i>visit</i> in necessity is to extend a helping
hand to alleviate such as are in distress. And as there are many others whom the
Lord bids us to succor, in mentioning widows and orphans, he states a part for
the whole. There is then no doubt but that under one particular thing he
recommends to us every act of love, as though he had said, &#8220;Let him who
would be deemed religious, prove himself to be such by self denial and by mercy
and benevolence towards his neighbors.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>before
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, to intimate that it appears in deed
otherwise to men, who are led astray by external masks, but that we ought to
seek what pleases him. By </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>God and

father.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">This reproof seems at first sight to be hard and
unreasonable; for it is one of the duties of courtesy, not to be neglected, to
honor those who are elevated in the world. Further, if respect of persons be
vicious, servants are to be freed from all subjection; for freedom and servitude
are deemed by Paul as conditions of life. The same must be thought of
magistrates. But the solution of these questions is not difficult, if what James
writes is not separated. For he does not simply disapprove of honor being paid
to the rich, but that this, should not be done in a way so as to despise or
reproach the poor; and this will appear more clearly, when he proceeds to speak
of the rule of love.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Let us therefore remember that the respect of persons
here condemned is that by which the rich is so extolled, wrong is done to the
poor, which also he shews clearly by the context and surely ambitions is that
honor, and full of vanity, which is shewn to the rich to the contempt of the
poor. Nor is there a doubt but that ambition reigns and vanity also, when the
masks of this world are alone in high esteem. We must remember this truth, that
he is to be counted among the heirs of God&#8217;s kingdom, who disregards the
reprobate and honors those who fear God.

15:4.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Here then is the contrary vice condemned, that is,
when from respect alone to riches, anyone honors the wicked, and as it has been
said, dishonors the good. If then thou shouldest read thus, &#8220;He sins who
respects the rich,&#8221; the sentence would be absurd; but if as follows,
&#8220;He sins who honors the rich alone and despises the poor, and treats him
with contempt,&#8221; it would be a pious and true doctrine.</font><br></div>

is inconsistent with the faith of Christ, so that they cannot be united
together, and rightly so; for we are by faith united into one body, in which
Christ holds the primacy. When therefore the pomps of the world become
preeminent so as to cover over what Christ is, it is evident that faith hath but
little vigor.</font><br></div>

be blamed, who has rendered it &#8220;glory,&#8221; for the word means both; and
it may be fitly applied to Christ, and that according to the drift of the
passage. For so great is the brightness of Christ, that it easily extinguishes
all the glories of the world, if indeed it irradiates our eyes. It hence
follows, that Christ is little esteemed by us, when the admiration of worldly
glory lays hold on us. But the other exposition is also very suitable, for when
the esteem or value of riches or of honors dazzles our eyes, the truth is
suppressed, which ought alone to prevail. To <i>sit becomingly</i> means to sit

interrogatively, the meaning is, &#8220;Does not your own conscience hold you

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hearken, my beloved
brethren</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He proves now by a two-fold argument,
that they acted preposterously, when for the sake of the rich they despised the
poor: The first is, that it is unbecoming and disgraceful to cast down those
whom God exalts, and to treat reproachfully those whom he honors. As God honors
the poor, then every one who repudiates them, reverses the order of God. The
other argument is taken from common experience; for since the rich are for the
most part vexatious to the good and innocent, it is very unreasonable to render
such a reward for the wrongs they do, so that they should be more approved by us
than the poor, who aid us more than they wrong us. We shall now see how he
proceeds with these two points.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hath not God chosen the poor of
this world?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Not indeed alone, but he wished to
begin with them, that he might beat down the pride of the rich. This is also
what Paul says, that God hath chosen, not many noble, not many mighty in the
world, but those who are weak, that he might make ashamed such as are strong
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460125&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 1:25.) In short, though God pours forth his grace on the rich in
common with the poor, yet his will is to prefer these to those, that the mighty
might learn not to flatter themselves, and that the ignoble and the obscure
might ascribe in what they are to the mercy of God, and that both might be
trained up to meekness and humility.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The rich in
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino"> are not those who abound in the greatness
of faith, but such as God has enriched with the various gifts of his Spirit,
which we receive by faith. For, doubtless, since the Lord deals bountifully with
all, every one becomes partaker of his gifts according to the measure of his own
faith. If, then, we are empty or needy, that proves the deficiency of our faith;
for if we only enlarge the bosom of faith, God is always ready to fill
it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says, that a kingdom is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>promised</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to those who love God: not that the promise depends on love; but he reminds us
that we are called by God unto the hope of eternal life, on this condition and
to this end, that we may love him. Then the end, and not the beginning, is here
pointed out.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do not the
rich</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He seems to instigate them to vengeance
by bringing forward the unjust rule of the rich, in order that they who were
unjustly treated, might render like for like: and yet we are everywhere bid to
do good to those who injure us. But the object of James was another; for he only
wished to shew that they were without reason or judgment who through ambition
honored their executioners, and in the meantime injured their own friends, at
least those from whom they never suffered any wrong. For hence appeared more
fully their vanity, that they were induced by no acts of kindness: they only
admired the rich, because they were rich; nay, they servilely flattered those
whom they found, to their own loss, to be unjust and cruel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are, indeed, some of the rich who are just, and
meek, and hate all unrighteousness; but few of such men are to be found. James,
then, mentions what for the most part usually happens, and what daily experience
proves true. For as men commonly exercise their power in doing what is wrong, it
hence happens, that the more power any one has, the worse he is, and the more
unjust towards his neighbors. The more careful then ought the rich to be, lest
they should contract any of the contagion which everywhere prevails among those
of their own rank.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">Now follows a plainer declaration; for he expressly
points out the cause of the last reproof, for they were officiously attentive to
the rich, not from love, but on the contrary, from a vain desire of attaining
their favor: And it is in anticipation, by which he obviated an excuse on the
other side; for they might have objected and said, that he ought not to be
blamed, who humbly submiteth himself to the unworthy. James, indeed, concedes
that this is true, but he shews that it was falsely pretended by them, because
they shewed this submission of homage, not from love to their neighbors, but
from respect of persons.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the first clause, then, he acknowledges as right
and praiseworthy, as the duties of love which we perform towards our neighbors.
In the second, he denies that the ambitious respect of persons ought to be
deemed as of this kind, for it widely differs from what the law prescribes. And
the hinge of this answer turns on the words &#8220;neighbor&#8221; and
&#8220;respect of persons,&#8221; as though he had said, &#8220;If you pretend
that there is a sort of love in what you do, this may be easily disproved; for
God bids us to love our neighbors, and not to shew respect of persons.&#8221;
Besides, this word &#8220;neighbor&#8221; includes all mankind: he, then, who
says, that a very few, according to his own fancy, ought to be honored, and
others passed by, does not keep the law of God, but yields to the depraved
desires of his own heart. God expressly commends to us strangers and enemies,
and all, even the most contemptible. To this doctrine the respect of persons is
wholly contrary. Hence, rightly does James assert, that respect of persons is
inconsistent with love.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
If ye fulfill the royal law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The law here I
take simply as the rule of life; and <i>to
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>fulfill</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or perform it, is to keep it with real integrity of heart, and as they say,
roundly, (<i>rotunde</i>;) and he sets such a keeping in opposition to a partial
observance of it. It is said, indeed, to be a
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>royal
law</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as it is the royal way, or road; that is,
plain, straight, and level, which, by implication, is set in opposition to
sinuous by-paths and windings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Allusion however is made, as I think, to servile
obedience which they rendered to the rich, when they might, by serving in
sincerity their neighbors, be not only free men, but live as
kings.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, in the second place, he says, that those who
had respect of persons were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>convinced</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or reproved by the law, the law is taken according to its proper meaning. For
since we are bidden by God&#8217;s command to embrace all mortals, every one
who, with a few exceptions, rejects all the rest, breaks the bond of God, and
inverts also his order, and is, therefore, rightly called a transgressor of the
law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For whosoever shall keep the
whole law</i></font><font face="Palatino">. What alone he means is, that God
will not be honored with exceptions, nor will he allow us to cut off from his
law what is less pleasing to us. At the first view, this sentence seems hard to
some, as though the apostle countenanced the paradox of the Stoics, which makes
all sins equal, and as though he asserted that he who offends in one thing ought
to be punished equally with him whose whole life has been sinful and wicked. But
it is evident from the context that no such thing entered into his
mind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For we must always observe the reason anything is
said. He denies that our neighbors are loved when a part only of them is through
ambition chosen, and the rest neglected. This he proves, because it is no
obedience to God, when it is not rendered equally according to his command. Then
as the rule of God is plain and complete or perfect, so we ought to regard
completeness; so that none of us should presumptuously separate what he has
joined together. Let there be, therefore, a uniformity, if we desire rightly to
obey God. As, for instance, were a judge to punish ten thefts, and leave one man
unpunished, he would betray the obliquity of his mind, for he would thus shew
himself indignant against men rather than against crimes; because what he
condemns in one he absolves in another.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now, then, understand the design of James, that
is, that if we cut off from God&#8217;s law what is less agreeable to us, though
in other parts we may be obedient, yet we be come guilty of all, because in one
particular thing we violate the whole law. And though he accommodates what is
said to the subject in hand, it is yet taken from a general principle, &#8212;
that God has prescribed to us a rule of life, which it is not lawful for us to
mutilate. For it is not said of a part of the law, &#8220;This is the way, walk
ye in it;&#8221; nor does the law promise a reward except to universal
obedience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Foolish, then, are the schoolmen, who deem partial
righteousness, as they call it, to be meritorious; for this passage and many
others, clearly shew that there is no righteousness except in a perfect
obedience to the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he that
said</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or he who hath said. This is a proof of
the former verse; because the Lawgiver is to be considered rather than each
particular precept apart. The righteousness of God, as an indivisible body, is
contained in the law. Whosoever, then, transgresses one article of the Law,
destroys, as far as he can, the righteousness of God. Besides, as in one part,
so in every part, God&#8217;s will is to try our obedience. Hence a transgressor
of the law is every one who offends as to any one of its commandments according
to this saying,</font><br></div>

flattered themselves too much, they are summoned to the right tribunal; for men
absolve themselves according to their own notions, because they withdraw
themselves from the judgment of the divine law. He then reminds them that all
deeds and words are there to be accounted for, because God will judge the world
according to his law. As, however, such a declaration might have smitten them
with immoderate terror, to correct or mitigate what they might have thought
severe, he adds,<i> </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the law
of liberty</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For we know what Paul
says,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Whosoever are
under the law are under a
curse.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480310&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians

<div><font face="Palatino">Hence the judgment of the law in itself is
condemnation to eternal death; but he means by the word <i>liberty</i>, that we
are freed from the rigor of the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This meaning is not altogether unsuitable, though if
one examines more minutely what immediately follows, he will see that James
meant another thing; the sense is as though he had said, &#8220;Except ye wish
to undergo the rigor of the law, ye must be less rigid towards your neighbors;
for the law of liberty is the same as the mercy of God, which delivers us from
the curse of the law&#8221; And so this verse ought to be read with what
follows, where he speaks of the duty of bearing with infirmities. And doubtless
the whole passage thus reads well: &#8220;Since none of us can stand before God,
except we be delivered and freed from the strict rigor of the law, we ought so
to act, that we may not through too much severity exclude the indulgence or
mercy of God, of which we all have need to the last.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
For he shall have judgment.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is an
application of the last verse to the subject in hand, which confirms altogether
the second explanation which I have mentioned: for he shews, that since we stand
through God&#8217;s mercy alone, we ought to shew that to those whom the Lord
himself commends to us. It is, indeed, a singular commendation of kindness and
benevolence, that God promises that he will be merciful to us, if we be so to
our brethren: not that our mercy, how ever great it may be, shewn towards men,
merits the mercy of God; but that God would have those whom he has adopted, as
he is to them a kind and an indulgent Father, to bear and exhibit his image on
the earth, according to the saying of Christ,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220; Be ye merciful,
as your heavenly Father is
merciful.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400507&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Matthew

<div><font face="Palatino">We must notice, on the other hand, that he could
denounce nothing on them more severe or more dreadful than the judgment of God.
It hence follows, that all they are miserable and lost who flee not to the
asylum of pardon.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And mercy
rejoiceth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As though he had said,
&#8220;God&#8217;s mercy alone is that which delivers us from the dread and
terror of judgment.&#8221; he takes
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>rejoicing</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or glorying in the sense of being victorious or triumphant; for the judgment of
condemnation is suspended over the whole world, and nothing but mercy can bring
relief.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Hard and forced is the explanation of those who
regard mercy as put here for the person, for men cannot properly be said to
rejoice or glory against the judgment of God; but mercy itself in a manner
triumphs, and alone reins when the severity of judgment gives way; though I do
not deny but that hence arises confidence in rejoicing, that is, when the
faithful know that the wrath of God in a manner yields to mercy, so that being
relieved by the latter, they are not overwhelmed by the former.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>What doth it
profit</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He proceeds to commend mercy. And as he
had threatened that God would be a severe Judge to us, and at the same time very
dreadful, except we be kind and merciful towards our neighbors, and as on the
other hand hypocrites objected and said, that faith is sufficient to us, in
which the salvation of men consists, he now condemns this vain boasting. The
sum, then, of what is said is, that faith without love avails nothing, and that
it is therefore wholly dead.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But here a question arises, Can faith be separated
from love? It is indeed true that the exposition of this passage has produced
that common distinction of the Sophists, between unformed and formed faith; but
of such a thing James knew nothing, for it appears from the first words, that he
speaks of false profession of faith: for he does not begin thus, &#8220;If any
one has faith;&#8221; but, &#8220;If any says that he has faith;&#8221; by which
he certainly intimates that hypocrites boast of the empty name of faith, which
really does not belong to them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That he calls it then <i>faith,</i> is a concession,
as the Rhetoricians say; for when we discuss a point, it does no harm, nay, it
is sometimes expedient, to concede to an adversary what he demands, for as soon
as the thing itself is known, what is conceded may be easily taken away from
him. James then, as he was satisfied that it was a false pretext by which
hypocrites covered themselves, was not disposed to raise a dispute about a word
or an expression. Let us, however, remember that he does not speak according to
the impression of his own mind when he mentions faith, but that on the contrary
he disputes against those who made a false pretense as to faith, of which they
were wholly destitute.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Can faith save
him?</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is the same as though he had said,
that we do not attain salvation by a frigid and bare knowledge of God, which all
confess to be most true; for salvation comes to us by faith for this reason,
because it joins us to God. And this comes not in any other way than by being
united to the body of Christ, so that, living through his Spirit, we are also
governed by him. There is no such thing as this in the dead image of faith.
There is then no wonder that James denies that salvation is connected with
it.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd16</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If a
brother</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, For if a brother. He takes an
example from what was connected with his subject; for he had been exhorting them
to exercise the duties of love. If any one, on the contrary, boasted that he was
satisfied with faith without works, he compares this shadowy faith to the saying
of one who bids a famished man to be filled without supplying him with the food
of which he is destitute. As, then, he who sends away a poor man with words, and
offers him no help, treats him with mockery, so they who devise for themselves
faith without works, and without any of the duties of religion, trifle with
God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd17</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is dead, being
alone</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He says that faith is dead, being by
itself, that is, when destitute of good works. We hence conclude that it is
indeed no faith, for when dead, it does not properly retain the name. The
Sophists plead this expression and say, that some sort of faith is found by
itself; but this frivolous caviling is easily refuted; for it is sufficiently
evident that the Apostle reasons from what is impossible, as Paul calls an angel
anathema, if he attempted to subvert the gospel.

But this view seems to me too forced. He thinks it strange, that this should be
said by James, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou hast
faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">, who acknowledges no faith without works.
But in this he is much mistaken, that he does not acknowledge an irony in these
words. Then
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajlla&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">
I take for &#8220;nay rather;&#8221; and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ti&lt;v</font><font face="Palatino">
for &#8220;any one;&#8221; for the design of James was to expose the foolish
boasting of those who imagined that they had faith when by their life they
shewed that they were unbelievers; for he intimates that it would be easy for
all the godly who led a holy life to strip hypocrites of that boasting with
which they were
inflated.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd17A</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Shew
me</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though the more received reading is,
&#8220;by works,&#8221; yet the old Latin is more suitable, and the reading is
also found in some Greek copies. I therefore hesitated not to adopt it. Then he
bids to shew faith without works, and thus reasons from what is impossible, to
prove what does not exist. So he speaks ironically. But if any one prefers the
other reading, it comes to the same thing, &#8220;Shew me by works thy
faith;&#8221; for since it is not an idle thing, it must necessarily be proved
by works. The meaning then is, &#8220;Unless thy faith brings forth fruits, I
deny that thou hast any
faith.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd18</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, whether the outward uprightness
of life is a sure evidence of faith? For James says,
&#8220;</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I will shew thee my faith
by my works</i></font><font face="Palatino">.&#8221; To this I reply, that the
unbelieving sometimes excel in specious virtues, and lead an honorable life free
from every crime; and hence works apparently excellent may exist apart from
faith. Nor indeed does James maintain that every one who seems good possesses
faith. This only he means, that faith, without the evidence of good works, is
vainly pretended, because fruit ever comes from the living root of a good
tree.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou believest that there is one
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. From this one sentence it appears evident
that the whole dispute is not about faith, but of the common knowledge of God,
which can no more connect man with God, than the sight of the sun carry him up
to heaven; but it is certain that by faith we come nigh to God. Besides, it
would be ridiculous were any one to say, that the devils have faith; and James
prefers them in this respect to hypocrites. The devil <i>trembles</i>, he says,
at the mention of God&#8217;s name, because when he acknowledges his own judge
he is filled with the fear of him. He then who despises an acknowledged God is
much worse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou doest
well</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is put down for the purpose of
extenuating, as though he had said, &#8220;It is, forsooth! a great thing to
sink down below the devils.&#8221;

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But wilt thou
know</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We must understand the state of the
question, for the dispute here is not respecting the cause of justification, but
only what avails a profession of faith without works, and what opinion we are to
form of it. Absurdly then do they act who strive to prove by this passage that
man is justified by works, because James meant no such thing, for the proofs
which he subjoins refer to this declaration, that no faith, or only a dead
faith, is without works. No one will ever understand what is said, nor judge
wisely of words, except he who keeps in view the design of the
writer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Was not
Abraham</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The Sophists lay hold on the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>justified</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
and then they cry out as being victorious, that justification is partly by
works. But we ought to seek out a right interpretation according to the general
drift of the whole passage. We have already said that James does not speak here
of the cause of justification, or of the manner how men obtain righteousness,
and this is plain to every one; but that his object was only to shew that good
works are always connected with faith; and, therefore, since he declares that
Abraham was </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>justified by
works</i></font><font face="Palatino">, he is speaking of the proof he gave of
his justification.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When, therefore, the Sophists set up James against
Paul, they go astray through the ambiguous meaning of a term. When Paul says
that we are justified by faith, he means no other thing than that by faith we
are counted righteous before God. But James has quite another thing in view,
even to shew that he who professes that he has faith, must prove the reality of
his faith by his works. Doubtless James did not mean to teach us here the ground
on which our hope of salvation ought to rest; and it is this alone that Paul
dwells
upon.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd20</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That we may not then fall into that false reasoning
which has deceived the Sophists, we must take notice of the two fold meaning, of
the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>justified</i></font><font face="Palatino">.
Paul means by it the gratuitous imputation of righteousness before the tribunal
of God; and James, the manifestation of righteousness by the conduct, and that
before men, as we may gather from the preceding words, &#8220;Shew to me thy
faith,&#8221; etc. In this sense we fully allow that man is justified by works,
as when any one says that a man is enriched by the purchase of a large and
valuable chest, because his riches, before hid, shut up in a chest, were thus
made known.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By works was faith made
perfect</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd21</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By this he again shews, that the question here is not respecting the cause of
our salvation, but whether works necessarily accompany faith; for in this sense
it is said to have been perfected by works, because it was not idle. It is said
to have been perfected by works, not because it received thence its own
perfection, but because it was thus proved to be true. For the futile
distinction which the Sophists draw from these words, between formed and
unformed faith, needs no labored refutation; for the faith of Abram was formed
and therefore perfected before he sacrificed his son. And this work was not as
it were the finishing, or last work. Formerly things afterwards followed by
which Abraham proved the increase of his faith. Hence this was not the
perfection of his faith, nor did it then for the first time put on its form.
James then understood no other thing, than that the integrity of his faith then
appeared, because it brought forth that remarkable fruit of
obedience.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the Scripture was
fulfilled</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They who seek to prove from this
passage of James that the works of Abraham were imputed for righteousness, must
necessarily confess that Scripture is perverted by him; for however they may
turn and twist, they can never make the effect to be its own cause. The passage
is quoted from Moses.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;011506&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
15:6.) The imputation of righteousness which Moses mentions, preceded more than
thirty years the work by which they would have Abraham to have been justified.
Since faith was imputed to Abraham fifteen years before the birth of Isaac, this
could not surely have been done through the work of sacrificing him. I consider
that all those are bound fast by an indissoluble knot, who imagine that
righteousness was imputed to Abraham before God, because he sacrificed his son
Isaac, who was not yet born when the Holy Spirit declared that Abraham was
justified. It hence necessarily follows that something posterior is pointed out
here.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Why then does James say that it was fulfilled? Even
because he intended to shew what sort of faith that was which justified Abraham;
that is, that it was not idle or evanescent, but rendered him obedient to God,
as also we find in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581108&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:8. The conclusion, which is immediately added, as it depends on this, has no
other meaning. Man is not justified by faith alone, that is, by a bare and empty
knowledge of God; he is justified by works, that is, his righteousness is known
and proved by its fruits.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>25</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Likewise also was not
Rahab</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It seems strange that he connected
together those who were so unlike. Why did he not rather choose some one from so
large a number of illustrious fathers, and join him to Abraham? Why did he
prefer a harlot to all others? he designedly put together two persons so
different in their character, in order more clearly to shew, that no one,
whatever may have been his or her condition, nation, or class in society, has
ever been counted righteous without good works. He had named the patriarch, by
far the most eminent of all; he now includes under the person of a harlot, all
those who, being aliens, were joined to the Church. Whosoever, then, seeks to be
counted righteous, though he may even be among the lowest, must yet shew that he
is such by good works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">James, according to his manner of speaking, declares
that Rahab was justified by works; and the Sophists hence conclude that we
obtain righteousness by the merits of works. But he deny that the dispute here
is concerning the mode of obtaining righteousness. We, indeed, allow that good
works are required for righteousness; we only take away from them the power of
conferring righteousness, because they cannot stand before the tribunal of
God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd22</font></sup><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be not many
masters</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The common and almost universal
interpretation of this passage is, that the Apostle discourages the desire for
the office of teaching, and for this reason, because it is dangerous, and
exposes one to a heavier judgment, in case he transgresses: and they think that
he said<i>, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be not many
masters</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because there ought to have been some.
But I take masters not to be those who performed a public duty in the Church,
but such as took upon them the right of passing judgment upon others: for such
reprovers sought to be accounted as masters of morals. And it has a mode of
speaking usual among the Greeks as well as Latins, that they were called masters
who superciliously animadverted on others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And that he forbade them to be many, it was done for
this reason, because many everywhere did thrust in themselves; for it is, as it
were, an innate disease in mankind to seek reputation by blaming others. And, in
this respect, a twofold vice prevails &#8212; though few excel in wisdom, yet
all intrude indiscriminately into the office of masters; and then few are
influenced by a right feeling, for hypocrisy and ambition stimulate them, and
not a care for the salvation of their brethren. For it is to be observed, that
James does not discourage those brotherly admonitions, which the Spirit so often
and so much recommends to us, but that immoderate desire to condemn, which
proceeds from ambition and pride, when any one exalts himself against his
neighbor, slanders, carps, bites, and malignantly seeks for what he may turn to
a sinister purpose: for this is usually done when impertinent censors of this
kind insolently boast themselves in the work of exposing the vices of
others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">From this outrage and annoyance James recalls us; and
he adds a reason, because they who are thus severe towards others shall undergo
a heavier judgment: for he imposes a hard law on himself, who tries the words
and deeds of others according to the rule of extreme rigor; nor does he deserve
pardon, who will pardon none. This truth ought to be carefully observed, that
they who are too rigid towards their brethren, provoke against themselves the
severity of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For in many things we offend
all</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This may be taken as having been said by
way of concession, as though he had said, &#8220;Be it that thou findest what is
blamable in thy brethren, for no one is free from sins; but dost thou think that
thou art perfect who usest a slanderous and virulent tongue?&#8221; But James
seems to me to exhort us by this argument to meekness, since we are ourselves
also surrounded with many infirmities; for he acts unjustly who denies to others
the pardon he needs himself. So also Paul says, when he bids the fallen to be
reproved kindly, and in the spirit of meekness; for he immediately
adds,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;considering
thyself, lest thou also be
tempted.&#8221;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;480601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Galatians
6:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For there is nothing which serves more to moderate
extreme rigor than the knowledge of our own infirmity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>If any man offend not in
word</i></font><font face="Palatino">. After having said that there is no one
who does not sin in many things, he now shews that the disease of evil-speaking
is more odious than other sins; for by saying that he who offends not with his
tongue is <i>perfect</i>, he intimates that the restraining of the tongue is a
great virtue, and one of the chief virtues. Hence they act most perversely who
curiously examine every fault, even the least, and yet so grossly indulge
themselves.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He then indirectly touches here on the hypocrisy of
censors, because in examining themselves they omitted the chief thing, and that
was of great moment even their evil-speaking; for they who reproved others
pretended a zeal for perfect holiness, but they ought to have begun with the
tongue, if they wished to be perfect. As they made no account of bridling the
tongue, but, on the contrary, did bite and tear others, they exhibited only a
fictitious sanctity. It is hence evident that they were the most reprehensible
of all, because they neglected a primary virtue. This connection renders the
meaning of the Apostle plain to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
We put bits in the horses&#8217; mouths</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By
these two comparisons he proves that a great part of true perfection is in the
tongue, and that it exercises dominion, as he has just said, over the whole
life. He compares the tongue, first, to a bridle, and then to a helm of a ship.
Though a horse be a ferocious animal, yet he is turned about at the will of its
rider, because he is bridled; no less can the tongue serve to govern man. So
also with regard to the helm of a ship, which guides a large vessel and
surmounts the impetuosity of winds. Though the tongue be a small member, yet it
avails much in regulating the life of man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And boasteth great
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">megalaucei~n</font><font face="Palatino">
means to boast one&#8217;s self, or to vaunt. But James in this passage did not
intend to reprove ostentation so much as to show that the tongue is the doer of
great things; for in this last clause he applies the previous comparisons to his
subject; and vain boasting is not suitable to the bridle and the helm. He then
means that the tongue is endued with great power.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I have rendered what Erasmus has translated the
<i>impetuosity</i>, the <i>inclination</i>, of the pilot or guide; for
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">oJrmh&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">
means desire. I indeed allow that among the Greeks it designates those lusts
which are not subservient to reason. But here James simply speaks of the will of
the pilot. </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">He now explains the evils which proceed from the
neglect of restraining the tongue, in order that we may know that the tongue may
do much good or much evil, &#8212; that if it be modest and well regulated, it
becomes a bridle to the whole life, but that if it be petulant and violent, like
a fire it destroys all things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He represents it as a small or
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>little
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino">, to intimate that this smallness of the
tongue will not be a hindrance that its power should not extend far and wide to
do harm.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>. By adding that it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>a world of
iniquity</i></font><font face="Palatino">, it is the same as though he had
called it the sea or the abyss. And he suitably connects the smallness of the
tongue with the vastness of the world; according to this meaning, A slender
portion of flesh contains in it the whole world of iniquity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>So is the
tongue</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He explains what he meant by the term
<i>world</i>, even because the contagion of the tongue spreads through every
part of life; or rather he shews what he understood by the metaphor <i>fire</i>,
even that the tongue pollutes the whole man. He however immediately returns to
the fire, and says, that the <i>whole
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>course of
nature</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is set on fire by the tongue. And he
compares human life to a course or a wheel: and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ge&gt;nesiv</font><font face="Palatino">,
as before, he takes for nature,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;590123&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
1:23.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is, that when other vices are corrected
by age or by the succession of time, or when at least then do not possess the
whole man, the vice of the tongue spreads and prevails over every part of life;
except one prefers to take
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>setting on
fire</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as signifying a violent impulse, for we
call that fervid which is accompanied with violence. And thus Horace speaks of
wheels, for he calls chariots in battle fervid, on account of their rapidity.
The meaning then would be, that the tongue is like untamed horses; for as these
draw violently the chariots, so the tongue hurries a man headlong by its own
wantonness.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd23</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says that it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>set on fire by

that the outrageousness of the tongue is the flame of the infernal fire.

For as heathen poets imagined that the wicked are tormented by the torches of
the Furies; so it is true, that Satan by the fans of temptations kindles the
fire of all evils in the world: but James means, that fire, sent by Satan, is
most easily caught by the tongue, so that it immediately burns; in short, that
it is a material fitted for receiving or fostering and increasing the fire of
hell.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For every kind of
beasts</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is a confirmation of the last
clause; for that Satan by the tongue rules most effectively he proves by this
&#8212; that it can by no means be brought to due order; and he amplifies this
by comparisons. For he says that there is no animal so savage or fierce, which
is not tamed by the skill of man, &#8212; that fishes, which in a manner inhabit
another world, &#8212; that birds, which are so quick and roving &#8212; and
that serpents, which are so inimical to mankind, are sometimes tamed. Since then
the tongue cannot be restrained, there must be some secret fire of hell hidden
in it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he says of wild beasts, of serpents, and of
other animals, is not to be understood of them all; it is enough that the skill
of man should subdue and tame some of the most ferocious of them, and also that
serpents are sometimes tamed. He refers to present and to past time: the present
regards power and capacity, and the past, usage or experience. He hence justly
concludes that the tongue is full of deadly poison.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Though all these things most suitably refer in the
first place to the subject of this passage &#8212; that they claim an
unreasonable command over others, who labor under a worse vice; yet a universal
doctrine may be understood as taught here, &#8212; that if we desire to form our
life aright, we must especially strive to restrain the tongue, for no part of
man does more harm.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Therewith</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or, by it<i>, </i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bless we
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is a clear instance of its deadly
poison, that it can thus through a monstrous levity transform itself; for when
it pretends to bless God, it immediately curses him in his own image, even by
cursing men. For since God ought to be blessed in all his works, he ought to be
so especially as to men, in whom his image and glory peculiarly shine forth. It
is then a hypocrisy not to be borne, when man employs the same tongue in
blessing God and in cursing men. There can be then no calling on God, and his
praises must necessarily cease, when evil-speaking prevails; for it is impious
profanation of God&#8217;s name, which the tongue is virulent towards our
brethren and pretends to praise him. That he may therefore rightly praise God,
the view of evil speaking as to our neighbor must especially be
corrected.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This particular truth ought also to be borne in mind,
that severe censors discover their own virulence, which they suddenly vomit
forth against their brethren whatever curses they can imagine, after having in
sweet strains offered praises to God. Were any one to object and say, that the
image of God in human nature has been blotted out by the sin of Adam; we must,
indeed, confess that it has been miserably deformed, but in such a way that some
of its lineaments still appear. Righteousness and rectitude, and the freedom of
choosing what is good, have been lost; but many excellent endowments, by which
we excel the brutes, still remain. He, then, who truly worships and honors God,
will be afraid to speak slanderously of man.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Doth a
fountain</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He adduces these comparisons in order
to shew that a cursing tongue is something monstrous, contrary to all nature,
and subverts the order everywhere established by God. For God hath so arranged
things which are contrary, that inanimate things ought to deter us from a
chaotic mixture, sure as is found in a double
tongue.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd25</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who is a wise
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As the lust of slandering arises mostly
from pride, and as the false conceit of wisdom for the most part generates
pride, he therefore speaks here of wisdom. It is usual with hypocrites to exalt
and shew off themselves by criminating all others, as the case was formerly with
many of the philosophers, who sought glory for themselves by a bitter abuse of
all other orders. Such haughtiness as slanderous men swell with and are blinded
by, James checked, by denying that the conceit of wisdom, with which men flatter
themselves, has in it anything divine; but, on the contrary, he declares that it
proceeds from the devil.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then the meaning is, that supercilious censors, who
largely indulge themselves, and at the same time spare none, seem to themselves
to be very wise, but are greatly mistaken; for the Lord teaches his people far
otherwise, even to be meek, and to be courteous to others. They, then, are alone
wise in the sight of God, who connect this meekness with an honest conversation;
for they who are severe and inexorable, though they may excel others in many
virtues, do not yet follow the right way of
wisdom.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd26</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>l4</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But if ye have bitter
envying</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He points out the fruits which proceed
from that extreme austerity which is contrary to meekness; for immoderate rigor
necessarily begets mischievous emulations, which presently break forth into
contentions. It is, indeed, an improper mode of speaking, to place contentions
in the heart; but this affects not the meaning; for the object was to shew that
the evil disposition of the heart is the fountain of these
evils.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He has called
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>envying</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or emulation,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>bitter</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
for it prevails not, except when minds are so infected with the poison of
malignity, that they turn all things into
bitterness.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd27</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That we may then really glory that we are the
children of God, he bids us to act calmly and meekly towards our brethren;
otherwise he declares that we are lying in assuming the Christian name. But it
is not without reason that he has added the associate of envying, even
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>strife</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or contention, for contests and quarrels ever arise from malignity and
envy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This wisdom descendeth
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As hypocrites with difficulty give way, he
sharply checked their haughtiness, denying that to be true wisdom with which
they were inflated, while they were extremely morose in searching out the vices
of others. Conceding to them, however, the term
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>wisdom</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
he shews by the words he applies to it its true character, and says that it is
<i>earthly, sensual, devilish</i>, or demoniac, while true wisdom must be
heavenly, spiritual, divine; which three things are directly contrary to the
three preceding ones. For James takes it as granted, that we are not wise,
except when we are illuminated by God from above through his Spirit. However,
then, the mind of man may enlarge itself, all its acuteness will be vanity; and
not only so, but being at length entangled in the wiles of Satan, it will become
wholly
delirious.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd28</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Sensual</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
or animal, is in opposition to what is spiritual, as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460214&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 2:14, where Paul says that the sensual or animal man receives not
the things of God. And the pride of man could not have been more effectually
cast down, than when thus is condemned whatever wisdom he has from himself,
without the Spirit of God; nay, when from himself a transition is made to the
devil. For it is the same as though he had said, that men, following their own
sense, or minds, or feelings, soon became a prey to the delusions of
Satan.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For where envying
is</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is an argument from what is contrary;
for envying, by which hypocrites are influenced, produces effects contrary to
wisdom. For wisdom requires a state of mind that is calm and composed, but
envying disturbs it, so that in itself it becomes in a manner tumultuous, and
boils up immoderately against others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some render
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajkatastasi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">
inconstancy, and sometimes it means this, but as it signifies also sedition and
tumult, perturbation seems the most suitable to this passage. For James meant to
express something more than levity, even that the malignant and the slanderer
does everything confusedly and rashly, as though he were beside himself; and
hence he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>every evil
work</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the wisdom which is from
above</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now mentions the effects of celestial
wisdom which are wholly contrary to the former effects. He says first that it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pure</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
by which term he excludes hypocrisy and
ambition.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd29</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He, in the second place, calls it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>peaceable</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
to intimate that it is not contentious. In the third place, he calls it<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>kind</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or humane, that we may know that it is far away from that immoderate austerity
which tolerates nothing in our brethren. He also calls it
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>gentle</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or tractable; by which he means that it widely differs from pride and malignity.
In the last place, he says that it is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>full of
mercy</i></font><font face="Palatino">, etc., while hypocrisy is inhuman and
inexorable. By </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>good
fruits</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he generally refers to all those duties
which benevolent men perform towards their brethren; as though he had said, it
is full of benevolence. It hence follows, that they lie who glory in their cruel
austerity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But though he had sufficiently condemned hypocrisy,
when he said that wisdom is
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>pure</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or sincere; he makes it more clear by repeating the same thing at the end. We
are hence reminded, that for no other reason are we beyond measure morose or
austere, but this, because we too much spare ourselves, and connive at our own
vices.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>without
discerning</i></font><font face="Palatino"> (<i>sine dijudicatione</i>,) seems
strange; for the Spirit of God does not take away the difference between good
and evil; nor does he render us so senseless as to be so void of judgment as to
praise vice, and regard it as virtue. To this I reply, that James here, by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>discerning</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or distinguishing refers to that overanxious and overscrupulous inquiry, such as
is commonly carried on by hypocrites, who too minutely examine the sayings and
doings of their brethren, and put on them the worst
construction.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd30</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And the fruit of
righteousness</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This admits of two meanings,
&#8212; that fruit is sown by the peaceable, which afterwards they gather,
&#8212; or, that they themselves, though they meekly tolerate many things in
their neighbors, do not yet cease to sow righteousness. It is, however, an
anticipation of an objection; for they who are carried away to evil speaking by
the lust of slandering, have always this excuse, &#8220;What! can we then remove
evil by our courteousness?&#8221; Hence James says, that those who are wise
according to God&#8217;s will, are so kind, meek, and merciful, as yet not to
cover vices nor favor them; but on the contrary in such a way as to strive to
correct them, and yet in a peaceable manner, that is, in moderation, so that
union is preserved. And thus he testifies that what he had hitherto said tends
in no degree to do away with calm reproofs; but that those who wish to be
physicians to heal vices ought not to be executioners.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He therefore adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by those who make
peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">; which ought to be thus explained: they
who study peace, are nevertheless careful to sow righteousness; nor are they
slothful or negligent in promoting and encouraging good works; but they moderate
their zeal with the condiment of peace, while hypocrites throw all things into
confusion by a blind and furious violence.</font><br></div>

reminded them that vices are to be exterminated in such a way as to preserve
peace, he now comes to their contentions, by which they created confusion among
themselves; and he shews that these arose from their invidious desires and
lusts, rather than from a zeal for what was just and right; for if every one
observed moderation, they would not have disturbed and annoyed one another. They
had their hot conflicts, because their lusts were allowed to prevail
unchecked.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence appears, that greater peace would have been
among them, had every one abstained from doing wrong to others; but the vices
which prevailed among them were so many attendants armed to excite contentions.

is insatiable, when he indulges wicked lusts; and truly it is so; for he who
suffers his sinful propensities to rule uncontrolled, will know no end to his
lust. Were even the world given to him, he would wish other worlds to be created
for him. It thus happens, that men seek torments which exceed the cruelty of all
executioners. For that saying of Horace is true:</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b><i>The tyrants of

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye

fightings, which men engage in with drawn swords, but the violent contentions
which prevailed among them. They derived no benefit from contentions of this
kind, for he affirms that they received the punishment of their own wickedness.
God, indeed, whom they owned not as the author of blessings, justly disappointed
them. For when they contended in ways so unlawful, they sought to be enriched
through the favor of Satan rather than through the favor of God. One by fraud,
another by violence, one by calumnies, and all by some evil or wicked arts,
strove for happiness. They then sought to be happy, but not through God. It was
therefore no wonder that they were frustrated in their efforts, since no success
can be expected except through the blessings of God alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye seek and receive
not</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He goes farther: though they sought, yet
they were deservedly denied; because they wished to make God the minister of
their own lusts. For they set no bounds to their wishes, as he had commanded;
but gave unbridled license to themselves, so as to ask those things of which
man, conscious of what is right, ought especially to be ashamed. Pliny somewhere
ridicules this impudence, that men so wickedly abuse the ears of God. The less
tolerable is such a thing in Christians, who have had the rule of prayer given
them by their heavenly Master.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And doubtless there appears to be in us no reverence
for God, no fear of him, in short, no regard for him, when we dare to ask of him
what even our own conscience does not approve. James meant briefly this, &#8212;
that our desires ought to be bridled: and the way of bridling them is to subject
them to the will of God. And he also teaches us, that what we in moderation
wish, we ought to seek from God himself; which if it be done, we shall be
preserved from wicked contentions, from fraud and violence, and from doing any
injury to others. </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye
adulterers</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I connect this verse with the
foregoing verses: for he calls them <i>adulterers</i>, as I think,
metaphorically; for they corrupted themselves with the vanities of this world,
and alienated themselves from God; as though he had said, that they had become
degenerated, or were become bastards. We know how frequent, in Holy Scripture,
is that marriage mentioned which God forms with us. He would have us, then, to
be like a chaste virgin, as Paul says,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;471102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 11:2.) This chastity is violated and corrupted by all impure
affections towards the world. James, then, does not without reason compare the
love of the world to adultery.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">They, then, who take his words literally, do not
sufficiently observe the context: for he goes on still to speak against the
lusts of men, which lead away those entangled with the world from God, as it
follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>friendship of the
world</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He calls it the friendship of the world
when men surrender themselves to the corruptions of the world, and become slaves
to them. For such and so great is the disagreement between the world and God,
that as much as any one inclines to the world, so much he alienates himself from
God. Hence the Scripture bids us often to renounce the world, if we wish to
serve God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Do ye
think</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He seems to adduce from Scripture the
next following sentence. Hence interpreters toil much, because none such, at
least none exactly alike, is found in Scripture. But nothing hinders the
reference to be made to what has been already said, that is, that the friendship
of the world is adverse to God. Moreover; it has been rightly said, that this is
a truth which occurs everywhere in Scripture. And that he has omitted the
pronoun, which would have rendered the sentence clearer, is not to be wondered
at, for, as it is evident, he is everywhere very concise.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, Does the Spirit? Some think that
the soul of man is meant, and therefore read the sentence affirmatively, and
according to this meaning, &#8212; that the spirit of man, as it is malignant,
is so infected with envy, that it has ever a mixture of it. They, however, think
better who regard the Spirit of God as intended; for it is he that is given to
dwell in
us.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd33</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
I then take the Spirit as that of God, and read the sentence as a question; for
it was his object to prove, that because they envied they were not ruled by the
Spirit of God; because he teaches the faithful otherwise; and this he confirms
in the next verse, by adding that he<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>giveth more
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For it is an argument arising from what is contrary.
Envy is a proof or sign of malignity; but the Spirit of God proves himself to be
bountiful by the affluence of his blessings. There is then nothing more
repugnant to his nature than envy. In short, James denies that the Spirit of God
rules where depraved lusts prevail, which excite to mutual contention; because
it is peculiarly the office of the Spirit to enrich men more and more
continually with new gifts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I will not stop to refute other explanations. Some
give this meaning that the Spirit lusteth against envy; which is too harsh and
forced. Then they say that God <i>gives
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>more
grace</i></font><font face="Palatino"> to conquer and subdue lust. But the
meaning I have given is more suitable and simple, &#8212; that he restores us by
his bounty from the power of malignant emulation. The continuative particle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">de </font><font face="Palatino">is
to be taken adversatively, for
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajlla&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Submit
yourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The submission which he recommends
is that of humility; for he does not exhort us generally to obey God, but
requires submission; for the Spirit of God rests on the humble and the meek.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
57:15.) On this account he uses the illative particle. For as he had declared
that God&#8217;s Spirit is bountiful in increasing his gifts, he hence concludes
that we ought to lay aside envy, and to submit to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Many copies have introduced here the following
sentence: &#8220;Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace
unto the humble.&#8221; But in others it is not found. Erasmus suspects that it
was first a note in the margin, and afterwards crept into the text. It may have
been so, though it is not unsuitable to the passage. For what some think, that
it is strange that what is found only in Peter, should be quoted as Scripture,
may be easily disposed of. But I rather conjecture that this sentence which
accords with the common doctrine of Scripture, had become then a sort of
proverbial saying common among the Jews. And, indeed, it is no more than what is
found in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;191827&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Psalm
18:27,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;The humble O Lord,
thou wilt save;</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">and the eyes of the
proud wilt thou cast down:&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">and similar sentences are found in many other
passages.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd34</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Resist the
devil</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He shews what that contention is which
we ought to engage in, as Paul says, that our contest is not with flesh and
blood, but he stimulates us to a spiritual fight. Then, after having taught us
meekness towards men, and submission towards God, he brings before us Satan as
our enemy, whom it behooves us to fight against.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However, the promise which he adds, respecting the
fleeing of Satan, seems to be refuted by daily experience; for it is certain,
that the more strenuously any one resists, the more fiercely he is urged. For
Satan, in a manner, acts playfully, when he is not in earnest repelled; but
against those who really resist him, he employs all the strength he possesses.
And further, he is never wearied with fighting; but when conquered in one
battle, he immediately engages in another. To this I reply, that fleeing is to
be taken here for putting to flight, or routing. And, doubtless, though he
repeats his attacks continually, he yet always departs
vanquished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Draw nigh to
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He again reminds us that the aid of God
will not be wanting to us, provided we give place to him. For when he bids us to
draw nigh to God, that we may know him to be near to us he intimates that we are
destitute of his grace, because we withdraw from him. But as God stands on our
side, there is no reason to fear succumbing. But if any one concludes from this
passage, that the first part of the work belongs to us, and that afterwards the
grace of God follows, the Apostle meant no such thing; for though we ought to do
this, yet it does immediately follow that we can. And the Spirit of God, in
exhorting us to our duty, derogates nothing from himself, or from his own power;
but the very thing he bids us to do, he himself fulfills in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, James meant no other thing in this passage,
than that God is never wanting to us, except when we alienate ourselves from
him. He is like one who brings the hungry to a table and the thirsty to a
fountain. There is this difference, that our steps must be guided and sustained
by the Lord, for our feet fail us. But what some cavil at, and say, that
God&#8217;s grace is secondary to our preparation, and as it were the
waiting-maid, is only frivolous; for we know that it is no new thing that he
adds now to former graces and thus enriches more and more those to whom he has
already given much.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cleanse </i>your<i>
hands</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He here addresses all those who were
alienated from God and he does not refer to two sorts of men, but he calls the
same
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sinners</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>double-minded</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i>
Nor does he understand every kind of sinners, but the wicked and those of a
corrupt life. It is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;430903&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">John
9:3,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;God does not hear
sinners;&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">in the same sense a woman is called a sinner by Luke.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420736&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
7:36.) It is said by the same and the other evangelists, &#8220;He drinketh and
eateth with sinners.&#8221; He, therefore, does not smite all indiscriminately
to that sort of repentance mentioned here, but those who are wicked and corrupt
in heart, and whose life is base and flagitious or at least wicked; it is from
these he requires a purity of heart and outward cleanliness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn what is the true character of
repentance. It is not only an outward amendment of life, but its beginning is
the cleansing of the heart. It is also necessary on the other hand that the
fruits of inward repentance should appear in the brightness of our
works.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd35</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be afflicted and
mourn</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Christ denounces mourning on those who
laugh, as a curse,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;420625&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Luke
6:25;) and James, in what shortly follows, alluding to the same words, threatens
the rich with mourning. But here he speaks of that salutary mourning or sorrow
which leads us to repentance. He addresses those who, being inebriated in their
minds, did not perceive God&#8217;s judgment. Thus it happened that they
flattered themselves in their vices. That he might shake off from them this
deadly torpor, he admonishes them to learn to mourn, that being touched with
sorrow of conscience they might cease to flatter themselves and to exult on the
verge of destruction. Then <i>laughter </i>is to be taken as signifying the
flattering with which the ungodly deceive themselves, while they are infatuated
by the sweetness of their sins and forget the judgment of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Humble
yourselves</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, be ye humbled. The
conclusion of what is gone before is, that the grace of God then be ready to
raise us up when he sees that our proud spirits are laid aside. We emulate and
envy, because we desire to be eminent. This is a way wholly unreasonable, for it
is God&#8217;s peculiar work to raise up the lowly, and especially those who
willingly humble themselves. Whosoever, then, seeks a firm elevation, let him be
cast down under a sense of his own infirmity, and think humbly of himself.
Augustine well observes somewhere, As a tree must strike deep roots downwards,
that it may grow upwards, so every one who has not his soul fixed deep in
humility, exalts himself to his own ruin. </font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Speak not
evil</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, defame not. We see how much
labor James takes in correcting the lust for slandering. For hypocrisy is always
presumptuous, and we are by nature hypocrites, fondly exalting ourselves by
calumniating others. There is also another disease innate in human nature, that
every one would have all others to live according to his own will or fancy. This
presumption James suitably condemns in this passage, that is, because we dare to
impose on our brethren our rule of life. He then takes <i>detraction</i> as
including all the calumnies and suspicious works which flow from a malignant and
perverted judgment. The evil of slandering takes a wide range; but here he
properly refers to that kind of slandering which I have mentioned, that is, when
we superciliously determine respecting the deeds and sayings of others, as
though our own morosity were the law, when we confidently condemn whatever does
not please us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That such presumption is here reproved is evident
from the reason that is immediately added,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>He that speaketh evil
of,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or defames
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>his brother, speaketh evil of,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">or defames the law. He intimates, that so much
is taken away from the law as one claims of authority over his brethren.
Detraction, then, against the law is opposed to that reverence with which it
behooves us to regard it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Paul handles nearly the same argument in Romans 14,
though on a different occasion. For when superstition in the choice of meats
possessed some, what they thought unlawful for themselves, they condemned also
in others. He then reminded them, that there is but one Lord, according to whose
will all must stand or fall, and at whose tribunal we must all appear. Hence he
concludes that he who judges his brethren according to his own view of things,
assumes to himself what peculiarly belongs to God. But James reproves here those
who under the pretense of sanctity condemned their brethren, and therefore set
up their own morosity in the place of the divine law. He, however, employs the
same reason with Paul, that is, that we act presumptuously when we assume
authority over our brethren, while the law of God subordinates us all to itself
without exception. Let us then learn that we are not to judge but according to
God&#8217;s law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Thou art not a doer of the law, but
a judge</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This sentence ought to be thus
explained: &#8220;When thou claimest for thyself a power to censure above the
law of God thou exemptest thyself from the duty of obeying the law.&#8221; He
then who rashly judges his brother; shakes off the yoke of God, for he submits
not to the common rule of life. It is then an argument from what is contrary;
because the keeping of the law is wholly different from this arrogance, when men
ascribe to their conceit the power and authority of the law. It hence follows,
that we then only keep the law, when we wholly depend on its teaching alone and
do not otherwise distinguish between good and evil; for all the deeds and words
of men ought to be regulated by it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Were any one to object and say, that still the saints
will be the judges of the world,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;460602&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 6:2,) the answer is obvious, that this honor does not belong to them
according to their own right, but inasmuch as they are the members of Christ;
and that they now judge according to the law, so that they are not to be deemed
judges because they only obediently assent to God as their own judge and the
judge of all. With regard to God he is not to be deemed the doer of the law,
because his righteousness is prior to the law; for the law has flown from the
eternal and infinite righteousness of God as a river from its
fountain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>There is one
lawgiver</i></font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd36</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Now he connects the power of saying and destroying with the office of a
lawgiver, he intimates that the whole majesty of God is forcibly assumed by
those who claim for themselves the right of making a law; and this is what is
done by those who impose as a law on others their own nod or will. And let us
remember that the subject here is not civil government, in which the edicts and
laws of magistrates have place, but the spiritual government of the soul, in
which the word of God alone ought to bear rule. There is then one God, who has
consciences subjected by right to his own laws, as he alone has in his own hand
the power to save and to destroy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence appears what is to be thought of human
precepts, which cast the snare of necessity on consciences. Some indeed would
have us to shew modesty, when we call the Pope antichrist, who exercises tyranny
over the souls of men, making himself a lawgiver equal to God. But we learn from
this passage something far more, even that they are the members of Antichrist,
who willingly submit to be thus ensnared, and that they thus renounce Christ,
when they connect themselves with a man that is not only a mortal, but who also
extols himself against him. It is, I say, a prevaricating obedience, rendered to
the devil, when we allow any other than God himself to be a lawgiver to rule our
souls.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who art
thou</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some think that they are admonished here
to become reprovers of their own vices, in order that they might begin to
examine themselves, and that by finding out that they were not purer than
others, they might cease to be so severe. I think that their own condition is
simply suggested to men, so that they may think how much they are below that
dignity which they assumed, as Paul also says, &#8220;Who art thou who judgest
another?&#8221;

presumption, that many, who ought to have depended on God&#8217;s providence,
confidently settled what they were to do, and arranged their plans for a long
time, as though they had many years at their own disposal, while they were not
sure, no not even of one moment. Solomon also sharply ridicules this kind of
foolish boasting, when he says that</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;men settle their
ways in their heart, and that the Lord in the mean time rules the tongue.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;201601&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">Proverbs
16:1.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it is a very insane thing to undertake to execute
what we cannot pronounce with our tongue. James does not reprove the form of
speaking, but rather the arrogance of mind, that men should forget their own
weakness, and speak thus presumptuously; for even the godly, who think humbly of
themselves, and acknowledge that their steps are guided by the will of God, may
yet sometimes say, without any qualifying clause, that they will do this or
that. It is indeed right and proper, when we promise anything as to future time,
to accustom ourselves to such words as these, &#8220;If it shall please the
Lord,&#8221; &#8220;If the Lord will permit.&#8221; But no scruple ought to be
entertained, as though it were a sin to omit them; for we read everywhere in the
Scriptures that the holy servants of God spoke unconditionally of future things,
when yet they had it as a principle fixed in their minds, that they could do
nothing without the permission of God. Then as to the practice of saying,
&#8220;If the Lord will or permit,&#8221; it ought to be carefully attended to
by all the godly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But James roused the stupidity of those who
disregarded God&#8217;s providence, and claimed for themselves a whole year,
though they had not a single moment in their own power; the gain which was afar
off they promised to themselves, though they had no possession of that which was
before their feet.</font><br></div>

license in determining things to come by many other reasons; for we see how the
Lord daily frustrates those presumptuous men who promise what great things they
will do. But he was satisfied with this one argument, who has promised to thee a
life for to-morrow? Canst thou, a dying man, do what thou so confidently
resolvest to do? For he who remembers the shortness of his life, will have his
audacity easily checked so as not to extend too far his resolves. Nay, for no
other reason do ungodly men indulge themselves so much, but because they forget
that they are men. By the similitude of <i>vapor</i>, he strikingly shews that
the purposes which are founded only on the present life, are altogether

boastings. Though they robbed God of his government, they yet flattered
themselves; not that they openly set themselves up as superior to God, though
they were especially inflated with confidence in themselves, but that their
minds were inebriated with vanity so as to disregard God. And as warnings of
this kind are usually received with contempt by ungodly men &#8212; nay, this
answer is immediately given, &#8220;known to ourselves is what is offered to us,
so that there is no need of such a warning;&#8221; &#8212; he alleges against

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Go to
now</i></font><font face="Palatino">. They are mistaken, as I think, who
consider that James here exhorts the rich to repentance. It seems to me to be a
simple denunciation of God&#8217;s judgment, by which he meant to terrify them
without giving them any hope of pardon; for all that he says tends only to
despair. He, therefore, does not address them in order to invite them to
repentance; but, on the contrary, he has a regard to the faithful, that they,
hearing of the miserable and of the rich, might not envy their fortune, and also
that knowing that God would be the avenger of the wrongs they suffered, they
might with a calm and resigned mind bear
them.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd38</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he does not speak of the rich indiscriminately,
but of those who, being immersed in pleasures and inflated with pride, thought
of nothing but of the world, and who, like inexhaustible gulfs, devoured
everything; for they, by their tyranny, oppressed others, as it appears from the
whole passage.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Weep and
howl</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, Lament, howling. Repentance has
indeed its weeping, but being mixed with consolation, it does not proceed to
howling. Then James intimates that the heaviness of God&#8217;s vengeance will
be so horrible and severe on the rich, that they will be constrained to break
forth into howling, as though he had said briefly to them, &#8220;Woe to
you!&#8221; But it is a prophetic mode of speaking: the ungodly have the
punishment which awaits them set before them, and they are represented as
already enduring it. As, then, they were now flattering themselves, and
promising to themselves that the prosperity in which they thought themselves
happy would be perpetual, he declared that the most grievous miseries were nigh
at hand.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Your
riches</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The meaning may be twofold: &#8212;
that he ridicules their foolish confidence, because the riches in which they
placed their happiness, were wholly fading, yea, that they could be reduced to
nothing by one blast from God &#8212; or that he condemns as their insatiable
avarice, because they heaped together wealth only for this, that they might
perish without any benefit. This latter meaning is the most suitable. It is,
indeed, true that those rich men are insane who glory in things so fading as
garments, gold, silver, and such things, since it is nothing else than to make
their glory subject to rust and moths; and well known is that saying &#8220;What
is ill got is soon lost;&#8221; because the curse of God consumes it all, for it
is not right that the ungodly or their heirs should enjoy riches which they have
snatched, as it were, by violence from the hand of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as James enumerates the vices of which the rich
brought on themselves the calamity which he mentions, the context requires, as I
think, that we should say, that what he condemns here is the extreme rapacity of
the rich, in retaining everything they could lay hold on, that it might rot
uselessly in their chests. For thus it was, that what God had created for the
use of men, they destroyed, as though they were the enemies of
mankind.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd39</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it must be observed, that the vices which he
mentions here do not belong to all the rich; for some of them indulge themselves
in luxury, some spend much in show and display, and some pinch themselves, and
live miserably in their own filth. Let us, then, know that he here reproves some
vices in some, and some vices in others. However, all those are generally
condemned who unjustly accumulate riches, or who foolishly abuse them. But what
James now says, is not only suitable to the rich of extreme tenacity, (such as
Euclio of Plautus,) but to those also who delight in pomp and luxury, and yet
prefer to heap up riches rather than to employ them for necessary purposes. For
such is the malignity of some, that they grudge to others the common sun and
air.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>A witness against
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He confirms the explanation I have already
given. For God has not appointed gold for rust, nor garments for moths; but, on
the contrary, be has designed them as aids and helps to human life. Therefore,
even spending without benefit is a witness of inhumanity. The rusting of gold
and silver will be, as it were, the occasion of inflaming the wrath of God, so
that it will, like fire, consume them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have heaped treasure
together</i></font><font face="Palatino">: These words may also admit of two
explanations: &#8212; that the rich, as they would always live, are never
satisfied, but weary themselves in heaping together what may be sufficient to
the end of the world, &#8212; or, that they heap together the wrath and curse of
God for the last day; and this second view I
embrace.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd40</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the
hire</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now condemns cruelty, the invariable
companion of avarice. But he refers only to one kind, which, above all others,
ought justly to be deemed odious. For if a humane and a just man, as Solomon
says in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;201210&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
12:10, regards the life of his beast, it is a monstrous barbarity, when man
feels no pity towards the man whose sweat he has employed for his own benefit.
Hence the Lord has strictly forbidden, in the law, the hire of the laborer to
sleep with us
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;052415&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
24:15). Besides, James does not refer to laborers in common, but, for the sake
of amplifying, he mentions husbandmen and reapers. For what can be more base
than that they, who supply us with bread by their labor should be pined through
want? And yet this monstrous thing is common; for there are many of such a
tyrannical disposition, that they think that the rest of mankind live only for
their benefit alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says that this hire <i>crieth</i>, for
whatever men retain either by fraud or by violence, of what belongs to another;
it calls for vengeance as it were by a loud voice. We ought to notice what he
adds, that the <i>cries</i> of the poor come to the ears of God, so that we may
know that the wrong done to them shall not be unpunished. They, therefore, who
are oppressed by the unjust ought resignedly to sustain their evils, because
they will have God as their defender. And they who have the power of doing wrong
ought to abstain from injustice, lest they provoke God against them, who is the
protector and patron of the poor. And for this reason also he calls God the Lord
of Sabaoth, or of hosts, intimating thereby his power and his might, by which he
renders his judgment more dreadful.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In
pleasure</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He comes now to another vice, even
luxury and sinful gratifications; for they who abound in wealth seldom keep
within the bounds of moderation, but abuse their abundance by extreme
indulgences. There are, indeed, some rich men, as I have said, who pine
themselves in the midst of their abundance. For it was not without reason that
the poets have imagined Tantalus to be hungry near a table well furnished. There
have ever been Tantalians in the world. But James, as it has been said, does not
speak of all rich men. It is enough that we see this vice commonly prevailing
among the rich, that they are given too much to luxuries, to pomps and
superfluities.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And though the Lord allows them to live freely on
what they have, yet profusion ought to be avoided and frugality practiced. For
it was not in vain that the Lord by his prophets severely reproved those who
slept on beds of ivory, who used precious ointments, who delighted themselves at
their feasts with the sound of the harp, who were like fat cows in rich
pastures. For all these things have been said for this end, that we may know
that moderation ought to be observed, and that extravagance is displeasing to
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have nourished your
hearts</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He means that they indulged themselves,
not only as far as to satisfy nature, but as far as their cupidity led them. He
adds a similitude, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>as in a day of
slaughter</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because they were wont in their
solemn sacrifices to eat more freely than according to their daily habits. He
then says, that the rich feasted themselves every day of their life, because
they immersed themselves in perpetual indulgences.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye have
condemned</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Here follows another kind of
inhumanity, that the rich by their power oppressed and destroyed the poor and
weak. He says by a metaphor that the just were condemned and killed; for when
they did not kill them by their own hand, or condemn them as judges, they yet
employed the authority which they had to do wrong, they corrupted judgments, and
contrived various arts to destroy the innocent, that is, really to condemn and
kill
them.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd41</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By adding that the just did <i>not resist</i> them,
he intimates that the audacity of the rich was greater; because those whom they
oppressed were without any protection. He, however, reminds them that the more
ready and prompt would be the vengeance of God, when the poor have no protection
from men. But though the just did not resist, because he ought to have patiently
endured wrongs, I yet think that their weakness is at the same time referred to,
that is he did not resist, because he was unprotected and without any help from
men.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Be patient
therefore</i></font><font face="Palatino">. From this inference it is evident
that what has hitherto been said against the rich, pertains to the consolation
of those who seemed for a time to be exposed to their wrongs with impunity. For
after having mentioned the causes of those calamities which were hanging over
the rich, and having stated this among others, that they proudly and cruelly
ruled over the poor, he immediately adds, that we who are unjustly oppressed,
have this reason to be patient, because God would become the judge. For this is
what he means when he says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unto
the coming of the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, that the
confusion of things which is now seen in the world will not be perpetual,
because the Lord at his coming will reduce things to order, and that therefore
our minds ought to entertain good hope; for it is not without reason that the
restoration of all things is promised to us at that day. And though the day of
the Lord is everywhere called in the Scriptures a manifestation of his judgment
and grace, when he succors his people and chastises the ungodly, yet I prefer to
regard the expression here as referring to our final
deliverance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Behold, the
husbandman</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Paul briefly refers to the same
similitude in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;550206&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Timothy 2:6, when he says that the husband man ought to labor before he gathers
the fruit; but James more fully expresses the idea, for he mentions the daily
patience of the husbandman, who, after having committed the seed to the earth,
confidently, or at least patiently, waits until the time of harvest comes; nor
does he fret because the earth does not immediately yield a ripe fruit. He hence
concludes, that we ought not to be immoderately anxious, if we must now labor
and sow, until the harvest as it were comes, even the day of the
Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The precious
fruit</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He calls it precious, because it is the
nourishment of life and the means of sustaining it. And James intimates, that
since the husbandman suffers his life, so precious to him, to lie long deposited
in the bosom of the earth, and calmly suspends his desire to gather the fruit,
we ought not to be too hasty and fretful, but resignedly to wait for the day of
our redemption. It is not necessary to specify particularly the other parts of
the comparison.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The early and the latter
rains</i></font><font face="Palatino">. By the two words,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>early
</i></font><font face="Palatino">and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>latter</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
two seasons are pointed out; the first follows soon after sowing; and the other
when the corn is ripening. So the prophets spoke, when they intended to set
forth the time for rain,
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;052812&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
28:12;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;290223&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Joel
2:23;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;280603&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hosea
6:3.) And he has mentioned both times, in order more fully to shew that
husbandmen are not disheartened by the slow progress of time, but bear with the
delay.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Stablish your
hearts</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Lest any should object and say, that
the time of deliverance was too long delayed, he obviates this objection and
says, that the Lord was at hand, or (which is the same thing) that his coming
was drawing nigh. In the meantime, he bids us to correct the softness of the
heart, which weakens us, so as not to persevere in hope. And doubtless the time
appears long, because we are too tender and delicate. We ought, then, to gather
strength that we may become hardened and this cannot be better attained than by
hope, and as it were by a realizing view of the near approach of our
Lord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Grudge
not</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>, </i>or, groan not<i>.</i> As the
complaints of many were heard, that they were more severely treated than others,
this passage is so explained by some, as though James bade each to be contented
with his own lot, not to envy others, nor grudge if the condition of others was
more tolerable. But I take another view; for after having spoken of the
unhappiness of those who distress good and quiet men by their tyranny, he now
exhorts the faithful to be just towards one another and ready to pass by
offenses. That this is the real meaning may be gathered from the reason that is
added: Be not querulous one against another;
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lest ye be
condemned</i></font><font face="Palatino">. We may, indeed, groan, when any evil
torments us; but he means an accusing groan, when one expostulates with the Lord
against another. And he declares that thus they would all be condemned, because
there is no one who does not offend his brethren, and afford them an occasion of
groaning. Now, if everyone complained, they would all have accused one another;
for no one was so innocent, that he did not do some harm to
others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">God will be the common judge of all. What, then, will
be the case, but that every one who seeks to bring judgment on others, must
allow the same against himself; and thus all will be given up to the same ruin.
Let no one, then, ask for vengeance on others, except he wishes to bring it on
his own head. And lest they should be hasty in making complaints of this kind,
he declares that the judge was at the door. For as our propensity is to profane
the name of God, in the slightest offenses we appeal to his judgment. Nothing is
a fitter bridle to check our rashness, than to consider that our imprecations
vanish not into air, because God&#8217;s judgment is at hand.</font><br></div>

that which is according to the common proverb, that the miserable hope for like
companions in evils. That they set before them associates, in whose number it
was desirable to be classed; and to have the same condition with them, was no
misery. For as we must necessarily feel extreme grief, when any evil happens to
us which the children of God have never experienced, so it is a singular
consolation when we know that we suffer nothing different from them; nay, when
we know that we have to sustain the same yoke with them.</font><br></div>

5:1,)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">it was the voice of Satan, because he wished to drive
him to despair. When, on the other hand, the Spirit by the mouth of James
designs to raise us up to a good hope, he shews to us all the fore-going saints,
who as it were stretch out their hand to us, and by their example encourage us
to undergo and to conquer afflictions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The life of men is indeed indiscriminately subject to
troubles and adversities; but James did not bring forward any kind of men for
examples, for it would have availed nothing to perish with the multitude; but he
chose the prophets, a fellowship with whom is blessed. Nothing so breaks us down
and disheartens us as the feeling of misery; it is therefore a real consolation
to know that those things commonly deemed evils are aids and helps to our
salvation. This is, indeed, what is far from being understood by the flesh; yet
the faithful ought to be convinced of this, that they are happy when by various
troubles they are proved by the Lord. To convince us of this, James reminds us
to consider the end or design of the afflictions endured by the prophets; for as
our own evils we are without judgment, being influenced by grief, sorrow, or
some other immoderate feelings, as we see nothing under a foggy sky and in the
midst of storms, and being tossed here and there as it were by a tempest, it is
therefore necessary for us to cast our eyes to another quarter, where the sky is
in a manner serene and bright. When the afflictions of the saints are related to
us, there is no one who will allow that they were miserable, but, on the
contrary, that they were happy.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then James has done well for us; for he has laid
before our eyes a pattern, that we may learn to look at it whenever we are
tempted to impatience or to despair: and he takes this principle as granted,
that the prophets were blessed in their afflictions, for they courageously
sustained them. Since it was so, he concludes that the same judgment ought to be
formed of us when afflicted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the prophets who have spoken in
the name of the Lord</i></font><font face="Palatino">; by which he intimates
that they were accepted and approved by God. If, then, it had been useful for
them to have been free from miseries, doubtless God would have kept them free.
But it was otherwise. It hence follows that afflictions are salutary to the
faithful. He, therefore, bids them to be taken as an example of suffering
affliction. But patience also must be added, which is a real evidence of our
obedience. Hence he has joined them both together.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The patience of
Job</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Having spoken generally of the prophets,
he now refers to an example remarkable above others; for no one, as far as we
can learn from histories, has ever been overwhelmed with troubles so hard and so
various as Job; and yet he emerged from so deep a gulf. Whosoever, then, will
imitate his patience, will no doubt find God&#8217;s hand, which at length
delivered him, to be the same. We see for what end his history has been written.
God suffered not his servant Job to sink, because he patiently endured his
afflictions. Then he will disappoint the patience of no one.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If, however, it be asked, Why does the Apostle so
much commend the patience of Job, as he had displayed many signs of impatience,
being carried away by a hasty spirit? To this I reply, that though he sometimes
failed through the infirmity of the flesh, or murmured within himself, yet he
ever surrendered himself to God, and was ever willing to be restrained and ruled
by him. Though, then, his patience was somewhat deficient, it is yet deservedly
commended.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The end of the
Lord.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words he intimates that
afflictions ought ever to be estimated by their end. For at first God seems to
be far away, and Satan in the meantime revels in the confusion; the flesh
suggests to us that we are forsaken of God and lost. We ought, then, to extend
our view farther, for near and around us there appears no light. Moreover, he
has called it the end of the Lord, because it is his work to give a prosperous
issue to adversities. If we do our duty in bearing evils obediently, he will by
no means be wanting in performing his part. Hope directs us only to the end; God
will then shew himself very merciful, how ever rigid and severe he may seem to
be while afflicting
us.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd42</font></sup><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But above all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It has been a common vice almost in all
ages, to swear lightly and inconsiderately. For so bad is our nature that we do
not consider what an atrocious crime it is to profane the name of God. For
though the Lord strictly commands us to reverence his name, yet men devise
various subterfuges, and think that they can swear with impunity. They imagine,
then, that there is no evil, provided they do not openly mention the name of
God; and this is an old gloss. So the Jews, when they swore by heaven or earth,
thought that they did not profane God&#8217;s name, because they did not mention
it. But while men seek to be ingenious in dissembling with God, they delude
themselves with the most frivolous evasions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was a vain excuse of this kind that Christ
condemned in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400534&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
5:34. James, now subscribing to the decree of his master, commands us to abstain
from these indirect forms of swearing: for whosoever swears in vain and on
frivolous occasions, profanes God&#8217;s name, whatever form he may give to his
words. Then the meaning is, that it is not more lawful to swear by heaven or by
the earth, than openly by the name of God. The reason is mentioned by Christ
&#8212; because the glory of God is everywhere inscribed, and everywhere shines
forth. Nay, men take the words, heaven and earth, in their oaths, in no other
sense and for no other purpose, than if they named God himself; for by thus
speaking they only designate the Worker by his works.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>above all
things</i></font><font face="Palatino">; because the profanation of God&#8217;s
name is not a slight offense. The Anabaptists, building on this passage, condemn
all oaths, but they only shew their ignorance. For James does not speak of oaths
in general, nor does Christ in the passage to which I have referred; but both
condemn that evasion which had been devised, when men took the liberty to swear
without expressing the name of God, which was a liberty repugnant to the
prohibition of the law.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And this is what the words clearly mean,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Neither by heaven, neither by the
earth</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For, if the question had been as to
oaths in themselves, to what purpose were these forms mentioned? It then appears
evident that both by Christ and by James the puerile astuteness of those is
reproved who taught that they could swear with impunity, provided they adopted
some circuitous expressions. That we may, then, understand the meaning of James,
we must understand first the precept of the law, &#8220;Thou shalt not take the
name of God <i>in vain</i>.&#8221; It hence appears clear, that there is a right
and lawful use of God&#8217;s name. Now, James condemns those who did not indeed
dare in a direct way to profane God&#8217;s name, but endeavored to evade the
profanation which the law condemns, by circumlocutions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But let your yea be
yea</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He brings the best remedy to correct the
vice which he condemns, that is, that they were habitually to keep themselves to
truth and faithfulness in all their sayings. For whence is the wicked habit of
swearing, except that such is the falsehood of men, that their words alone are
not believed? For, if they observed faithfulness, as they ought, in their words,
there would have been no necessity of so many superfluous oaths. As, then, the
perfidy or levity of men is the fountain from which the vice of swearing flows,
in order to take away the vice, James teaches us that the fountain ought to be
removed; for the right way of healing is to begin with the cause of
illness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some copies have, &#8220; Let your word (or speech)
be, yea, yea; no, no.&#8221; The true reading however, is what I have given, and
is commonly received; and what he means I have already explained, that is, that
we ought to tell the truth, and to be faithful in our words. To the same purpose
is what Paul says in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 1:18, that he was not in his preaching yea and nay, but pursued the
same course from the beginning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Lest ye fall into
condemnation</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There is a different reading,
owing to the affinity of the words
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpo&lt;
kri&gt;sin</font><font face="Palatino"> and
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">uJpo&gt;krisin</font><font face="Palatino">.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd43</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
If you read, &#8220;into judgment&#8221; or condemnation, the sense will clearly
be, that to take God&#8217;s name in vain will not be unpunished. But it is not
unsuitable to say, &#8220;into hypocrisy;&#8221; because when simplicity, as it
has been already said, prevails among us, the occasion for superfluous oaths is
cut off. If, then, fidelity appears in all we say, the dissimulation, which
leads us to swear rashly, will be removed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Is any among you
afflicted</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>?</i> he means that there is no
time in which God does not invite us to himself. For afflictions ought to
stimulate us to pray; prosperity supplies us with an occasion to praise God. But
such is the perverseness of men, that they cannot rejoice without forgetting
God, and that when afflicted they are disheartened and driven to despair. We
ought, then, to keep within due bounds, so that the joy, which usually makes us
to forget God, may induce us to set forth the goodness of God, and that our
sorrow may teach us to pray. For he has set the <i>singing of psalms</i> in
opposition to profane and unbridled joy; and thus they express their joy who are
led, as they ought to be, by prosperity to God.</font><br></div>

he directs the sick to have recourse to that remedy. It is, indeed, certain that
they were not all healed; but the Lord granted this favor as often and as far as
he knew it would be expedient; nor is it probable that the oil was
indiscriminately applied, but only when there was some hope of restoration. For,
together with the power there was given also discretion to the ministers, lest
they should by abuse profane the symbol. The design of James was no other than
to commend the grace of God which the faithful might then enjoy, lest the
benefit of it should be lost through contempt or neglect.</font><br></div>

passage is wickedly and ignorantly perverted; when extreme unction is
established by it, and is called a sacrament, to be perpetually observed in the
Church. I indeed allow that it was used as a sacrament by the disciples of
Christ, (for I cannot agree with those who think that it was medicine;) but as
the reality of this sign continued only for a time in the Church, the symbol
also must have been only for a time. And it is quite evident, that nothing is
more absurd than to call that a sacrament which is void and does not really
present to us that which it signifies. That the gift of healing was temporary,
all are constrained to allow, and events clearly prove: then the sign of it
ought not to be deemed perpetual. It hence follows, that they who at this day
set anointing among the sacraments, are not the true followers, but the apes of
the Apostles, except they restore the effect produced by it, which God has taken
away from the world for more than fourteen hundred years. So we have no dispute,
whether anointing was once a sacrament; but whether it has been given to be so
perpetually. This latter we deny, because it is evident that the thing signified
has long ago ceased.</font><br></div>

presbyters</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or elders,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of the
church</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I include here generally all those who
presided over the Church; for pastors were not alone called presbyters or
elders, but also those who were chosen from the people to be as it were censors
to protect discipline. For every Church had, as it were, its own senate, chosen
from men of weight and of proved integrity. But as it was customary to choose
especially those who were endued with gifts more than ordinary, he ordered them
to send for the elders, as being those in whom the power and grace of the Holy
Spirit more particularly appeared.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Let them pray over
him.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This custom of praying over one was
intended to shew, that they stood as it were before God; for when we come as it
were to the very scene itself, we utter prayers with more feeling; and not only
Elisha and Paul, but Christ himself, roused the ardor of prayer and commended
the grace of God by thus praying over persons.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>15</b>. But it must be observed, that he connects
a promise with the prayer, lest it should be made without faith. For he who
doubts, as one who does not rightly call on God, is unworthy to obtain anything,
as we have seen in the first chapter. Whosoever then really seeks to be heard,
must be fully persuaded that he does not pray in vain.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As James brings before us this special gift, to which
the external rite was but an addition, we hence learn, that the oil could not
have been rightly used without faith. But since it appears that the Papists have
no certainty as to their anointing, as it is manifest that they have not the
gift, it is evident that their anointing is spurious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And if he have committed
sins</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This is not added only for the sake of
amplifying, as though he had said, that God would give something more to the
sick than health of body; but because diseases were very often inflicted on
account of sins; and by speaking of their remission he intimates that the cause
of the evil would be removed. And we indeed see that David, when afflicted with
disease and seeking relief, was wholly engaged in seeking the pardon of his
sins. Why did he do this, except that while he acknowledged the effect of his
faults in his punishment, he deemed that there was no other remedy, but that the
Lord should cease to impute to him his sins?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The prophets are full of this doctrine, that men are
relieved from their evils when they are loosed from the guilt of their
iniquities. Let us then know that it is the only fit remedy for our diseases and
other calamities, when we carefully examine ourselves, being solicitous to be
reconciled to God, and to obtain the pardon of our sins. </font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Confess your faults one to
another</i></font><font face="Palatino">. In some copies the illative particle
is given, nor is it unsuitable; for though when not expressed, it must be
understood. He had said, that sins were remitted to the sick over whom the
elders prayed: he now reminds them how useful it is to discover our sins to our
brethren, even that we may obtain the pardon of them by their
intercession.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd44</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This passage, I know, is explained by many as
referring to the reconciling of offenses; for they who wish to return to favor
must necessarily know first their own faults and confess them. For hence it
comes, that hatreds take root, yea, and increase and become irreconcilable,
because every one perniciously defends his own cause. Many therefore think that
James points out here the way of brotherly reconciliation, that is, by mutual
acknowledgment of sins. But as it has been said, his object was different; for
he connects mutual prayer with mutual confession; by which he intimates that
confession avails for this end, that we may be helped as to God by the prayers
of our brethren; for they who know our necessities, are stimulated to pray that
they may assist us; but they to whom our diseases are unknown are more tardy to
bring us help.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Wonderful, indeed, is the folly or the insincerity of
the Papists, who strive to build their whispering confession on this passage.
For it would be easy to infer from the words of James, that the priests alone
ought to confess. For since a mutual, or to speak more plainly, a reciprocal
confession is demanded here, no others are bidden to confess their own sins, but
those who in their turn are fit to hear the confession of others; but this the
priests claim for themselves alone. Then confession is required of them alone.
But since their puerilities do not deserve a refutation, let the true and
genuine explanation already given be deemed sufficient by us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For the words clearly mean, that confession is
required for no other end, but that those who know our evils may be more
solicitous to bring us help.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Availeth
much.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> That no one may think that this is done
without fruit, that is, when others pray for us, he expressly mentions the
benefit and the effect of prayer. But he names expressly the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>prayer of a
righteous</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or just <i>man;</i> because God does
not hear the ungodly; nor is access to God open, except through a good
conscience: not that our prayers are founded on our own worthiness, but because
the heart must be cleansed by faith before we can present ourselves before God.
Then James testifies that the righteous or the faithful pray for us beneficially
and not without fruit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But what does he mean by adding <i>effectual</i> or
efficacious? For this seems superfluous; for if the prayer avails much, it is
doubtless effectual. The ancient interpreter has rendered it
&#8220;assiduous;&#8221; but this is too forced. For James uses the Greek
participle,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejneroume&gt;nh</font><font face="Palatino">,
which means &#8220;working.&#8221; And the sentence may be thus explained,
&#8220;It avails much, because it is
effectual.&#8221;</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fd45</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As it is an argument drawn from this principle, that God will not allow the
prayers of the faithful to be void or useless, he does not therefore unjustly
conclude that it avails much. But I would rather confine it to the present case:
for our prayers may properly be said to be
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejnergou&gt;menai</font><font face="Palatino">,
working, when some necessity meets us which excites in us earnest prayer. We
pray daily for the whole Church, that God may pardon its sins; but then only is
our prayer really in earnest, when we go forth to succor those who are in
trouble. But such efficacy cannot be in the prayers of our brethren, except they
know that we are in difficulties. Hence the reason given is not general, but
must be specially referred to the former sentence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17</b>.
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Elias was a
man</i></font><font face="Palatino">. There are innumerable instances in
Scripture of what he meant to prove; but he chose one that is remarkable above
all others; for it was a great thing that God should make heaven in a manner
subject to the prayers of Elias, so as to obey his wishes. Elias kept heaven
shut by his prayers for three years and a half; he again opened it, so that it
poured down abundance of rain. Hence appeared the wonderful power of prayer.
Well known is this remarkable history, and is found in 1 Kings 17 and 1 Kings
18. And though it is not there expressly said, that Elias prayed for drought, it
may yet be easily gathered, and that the rain also was given to his
prayers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must notice the application of the example.
James does not say that drought ought to be sought from the Lord, because Elias
obtained it; for we may by inconsiderate zeal presumptuously and foolishly
imitate the Prophet. We must then observe the rule of prayer, so that it may be
by faith. He, therefore, thus accommodates this example, &#8212; that if Elias
was heard, so also we shall be heard when we rightly pray. For as the command to
pray is common, and as the promise is common, it follows that the effect also
will be common.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Lest any one should object and say, that we are far
distant from the dignity of Elias, he places him in our own rank, by saying,
that he was a mortal
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>man</i></font><font face="Palatino">
and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>subject to the same
passions</i></font><font face="Palatino"> with ourselves. For we profit less by
the examples of saints, because we imagine them to have been half gods or
heroes, who had peculiar intercourse with God; so that because they were heard,
we receive no confidence. In order to shake off this heathen and profane
superstition, James reminds us that the saints ought to be considered as having
the infirmity of the flesh; so that we may learn to ascribe what they obtained
from the Lord, not to their merits, but to the efficacy of
prayer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It hence appears how childish the Papists are, who
teach men to flee to the protection of saints, because they had been heard by
the Lord. For thus they reason, &#8220;Because he obtained what he asked as long
as he lived in the world, he will be now after death our best patron.&#8221;
This sort of subtle refinement was altogether unknown to the Holy Spirit. For
James on the contrary argues, that as their prayers availed so much, so we ought
in like manner to pray at this day according to their example, and that we shall
not do so in vain.</font><br></div>

been written,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">givw&gt;skete</font><font face="Palatino">,
&#8220;know ye.&#8221; Both ways the meaning however is the same. For James
recommends to us the correction of our brethren from the effect produced that we
may more assiduously attend to this duty. Nothing is better or more desirable
than to deliver a soul from eternal death; and this is what he does who restores
an erring brother to the right way: therefore a work so excellent ought by no
means to be neglected. To give food to the hungry, and drink to the thirsty, we
see how much Christ values such acts; but the salvation of the soul is esteemed
by him much more precious than the life of the body. We must therefore take heed
lest souls perish through our sloth, whose salvation God puts in a manner in our
hands. Not that we can bestow salvation on them; but that God by our ministry
delivers and saves those who seem otherwise to be nigh
destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some copies have <i>his soul</i>, which makes no
change in the sense. I, however, prefer the other reading, for it has more force
in it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And shall hide a multitude of

Solomon, rather than a quotation.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;201012&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
10:12.) Solomon says that love covers sins, as hatred proclaims them. For they
who hate burn with the desire of mutual slander; but they who love are disposed
to exercise mutual forbearance. Love, then, buries sins as to men. James teaches
here something higher, that is, that sins are blotted out before God; as though
he had said, Solomon has declared this as the fruit of love, that it covers
sins; but there is no better or more excellent way of covering them than when
they are wholly abolished before God. And this is done when the sinner is
brought by our admonition to the right way: we ought then especially and more
carefully to attend to this duty.</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino"><b>END OF THE EPISTLE OF
JAMES</b></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE ARGUMENT</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The doubts respecting this Epistle mentioned by
Eusebius, ought not to keep us from reading it. For if the doubts rested on the
authority of men, whose names he does not give, we ought to pay no more regard
to it than to that of unknown men. And he afterwards adds, that it was
everywhere received without any dispute. What Jerome writes influences me
somewhat more, that some, induced by a difference in the style, did not think
that Peter was the author. For though some affinity may be traced, yet I confess
that there is that manifest difference which distinguishes different writers.
There are also other probable conjectures by which we may conclude that it was
written by another rather than by Peter. At the same time, according to the
consent of all, it has nothing unworthy of Peter, as it shews everywhere the
power and the grace of an apostolic spirit. If it be received as canonical, we
must allow Peter to be the author, since it has his name inscribed, and he also
testifies that he had lived with Christ: and it would have been a fiction
unworthy of a minister of Christ, to have personated another individual. So then
I conclude, that if the Epistle be deemed worthy of credit, it must have
proceeded from Peter; not that he himself wrote it, but that some one of his
disciples set forth in writing, by his command, those things which the necessity
of the times required. For it is probable that he was now in extreme old age,
for he says, that he was near his end. And it may have been that at the request
of the godly, he allowed this testimony of his mind to be recorded shortly
before his death, because it might have somewhat availed, when he was dead, to
support the good, and to repress the wicked. Doubtless, as in every part of the
Epistle the majesty of the Spirit of Christ appears, to repudiate it is what I
dread, though I do not here recognize the language of Peter. But since it is not
quite evident as to the author, I shall allow myself the liberty of using the
word Peter or Apostle indiscriminately.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I shall now come to the argument, which may be
briefly stated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The <i>design</i> is to shew, that those who have
once professed the true faith of Christ, ought to respond to their calling to
the last. After having then extolled, in high terms, the grace of God, he
recommends to them holiness of life, because God usually punishes in hypocrites
a false profession of his name, with dreadful blindness, and on the other hand
he increases his gifts to those who truly and from the heart embrace the
doctrine of religion. He, therefore, exhorts them to prove their calling by a
holy life. And, to give a greater weight to his admonitions, he says that he is
already near his end, and at the same time, excuses himself that he so often
repeated the same things, his object being that they who should remain alive on
the earth after his death, might have what he, when alive, wrote, more deeply
fixed in their minds.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And as the foundation of true religion is the
certainty or the truth of the gospel, he shews, first, how indubitable is its
truth by this fact,-that he himself had been an eyewitness of all things which
it contains, and especially that he had heard Christ proclaimed from heaven to
be the Son of God; and, in the second place, it was God's will that it should be
borne witness to, and approved by the oracles of the prophets.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He, however, predicts, at the same time, that danger
was approaching from false teachers, who would spread impious inventions, as
well as from the despisers of God, who would mock all religion; and he did this,
that the he seems to have spoken thus designedly, lest they expected that the
course of truth in the kingdom Of Christ would be tranquil and peaceable, and
free from all contention. He afterwards, as on a tablet, describes the character
and manners of those who would, by their corruptions, pollute Christianity. But
the description which he presents, especially suits the present age, as it will
be more evident by a comparison. For he especially draws his pen against
Lucianic men, who abandon themselves to every wickedness, and take a profane
license to shew contempt to God, yea, and treat with ridicule the hope of a
better life; and at this day we see that the world is everywhere full of such
rabble.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He further exhorts the faithful, not only to look
always for the coming of Christ with suspended and expectant minds, but also to
regard that day as present before their eyes, and in the meantime to keep
themselves unpolluted for the Lord: in which doctrine he makes Paul as his
associate and approver; and to defend his writings from the calumnies of the
ungodly, he severely reproves all those who pervert them.</font><br></div>

not that it is equal in all, but because all possess by faith the same Christ
with his righteousness, and the same salvation. Though then the measure is
different, that does not prevent the knowledge of God from being common to all,
and the fruit which proceeds from it. Thus we have a real fellowship of faith
with Peter and the Apostles.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through the righteousness of God,
</i></font><font face="Palatino">in order that they might know that they did not
obtain faith through their own efforts or strength, but through God's favor
alone. For these things stand opposed the one to the other, the righteousness of
God (in the sense in which it is taken here) and the merit of man. For the
efficient cause of faith is called God's righteousness for this reason, because
no one is capable of conferring it on himself. So the righteousness that is to
be understood, is not that which remains in God, but that which he imparts to
men, as in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450322&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
3:22. Besides, he ascribes this righteousness in common to God and to Christ,
because it flows from God, and through Christ it flows down to
us.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc2</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Grace and
peace.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By grace is designated God&#8217;s
paternal favor towards us. We have indeed been once for all reconciled to God by
the death of Christ, and by faith we come to the possession of this so great a
benefit; but as we perceive the grace of God according to the measure of our
faith, it is said to increase according to our perception when it becomes more
fully known to us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Peace</i></font><font face="Palatino">
is added; for as the beginning of our happiness is when God receives us into
favor; so the more he confirms his love in our hearts, the richer blessing he
confers on us, so that we become happy and prosperous in all
things,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Through the

often means &#8220;through&#8221; or &#8220;with:&#8221; yet both senses may
suit the context. I am, however, more disposed to adopt the former. For the more
any one advances in the knowledge of God, every kind of blessing increases also
equally with the sense of divine love. Whosoever then aspires to the full
fruition of the blessed life which is mentioned by Peter, must remember to
observe the right way. He connects together at the same time the knowledge of
God and of Christ; because God cannot be rightly known except in Christ,
according to that saying,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;No one knoweth the
Father but the Son, and he to
whom</font><br><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">the Son will reveal

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>According as his divine
power.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He refers to the infinite goodness of
God which they had ,already experienced, that they might more fully understand
it for the future. For he continues the course of his benevolence perpetually to
the end, except when we ourselves break it off by our unbelief; for he possesses
exhaustless power and an equal will to do good. Hence the Apostle justly
animates the faithful to entertain good hope by the consideration of the former
benefits of
God.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For the same purpose is the amplification which he makes; for he might have
spoken more simply, &#8220;As he has freely given us all things.&#8221; But by
mentioning &#8220;divine power,&#8221; he rises higher, that is, that God has
copiously unfolded the immense resources of his power. But the latter clause may
be referred to Christ as well as to the Father, but both are suitable. It may
however be more fitly applied to Christ, as though he had said, that the grace
which is conveyed to us by him, is an evidence of divinity, because it could not
have done by humanity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That</i></font><font face="Palatino">
pertain to </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>life and
godliness</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, as to life and godliness. Some
think that the present life is meant here, as godliness follows as the more
excellent gift; as though by those two words Peter intended to prove how
beneficent and bountiful God is towards the faithful, that he brought them to
light, that he supplies them with all things necessary for the preservation of
an earthly life, and that he has also renewed them to a spiritual life by
adorning them with godliness. But this distinction is foreign to the mind of
Peter, for as soon as he mentioned life, he immediately added godliness, which
is as it were its soul; for God then truly gives us life, when he renews us unto
the obedience of righteousness. So Peter does not speak here of the natural
gifts of God, but only mentions those things which he confers peculiarly on his
own elect above the common order of
nature.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc4</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That we are born men, that We are endued with reason.
and knowledge, that our life is supplied with necessary support, -all this is
indeed from God. As however men, being perverted in their minds and ungrateful,
do not regard these various things, which are called the gifts of nature, among
God's benefits, the common condition of human life is not here referred to, but
the peculiar endowments of the new and Spiritual life, which derive their origin
from the kingdom of Christ. But since everything necessary for godliness and
salvation is to be deemed among the supernatural gifts of God, let men learn to
arrogate nothing to themselves, but humbly ask of God whatever they see they are
wanting in, and to ascribe to him whatever good they may have. For Peter here,
by attributing the whole of godliness, and all helps to salvation, to the divine
power of Christ, takes them away from the common nature of men, so that he
leaves to us not even the least particle of any virtue or
merit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Through the knowledge of
him</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now describes the manner in which God
makes us partakers of so great blessings, even by making himself known to us by
the gospel. For the knowledge of God is the beginning of life and the first
entrance into godliness. In short, spiritual gifts cannot be given for
salvation, until, being illuminated by the doctrine of the gospel, we are led to
know God. But he makes God the author of this knowledge, because we never go to
him except when called. Hence the effectual cause of faith is not the
perspicacity of our mind, but the calling of God. And he speaks not of the
outward calling only, which is in itself ineffectual; but of the inward calling,
effected by the hidden power of the Spirit when God not only sounds in our ears
by the voice of man, but draws inwardly our hearts to himself by his own
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To glory and
virtue,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or, by his own glory and power. Some
copies have </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ijdi&gt;a
do&gt;xh|</font><font face="Palatino">, &#8220;by his own glory," and it is so
rendered by the old interpreter; and this reading I prefer, because the sentence
seems thus to flow better For it was Peter's object expressly to ascribe the
whole praise of our salvation to God, so that we may know that we owe every
thing to him. And this is more clearly expressed by these words, &#8212; that he
has called us </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>by his own glory
and power</i></font><font face="Palatino">. However, the other reading, though
more obscure, tends to the same thing; for he teaches us, that we are covered
with shame, and are wholly vicious, until God clothes us with glory and adorns
us with virtue. He further intimates, that the effect of calling in the elect,
is to restore to them the glorious image of God, and to renew them in holiness
and righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Whereby are given to
us.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It is doubtful whether he refers only to
glory and power, or to the preceding things also. The whole difficulty arises
from this, &#8212; that what is here said is not suitable to the glory and
virtue which God confers on us; but if we read, &#8220;by his own glory and
power,&#8221; there will be no ambiguity nor perplexity. For what things have
been promised to us by God, ought to be properly and justly deemed to be the
effects of his power and
glory.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc5</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time the copies vary here also; for some
have </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">di j
o{n</font><font face="Palatino">, &#8220;on account of whom;&#8221; so the
reference may be to Christ. Whichsoever of the two readings you choose, still
the meaning will be, that first the promises of God ought to be most highly
valued; and, secondly, that they are gratuitous, because they are offered to us
as gifts. And he then shews the excellency of the promises, that they make us
partakers of the divine nature, than which nothing can be conceived
better.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For we must consider from whence it is that God
raises us up to such a height of honor. We know how abject is the condition of
our nature; that God, then, should make himself ours, so that all his things
should in a manner become our things, the greatness of his grace cannot be
sufficiently conceived by our minds. Therefore this consideration alone ought to
be abundantly sufficient to make us to renounce the world and to carry us aloft
to heaven. Let us then mark, that the end of the gospel is, to render us
eventually conformable to God, and, if we may so speak, to deify
us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>nature</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">is not here essence but quality. The Manicheans
formerly dreamt that we are a part of God, and that ,after having run the race
of life we shall at length revert to our original. There are also at this day
fanatics who imagine that we thus pass over into the nature of God, so that his
swallows up our nature. Thus they explain what Paul says, that God will be all
in all
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;461528&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
Corinthians 15:28,) and in the same sense they take this passage. But such a
delirium as this never entered the minds of the holy Apostles; they only
intended to say that when divested of all the vices of the flesh, we shall be
partakers of divine and blessed immortality and glory, so as to be as it were
one with God as far as our capacities will allow.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This doctrine was not altogether unknown to Plato,
who everywhere defines the chief good of man to be an entire conformity to God;
but as he was involved in the mists of errors, he afterwards glided off' to his
own inventions. But we, disregarding empty speculations, ought to be satisfied
with this one thing,--that the image of God in holiness and righteousness is
restored to us for this end, that we may at length be partakers of eternal life
and glory as far as it will be necessary for our complete
felicity.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Having
escaped</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>.</i> We have already explained that
the design of the Apostle was, to set before us the dignity of the glory of
heaven, to which God invites us, and thus to draw us away from the vanity of
this world. Moreover, he sets the corruption of the world in opposition to the
divine nature; but he shews that this corruption is not in the elements which
surround us, but in our heart, because there vicious and depraved affections
prevail, the fountain and root of which he points out by the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lust.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
Corruption, then, is thus placed in the world, that we may know that the world
is in us.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And besides this.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">As it is a work arduous and of immense labor,
to put off the corruption which is in us, he bids us to strive and make every
effort for this purpose. He intimates that no place is to be given in this case
to sloth, and that we ought to obey God calling us, not slowly or carelessly,
but that there is need of alacrity; as though he had said, &#8220;Put forth
every effort, and make your exertions manifest to all.&#8221; &#8212; For this
is what the participle he uses imports.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Add to your faith
virtue,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or, Supply to your faith virtue. He
shews for what purpose the faithful were to strive, that is, that they might
have faith adorned with good morals, wisdom, patience, and love. Then he
intimates that faith ought not to be naked or empty, but that these are its
inseparable companions. To supply to faith, is to add to faith. There is not
here, however, properly a gradation as to the sense, though it appears as to the
words; for love does not in order follow patience, nor does it proceed from it.
Therefore the passage is to be thus simply explained, &#8220;Strive that virtue,
prudence, temperance, and the things which follow, may be added to your
faith.&#8221;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc6</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">I take
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>virtue</i></font><font face="Palatino">
to mean a life honest and rightly formed; for it is not here
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejne&gt;rgeia</font><font face="Palatino">,
energy or courage, but
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajreth&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">,
virtue, moral goodness. Knowledge is what is necessary for acting prudently; for

</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">filadelfi&gt;a</font><font face="Palatino">,
is mutual affection among the children of God. Love extends wider, because it
embraces all mankind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may, however, be here asked, Whether Peter, by
assigning to us the work of supplying or adding virtue, thus far extolled the
strength and power of free-will? They who seek to establish free-will in man,
indeed concede to God the first place, that is, that he begins to act or work in
us; but they imagine that we at the same time co-operate, and that it is thus
owing to us that the movements of God are not rendered void and inefficacious.
But the perpetual doctrine of Scripture is opposed to this delirious notion: for
it plainly testifies, that right feelings are formed in us by God, and are
rendered by him effectual. It testifies also that all our progress and
perseverance are from God. Besides, it expressly declares that wisdom, love,
patience, are the gifts of God and the Spirit. When, therefore, the Apostle
requires these things, he by no means asserts that they are in our power, but
only shews what we ought to have, and what ought to be done. And as to the
godly, when conscious of their own infirmity, they find themselves deficient in
their duty, nothing remains for them but to flee to God for aid and
help.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc7</font></sup><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For if these things be in

that Christ is really known by you, if ye be endued with virtue, temperance, and
the other endowments. For the knowledge of Christ is an efficacious thing and a
living root, which brings forth fruit. For by saying that these things would
make them </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>neither barren nor
unfruitful, </i></font><font face="Palatino">he shews that all those glory, in
vain and falsely, that they have the knowledge of Christ, who boast of it
without love, patience, and the like gifts, as Paul also says in

so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in
Jesus, that ye put off the old man,&#8221; etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For he means that those who possess Christ without
newness of life, have never been rightly taught his doctrine.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he would not have the faithful to be only taught
patience, godliness, temperance, love; but he requires a continual progress to
be made as to these endowments, and that justly, for we are as yet far off from
the goal. We ought, therefore, always to make advances, so that God&#8217;s
gifts may continually increase in us.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But he that lacketh these
things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now expresses more clearly that they
who profess a naked faith are wholly without any true knowledge. He then says
that they go astray like the blind in darkness, because they do not see the
right way which is shewn to us by the light of the gospel.<sup>
</sup></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc8</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This he also confirms by adding this reason, because such have forgotten that
through the benefit of Christ they had been cleansed from sin, and yet this is
the beginning of our Christianity. It then follows, that those who do not strive
for a pure and holy life, do not understand even the first rudiments of
faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Peter takes this for granted, that they who were
still rolling in the filth of the flesh had forgotten their own purgation. For
the blood of Christ has not become a washing bath to us, that it may be fouled
by our filth. He, therefore, calls them old sins, by which he means, that our
life ought to be otherwise formed, because we have been cleansed from our sins;
not that any one can be pure from every sin while he lives in this world, or
that the cleansing we obtain through Christ consists of pardon only, but that we
ought to differ from the unbelieving, as God has separated us for himself.
Though, then, we daily sin, and God daily forgives us, and the blood of Christ
cleanses us from our sins, yet sin ought not to rule in us, but the
sanctification of the Spirit ought to prevail in us; for so Paul teaches us in

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore the rather, brethren,
give diligence.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He draws this conclusion, that
it is one proof that we have been really elected, and not in vain called by the
Lord, if a good conscience and integrity of life correspond with our profession
of faith. And he infers, that there ought to be more labor and diligence,
because he had said before, that faith ought not to be barren.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some copies have, &#8220;by good works;&#8221; but
these words make no change in the sense, for they are to be understood though
not expressed.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc9</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He mentions
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>calling</i></font><font face="Palatino">
first, though the last in order. The reason is, because election is of greater
weight or importance; and it is a right arrangement of a sentence to subjoin
what preponderates. The meaning then is, labor that you may have it really
proved that you have not been called nor elected in vain. At the same time he
speaks here of calling as the effect and evidence of election. If any one
prefers to regard the two words as meaning the same thing, I do not object; for
the Scripture sometimes merges the difference which exists between two terms. I
have, however, stated what seems to me more probable.<sup>
</sup></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc10</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now a question arises, Whether the stability of our
calling and election depends on good works, for if it be so, it follows that it
depends on us. But the whole Scripture teaches us, first, that God's election is
founded on his eternal purpose; and secondly, that calling begins and is
completed through his gratuitous goodness. The Sophists, in order to transfer
what is peculiar to God's grace, to ourselves usually pervert this evidence. But
their evasions may be easily refuted. For if any one thinks that calling is
rendered sure by men, there is nothing absurd in that; we may however, go still
farther, that every one confirms his calling by leading a holy and pious life.
But it is very foolish to infer from this what the Sophists contend for; for
this is a proof not taken from the cause, but on the contrary from the sign or
the effect. Moreover, this does not prevent election from being gratuitous, nor
does it shew that it is in our own hand or power to confirm election. For the
matter stands thus, &#8212; God effectually calls whom he has preordained to
life in his secret counsel before the foundation of the world; and he also
carries on the perpetual course of calling through grace alone. But as he has
chosen us, and calls us for this end, that we may be pure and spotless in his
presence; purity of life is not improperly called the evidence and proof of
election, by which the faithful may not only testify to others that they are the
children of God, but also confirm themselves in this confidence, in such n
manner, however that they fix their solid foundation on something
else.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, this certainty, mentioned by Peter,
ought, I think, to be referred to the conscience, as though the faithful
acknowledged themselves before God to be chosen and called. But I take it simply
of the fact itself, that calling appears as confirmed by this very holiness of
life. It may, indeed, be rendered, Labor that your calling may become certain;
for the verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">poiei~sqai</font><font face="Palatino">
is transitive or intransitive. Still, however you may render it, the meaning is
nearly the same.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The import of what is said is, that the children of
God are distinguished from the reprobate by this mark, that they live a godly
and a holy life, because this is the design and end of election. Hence it is
evident how wickedly some vile unprincipled men prattle, when they seek to make
gratuitous election an excuse for all licentiousness; as though, forsooth! we
may sin with impunity, because we have been predestinated to righteousness and
holiness!</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For if ye do these
things.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Peter seems again to ascribe to the
merits of works, that God furthers our salvation, and also that we continually
persevere in his grace. But the explanation is obvious; for his purpose was only
to shew that hypocrites have in them nothing real or solid, and that, on the
contrary, they who prove their calling sure by good works, are free from the
danger of falling, because sure and sufficient is the grace of God by which they
are supported. Thus the certainty of our salvation by no means depends on us, as
doubtless the cause of it is beyond our limits. But with regard to those who
feel in themselves the efficacious working of the Spirit, Peter bids them to
take courage as to the future, because the Lord has laid in them the solid
foundation of a true and sure calling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He explains the way or means of persevering, when he
says, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>an entrance shall be
ministered to you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The import of the words is
this: &#8220;God, by ever supplying you abundantly with new graces, will lead
you to his own kingdom.&#8221; And this was added, that we may know, that though
we have already passed from death into life, yet it is a passage of hope; and as
to the fruition of life, there remains for us yet a long journey. In the
meantime we are not destitute of necessary helps. Hence Peter obviates a doubt
by these words, &#8220;The Lord will abundantly supply your need, until you
shall enter into his eternal kingdom.&#8221; He calls it the kingdom of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Christ,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
because we cannot ascend to heaven except under his banner and
guidance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>12.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Wherefore I will not be
negligent</i></font><font face="Palatino">. As we seem to distrust either the
memory or the attention of those whom we often remind of the same thing, the
Apostle makes this modest excuse, that he ceased not to press on the attention
of the faithful what was well known and fixed in their minds, because its
importance and greatness required this.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;Ye do, indeed,&#8221; he says, &#8220;fully
understand what the truth of the gospel is, nor have I to confirm as it were the
wavering, but in a matter so great, admonitions are never superfluous; and,
therefore, they ought never to be deemed vexatious.&#8221; Paul also employs a
similar excuse in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;451514&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
15:14,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;I am persuaded of you,
brethren,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that ye are full of knowledge, so as to be able
to admonish one another: but I have more confidently written to you, as putting
you in mind.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls that <i>the present truth</i>, into the
possession of which they had already entered by a sure faith. He, then, commends
their faith, in order that they might remain fixed in it more
firmly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yea, I think it
meet,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or right. He expresses more clearly how
useful and how necessary is admonition, because it is needful to arouse the
faithful, for otherwise torpor will creep in from the flesh. Though, then, they
might not have wanted teaching, yet he says that the goads of admonitions were
useful, lest security and indulgence (as it is usually the case) should weaken
what they had learned, and at length extinguish it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He adds another cause why he was so intent on writing
to them, because he knew that a short time remained for him. &#8220;I must
diligently employ my time,&#8221; he says; &#8220;for the Lord has made known to
me that my life in this world will not be long.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn, that admonitions ought to be so
given, that the people whom we wish to benefit may not think that wrong is done
to them, and also that offenses ought to be so avoided, that yet the truth may
have a free course, and exhortations may not be discontinued. Now, this
moderation is to be observed towards those to whom a sharp reproof would not be
suitable, but who ought on the contrary to be kindly helped, since they are
inclined of themselves to do their duty. We are also taught by the example of
Peter, that the shorter term of life remains to us, the more diligent ought we
to be in executing our office. It is not commonly given to us to foresee our
end; but they who are advanced in years, or weakened by illness, being reminded
by such indications of the shortness of their life, ought to be more sedulous
and diligent, so that they may in due time perform what the Lord has given them
to do; nay, those who are the strongest and in the flower of their age, as they
do not render to God so constant a service as it behooves them to do, ought to
quicken themselves to the same care and diligence by the recollection of
approaching death; lest the occasion of doing good may pass away, while they
attend negligently and slothfully to their work.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">At the same time, I doubt not but that it was
Peter&#8217;s object to gain more authority and weight to his teaching, when he
said that he would endeavor to make them to remember these things after his
death, which was then nigh at hand. For when any one, shortly before he quits
this life, addresses us, his words have in a manner the force and power of a
testament or will, and are usually received by us with greater
reverence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>14.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I must put off this my
tabernacle.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Literally the words are,
&#8220;Short is the putting; away of this tabernacle.&#8221; By this mode of
speaking, and afterwards by the word &#8220;departing,&#8221; he designates
death, which it behooves us to notice; for we are here taught how much death
differs from perdition. Besides, too much dread of death terrifies us, because
we do not sufficiently consider how fading and evanescent this life is, and do
not reflect on the perpetuity of future life. But what does Peter say? He
declares that death is departing from this world, that we may remove elsewhere,
even to the Lord. It ought not, then, to be dreadful to us, as though we were to
perish when we die. He declares that it is the putting away of a tabernacle, by
which we are covered only for a short time. There is, then, no reason why we
should regret to be removed from it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is to be understood an implied contrast
between a fading tabernacle and a perpetual habitation, which Paul explains in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470501&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2
Corinthians 5:1.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc11</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says that it had been revealed to him by
Christ, he refers not to the kind of death, but to the time. But if he received
the oracle at Babylon respecting his death being near, how was he crucified at
Rome? It certainly appears that he died very far from Italy, except he flew in a
moment over seas and lands.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc12</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But the Papists, in order to claim for themselves the body of Peter, make
themselves Babylonians, and say that Rome is called Babylon by Peter: this shall
be refuted in its proper place. What he says of remembering these things after
his death, was intended to shew, that posterity ought to learn from him when
dead. For the apostles had not regard only for their own age, but purposed to do
us good also. Though, then, they are dead, their doctrine lives and prevails:
and it is our duty to profit by their writings, as though they were manifestly
present with. us.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>16.
</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For we have not followed
cunningly-devised fables.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> It gives us much
courage, when we know that we labor in a matter that is certain. Lest, then, the
faithful should think that in these labors they were beating the air, he now
comes to set forth the certainty of the gospel; and he denies that anything had
been delivered by him but what was altogether true and indubitable: and they
were encouraged to persevere, when they were sure of the prosperous issue of
their calling.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the first place, Peter indeed asserts that he had
been an eye-witness; for he had himself seen with his own eyes the glory of
Christ, of which he speaks. This knowledge he sets in opposition to crafty
fables, such as cunning men are wont to fabricate to ensnare simple minds. The
old interpreter renders the word &#8220;feigned,&#8221; (fictas;) Erasmus,
&#8220;formed by art.&#8221; It seems to me that what is subtle to deceive is
meant: for the Greek word here used,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sofi?&gt;zesqai</font><font face="Palatino">,
sometimes means this. And we know how much labor men bestow on frivolous
refinements, and only that they may have some amusement. Therefore no less
seriously ought our minds to be applied to know the truth which is not
fallacious, and the doctrine which is not nugatory, and which discovers to us
the glory of the Son of God and our own salvation.<sup>
</sup></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc13</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The power and the coming.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">No doubt he meant in these words to include the
substance of the gospel, as it certainly contains nothing except Christ, in whom
are hid all the treasures of wisdom. But he distinctly mentions two things,
&#8212; that Christ had been manifested in the flesh, &#8212; and also that
power was exhibited by him.<sup>
</sup></font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc14</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus, then, we have the whole gospel; for we know that he, the long-promised
Redeemer, came from heaven, put on our flesh, lived in the world, died and rose
again; and, in the second place, we perceive the end and fruit of all these
things, that is, that he might be God with us, that he might exhibit in himself
a sure pledge of our adoption, that he might cleanse us from the
defilement&#8217;s of the flesh by the grace of his Spirit, and consecrate us
temples to God, that he might deliver us from hell, and raise us up to heaven,
that he might by the sacrifice of his death make an atonement for the sins of
the world, that he might reconcile us to the Father, that he might become to us
the author of righteousness and of life. He who knows and understands these
things, is fully acquainted with the gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Were
eye-witnesses,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or beholders.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc15</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
We hence conclude, that they by no means serve Christ, nor are like the
apostles, who presumptuously mount the pulpit to prattle of speculations unknown
to themselves; for he alone is the lawful minister of Christ, who knows the
truth of the doctrine which he delivers: not that all obtain certainty in the
same way; for what Peter says is that he himself was present, when Christ was
declared by a voice from heaven to be the Son of God. Three only were then
present, but they were sufficient as witnesses; for they had through many
miracles seen the glory of Christ, and had a remarkable evidence of his divinity
in his resurrection. But we now obtain certainty in another way; for though
Christ has not risen before our eyes, yet we know by whom his resurrection has
been handed down to us. And added to this is the inward testimony of conscience,
the sealing of the Spirit, which far exceeds all the evidence of the senses. But
let us remember that the gospel was not at the beginning made up of vague
rumors, but that the apostles were the authentic preachers of what they had
seen.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For he received from God the
Father.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He chose one memorable example out of
many, even that of Christ, when, adorned with celestial glory, he conspicuously
displayed his divine majesty to his three disciples. And though Peter does not
relate all the circumstances, yet he sufficiently designates them when he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>that a voice came from the
magnificent glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> For the meaning is, that
nothing earthly was seen there, but that a celestial majesty shone on every
side. We may hence conclude what those displays of greatness were which the
evangelists relate. And it was necessarily thus done, in order that the
authority of that voice which came might be more awful and solemn, as we see
that it was done all at once by the Lord. For when he spoke to the fathers, he
did not only cause his words to sound in the air, but by adding some symbols or
tokens of his presence, he proved the oracles to be his.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>This is my beloved
Son.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Peter then mentions this voice, as though
it was sufficient alone as s full evidence for the gospel, and justly so. For
when Christ is acknowledged by us to be him whom the Father has sent, this is
our highest wisdom. There are two parts to this sentence. When he says,
&#8220;This is,&#8221; the expression is very emphatical, intimating, that he
was the Messiah who had been so often promised. Whatever, then, is found in the
Law and the Prophets respecting the Messiah, is declared here, by the Father, to
belong to him whom he so highly commended. In the other part of the sentence, he
announces Christ as his own Son, in whom his whole love dwells and centres. It
hence follows that we are not otherwise loved than in him, nor ought the love of
God to be sought anywhere else. It is sufficient for me now only to touch on
these things by the way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the holy
mount.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He calls it the holy mount, for the same
reason that the ground was called holy where God appeared to Moses. For wherever
the Lord comes, as he is the fountain of all holiness, he makes holy all things
by the odor of his presence. And by this mode of speaking we are taught, not
only to receive God reverently wherever he shews himself, but also to prepare
ourselves for holiness, as soon as he comes nigh us, as it was commanded the
people when the law was proclaimed on Mount Sinai. And it is a general
truth,</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>We have also.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">He now shews that the truth of the gospel is
founded on the oracles of the prophets, lest they who embraced it should
hesitate to devote themselves wholly to Christ: for they who waver cannot be
otherwise than remiss in their minds. But when he says, &#8220;We have,&#8221;
he refers to himself and other teachers, as well as to their disciples. The
apostles had the prophets as the patrons of their doctrine; the faithful also
sought from them a confirmation of the gospel. I am the more disposed to take
this view, because he speaks of the whole Church, and makes himself one among
others. At the same time, he refers more especially to the Jews, who were well
acquainted with the doctrine of the prophets. And hence, as I think, he calls
their word </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>more
sure</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or firmer.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For they who take the comparative for a positive,
that is, &#8220;more sure,&#8221; for &#8220;sure,&#8221; do not sufficiently
consider the whole context. The sense also is a forced one, when it is said to
be &#8220;more sure,&#8221; because God really completed what he had promised
concerning his Son. For the truth of the gospel is here simply proved by a
twofold testimony, &#8212; that Christ had been highly approved by the solemn
declaration of God, and, then, that all the prophecies of the prophets confirmed
the same thing. But it appears at first sight strange, that the word of the
prophets should be said to be more sure or firmer than the voice which came from
the holy mouth of God himself; for, first, the authority of God's word is the
same from the beginning; and, secondly, it was more confirmed than previously by
the coming of Christ. But the solution of this knot is not difficult: for here
the Apostle had a regard to his own nation, who were acquainted with the
prophets, ,and their doctrine was received without any dispute. As, then, it was
not doubted by the Jews but that all the things which the prophets had taught,
came from the Lord, it is no wonder that Peter said that their word was more
sure. Antiquity also gains some reverence. There are, besides, some other
circumstances which ought to be noticed; particularly, that no suspicion could
be entertained as to those prophecies in which the kingdom of Christ had so long
before been predicted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The question, then, is not here, whether the prophets
deserve more credit than the gospel; but Peter regarded only this, to shew how
much deference the Jews paid to those who counted the prophets as God's faithful
ministers, and had been brought up from childhood in their school.

well.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This passage is, indeed, attended with
some more difficulty; for it may be asked, what is the day which Peter mentions?
To some it seems to be the clear knowledge of Christ, when men fully acquiesce
in the gospel; and the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>darkness</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">they explain as existing, when they, as yet,
hesitate in suspense, and the doctrine of the gospel is not received as
indubitable; as though Peter praised those Jews who were searching for Christ in
the Law and the Prophets, and were advancing, as by this preceding light towards
Christ, the Sun of righteousness, as they were praised by Luke, who, having
heard Paul preaching, searched the Scripture to know whether what he said was
true.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
17:11)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But in this view there is, first, an inconsistency,
because it thus seems that the use of the prophecies is confined to a short
time, as though they would be superfluous when the gospel-light is seen. Were
one to object and say, that this does not necessarily follow, because
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>until</i></font><font face="Palatino">
does not always denote the end. To this I say, that in commands it cannot be
otherwise taken: &#8220;Walk until you finish your course;&#8221; &#8220;Fight
until you conquer.&#8221; In such expressions we doubtless see that a certain
time is specified.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc17</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But were I to concede this point, that the reading of the prophets is not thus
wholly cast aside; yet every one must see how frigid is this commendation, that
the prophets are useful until Christ is revealed to us; for their teaching is
necessary to us until the end of life. Secondly, we must bear in mind who they
were whom Peter addressed; for he was not instructing the ignorant and novices,
who were as yet in the first rudiments; but even those respecting whom he had
before testified, that they had obtained the same precious faith, and were
confirmed in the present truth. Surely the gross darkness of ignorance could not
have been ascribed to such people. I know what some allege, that all had not
made the same progress, and that here beginners who were as yet seeking Christ,
are admonished.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as it is evident from the context, that the words
were addressed to the same persons, the passage must necessarily be applied to
the faithful who had already known Christ, and had become partakers of the true
light. I therefore extend this darkness, mentioned by Peter, to the whole course
of life, and </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the
day,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> I consider will then
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>shine</i></font><font face="Palatino">
on us when we shall see face to face, what we now see through a glass darkly.
Christ, the Sun of righteousness, indeed, shines forth in the gospel; but the
darkness of death will always, in part, possess our minds, until we shall be
brought out of the prison of the flesh, and be translated into heaven. This,
then, will be the brightness of day, when no clouds or mists of ignorance shall
intercept the bright shining of the Sun.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And doubtless we are so far from a perfect day, as
our faith is from perfection. It is, therefore, no wonder that the state of the
present life is called darkness, since we are far distant from that knowledge to
which the gospel invites us.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc18</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In short, Peter reminds us that as long as we sojourn
in this world, we have need of the doctrine of the prophets as a guiding; light;
which being extinguished, we can do nothing else but wander in darkness; for he
does not disjoin the prophecies from the gospel, when he teaches us that they
shine to shew us the way. His object only was to teach us that the whole course
of our life ought to be guided by God's word; for otherwise we must be involved
on every side in the darkness of ignorance; and the Lord does not shine on us,
except when we take his word as our light.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he does not use the comparison,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>light,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or lamp, to intimate that the light is small and sparing, but to make these two
things to correspond,--that we are without light, and can no more keep on the
right way than those who go astray in a dark night; and that the Lord brings a
remedy for this evil, when he lights a torch to guide us in the midst of
darkness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What he immediately adds
respecting</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> the day
star</i></font><font face="Palatino"> does not however seem altogether suitable
to this explanation; for the real knowledge, to which we are advancing through
life, cannot be called the beginning of the day. To this I reply, that different
parts of the day are compared together, but the whole day in all its parts is
set in opposition to that darkness, which would wholly overspread all our
faculties, were not the Lord to come to our help by the light of his
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a remarkable passage: we learn from it how
God guides us. The Papists have ever and anon in their mouth, that the Church
cannot err. Though the word is neglected, they yet imagine that it is guided by
the Spirit. But Peter, on the contrary, intimates that all are immersed in
darkness who do not attend to the light of the word. Therefore, except thou art
resolved wilfully to cast thyself into a labyrinth, especially beware of
departing even in the least thing from the rule and direction of the word. Nay,
the Church cannot follow God as its guide, except it observes what the word
prescribes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In this passage Peter also condemns all the wisdom of
men, in order that we may learn humbly to seek, otherwise than by our own
understanding, the true way of knowledge; for without the word nothing is left
for men but darkness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It further deserves to be noticed, that he pronounces
on the clearness of Scripture; for what is said would Be a false eulogy, were
not the Scripture fit and suitable to shew to us with certainty the right way.
Whosoever, then, will open his eyes through the obedience of faith, shall by
experience know that the Scripture has not been in vain called a light. It is,
indeed, obscure to the unbelieving; but they who are given up to destruction are
wilfully blind. Execrable, therefore, is the blasphemy of the Papists, who
pretend that the light of Scripture does nothing but dazzle the eyes, in order
to keep the simple from reading it. But it is no wonder that proud men, inflated
with the wind of false confidence, do not see that light with which the Lord
favors only little children and the humble. With a similar eulogy David commends
the law of God in Psalms 19 and 119.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Knowing this
first.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Here Peter begins to shew how our minds
are to be prepared, if we really wish to make progress in scriptural knowledge.
There may at the same time be two interpretations given, if you read
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejphlu&gt;sewv</font><font face="Palatino">
as some do, which means occurrence, impulse; or, as I have rendered it,
interpretation,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejpilu&gt;sewv</font><font face="Palatino">
But almost all give this meaning, that we ought not to rush on headlong and
rashly when we read Scripture, confiding in our own understanding. They think
that a confirmation of this follows, because the Spirit, who spoke by the
prophets, is the only true interpreter of himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This explanation contains a true, godly, and useful
doctrine, that then only are the prophecies read profitably, when we renounce
the mind and feelings of the flesh, and submit to the teaching of the Spirit,
but that it is an impious profanation of it; when we arrogantly rely on our own
acumen, deeming that sufficient to enable us to understand it, though the
mysteries contain things hidden to our flesh, and sublime treasures of life far
surpassing our capacities. And this is what we have said, that the light which
shines in it, comes to the humble alone.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But the Papists are doubly foolish, when they
conclude from this passage, that no interpretation of a private man ought to be
deemed authoritative. For they pervert what Peter says, that they may claim for
their own councils the chief right of interpreting Scripture; but in this they
act indeed childishly; for Peter calls interpretation
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>private,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
not that of every individual, in order to prohibit each one to interpret; but he
shews that whatever men bring of their own is profane. Were, then, the whole
world unanimous, and were the minds of all men united together, still what would
proceed from them, would be private or their own; for the word is here set in
opposition to divine revelation; so that the faithful, inwardly illuminated by
the Holy Spirit, acknowledge nothing but what God says in his
word.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">However, another sense seems to me more simple, that
Peter says that Scripture came not from man, or through the suggestions of man.
For thou wilt never come well prepared to read it, except thou bringest
reverence, obedience, and docility; but a just reverence then only exists when
we are convinced that God speaks to us, and not mortal men. Then Peter
especially bids us to believe the prophecies as the indubitable oracles of God,
because they have not emanated from men's own private suggestions.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc19</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">To the same purpose is what immediately follows,
&#8212; </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>but holy men of God
spake</i></font><font face="Palatino"> as they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>moved by the Holy
Ghost.</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i> </i>They did not of themselves, or
according to their own will, foolishly deliver their own inventions. The meaning
is, that the beginning of right knowledge is to give that credit to the holy
prophets which is due to God. He calls them the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>holy men of
God,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> because they faithfully executed the
office committed to them, having sustained the person of God in their
ministrations. He says that they were &#8212; not that they were bereaved of
mind, (as the Gentiles imagined their prophets to have been,) but because they
dared not to announce anything of their own, and obediently followed the Spirit
as their guide, who ruled in their mouth as in his own sanctuary. Understand by
<i>prophecy of Scripture</i> that which is contained in the holy
Scriptures.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But there
were.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As weak consciences are usually very
grievously and dangerously shaken, when false teachers arise, who either corrupt
or mutilate the doctrine of faith, it was necessary for the Apostle, while
seeking to encourage the faithful to persevere, to remove out of the way an
offense of this kind. He, moreover, comforted those to whom he was writing, and
confirmed them by this argument, that God has always tried and proved his Church
by such a temptation as this, in order that novelty might not disturb their
hearts. &#8220;Not different,&#8221; he says, &#8220;will be the condition of
the Church under the gospel, from what it was formerly under the law; false
prophets disturbed the ancient Church; the same thing must also be expected by
us.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It was necessary expressly to shew this, because many
imagined that the Church would enjoy tranquillity under the rein of Christ; for
as the prophets had promised that at his coming there would be real peace, the
highest degree of heavenly wisdom, and the full restoration of all things, they
thought that the Church would be no more exposed to any contests. Let us then
remember that the Spirit of God hath once for all declared, that the Church
shall never be free from this intestine evil; and let this likeness be always
borne in mind, that the trial of our faith is to be similar to that of the
fathers, and for the same reason &#8212; that in this way it may be made
evident, whether we really love God, as we find it written in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;051303&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Deuteronomy
13:3.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it is not necessary here to refer to every
example of this kind; it is enough, in short, to know that, like the fathers, we
must contend against false doctrines, that our faith ought by no means to be
shaken on account of discords and sects, because the truth of God shall remain
unshaken notwithstanding the violent agitations by which Satan strives often to
upset all things.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Observe also, that no one time in particular is
mentioned by Peter, when he says
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>there shall be false
teachers</i></font><font face="Palatino">, but that all ages are included; for
he makes here a comparison between Christians and the ancient people. We ought,
then, to apply this truth to our own time, lest, when we see false teachers
rising up to oppose the truth of God, this trial should break us down. But the
Spirit reminds us, in order that we may take the more heed; and to the same
purpose is the whole description which follows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He does not, indeed, paint each sect in its own
colors, but particularly refers to profane men who manifested contempt towards
God. The ,advice, indeed, is general, that we ought to beware of false teachers;
but, at the same time, he selected one kind of such from whom the greater danger
arose. What is said here will hereafter become more evident from the words of
Jude, who treats exactly of the same subject.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Who privily shall bring
in.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words he points out the craftiness
of Satan, and of all the ungodly who militate under his banner, that they would
creep in by oblique turnings, as through burrows under ground.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc19a</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The more watchful, then, ought the godly to be, so that they may escape their
hidden frauds: for however they may insinuate themselves, they cannot circumvent
those who are carefully vigilant.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls them
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>opinions of
perdition,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or destructive opinions, that every
one, solicitous for his salvation, might dread such opinions as the most noxious
pests. As to the word<i> opinions </i>or heresies, it has not, without reason,
been always deemed infamous and hateful by the children of God; for the bond of
holy unity is the simple truth. As soon as we depart from that, nothing remains
but dreadful discord.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even denying the Lord that bought
them. </i></font><font face="Palatino">Though Christ may be denied in various
ways, yet Peter, as I think, refers here to what is expressed by Jude, that is,
when the grace of God is turned into lasciviousness; for Christ redeemed us,
that he might have a people separated from all the pollutions of the world, and
devoted to holiness ,and innocency. They, then, who throw off the bridle, and
give themselves up to all kinds of licentiousness, are not unjustly said to deny
Christ by whom they have been redeemed. Hence, that the doctrine of the gospel
may remain whole and complete among us, let this be fixed in our minds, that we
have been redeemed by Christ, that he may be the Lord of our life and of our
death, and that our main object ought to be, to live to him and to die to him.
He then says, that their </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>swift
destruction</i></font><font face="Palatino"> was at hand, lest others should be
ensnared by them.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc20</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And many shall
follow</i></font><font face="Palatino">. It is, indeed, no slight offense to the
weak, when they see that false doctrines are received by the common consent of
the world, that a large number of men are led astray, so that few continue in
true obedience to Christ. So, at this day, there is nothing that more violently
disturbs pious minds than such a defection. For hardly one in ten of those who
have once made a profession of Christ, retains the purity of faith to the end.
Almost all turn aside into corruptions, and being deluded by the teachers of
licentiousness, they become profane. Lest this should make our faith to falter,
Peter comes to our help, and in due time foretells that this very thing would
be, that is, that false teachers would draw many to perdition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is a double reading even in the Greek
copies; for some read, &#8220;lasciviousness,&#8221; and others,
&#8220;perdition.&#8221; I have, however, followed what has been mostly
approved.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc21</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By reason of whom the way of
truth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This I consider to have been said for
this reason, because as religion is adorned when men are taught to fear God, to
maintain uprightness of life, a chaste and virtuous conduct, or when at least
the mouth of the wicked is closed, that they do not speak evil of the gospel; so
when the reins are let loose, and every kind of licentiousness is practiced, the
name and the doctrine of Christ are exposed to the reproaches of the ungodly.
Others give a different explanation &#8212; that these false teachers, like
filthy dogs, barked at sound doctrine. But the words of Peter appear to me on
the contrary to intimate, that these would give occasion to enemies insolently
to assail the truth of God. Though then they would not themselves assail the
Christian faith with calumnies, yet they would arm others with the means of
reproaching it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>3.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>With feigned
words.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Peter endeavors by all means to render
the faithful displeased with ungodly teachers, that they might resist them more
resolutely and more constantly. It is especially an odious thing that we should
be exposed to sale like vile slaves. But he testifies that this is done, when
any one seduces us from the redemption of Christ. He calls those
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>feigned
words</i></font><font face="Palatino"> which arc artfully formed for the purpose
of deceiving.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc22</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Unless then one is so mad as to sell the salvation of his soul to false
teachers, let him close up every avenue that may lead to their wicked
inventions. For the same purpose as before he repeats again, that their
destruction delayed not, that is, that he might frighten the good from their
society. For since they were given up to a sudden destruction, every one who
connected himself with them, must have perished with them.</font><br></div>

For if.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> We have stated how much it behoves us
to know that the ungodly, who by their mischievous opinions corrupt the Church,
cannot escape God&#8217;s vengeance; and this he proves especially by three
remarkable examples of God's judgment, &#8212; that he spared not even angels,
that he once destroyed the whole world by a deluge, that he reduced Sodom to
ashes, and other neighboring cities. But Peter thought it sufficient to take as
granted what ought to be never doubted by us, that is, that God is the judge of
the whole world. It hence follows that the punishment he formerly inflicted on
the ungodly and wicked, he will now also inflict on the like characters. For he
can never be unlike himself, nor does he shew respect of persons, so as to
forgive the same wickedness in one which he has punished in another; but he
hates injustice and wrong equally, whenever it is found.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc23</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For we must always bear in mind that there is a
difference between God and men; for men indeed judge unequally, but God keeps
the same course in judging. For that he forgives sins, this is done because he
blots them out through repentance and faith. He therefore does not otherwise
reconcile himself to us than by justifying us; for until sin is taken away,
there is always an occasion of discord between us and Him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>angels.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
The argument is from the greater to the less; for they were far more excellent
than we are, and yet their dignity did not preserve them from the hand of God;
much less then can mortal men escape, when they follow them in their impiety.
But as Peter mentions here but briefly the fall of angels, and as he has not
named the time and the manner and other circumstances, it behoves us soberly to
speak on the subject. Most men are curious and make no end of inquiries on these
things; but since God in Scripture has only sparingly touched on them, and as it
were by the way, he thus reminds us that we ought to be satisfied with this
small knowledge. And indeed they who curiously inquire, do not regard
edification, but seek to feed their souls with vain speculations. What is useful
to us, God has made known, that is, that the devils were at first created, that
they might serve and obey God, but that through their own fault they
apostatized, because they would not submit to the authority of God; and that
thus the wickedness found in them was accidental, and not from nature, so that
it could not be ascribed to God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">All this Peter declares very clearly, when he says
that angels fell, though superior to men; and Jude is still more express when he
writes, that they kept not their first estate, or their pre-eminence. Let those
who are not satisfied with these testimonies have recourse to the Sorbonian
theology, which will teach them respecting angels to satiety, so as to
precipitate them to hell together with the devils.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Chains of
darkness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This metaphor intimates that they are
held bound in darkness until the last day. And the comparison is taken from
malefactors, who, after having been condemned, suffer half of their punishment
by the severity of the prison, until they are drawn forth to their final doom.
We may hence learn, not only what punishment the wicked suffer after death, but
also what is the condition of the children of God: for they calmly acquiesce in
the hope of sure and perfect blessedness, though they do not as yet enjoy it; as
the former suffer dreadful agonies on account of the vengeance prepared for
them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>5.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The old
world.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The import of what he says is, that God,
after having drowned the human race, formed again as it were a new world. This
is also an argument from the greater to the less; for how can the wicked escape
the deluge of divine wrath, since the whole world was once destroyed by it? For
by saying that eight only were saved, he intimates that a multitude would not be
a shield against God to protect the wicked; but that as many as sin shall be
punished, be they few or many in number.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked why he calls Noah
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the preacher of
righteousness.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Some understand that he was the
preacher of the righteousness of God, inasmuch as Scripture commends God's
righteousness, because he defends his own and restores them, when dead, to life.
But I rather think that he is called the preacher of righteousness, because he
labored to restore a degenerated world to a sound mind, and this not only by his
teaching and godly exhortations, but also by his anxious toil in building the
ark for the term of a hundred and twenty years. Now, the design of the Apostle
is to set before our eyes God&#8217;s wrath against the wicked, so as to
encourage us at the same time to imitate the
saints.</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc24</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>6.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The cities of
Sodom.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This was so memorable an example of
Divine vengeance, that when the Scripture speaks of the universal destruction of
the ungodly, it alludes commonly to this as the type. Hence Peter says, that
these cities were made an example. This may, indeed, be truly said of others;
but Peter points out something singular, because it was the chief and a lively
image; yea, rather, because the Lord designed that his wrath against the ungodly
should be made known to all ages; as when he redeemed his people from Egypt, he
has set forth to us by that one favor the perpetual safety of his Church. Jude
has also expressed the same thing, calling it the punishment of eternal
fire.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In seeing and
hearing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> The common explanation is, that Lot
was just in his eyes and ears, because all his senses abhorred the crimes of
Sodom. However, another view may be taken of his seeing and hearing, so as to
make this the meaning, that when the just man lived among the Sodomites, he
tormented his soul by seeing and hearing; for we know that he was constrained to
see and hear many things which greatly vexed his mind. The purport of what is
said then is, that though the holy man was surrounded with every kind of
monstrous wickedness, he yet never turned aside from his upright
course.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But Peter expresses more than before, that is, that
just Lot underwent voluntary sorrows; as it is right that all the godly should
feel no small grief when they see the world rushing into every kind of evil, so
the more necessary it is that they should groan for their own sins. And Peter
expressly mentioned this, lest when impiety everywhere prevails, we should be
captivated and inebriated by the allurements of vices, and perish together with
others, but that we might prefer this grief, blessed by the Lord, to all the
pleasures of the world.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The Lord
knoweth.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> What first offends the weak is, that
when the faithful anxiously seek aid, they are not immediately helped by God;
but on the contrary he suffers them sometimes as it were to pine away through
daily weariness and languor; and secondly, when the wicked grow wanton with
impunity and God in the meantime Is silent, as though he connived at their evil
deeds. This double offense Peter now removes; for he testifies that the Lord
knows when it is expedient to deliver the godly from temptation. By these words
he reminds us that this office ought to be left to him, and that therefore we
ought to endure temptations, and not to faint, when at any time he defers his
vengeance against the ungodly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This consolation is very necessary for us, for this
thought is apt to creep in, &#8220;If the Lord would have his own to be safe,
why does he not gather them all into some corner of the earth, that they may
mutually stimulate one another to holiness? why does he mingle them with the
wicked by whom they may be defiled?&#8221; But when God claims to himself the
office of helping, and protecting his own, that they may not fail in the
contest, we gather courage to fight more strenuously. The meaning of the first
clause is, that this law is prescribed by the Lord to all the godly, that they
are to be proved by various temptations, but that they are to entertain good
hope of success, because they are never to be deprived of his aid and
help.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And to reserve the
unjust.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By this clause he shews that God so
regulates his judgments as to bear with the wicked for a time, but not to leave
them unpunished. Thus he corrects too much haste, by which we are wont to be
carried headlong, especially when the atrocity of wickedness grievously wounds
us, for we then wish God to fulminate without delay; when he does not do so, he
seems no longer to be the judge of the world. Lest, then, this temporary
impunity of wickedness should disturb us, Peter reminds us that a day of
judgment has been appointed by the Lord; and that, therefore, the wicked shall
by no means escape punishment, though it be not immediately
inflicted.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is an emphasis in the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>reserve,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
as though he had said, that they shall not escape the hand of God, but be held
bound as it were by hidden chains, that they may at a certain time be drawn
forth to judgment. The participle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kolazome&gt;nouv</font><font face="Palatino">,
though in the present tense, is yet to be thus explained, that they are reserved
or kept to be punished, or, that they may be punished. For he bids us to rely on
the expectation of the last judgment, so that in hope and patience we may fight
till the end of life.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But chiefly
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He comes here to particulars,
accommodating a general doctrine to his own purpose; for he had to do with men
of desperate wickedness. He then shews that dreadful vengeance necessarily
awaited them. For since God will punish all the wicked, how can they escape who
abandon themselves like brute beasts to every kind of iniquity?
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To walk after the
flesh,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is to be given up to the flesh, like
brute animals, who are not led by reason and judgment, but have the natural
desire of their flesh as their chief guide. By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>lust of
uncleanness</i></font><font face="Palatino"> understand filthy and unbridled
gratifications, when men, having cast away every virtuous feeling, and shaken
off shame, are carried away into every uncleanness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is the first mark by which he brands them, that
they are impure men, given up to wickedness. Other marks follow, that they
despised government, and feared not to calumniate and reproach men whom God had
favored with honorable stations in life. But these words refer to the same
thing; for after having said that they held government in contempt, he
immediately points out the fountain of this evil, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>presumptuous,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or audacious, and
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>self-willed,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or refractory;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc25</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
and lastly, that he might more fully exhibit their pride, he says that they did
not fear nor tremble when they treated dignities with contempt. For it is a
monstrous arrogance to regard as nothing the glory which shines forth in
dignities appointed by God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But there is no doubt but that in these words he
refers to the imperial and magisterial power; for though there is no lawful
station in life which is not worthy of respect, yet we know that the magisterial
office excels every other, because in governing mankind God himself is
represented. Then truly glorious is that power in which God himself
appears.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We now perceive what the Apostle meant in this second
clause, even that they of whom he speaks were frantic men, lovers of tumults and
confusion; for no one can introduce anarchy
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajnarci&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">)
into the world without introducing disorder
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajtaxi&gt;an</font><font face="Palatino">.)
Now, these with bold effrontery vomited forth reproaches against magistrates,
that they might take away every respect for public rights; and this was openly
to fight against God by their blasphemies. There are also many turbulent men of
this sort at the present day, who proudly declare that the power of the sword is
heathen and unlawful, and furiously attempt to subvert all government. Such
furies Satan excites, in order to disturb and prevent the progress of the
gospel. But the Lord hath dealt favorably with us; for he hath not only warned
us to beware of this deadly poison, but hath also by this ancient example
fortified us against this scandal. Hence the Papists act very dishonestly, when
they accuse us, and say that seditious men are made so by our doctrine. The same
thing might indeed have been alleged against the apostles formerly; and yet they
were as far as possible from encouraging any such wickedness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>11.</b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>
Whereas angels.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He hence shews their rash
arrogance, because they dared to assume more liberty than even angels. But it
seems strange that he says that angels do not bring a railing accusation against
magistrates; for why should they be adverse to that sacred order, the author of'
which they know to be God? why should they oppose rulers whom they know to be
exercising the same ministry with themselves? This reasoning has made some to
think that the devils arc meant; but they do not thus by any means escape the
difficulty. For how could Satan be so moderate as to spare men, since he is the
author of every blasphemy against God? And further, their opinion is refuted by
what Jude says.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But when we consider the circumstances of the time,
what is said applies very suitably to holy angels. For all the magistrates were
then ungodly, and bloody enemies to the gospel. They must, therefore, have been
hateful to angels, the guardians of the Church. He, however, says, that men
deserving hatred and execration, were not condemned by them in order that they
might shew respect to a power divinely appointed. While such moderation, he
says, is shewn by angels, these men fearlessly give vent to impious and
unbridled blasphemies.</font><br></div>

say respecting impious and wicked corrupters. And, first, he condemns their
loose manners and the obscene wickedness of their whole life; and then he says
that they were audacious and perverse, so that by their scurrilous garrulity
they insinuated themselves into the favor of many.</font><br></div>

extend their thoughts much farther. It is, then, a base thing in man to be
occupied only with present things. Here he reminds us that our minds ought to be
freed from the gratifications of the flesh, except we wish to be reduced to the
state of beasts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning of what follows is this, &#8220;These are
filthy spots to you and your assembly; for while they feast with. you, they at
the same time luxuriate in their errors, and shew by their eyes and gestures
their lascivious lusts and detestable incontinency.&#8221; Erasmus has rendered

this is too forced. It may not unaptly be thus explained, &#8220;Feasting with

the version which seems the most probable, &#8220;luxuriating in their errors,
feasting with you.&#8221; He calls the libidinous such as had eyes full of

the faithful to beware of their hidden and deceitful arts; for he compares their
impostures to hooks which may catch the unwary to their destruction. By adding
unstable souls he shews the reason for caution, that is, when we have not struck
firm roots in faith and in the fear of the Lord: and he intimates at the same
time, that they have no excuse who suffer themselves to be baited or lured by
such flatteries; for this must have been ascribed to their levity. Let there be
then a stability of faith, and we shall be safe from the artifices of the
ungodly.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>An heart they have exercised with
covetous practices,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or, with lusts. Erasmus
renders the last word, &#8220;rapines.&#8221; The word is of a doubtful meaning.
I prefer &#8220;lusts.&#8221; As he had before condemned incontinence in their
eyes, so he now seems to refer to the vices latent in their hearts. It ought
not, however, to be confined to covetousness. By calling them cursed or
execrable children, he may be understood to mean, that they were so either
actively or passively, that is, that they brought a curse with them wherever
they went, or that they deserved a curse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As he has hitherto referred to the injury they did by
the example of a perverse and corrupt life, so he again repeats, that they
spread by their teaching the deadly poison of impiety, in order that they might
destroy the simple. He compares them to Balaam, the son of Bozor, who employed a
venal tongue to curse God&#8217;s people. And to shew that they were not worthy
of a long refutation, he says that Balaam was reproved by an ass, and that thus
his madness was condemned. But by this means also he restrains the faithful from
associating with them. For it was a dreadful judgment of God, that the angel
made himself known to the ass before he did to the prophet, so that the ass,
perceiving God displeased, dared not to advance farther, but went back, when the
prophet, under the blind impulse of his own avarice, pushed forward against the
evident prohibition of the Lord. For what was afterwards answered to him, that
he was to proceed, was an evidence of God's indignation rather than a
permission. In short, as the greatest indignity to him, the mouth of the ass was
opened, that he who had been unwilling to submit to God's authority might have
that as his teacher. And by this miracle the Lord designed to shew how monstrous
a thing it was to change the truth to a lie.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be here asked, by what right Balaam had the
name of a prophet, when it appears that he was addicted to many wicked
superstitions. To this I reply, that the gift of prophecy was so special, that
though he did not worship the true God, and had not true religion, he might yet
have been endued with it. Besides, God has sometimes caused prophecy to exist in
the midst of idolatry, in order that men might have less
excuse.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, if any one considers the chief things which
Peter says, he will see that his warning is equally suitable to the present age;
for it is an evil which prevails everywhere, that men use scurrilous raillery
for the purpose of deriding God and the Savior; nay, they ridicule all religion
under the cloak of wit; and when addicted, like beasts, to their own lusts, they
will mingle with the faithful; they prattle something about the gospel, and yet
they prostitute their tongue to the service of the devil, that they may bring
the whole world, as far as they can, to eternal perdition. They are in this
respect worse than Balaam himself, because they gratuitously pour forth their
maledictions, when he, induced by reward, attempted to curse.</font><br></div>

wells,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or fountains,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>without
water.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews by these two metaphors, that
they had nothing within, though they made a great display. A fountain, by its
appearance, draws men to itself, because it promises them water to drink, and
for other purposes; as soon as clouds appear, they give hope of immediate rain
to irrigate the earth. He then says that they were like fountains, because they
excelled in boasting, and displayed some acuteness in their thoughts and
elegance in their words; but that yet they were dry and barren within: hence the
appearance of a fountain was fallacious.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that they
were</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> clouds
carried</i></font><font face="Palatino"> by the wind, either without rain, or
which burst forth into a calamitous storm. He thereby denotes that they brought
nothing useful, and that often they were very hurtful. He afterwards denounces
on them the dreadful judgment of God, that fear might restrain the faithful. By
naming the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>mist</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>or the blackness </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>of
darkness,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he alludes to the clouds which
obscure the air; as though he had said, that for the momentary darkness which
they now spread, there is prepared for them a much thicker darkness which is to
continue for ever.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For when they speak great
swelling </i>words<i> of vanity.</i></font><font face="Palatino">
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc28</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
He means that they dazzled the eyes of the simple by high-flown stuff of words,
that they might not perceive their deceit, for it was not easy to captivate
their minds with such dotages, except they were first besotted by some artifice.
He then says that they used an inflated kind of words and speech, that they
might fill the unwary with admiration. And then this grandiloquence, which the
ample lungs of the soul send forth, (as Persius says,
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc29</font></sup><font face="Palatino">)
was very suitable to cover their shifts and trumperies. There was formerly a
craft of this kind in Valentinus, and in those like him, as we learn from the
books of Irenaeus. They made words unheard of before, by the empty sound of
which, the unlearned being smitten, they were ensnared by their
reveries.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There are fanatics of a similar kind at this day, who
call themselves by the plausible title of Libertines or free-men. For they talk
most confidently of the Spirit and of spiritual things, as though they roared
out from above the clouds, and fascinate many by their tricks and wiles, so that
you may say that the Apostle has correctly prophesied of them. For they treat
all things jocosely and scoffingly; and though they are great simpletons, yet as
they indulge in all vices, they find favor with their own people by a sort of
drollery. The state of the case is this, that when the difference between good
and evil is removed, everything becomes lawful; and men, loosed from all
subjection to laws, obey their own lusts. This Epistle, therefore, is not a
little suitable to our age.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>They
allure,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or bait,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>through the lusts of the
flesh.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He strikingly compares to hooks the
allurements of the ungodly, when they make anything they please lawful; for as
the lusts of men are headstrong and craving, as soon as liberty is offered, they
lay hold on it with great avidity; but soon afterwards the strangling hook
within is perceived. But we must consider the whole sentence of the
Apostle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that they who had really escaped from the
society of those in error were again deceived by a new kind of error, even when
the reins were let loose to them for the indulgence of every sort of
intemperance. He hereby reminds us how dangerous are the wiles of these men. For
it was already a dreadful thing that blindness and thick darkness possessed
almost all mankind. It was, therefore, in a manner a double prodigy, that men,
freed from the common errors of the world, should, after having received the
light of God, be brought back to a beastly indifference. Let us be reminded of
what we ought especially to beware of, after having been once enlightened, that
is, lest Satan entice us under the pretense of liberty, so as to give ourselves
up to lasciviousness to gratify the lusts of the flesh. But they are safe from
this danger who seriously attend to the study of holiness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>While they promise them
liberty.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He shews their inconsistency, that
they falsely promised liberty, while they themselves served sin, and were in the
worst bondage; for no one can give what he has not. This reason, however, does
not seem to be sufficiently valid, because it sometimes happens that wicked men,
and wholly unacquainted with Christ, preach usefully concerning the benefits and
blessings of Christ. But we must observe, that what is condemned here is vicious
doctrine, connected with impurity of life; for the Apostle's design was to
obviate the deceptive allurements by which they ensnared the foolish. The name
of liberty is sweet, and they abused it for this end, that the hearer, being
loosed from the fear of the divine law, might abandon himself unto unbridled
licentiousness. But the liberty which Christ has procured for us, and which he
offers daily by the gospel, is altogether different, for he has exempted us from
the yoke of the law as far as it subjects us to a curse, that he might also
deliver us from the dominion of sin, as far as it subjects us to its own lusts.
Hence, where lusts reign, and therefore where the flesh rules, there the liberty
of Christ has no place whatever. The Apostle then declares this to all the
godly, that they might not desire any other liberty but that which leads those,
who are set free from sin, to a willing obedience to
righteousness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We hence learn that there have ever been depraved men
who made a false pretense to liberty, and that this has been an old cunning
trick of Satan. We need not wonder that at this day the same filth is stirred up
by fanatical men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The Papists turn and twist this passage against us,
but they thereby betray their ridiculous impudence. For in the first place, men
of the filthiest life, in public-houses and brothels, belch out this charge,
that we are the servants of corruption, in the life of whom they cannot point
out anything reproachful. In the second place, since we teach nothing respecting
Christian liberty but what is derived from Christ and his Apostles, and at the
same time require the mortification of the flesh, and the proper exercises for
subduing it, much more strictly than they do who slander us, they vomit forth
their curses, not so much against us as against the Son of God, whom we have as
our certain teacher and authority.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For of whom a man is
overcome.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This sentence is derived from
military law; but yet it is a common saying among heathen writers, that there is
no harder or a more miserable bondage than when lusts rule and reign. What then
ought to be done by us, on whom the Son of God has bestowed his Spirit, not only
that we may be freed from the dominion of sin, but that we may also become the
conquerors of the flesh and the world?</font><br></div>

sect which led men consecrated to God back again to their old filth and the
corruptions of the world. And he exhibits the heinousness of the evil by a
comparison; for it was no common sin to depart from the holy doctrine of God. It
would have been better for them, he says, not to have known the way of
righteousness; for though there is no excuse for ignorance, yet the servant who
knowingly and wilfully despises the commands of his lord, deserves a twofold
punishment. There was besides ingratitude, because they wilfully extinguished
the light of God, rejected the favor conferred on them, and having shaken off
the yoke, became perversely wanton against God; yea, as far as they could, they
profaned and abrogated the inviolable covenant of God, which had been ratified
by the blood of Christ. The more earnest then ought we to be, to advance humbly
and carefully in the course of our calling. We must now consider each
sentence.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By naming

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>By the knowledge of

testifies that the design of it is, to deliver us from the defilements of the
world, and to lead us far away from them. For the same reason he afterwards
calls it the </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>way of

progress in the gospel who faithfully learns Christ; and he truly knows Christ,
who has been taught by him to put off the old man and to put on the new man, as

reminds us that the doctrine of a holy and virtuous life, though common to all
and indiscriminately belonging to all, is yet peculiarly taught to those whom
God favors with the light of his gospel. But he declares that they who make
themselves slaves again to the pollutions of the world fall away from the
gospel. The faithful also do indeed sin; but as they allow not dominion to sin,
they do not fall away from the grace of God, nor do they renounce the profession
of sound doctrine which they have once embraced. For they are not to be deemed
conquered, while they strenuously resist the flesh and its
lusts.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But it has happened unto
them.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> As the example disturbs many, when men
who had submitted to the obedience of Christ, rush headlong into vices without
fear or shame, the Apostle, in order to remove the offense, says that this
happens through their own fault, and that because they are pigs and dogs. It
hence follows that no part of the sin can be ascribed to the
gospel.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For this purpose he quotes two ancient proverbs, the
first of which is found as the saying of Solomon in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;202611&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
26:11. But what Peter meant is briefly this, that the gospel is a medicine which
purges us by wholesome vomiting, but that there are many dogs who swallow again
what they have vomited to their own ruin; and that the gospel is also a laver
which cleanses all our uncleanness, but that there are many swine who,
immediately after washing, roll themselves again in the mud. At the same time
the godly are reminded to take heed to themselves, except they wish to be deemed
dogs or swine.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b> Lest they should be wearied with the Second
Epistle as though the first was sufficient, he says that it was not written in
vain, because they stood in need of being often stirred up. To make this more
evident, he shews that they could not be beyond danger, except they were well
fortified, because they would have to contend with desperate men, who would not
only corrupt the purity of the faith, by false opinions, but do what they could
to subvert entirely the whole faith.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By saying,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>I stir up your pure
mind,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means the same as though he had said,
&#8220;I wish to awaken you to a sincerity of mind.&#8221; And the words ought
to be thus explained, &#8220;I stir up your mind that it may be pure and
bright.&#8221; For the meaning is, that the minds of the godly become dim, and
as it were contract rust, when admonitions cease. But we also hence learn, that
men even endued with leaning, become, in a manner, drowsy, except they are
stirred up by constant warnings.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc31</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It now appears what is the use of admonitions, and
how necessary they are; for the sloth of the flesh smothers the truth once
received, and renders it inefficient, except the goads of warnings come to its
aid. It is not then enough, that men should be taught to know what they ought to
be, but there is need of godly teachers, to do this second part, deeply to
impress the truth on the memory of their hearers. And as men are, by nature, for
the most part, fond of novelty and thus inclined to be fastidious, it is useful
for us to bear in mind what Peter says, so that we may not only willingly suffer
ourselves to be admonished by others, but that every one may also exercise
himself in calling to mind continually the truth, so that our minds may become
resplendent with the pure and clear knowledge of it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>That ye may be
mindful.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By these words he intimates that we
have enough in the writings of the prophets, and in the gospel, to stir us up,
provided we be as diligent as it behoves us, in meditating on them; and that our
minds sometimes contract a rust, or become bedimmed through darkness, is owing
to our sloth. That God may then continually shine upon us, we must devote
ourselves to that study: let our faith at the same time acquiesce in witnesses
so certain and credible. For when we have the prophets and apostles agreeing
with us, nay, as the ministers of our faith, and God as the author, and angels
as approvers, there is no reason that the ungodly, all united, should move us
from our position. By the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>commandment of the
apostles</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means the whole doctrine in which
they had instructed the faithful.

may be applied to the Apostle, and in this way, &#8220;I labor to stir you up
for this reason, because I know what and how great is your impending danger from
scoffers.&#8221; I however prefer this explanation, that the participle is used
in place of a verb, as though he had said, &#8220;Know ye this
especially.&#8221; For it was necessary that this should have been foretold,
because they might have been shaken, had impious men attacked them suddenly with
scoffs of this kind. He therefore wished them to know this, and to feel assured
on the subject, that they might be prepared to oppose such men.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he calls the attention of the faithful again to
the doctrine which he touched upon in the second chapter. For by
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the last
days</i></font><font face="Palatino"> is commonly meant the kingdom of Christ,
or the days of his kingdom, according to what Paul says, &#8220;Upon whom the

Corinthians 10:11.)
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc33</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The meaning is, that the more God offers himself by the gospel to the world, and
the more he invites men to his kingdom, the more audacious on the other hand
will ungodly men vomit forth the poison of their impiety.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He calls those
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>scoffers,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
according to what is usual in Scripture, who seek to appear witty by shewing
contempt to God, and by a blasphemous presumption. It is, moreover, the very
extremity of evil, when men allow themselves to treat the awful name of God with
scoffs. Thus, the first Psalm speaks of the seat of scoffers. So David, in
Psalms 119:51, complains that he was derided by the proud, because he attended
to God&#8217;s law. So Isaiah, in the 28th chapter, having referred to them,
describes their supine security and insensibility. Let us therefore bear in
mind, that there is nothing to be feared more than a contest with scoffers. On
this subject we said something while explaining the third chapter of the Epistle
to the Galatians. As, however, the holy Scripture has foretold that they would
come, and has also given us a shield by which we may defend ourselves, there is
no excuse why we should not boldly resist them whatever devices they may
employ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Where is the promise.
</i></font><font face="Palatino">It was a dangerous scoff when they insinuated a
doubt as to the last resurrection; for when that is taken away, there is no
gospel any longer, the power of Christ is brought to nothing, the whole of
religion is gone. Then Satan aims directly at the throat of the Church, when he
destroys faith in the coming of Christ. For why did Christ die and rise again,
except that he may some time gather to himself the redeemed from death, and give
them eternal life? All religion is wholly subverted, except faith in the
resurrection remains firm and immovable. Hence, on this point Satan assails us
most fiercely.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But let us notice what the scoff was. They set the
regular course of nature, such as it seems to have been from the beginning, in
opposition to the promise of God, as though these things were contrary, or did
not harmonize together. Though the faith of the fathers, they said, was the
same, yet no change has taken place since their death, and it is known that many
ages have passed sway. Hence they concluded that what was said of the
destruction of the world was a fable; because they conjectured, that as it had
lasted so long, it would be perpetual.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For this they willingly are
ignorant of.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> By one argument only he confutes
the scoff of the ungodly, even by this, that the world once perished by a deluge
of waters, when yet it consisted of waters.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010102&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
1:2.) And as the history of this was well known, he says that they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>willingly,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
or of their own accord, erred. For they who infer the perpetuity of the world
from its present state, designedly close their eyes, so as not to see so clear a
judgment of God. The world no doubt had its origin from waters, for Moses calls
the chaos from which the earth emerged, waters; and further, it was sustained by
waters; it yet pleased the Lord to use waters for the purpose of destroying it.
It hence appears that the power of nature is not sufficient to sustain and
preserve the world, but that on the contrary it contains the very element of its
own ruin, whenever it may please God to destroy it.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">For it ought always to be borne in mind, that the
world stands through no other power than that of God's word, and that therefore
inferior or secondary causes derive from him their power, and produce different
effects as they are directed. Thus through water the world stood, but water
could have done nothing of itself, but on the contrary obeyed God's word as an
inferior agent or element. As soon then as it pleased God to destroy the earth,
the same water obeyed in becoming a ruinous inundation. We now see how
egregiously they err, who stop at naked elements, as though there was perpetuity
in them, and their nature were not changeable according to the bidding of
God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">By these few words the petulance of those is
abundantly refuted, who arm themselves with physical reasons to fight against
God. For the history of the deluge is an abundantly sufficient witness that the
whole order of nature is governed by the sole power of God.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010717&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
7:17.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It seems, however, strange that he says that the
world perished through the deluge, when he had before mentioned the heaven and
the earth. To this I answer, that the heaven was then also submerged, that is,
the region of the air, which stood open between the two waters. For the division
or separation, mentioned by Moses, was then confounded.
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010106&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis
1:6;) and the word <i>heaven</i> is often taken in this sense. if any wishes for
more on this subject, let him read Augustine on the City of God. <i>Lib</i>. 20.

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the heavens and the earth
which are now.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He does not infer this as the
consequence; for his purpose was no other than to dissipate the craftiness of
scoffers respecting the perpetual state of nature, and we see many such at this
day who being slightly embued with the rudiments of philosophy, only hunt after
profane speculations, in order that they may pass themselves off as great
philosophers.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it now appears quite evident from what has been
said, that there is nothing unreasonable in the declaration made by the Lord,
that the heaven and the earth shall hereafter be consumed by fire, because the
reason for the fire is the same as that for the water. For it was a common
saying even among the ancients, that from these two chief elements all things
have proceeded. But as he had to do with the ungodly, he speaks expressly of
their destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>8.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But be not ignorant of this one
thing.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He now turns to speak to the godly; and
he reminds them that when the coming of Christ is the subject, they were to
raise upwards their eyes, for by so doing, they would not limit, by their
unreasonable wishes, the time appointed by the Lord. For waiting seems very long
on this account, because we have our eyes fixed on the shortness of the present
life, and we also increase weariness by computing days, hours, and minutes. But
when the eternity of God's kingdom comes to our minds, many ages vanish away
like so many moments.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This then is what the Apostle calls our attention to,
so that we may know that the day of resurrection does not depend on the present
flow of tine, but on the hidden purpose of God, as though he had said,
&#8220;Men wish to anticipate God for this reason, because they measure time
according to the judgment of their own flesh; and they are by nature inclined to
impatience, so that celerity is even delay to them: do ye then ascend in your
minds to heaven, and thus time will be to you neither long nor
short.&#8221;</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the Lord is not
slack,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or, delays not. He checks extreme and
unreasonable haste by another reason, that is, that the Lord defers his coming
that he might invite all mankind to repentance. For our minds are always
prurient, and a doubt often creeps in, why he does not come sooner. But when we
hear that the Lord, in delaying, shews a concern for our salvation, and that he
defers the time because he has a care for us, there is no reason why we should
any longer complain of tardiness. He is tardy who allows an occasion to pass by
through slothfulness: there is nothing like this in God, who in the best manner
regulates time to promote our salvation. And as to the duration of the whole
world, we must think exactly the same as of the life of every individual; for
God by prolonging time to each, sustains him that he may repent. In the like
manner he does not hasten the end of the world, in order to give to all time to
repent.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This is a very necessary admonition, so that we may
learn to employ time aright, as we shall otherwise suffer a just punishment for
our idleness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Not willing that any should
perish.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> So wonderful is his love towards
mankind, that he would have them all to be saved, and is of his own self
prepared to bestow salvation on the lost. But the order is to be noticed, that
God is ready to receive all to repentance, so that none may perish; for in these
words the way and manner of obtaining salvation is pointed out. Every one of us,
therefore, who is desirous of salvation, must learn to enter in by this
way.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it may be asked, If God wishes none to perish,
why is it that so many do perish? To this my answer is, that no mention is here
made of the hidden purpose of God, according to which the reprobate are doomed
to their own ruin, but only of his will as made known to us in the gospel. For
God there stretches forth his hand without a difference to all, but lays hold
only of those, to lead them to himself, whom he has chosen before the foundation
of the world.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc35</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as the verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">cwrh~sai</font><font face="Palatino">
is often taken passively by the Greeks, no less suitable to this passage is the
verb which I have put in the margin, that God would have all, who had been
before wandering and scattered, to be gathered or come together to
repentance.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But the day of the Lord will
come.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This has been added, that the faithful
might be always watching, and not promise to-morrow to themselves. For we all
labor under two very different evils--too much haste, and slothfulness. We are
seized with impatience for the day of Christ already expected; at the same time
we securely regard it as afar off. As, then, the Apostle has before reproved an
unreasonable ardor, so he now shakes off our sleepiness, so that we may
attentively expect Christ at all times, lest we should become idle and
negligent, as it is usually the case. For whence is it that flesh indulges
itself except that there is no thought of the near coming of
Christ?</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What afterwards follows, respecting the burning of
heaven and earth, requires no long explanation, if indeed we duly consider what
is intended. For it was not his purpose to speak refinedly of fire and storm,
and other things, but only that he might introduce an exhortation, which he
immediately adds, even that we ought to strive after newness of life. For he
thus reasons, that as heaven and earth are to be purged by fire, that they may
correspond with the kingdom of Christ, hence the renovation of men is much more
necessary. Mischievous, then, arc those interpreters who consume much labor on
refined speculations, since the Apostle applies his doctrine to godly
exhortations.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Heaven and earth, he says, shall pass away for our
sakes; is it meet, then, for us to be engrossed with the things of earth, and
not, on the contrary, to attend to a holy and godly life? The corruptions of
heaven and earth will be purged by fire, while yet as the creatures of God they
are pure; what then ought to be done by us who are full of so many pollutions?
As to the word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>godlinesses</i></font><font face="Palatino">

it as meaning the duties of godliness.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc36</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Of the elements of the world I shall only say this one thing, that they are to
be consumed, only that they may be renovated, their substance still remaining
the same, as it may be easily gathered from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450821&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Looking for and hasting
unto,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> or, waiting for by hastening; so I render
the words, though they are two participles; for what we had before separately he
gathers now into one sentence, that is, that we ought hastily to wait. Now this
contrarious hope possesses no small elegance, like the proverb, &#8220;Hasten
slowly,&#8221; (<i>festina lente</i>.) When he says, &#8220;Waiting for,&#8221;
he refers to the endurance of hope; and he sets hastening in opposition to
topor; and both are very apposite. For as quietness and waiting are the
peculiarities of hope, so we must always take heed lest the security of the
flesh should creep in; we ought, therefore, strenuously to labor in good works,
and run quickly in the race of our calling.

restore the kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all.</font><br></div>

effect, or the practice of a godly life; for hope is living and efficacious;
therefore it cannot be but that it will attract us to itself. He, then, who
waits for new heavens, must begin with renewal as to himself, and diligently
aspire after it; but they who cleave to their own filth, think nothing, it is
certain, of God's kingdom, and have no taste for anything but for this corrupt

found blameless by Christ; for by these words he intimates, that while the world

approved by his judgment, and not that which gains the Praise of men.

For as so few turn their attention to the judgment of Christ, hence it is, that
while they are carried headlong by their importunate lusts, they are at the same
time in a state of disquietude. This peace, then, is the quietness of a
peaceable soul, which acquiesces in the word of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may be asked, how any one can be found blameless
by Christ, when we all labor under so many deficiencies. But Peter here only
points out the mark at which the faithful ought all to aim, though they cannot
reach it, until having put off their flesh they become wholly united to
Christ.</font><br></div>

wisely turns to a contrary purpose.</font><br></div>

the Galatians, as well as from other places, that unprincipled men, who went
about everywhere to disturb the churches, in order to discredit Paul, made use
of this pretense, that he did not well agree with the other Apostles. It is then
probable that Peter referred to Paul in order to shew their consent; for it was
very necessary to take away the occasion for such a calumny. And yet, when I
examine all things more narrowly, it seems to me more probable that this Epistle
was composed by another according to what Peter communicated, than that it was
written by himself, for Peter himself would have never spoken thus. But it is
enough for me that we have a witness of his doctrine and of his goodwill, who
brought forward nothing contrary to what he would have himself

The meaning is, that in the things which he wrote there was sometimes an
obscurity, which gave occasion to the unlearned to go astray to their own ruin.
We are reminded by these words, to reason soberly on things so high and obscure;
and further, we are here strengthened against this kind of offense, lest the
foolish or absurd speculations of men should disturb us, by which they entangle
and distort simple truth, which ought to serve for edification.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But we must observe, that we are not forbidden to
read Paul's Epistles, because they contain some things hard and difficult to be
understood, but that, on the contrary, they are commended to us, provided we
bring a calm and teachable mind. For Peter condemns men who are trifling and
volatile, who strangely turn to their own ruin what is useful to all. Nay, he
says that this is commonly done as to all the Scripture: and yet he does not
hence conclude, that we are not to read it, but only shews, that those vices
ought to be corrected which prevent improvement, and not only so, but render
deadly to us what God has appointed for our salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It may, however, be asked, Whence is this obscurity,
for the Scripture shines to us like a lamp, and guides our steps? To this I
reply, that it is nothing to be wondered at, if Peter ascribed obscurity to the
mysteries of Christ's kingdom, and especially if we consider how hidden they are
to the perception of the flesh. However the mode of teaching which God has
adopted, has been so regulated, that all who refuse not to follow the Holy
Spirit as their guide, find in the Scripture a clear light. At the same time,
many are blind who stumble at mid-day; others are proud, who, wandering through
devious paths, and flying over the roughest places, rush headlong into
ruin.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>17.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Ye, therefore,
beloved.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> After having shewn to the faithful the
dangers of which they were to beware, he now concludes by admonishing them to be
wise. But he shews that there was need of being watchful, lest they should be
overwhelmed. And, doubtless, the craft of our enemy, the many and various
treacheries which he employs against us, the cavils of ungodly men, leave no
place for security. Hence, vigilance must be exercised, lest the devices of
Satan and of the wicked should succeed in circumventing us. It, however seems
that we stand on slippery ground, and the certainty of our salvation is
suspended, as it were, on a thread, since he declares to the faithful, that they
ought to take heed lest they should fall from their own
steadfastness.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">What, then, will become of us, if we are exposed to
the danger of falling? To this I answer, that this exhortation, and those like
it, are by no means intended to shake the firmness of that faith which recumbs
on God, but to correct the sloth of our flesh. If any one wishes to see more on
this subject, let him read what has been said on the tenth chapter of the First
Epistle to the Corinthians.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The meaning is this, that as long as we are in the
flesh, our tardiness must be roused, and that this is fitly done by having our
weakness, and the variety of dangers which surround us, placed before our eyes;
but that the confidence which rests on God's promises ought not to be thereby
shaken.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>18.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But grow in
grace.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He also exhorts us to make progress; for
it is the only way of persevering, to make continual advances, and not to stand
still in the middle of our journey; as though he had said, that they only would
be safe who labored to make progress daily.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>grace,</i></font><font face="Palatino">
I take in a general sense, as meaning those spiritual gifts we obtain through
Christ. But as we become partakers of these blessings according to the measure
of our faith, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>knowledge</i>
</font><font face="Palatino">is added to grace; as though he had said, that as
faith increases, so would follow the increase of grace.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fc42</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To him be
glory.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> This is a remarkable passage to prove
the divinity of Christ; for what is said cannot belong to any but to God alone.
The adverb of the present time, now, is designed for this end, that we may not
rob Christ of his glory, during our warfare in the world. He then
adds,</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i> for
ever,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> that we may now form some idea of his
eternal kingdom, which will make known to us his full and perfect
glory.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" size="5" color="Green">THE ARGUMENT</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">THOUGH there was a dispute among the ancients
respecting this Epistle, yet as the reading of it is useful, and as it contains
nothing inconsistent with the purity of apostolic doctrine, and was received as
authentic formerly, by some of the best, I willingly add it to the others. Its
brevity, moreover, does not require a long statement of its contents; and almost
the whole of it is nearly the same with the second chapter of the last
Epistle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As unprincipled men, under the name of Christians,
had crept in, whose chief object was to lead the unstable and weak to a profane
contempt of God, Jude first shews, that the faithful ought not to have been
moved by agents of this kind, by which the Church has always been assailed; and
yet he exhorts them carefully to beware of such pests. And to render them more
hateful and detestable, he denounces on them the approaching vengeance of God,
such as their impiety deserved. Now, if we consider what Satan has attempted in
our age, from the commencement of the revived gospel, and what arts he still
busily employs to subvert the faith, and the fear of God, what was a useful
warning in the time of Jude, is more than necessary in our age. But this will
appear more fully as we proceed in reading the Epistle.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>1.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Jude the servant of Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He calls himself the servant of Christ,
not as the name applies to all the godly, but with respect to his apostleship;
for they were deemed peculiarly the servants of Christ, who had some public
office committed to them. And we know why the apostles were wont to give
themselves this honorable name. Whosoever is not called, arrogates to himself
presumptuously the right and authority of teaching. Then their calling was an
evidence to the apostles, that they did not thrust themselves into their office
through their own will. It was not, however, of itself sufficient to be
appointed to their office, except they faithfully discharged it. And, no doubt,
he who declares himself to be the servant of God, includes both these things,
that is, that God is the bestower of the office which he exercises, and that he
faithfully performs what has been committed to him. Many act falsely, and
falsely boast to be what they are very far from being: we ought always to
examine whether the reality corresponds with the profession.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And brother of
James</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He mentions a name more celebrated than
his own, and more known to the churches. For though faithfulness of doctrine and
authority do not depend on the names of mortal men, yet it is a confirmation to
the faith, when the integrity of the man who undertakes the office of a teacher
is made certain to us. Besides, the authority of James is not here brought
forward as that of a private individual, but because he was counted by all the
Church as one of the chief apostles of Christ. He was the son of Alpheus, as I
have said elsewhere. Nay, this very passage is a sufficient proof to me against
Eusebius and others, who say, that he was a disciple, named Oblias, [James,]
mentioned by Luke, in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;441513&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
15:13;
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;442118&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Acts
21:18, who was more eminent than the apostles in the Church. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fe1</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
But there is no doubt but that Jude mentions here his own brother, because he
was eminent among the apostles. It is, then, probable, that he was the person to
whom the chief honor was conceded by the rest, according to what Luke
relates.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>To them that are sanctified by God
the Father</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, to the called who are
sanctified, etc. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fe2</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
By this expression, &#8220;the called,&#8221; he denotes all the faithful,
because the Lord has separated them for himself. But as calling is nothing else
but the effect of eternal election, it is sometimes taken for it. In this place
it makes but little difference in which way you take it; for he, no doubt,
commends the grace of God, by which he has been pleased to choose them as his
peculiar treasure. And he intimates that men do not anticipate God, and that
they never come to him until he draws them.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Of the same he says that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>sanctified in God the
Father</i></font><font face="Palatino">, which may be rendered, &#8220;by God
the Father.&#8221; I have, however, retained the very form of the expression,
that readers may exercise their own judgment. For it may be, that this is the
sense, &#8212; that being profane in themselves, they had their holiness in God.
But the way in which God sanctifies is, by regenerating us by his
Spirit.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Another reading, which the Vulgate has followed, is
somewhat harsh, &#8220;To the beloved
(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">hjgaphme&gt;noiv</font><font face="Palatino">)
in God the Father.&#8221; I therefore regard it as corrupt; and it is, indeed,
found but in a few copies.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He further adds, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>preserved in Jesus
Christ</i></font><font face="Palatino">. For we should be always in danger of
death through Satan, and he might take us at any moment as an easy prey, were we
not safe under the protection of Christ, whom the Father has given to be our
guardian, so that none of those whom he has received under his care and shelter
should perish.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Jude then mentions here a threefold blessing, or
favor of God, with regard to all the godly, &#8212; that he has made them by his
calling partakers of the gospel; that he has regenerated them, by his Spirit,
unto newness of life; and that he has preserved them by the hand of Christ, so
that they might not fall away from salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>2.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Mercy to
you.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> Mercy means nearly the same as grace in
the salutations of Paul. Were any one to wish for a refined distinction, it may
be said that grace is properly the effect of mercy; for there is no other reason
why God has embraced us in love, but that he pitied our miseries. <i>Love
</i>may be understood as that of God towards men, as well as that of men towards
one another. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fe3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
If it be referred to God, the meaning is, that it might increase towards them,
and that the assurance of divine love might be daily more confirmed in their
hearts. The other meaning is, however, not unsuitable, that God would kindle and
confirm in them mutual love.</font><br></div>

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>When I gave
diligence</i></font><font face="Palatino">. I have rendered the words
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">spoudh&lt;n
poiou&gt;menov</font><font face="Palatino">, &#8220;Applying care:&#8221;
literally they are, &#8220;Making diligence.&#8221; But many interpreters
explain the sentence in this sense, that a strong desire constrained Jude to
write, as we usually say of those under the influence of some strong feeling,
that they cannot govern or restrain themselves. Then, according to these
expounders, Jude was under a sort of necessity, because a desire to write
suffered him not to rest. But I rather think that the two clauses are separate,
that though he was inclined and solicitous to write, yet a necessity compelled
him. He then intimates, that he was indeed glad and anxious to write to them,
but yet necessity urged him to do so, even because they were assailed (according
to what follows) by the ungodly, and stood in need of being prepared to fight
with them. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fe4</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then, in the first place, Jude testifies that he felt
so much concern for their salvation, that he wished himself, and was indeed
anxious to write to them; and, secondly, in order to rouse their attention, he
says that the state of things required him to do so. For necessity adds strong
stimulants. Had they not been forewarned how necessary his exhortation was, they
might have been slothful and negligent; but when he makes this preface, that he
wrote on account of the necessity of their case, it was the same as though he
had blown a trumpet to awake them from their torpor.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Of the common
salvation</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Some copies add &#8220;your,&#8221;
but without reason, as I think; for he makes salvation common to them and to
himself. And it adds not a little weight to the doctrine that is announced, when
any one speaks according to his own feelings and experience; for vain is what we
say, if we speak of salvation to others, when we ourselves have no real
knowledge of it. Then, Jude professed himself to be (so to speak) an
experimental teacher, when he associated himself with the godly in the
participation of the same salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And exhort
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Literally, &#8220;exhorting you;&#8221;
but as he points out the end of his counsel, the sentence ought to be thus
expressed. What I have rendered, &#8220;to help the faith by contending,&#8221;
means the same as to strive in retaining the faith, and courageously to sustain
the contrary assaults of Satan. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fe5</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
For he reminds them that in order to persevere in the faith, various contests
must be encountered and continual warfare maintained. He says that faith had
been </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>once
delivered</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that they might know that they had
obtained it for this end, that they might never fail or fall
away.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>4.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>For there are certain men crept
in unawares</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Though Satan is ever an enemy to
the godly, and never ceases to harass them, yet Jude reminds those to whom he
was writing of the state of things at that time. Satan now, he says, attacks and
harasses you in a peculiar manner; it is therefore necessary to take up arms to
resist him. We hence learn that a good and faithful pastor ought wisely to
consider what the present state of the Church requires, so as to accommodate his
doctrine to its wants.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">pareise&gt;dusan</font><font face="Palatino">,
which he uses, denotes an indirect and stealthy insinuation, by which the
ministers of Satan deceive the unwary; for Satan sows his tares in the night,
and while husbandmen are asleep, in order that he may corrupt the seed of God.
And at the same time he teaches us that it is an intestine evil; for Satan in
this respect also is crafty, as he raises up those who are of the flock to do
mischief, in order that they may more easily creep in.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Before of old
ordained</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He calls that judgment, or
condemnation, or a reprobate mind, by which they were led astray to pervert the
doctrine of godliness; for no one can do such a thing except to his own ruin.
But the metaphor is taken from this circumstance, because the eternal counsel of
God, by which the faithful are ordained unto salvation, is called a book: and
when the faithful heard that these were given up to eternal death, it behooved
them to take heed lest they should involve themselves in the same destruction.
It was at the same time the object of Jude to obviate danger, lest the novelty
of the thing should disturb and distress any of them; for if these were already
long ago ordained, it follows that the Church is not tried or exercised but
according to the infallible counsel of God. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fe6</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The grace of our
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He now expresses more clearly what the
evil was; for he says that they abused the grace of God, so as to lead
themselves and others to take an impure and profane liberty in sinning. But the
grace of God has appeared for a far different purpose, even that, denying
ungodliness and worldly lusts, we may live soberly, righteously, and godly in
this world. Let us, then, know that nothing is more pestilential than men of
this kind, who from the grace of Christ take a cloak to indulge in
lasciviousness. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fe7</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Because we teach that salvation is obtained through
God&#8217;s mercy alone, the Papists accuse us of this crime. But why should we
use words to refute their effrontery, since we everywhere urge repentance, the
fear of God, and newness of life, and since they themselves not only corrupt the
whole world with the worst examples, but also by their ungodly teaching take
away from the world true holiness and the pure worship of God? though I rather
think, that those of whom Jude speaks, were like the libertines of our time, as
it will be more evident from what follows.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>The only Lord
God</i></font><font face="Palatino">, or, God who alone is Lord. Some old copies
have, &#8220; Christ, who alone is God and Lord.&#8221; And, indeed, in the
Second Epistle of Peter, Christ alone is mentioned, and there he is called Lord.
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fe8</font></sup><font face="Palatino">

Devil, and thus render void as far as they can that incomparable price. That

died and rose again for us, that he might have dominion over our life and
death.</font><br></div>

excuses himself, lest he should seem to teach as it were the ignorant things
unknown to them; or, indeed, he openly declares in an emphatical manner, (which
I approve more of,) that he adduced nothing new or unheard of before, in order
that what he was going to say might gain more credit and authority. I only
recall, he says, to your mind what you have already learnt. As he ascribes
knowledge to them, so he says that they stood in need of warnings, lest they
should think that the labor he undertook towards them was superfluous; for the
use of God&#8217;s word is not only to teach what we could not have otherwise
known, but also to rouse us to a serious meditation of those things which we
already understand, and not to suffer us to grow torpid in a cold
knowledge.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now, the meaning is, that after having; been called
by God, we ought not to glory carelessly in his grace, but on the contrary, to
walk watchfully in his fear; for if any trifles thus with God, the contempt of
his grace will not be unpunished. And this he proves by three examples. He first
refers to the vengeance which God executed on those unbelievers, whom he had
chosen as his people, and delivered by his power. Nearly the same reference is
made by Paul in the tenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians. The
import of what he says is, that those whom God had honored with the greatest
blessings, whom he had extolled to the same degree of honor as we enjoy at this
day, he afterwards severely punished. Then in vain were all they Proud of

the less; for the state of angels is higher than ours; and yet God punished
their defection in a dreadful manner. He will not then forgive our perfidy, if
we depart from the grace unto which he has called us. This punishment, inflicted
on the inhabitants of heaven, and on such superior ministers of God, ought
surely to be constantly before our eyes, so that we may at no time be led to
despise God&#8217;s grace, and thus rush headlong into
destruction.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajrch&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">
in this place, may be aptly taken for beginning as well as for principality or
dominion. For Jude intimates that they suffered punishment, because they had
despised the goodness of God and deserted their first vocation. And there
follows immediately an explanation, for he says that they had<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>left their own
habitation</i></font><font face="Palatino">; for, like military deserters, they
left the station in which they had been placed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We must also notice the atrocity of the punishment
which the Apostle mentions. They are not only free spirits but celestial powers;
they are now held bound by perpetual chains. They not only enjoyed the glorious
light of God, but his brightness shone forth in them, so that from them, as by
rays, it spread over all parts of the universe; now they are sunk in darkness.
But we are not to imagine a certain place in which the devils are shut up, for
the Apostle simply intended to teach us how miserable their condition is, since
the time they apostatized and lost their dignity. For wherever they go, they
drag with them their own chains, and remain involved in darkness. Their extreme
punishment is in the meantime, deferred until the great day
comes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>7.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Even as Sodom and
Gomorrha</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This example is more general, for he
testifies that God, excepting none of mankind, punishes without any difference
all the ungodly. And Jude also mentions in what follows, that the fire through
which the five cities perished was a type of the eternal fire. Then God at that
time exhibited a remarkable example, in order to keep men in fear till the end
of the world. Hence it is that it is so often mentioned in Scripture; nay,
whenever the prophets wished to designate some memorable and dreadful judgment
of God, they painted it under the figure of sulfurous fire, and alluded to the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha. It is not, therefore, without reason that
Jude strikes all ages with terror, by exhibiting the same view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When he says,
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the cities about them in like
manner, giving themselves over to
fornication</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i> </i>I do not apply these words
to the Israelites and the angels, but to Sodom and Gomorrha. It is no objection
that the pronoun
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">tou&gt;toiv</font><font face="Palatino">
is masculine; for Jude refers to the inhabitants and not to the places. To
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>go after strange
flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">, is the same as to be given up<i> </i>to
monstrous lusts; for we know that the Sodomites, not content with the common
manner of committing fornication, polluted themselves in a way the most filthy
and detestable. We ought to observe, that he devotes them to eternal fire; for
we hence learn, that the dreadful spectacle which Moses describes, was only an
image of a much heavier punishment.</font><br></div>

strictly, as though he compared these whom he mentions in all things to be
Sodomites, or to the fallen angels, or to the unbelieving people. He only shews
that they were vessels of wrath appointed to destruction, and that they could
not escape the hand of God, but that he would some time or another make them
examples of his vengeance. For his design was to terrify the godly to whom he
was writing, lest they should entangle themselves in their
society.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But he begins here more clearly to describe these
impostors. And he says first, that they polluted their flesh as it were by
dreaming, by which words he denotes their stupid effrontery, as though he had
said that they abandoned themselves to all kinds of filth, which the most wicked
abhor, except sleep took away shame and also consciousness. It is then a
metaphorical mode of speaking, by which he intimates that they were so dull and
stupid as to give up themselves without any shame to every kind of baseness. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fe9</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">There is a contrast to be noticed, when he says that
they
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>defiled</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>

flesh</i></font><font face="Palatino">, that is, that they degraded what was
less excellent, and that yet they despised as disgraceful what is deemed
especially excellent among mankind.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It appears from the second clause that they were
seditious men, who sought anarchy, that, being loosed from the fear of the laws,
they might sin more freely. But these two things are nearly always connected,
that they who abandon themselves to iniquity, do also wish to abolish all order.
Though, indeed, their chief object is to be free from every yoke, it yet appears
from the words of Jude that they were wont to speak insolently and reproachfully
of magistrates, like the fanatics of the present day, who not only grumble
because they are restrained by the authority of magistrates, but furiously
declaim against all government, and say that the power of the sword is profane
and opposed to godliness; in short, they superciliously reject from the Church
of God all kings and all magistrates.

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>9.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Yet Michael the
archangel</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Peter gives this argument shorter,
and states generally, that angels, far more excellent than men, dare not bring
forward a railing judgment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But as this history is thought to have been taken
from an apocryphal book, it has hence happened that less weight has been
attached to this Epistle. But since the Jews at that time had many things from
the traditions of the fathers, I see nothing unreasonable in saying that Jude
referred to what had already been handed down for many ages. I know indeed that
many puerilities had obtained the name of tradition, as at this day the Papists
relate as traditions many of the silly dotages of the monks; but this is no
reason why they should not have had <i>some</i> historical facts not committed
to writing.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is beyond controversy that Moses was buried by the
Lord, that is, that his grave was concealed according to the known purpose of
God. And the reason for concealing his grave is evident to all, that is, that
the Jews might not bring forth his body to promote superstition. What wonder
then is it, when the body of the prophet was hidden by God, Satan should attempt
to make it known; and that angels, who are ever ready to serve God, should on
the other hand resist him? And doubtless we see that Satan almost in all ages
has been endeavoring to make the bodies of God&#8217;s saints idols to foolish
men. Therefore this Epistle ought not to be suspected on account of this
testimony, though it is not found in Scripture.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">That Michael is introduced alone as disputing against
Satan is not new. We know that myriads of angels are ever ready to render
service to God; but he chooses this or that to do his business as he pleases.
What Jude relates as having been said by Michael, is found also in the book of
Zechariah,</font><br></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">&#8220;Let God chide (or
check) thee, Satan.&#8221;

3:2.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">And it is a comparison, as they say, between the
greater and the less. Michael dared not to speak more severely against Satan
(though a reprobate and condemned) than to deliver him to God to be restrained;
but those men hesitated not to load with extreme reproaches the powers which God
had adorned with peculiar honors.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>10.</b>

therefore did not perceive what was worthy of honor; and that yet they added
audacity to madness, so that they feared not to condemn things above their
comprehension; and that they also labored under another evil &#8212; for when
like beasts they were carried away to those things which gratified the senses of
the body, they observed no moderation, but gorged themselves excessively like
the swine which roll themselves in stinking mud. The adverb
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>naturally</i></font><font face="Palatino">

them so severely, when he had just said that it was not permitted to an angel to
bring a railing accusation against Satan. But it was not his purpose to lay down
a general rule. He only shewed briefly, by the example of Michael, how
intolerable was their madness when they insolently reproached what God honored.
It was certainly lawful for Michael to fulminate against Satan his final curse;
and we see how vehemently the prophets threatened the ungodly; but when Michael
forbore extreme severity (otherwise lawful), what madness was it to observe no
moderation towards those excelling in glory? But when he pronounced woe on them,
he did not so much imprecate evil on them, but rather reminded them what sort of
end awaited them; and he did so, lest they should carry others with them to
perdition.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He says that they were the imitators of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Cain</i></font><font face="Palatino">,

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Balaam</i></font><font face="Palatino">
by a reward, because they adulterated the doctrine of true religion for the sake
of filthy lucre. But the metaphor he uses, expresses something more; for he says
that they <i>overflowed</i>, even because their excess was like overflowing
water. He says in the third place, that they imitated the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>contradiction of
Core</i></font><font face="Palatino">, because they disturbed the order and
quietness of tile church.</font><br></div>

For he calls those feasts
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>charities</i></font><font face="Palatino">,<i>
</i>(</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajga&gt;paiv</font><font face="Palatino">,)
which the faithful had among themselves for the sake of testifying their
brotherly unity. Such feasts, he says, were disgraced by impure men, who
afterwards fed themselves to an excess; for in these there was the greatest
frugality and moderation. It was then not right that these gorgers should be
admitted, who afterwards indulged themselves to an excess
elsewhere.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some copies have, &#8220;Feasting with you,&#8221;
which reading, if approved, has this meaning, that they were not only a
disgrace, but that they were also troublesome and expensive, as they crammed
themselves without fear, at the public expense of the church. Peter speaks
somewhat different, who says that they took delight in errors, and feasted
together with the faithful, as though he had said that they acted
inconsiderately who cherished such noxious serpents, and that they were very
foolish who encouraged their excessive luxury. And at this day I wish there were
more judgment in some good men, who, by seeking to be extremely kind to wicked
men, bring great damage to the whole church.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Clouds</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>they are </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>without

here given in one, but to the same purpose, for both condemn vain ostentation:
these unprincipled men, though promising much, were yet barren within and empty,
like clouds driven by stormy winds, which give hope of rain, but soon vanish
into nothing. Peter adds the similitude of a dry and empty fountain; but Jude
employs other metaphors for the same end, that they were
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>trees
fading</i></font><font face="Palatino">, as the vigor of trees in autumn
disappears. He then calls them trees
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>unfruitful, rooted

</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>twice

appear.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>13.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Raging waves of the
sea</i></font><font face="Palatino">. Why this was added, we may learn more
fully from the words of Peter: it was to shew, that being inflated with pride,
they breathed out, or rather cast out the scum of high-flown stuff of words in
grandiloquent style. At the same time they brought forth nothing spiritual,
their object being on the contrary to make men as stupid as brute animals. Such,
as it has been before stated, are the fanatics of our day, who call themselves
Libertines. You may justly say that they make only rumbling sounds; for,
despising common language, they form for themselves an exotic idiom, I know not
what. They seem at one time to carry their disciples above heaven, then they
suddenly fall down to beastly errors, for they imagine a state of innocency in
which there is no difference between baseness and honesty; they imagine a
spiritual life, when fear is extinguished, and when every one heedlessly
indulges himself; they imagine that we become gods, because God absorbs the
spirits when they quit their bodies. With the more care and reverence ought the
simplicity of Scripture to be studied, lest, by reasoning more refinedly than is
right, we should not draw men to heaven, but on the contrary be involved in
manifold labyrinths. He therefore calls them <i>wandering stars</i>, because
they dazzled the eyes by a sort of evanescent light. </font><br></div>

Were any one to ask, that since similar sentences occur in many parts of
Scripture, why did he not quote a testimony written by one of the prophets? the
answer is obvious, that he wished to repeat from the oldest antiquity what the
Spirit had pronounced respecting them: and this is what the words intimate; for
he says expressly that he was the

disposition, for they were servilely submissive for the sake of gain. And,
commonly, this sort of inconsistency is seen in unprincipled men of this kind.
When there is no one to check their insolence, or when there is nothing that
stands in their way, their pride is intolerable, so that they imperiously
arrogate everything to themselves; but they meanly flatter those whom they fear,
and from whom they expect some advantage. He takes <i>persons</i> as signifying
eternal greatness and power.</font><br></div>

the admonitions of the apostles, the memory of whom was recent. As to the verb
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">mnh&gt;sqhte</font><font face="Palatino">,
it makes no great difference, whether you read it as declarative or as an
exhortation; for the meaning remains the same, that being fortified by the
prediction he quotes, they ought to be terrified. By
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>the last
time</i></font><font face="Palatino"> he means that in which the renewed
condition of the Church received a fixed form till the end of the world; and it
began at the first coming of Christ.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">After the usual manner of Scripture, he calls them
scoffers who, being inebriated with a profane and impious contempt of God, rush
headlong into a brutal contempt of the Divine Being, so that no fear nor
reverence keeps them any longer within the limits of duty: as no dread of a
future judgment exists in their hearts, so no hope of eternal life. So at this
day the world is full of Epicurean despisers of God, who having cast off every
fear, madly scoff at the whole doctrine of true religion, regarding it as
fabulous.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19.</b>

that degenerated nature which we derive from Adam, there is nothing but what is
gross and earthly; so that no part of us aspires to God, until we are renewed by
his Spirit.</font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino"><b>20.<i>
</i></b></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>But ye,
beloved</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He shews the manner in which they
could overcome all the devices of Satan, that is, by having love connected with
faith, and by standing on their guard as it were in their watch-tower, until the
coming of Christ. But as he uses often and thickly his metaphors, so he has here
a way of speaking peculiar to himself, which must be briefly
noticed.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">He bids them first to
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>build</i></font><font face="Palatino">
themselves on
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>faith</i></font><font face="Palatino">;
by which he means, that the foundation of faith ought to be retained, but that
the first instruction is not sufficient, except they who have been already
grounded on true faith, went on continually towards perfection. He calls their
faith </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>most
holy,</i></font><font face="Palatino"> in order that they might wholly rely on
it, and that, leaning on its firmness, they might never
vacillate.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But since the whole perfection of man consists in
faith, it may seem strange that he bids them to build upon it another building,
as though faith were only a commencement to man. This difficulty is removed by
the Apostle in the words which follow, when he adds, that men build on faith
when love is added; Except, perhaps, some one may prefer to take this meaning,
that men build on faith, as far as they make proficiency in it, and doubtless
the daily progress of faith is such, that itself rises up as a building. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fe16</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Thus the Apostle teaches us, that in order to increase in faith, we must be
instant in prayer and maintain our calling by love.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Praying in the Holy
Ghost</i></font><font face="Palatino">. The way of persevering is, when we are
endued with the power of God. Hence whenever the question is respecting the
constancy of faith, we must flee to prayer. And as we commonly pray in a formal
manner, he adds, </font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>In the
Spirit</i></font><font face="Palatino">; as though he had said, that such is our
sloth, and that such is the coldness of our flesh, that no one can pray aright
except he be roused by the Spirit of God; and that we are also so inclined to
diffidence and trembling, that no one dares to call God his Father, except
through the teaching of the same Spirit; for from him is solicitude, from him is
ardor and vehemence, from him is alacrity, from him is confidence in obtaining
what we ask; in short, from him are those unutterable groanings mentioned by
Paul
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;450826&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Romans
8:26.) It is not, then, without reason that Jude teaches us, that no one can
pray as he ought without having the Spirit as his guide.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>21.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Keep yourselves in the love
of God.</i></font><font face="Palatino"> He has made love as it were the
guardian and the ruler of our life; not that he might set it in opposition to
the grace of God, but that it is the right course of our calling, when we make
progress in love. But as many things entice us to apostasy, so that it is
difficult to keep us faithful to God to the end, he calls the attention of the
faithful to the last day. For the hope of that alone ought to sustain us, so
that we may at no time despond; otherwise we must necessarily fail every
moment.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But it ought to be noticed that he would not have us
to hope for eternal life, except through the mercy of Christ: for he will in
such a manner be our judge, as to have no other rule in judging us than that
gratuitous benefit of redemption obtained by himself.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>22.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>And of some have
compassion</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He adds another exhortation,
shewing how the faithful ought to act in reproving their brethren, in order to
restore them to the Lord. He reminds them that such ought to be treated in
different ways, every one according to his disposition: for to the meek and
teachable we ought to use kindness; but others, who are hard and perverse, must
be subdued By terror. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fe17</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This is the
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>difference</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>which he mentions.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The participle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diakrino&gt;menoi</font><font face="Palatino">,
I know not why this is rendered in a passive sense by Erasmus. It may, indeed,
be rendered in either way, but its active meaning is more suitable to the
context. The meaning then is, that if we wish to consult the well-being of such
as go astray, we must consider the character and disposition of every one; so
that they who are meek and tractable may in a kind manner be restored to the
right way, as being objects of pity; but if any be perverse, he is to be
corrected with more severity. And as asperity is almost hateful, he excuses it
on the ground of necessity; for otherwise, they who do not willingly follow good
counsels, cannot he saved.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Moreover, he employs a striking metaphor. When there
is a danger of fire, we hesitate not to snatch away violently whom we desire to
save; for it would not be enough to beckon with the finger, or kindly to stretch
forth the hand. So also the salvation of some ought to be cared for, because
they will not come to God, except when rudely drawn. Very different is the old
translation, which reading is however found in many of the Greek copies; the
Vulgate is, &#8220;Rebuke the judged,&#8221; (<i>Arguite dijudicatos</i>.) But
the first meaning is more suitable, and is, I think, according to the old and
genuine reading. The word to<i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>save</i></font><font face="Palatino">,
is transferred to men, not that they are the authors, but the ministers of
salvation.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>23.</b><i>
</i></font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Hating even the
garment</i></font><font face="Palatino">. This passage, which otherwise would
appear obscure, will have no difficulty in it, when the metaphor is rightly
explained. He would have the faithful not only to beware of contact with vices,
but that no contagion might reach them, he reminds them that everything that
borders on vices and is near to them ought to be avoided: as, when we speak of
lasciviousness, we say that all excitements to lusts ought to be removed. The
passage will also become clearer, when the whole sentence is filled up, that is,
that we should hate not only the flesh, but also the garment, which, by a
contact with it, is infected. The particle
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">kai&lt;</font><font face="Palatino"><i>
</i>even serves to give greater emphasis. He, then, does not allow evil be
cherished by indulgence, so that he bids all preparations and all accessories,
as they say, to be cut off.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>24.</b>
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>Now unto him that is able to keep
you</i></font><font face="Palatino">. He closes the Epistle with praise to God;
by which he shews that our exhortations and labors can do nothing except through
the power of God accompanying them. 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fe18</font></sup><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Some copies have &#8220;them&#8221; instead of
&#8220;you.&#8221; If we receive this reading, the sense will be, &#8220;It is,
indeed, your duty to endeavor to save them; but it is God alone who can do this
&#8220; However, the other reading is what I prefer; in which there is an
allusion to the preceding verse; for after having exhorted the faithful to save
what was perishing, that they might understand that all their efforts would be
vain except God worked with them, he testifies that they could not be otherwise
saved than through the power of God. In the latter clause there is indeed a
different verb,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">fula&gt;xai</font><font face="Palatino">,
which means to guard; so the allusion is to a remoter clause, when he said,

<i>Horne, </i>in his Introduction, vol. 4:p. 425, mentions four opinions on this
subject. According to Bishop Pearson, Mill, and Le Clerc, it was Babylon in
Egypt; according to Erasmus, Drusius, Beza, Dr. Lightfoot, Basnage, Beausobre,
Dr. Cave, Wetstein, Drs. Benson and A. Clarke, it was Babylon in Assyria;
according to Michaelis, it was Babylon in Mesopotamia; and according to Grotius,
Drs. Whitby, Lardner, Macknight, and Hales, Bishop Tomline, and all the learned
of the Romish communion, it is to be taken figuratively for Rome, according to
what was done by John in Revelation 17:and 18:What renders the last opinion very
improbable is, that to date an epistle at a place to which a figurative name is
given, is without another instance in Scripture, and the thing itself seems
quite absurd. The language of prophecy is quite a different matter. Paul wrote
several of his epistles at Rome, and in no instance did he do anything of this
kind. Such an opinion would have never gained ground, had there not been from
early times a foolish attempt to connect Peter with Rome. And it is to be
regretted that some learned Protestants have been duped on this subject by a
mass of fictitious evidence which has been collected by the partisans of the
Romish Church. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

Inquilinis<i>; </i>they are those who dwell in a hired house, tenants. The
original,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">parepidh&gt;moiv</font><font face="Palatino">,
means those who dwell among a people, that is, not their own. Sojourners or
pilgrims would be the best word. The sentence literally is, &#8220;To the
sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus.&#8221; etc. &#8212;

On this question both ancient and modern divines have differed. It is to be
decided by the contents of the Epistle only. There is nothing <i>decisive </i>in
favor of the opinion that it was written only to believing Jews; but there is a
passage, 1 Peter 4:3, which seems clearly to shew that Peter included the
believing Gentiles; for &#8220;the abominable idolatries&#8221; could only refer
to them, as the Jews, since the Babylonian captivity, had never fallen into
idolatry. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">ftb6</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The meaning would be more clear, were we to make a change in the order of the
words, &#8220;Elected, according to the foreknowledge of God, unto obedience and
the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, through <i>(or, </i>by) the
sanctification of the Spirit,&#8221; that is, they were elected in order that
they might obey the gospel, and be cleansed from the guilt of sin by the blood
of Christ, through the sanctifying power of the Spirit. It was not their
obedience that made them the elect, but they were chosen that they might obey,
and thus obey through the influence of the Spirit. This is clearly the doctrine
of this passage. See
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;530213&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">ftb7</font></sup><font face="Palatino">&#8220;This
is a Hebraism,&#8221; says Macknight, &#8220;for <i>a hope of life.
</i>Accordingly, the Syriac version hath here, <i>in spem vitae &#8212; to a
hope of life.&#8221; </i>The begetting again seems not to refer to inward
renovation, but to what God did by raising Christ from the dead. To beget,
sometimes means to put one in a new state or condition; as the expression,
&#8220;This day have I begotten thee,&#8221; means, that God had then
constituted his Son a king, publicly invested him, as it were, with that office.
Similar is the meaning here: God through the resurrection of Christ restored to
the hope of life his desponding followers: hence the import of the word
&#8220;again;&#8221; though <i>Macknight </i>thinks the reference to be to the
covenant of grace made with our first parents after the fall, and that believers
were begotten the second time to the same hope by the resurrection of Christ.
The word for &#8220;begetting again,&#8221; is only found here, and in a passive
sense in the 23d verse, where it has a different meaning, as it evidently refers
to the renovation of the heart. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">ftb8</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
Pareus<i> </i>puts, &#8220;that is, <i>to an inheritance,&#8221; </i>making this
sentence explanatory of &#8220;the hope,&#8221; as hope here is a metonymy for
its object. It is an inheritance &#8220;incorruptible,&#8221; not to be
destroyed by a flood or by fire, &#8212; &#8221;undefiled,&#8221; not like the
land of Canaan, its type, which was defiled by its inhabitants, &#8212; &#8221;
unfading,&#8221; different from any worldly inheritance, for the world passeth

<div><font face="Palatino"> 
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">ftb9</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The meaning would be somewhat different, but the sentence would be more
intelligible, were we to render it thus, &#8220;Who are kept by faith in the
power of God unto salvation.&#8221; Salvation here means that of the body as
well as of the soul at the resurrection. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

exult;&#8221; and some as being an imperative, &#8220;On account of which exult
ye;&#8221; but neither of these comports with the context; for the 8th verse
proves that he speaks of present joy, and that he states the case as it was
among them. It is better with <i>Calvin </i>to refer &#8220;wherein,&#8221; or,
&#8220;on account of which,&#8221; to the fact stated in the previous verse,
that they were kept by God&#8217;s power for salvation ready to be revealed.

The seeming difference in meaning referred to, arises from this, that the
Apostle uses two nouns (a common thing in Scripture) instead of a noun and an
adjective or participle &#8212; &#8221;the trial of your faith,&#8221; instead
of &#8220;your tried faith,&#8221; or, &#8220;your faith when tried.&#8221;

to this view the words may be thus rendered, &#8220;with joy unspeakable and
heavenly.&#8221; <i>Doddridge </i>gives this paraphrase, &#8220;With unutterable

It is necessary either to give a future meaning to this participle, &#8220;Being
about to receive;&#8221; or to view the Apostle as speaking of the salvation of
the soul now, as distinct from the salvation of the soul and body hereafter. The
latter view seems most appropriate to the passage. The soul is now saved by
faith. The end of faith, its object and accomplishment, is reconciliation with
God, and reconciliation is salvation. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

Pareus<i> </i>observes, that the Apostle, in this part of the chapter, exhorted
the faithful to sobriety, holiness, humility, and brotherly love, by five
reasons: 1, because they were the children of God, ver. 14; 2, because God is
holy, and requires holiness, ver. 15; 3, because God is no respecter of persons,

Most commentators, like <i>Calvin, </i>represent the <i>seed </i>as the word;
but the construction does not admit this; the words are, &#8220;Having been
begotten from a seed, not corruptible, but incorruptible, through the living
word of God, and for-ever abiding.&#8221; The &#8220;seed&#8221; denotes
evidently the vital principle of grace, the new nature, the restored image of
God; it is the same with what John means when he says,</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;His seed (that is, of God) remaineth in
him.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;620309&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">1
John 3:9.)</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Then &#8220;the word&#8221; is set forth as the means
or instrument by which this seed is implanted. The &#8220;living&#8221; here
does not mean life-giving, as some interpret it, but stands opposed to what
ceases to be valid: and &#8220;for-ever abiding&#8221; more fully expresses its
meaning. The metaphor in the parable of the sower is quite different: the word
there is compared to a seed sown on bad or good ground; but here the turning of
a bad into a good ground is the subject; and in this process the word is
employed as an instrument. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

undeceitful, or guileless; but when to things, genuine, pure, unadulterated,
unmixed with anything deleterious. We may, therefore, render the words,
&#8220;Desire the pure milk of the word.&#8221; It is a milk not adulterated by
water or by anything poisonous. There is no contrast here between milk and
strong food; but it includes all that is necessary as an aliment for the soul,

birth; it is now spoken of as the food and aliment of the new-born. &#8212;

an adjective for a noun, &#8220;human&#8221; for &#8220;of man;&#8221; and he

In the previous statements of particular duties belonging to various relations
in life, the duty of masters towards their servants is omitted. Some have hence
inferred that there were no masters who were Christians among those to whom
Peter wrote. But this could not have been the ease, and for this reason, because
Paul, in his Epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians, expressly specifies the
duty of masters towards their servants; and Ephesus and Colosse were included in
Asia Minor, and it was to Christians scattered throughout that country that
Peter wrote his Epistle.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">But this omission is somewhat singular. At the same
time, though the master&#8217;s duty is not specifically mentioned, we may yet
consider this verse as having a special reference to masters, as sympathy,
brotherly love, and compassion or commiseration, are here
inculcated.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The construction of the whole passage, beginning at
the 17th verse of the last chapter, and ending at the 12th of this (for at the
13th of this, he resumes the subject he left off at the end of the 16th of the
last) deserves to be noticed. &#8220;Honour all,&#8221; is the injunction which
he afterwards exemplifies as to servants, wives, and husbands; for the
construction is &#8220;Honour all &#8212; the servants being subject, etc.
&#8212; in like manner, the wives being subject, etc. &#8212; in like manner,
the husbands, cohabiting according to knowledge, giving honor, etc.&#8221; Then
follows this verse in the same form, &#8220;And finally, all being of one mind,
sympathizing, loving the brethren, compassionate, friendly-minded (or
humble-minded,) not rendering, etc.&#8221; And thus he proceeds to the end of
the 12th verse. Afterwards he resumes the subject respecting the treatment the
Christians met with from the world.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">May we not then conclude, that as the duty of masters
does not come under the idea of
</font><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon"><i>honoring</i></font><font face="Palatino"><i>,

The most satisfactory explanation of this passage is that of <i>Beza, Doddridge,
Macknight, </i>and <i>Scott; </i>that the reference is to what was done in the
time of Noah, that is, that Christ by his Spirit employed him as a preacher of
righteousness, though with no success, as the spirits of the men to whom he
preached were then in prison, reserved, as the fallen angels are represented to
be, for the judgment of the last day. The Apostle had before said that
Christ&#8217;s Spirit was in the prophets who foretold his coming, 1 Peter 1:11.
The passage may be thus rendered, &#8212; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino"><b>19</b>. &#8220;By which also he, having gone,
preached to the spirits who are in prison, formerly disobedient, when the

<i>Mackight, </i>&#8220;to the spirits <i>now </i>in prison, who formerly were
disobedient,&#8221; etc. The word &#8220;formerly&#8221; seems to require
&#8220;now&#8221; in the previous clause, or, &#8220;who are,&#8221; as rendered

The subject of this passage, from 1 Peter 3:14 to 1 Peter 4:6, is suffering
unjustly, or for righteousness&#8217; sake, and Christ is brought as an example,
he being just, suffered for the unjust. After a digression at the 19th verse of
the third chapter, the Apostle returns here to his former subject, the example
of Christ suffering in the flesh or in his body and in order to retain still the
idea that he was just when he suffered, this clause seems to have been put in
parenthetically, &#8220;For he who suffered ceased from sin,&#8221; that is, had
no sin, but was just. And hence in the following verses he exhorts them to lead
a holy life whatever might be the opposition from the world, so that they might
be like their Savior, suffering unjustly, they themselves being
innocent.</font><br></div>

righteousness&#8217; sake. It is implied that they had been evil-doers, but they
were no longer to be so, otherwise their suffering in the flesh would not be
like that of Christ. To suffer as well-doers, and not as evil-doers, was to
suffer as Christ did. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

might be condemned by carnal men, or in the flesh, as evildoers, but live to God

stated with regard to little children, fathers, and young men, are adduced as

There are <i>two </i>things, the world, and the things that are in the world.

when our Savior says, &#8220;the world,&#8221; that is, the unbelieving Jews,

&#8220;The<i> </i>world (the ungodly men of the world) passeth away, and its
lust, (their lust;) but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.&#8221;
Others think that the blessings of the world are meant, the good things
necessary for the support of man, and that these are not to be <i>loved</i>,<i>
</i>though they may be rightly used. In this case, &#8220;in the world&#8221;
must have a different meaning, a thing not unusual in Scripture; it must mean in
the present state of things. But the most consistent view is the first, that is,
to take &#8220;the world&#8221; throughout as signifying the ungodly men of the
world. What prevail among them are the lusts here mentioned, &#8212; sensual
gratification, avarice, and ambition, the three gods who rule and reign in

verse with the 27th and the 28th verse, we see reason to conclude that the
&#8220;Holy One&#8221; is Christ, who had promised the Spirit to teach his
people. The unction, or the anointing, is the act of the Spirit by which the
truth is taught. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>

It is the character of John&#8217;s style that he often passes as it were
abruptly from the Son to the Father, and from the Father to the Son; and often
the antecedent is not the next preceding word, but one at some distance: we find
this to be the case by what the sentence contains, as in the present instance;
the new birth is never ascribed to the Son, referred to in the foregoing verse,
but to the Father or to the Spirit. Hence we must conclude that the righteous
one spoken of here, who together with the Son is mentioned in the 22d verse, is
the Father. As the intervening verses, with the exception of the 23d, which is
only explanatory of the previous verse, apply to the Son, so this verse seems to
refer to the Father, consistently with a mode of writing common in Scripture.

of the 8th verse, in this chapter, is connected with the 16th; for the
antecedent to<b>

because greater was he that was in them than he that was in the world, that is,
in the unbelieving and ungodly, of whom the false prophets formed a part. Hence

agreeable to the whole tenor of the context, the spirit throughout denoting the
person who claimed, rightly or falsely, to be under the direction of the divine
Spirit. &#8220;By this,&#8221; refers to what had been just stated, that is,
that false teachers were of the world, and spake things agreeable to the
worldly-minded, and were heard by the world, and that the true teachers were
from God, and were heard or attended to by those who knew God, and were not
attended to by such as were ignorant of him. It was by this statement which he
had made, they could distinguish between the teacher of truth and the teacher of
error. The teacher of truth was one from God, and was attended to by those who
knew God, and not by those who knew him not; on the other hand, the teacher of
error was from the world, preached what was agreeable to the men of the world,
and was hearkened to by them. The order, as it is often the case, is inverted;
the teacher of error, mentioned last, is described in the fifth verse, and the
teacher of truth, mentioned first, at the beginning of the sixth. &#8212;

<i>Calvin </i>probably refers to printed copies in his day, and not to Greek
MSS. As far as the authority of MSS. and versions and quotations goes, the
passage is spurious, for it is not found in <i>any </i>of the Greek MSS prior to
the 16th century, nor in <i>any </i>of the <i>early versions</i>,<i> </i>except
the Latin, nor in some of the copies of that version; nor is it quoted by any of
the early <i>Greek </i>fathers, nor by early <i>Latin </i>fathers, except a very
few, and even their quotations have been disputed. These are <i>facts </i>which
no refined conjectures can upset; and it is to be regretted that learned men,
such as the late Bishop <i>Burgess</i>,<i> </i>should have labored and toiled in
an attempt so hopeless as to establish the genuineness of this verse, or rather
of a part of this verse, and of the beginning of the following. The whole
passage is as follows, the spurious part being put within crotchets, &#8212;
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>7</b>. &#8220;For there are three who
bear witness [in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these
three are one:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy"><b>8</b>. And there are three who bear
witness in earth,] the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree
in one.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">As to the construction of the passage, as far as
grammar and sense are concerned, it may do with or without the interpolation
equally the same. What has been said to the contrary on this point, seems to be
nothing of a decisive character, in no way sufficient to shew that the words are
not spurious. Indeed, the passage reads better without the interpolated words;
and as to the sense, that is, the sense in which they are commonly taken by the
advocates of their genuineness, it has no connection whatever with the general
drift of the passage. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fta37</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
If we exclude the words deemed interpolated, we may read the passage thus:
</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;This<i> </i>is he who came with water and
blood, even Jesus Christ; not with water only, but with<i> </i>water and blood:
the Spirit also beareth witness, for (or seeing that) the Spirit is truth (or,
is true); because there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, the water, and
the blood, and these three agree in one.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">We see hence a reason why the Spirit is said to be
true, even because he is not alone, for the water and the blood concur with him.
Thus a testimony is formed consistently with the requirement of the law. We
hence also see the import of what is stated when the testimony of men is
mentioned, as though he had said, The testimony of three men is received as
valid, how much more valid is the testimony of God, which has three witnesses in
its behalf? It is called God&#8217;s testimony, because the witnesses have been
ordered and appointed by him. </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">When it is said that he came with water and blood,
the meaning is, that he came, having water and blood; the proposition
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dia&lt;</font><font face="Palatino">
has sometimes this meaning, and it is changed in the second clause into
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ejn</font><font face="Palatino">.
We meet with similar instances in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;470311&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">2

<div><font face="Palatino">According to this construction, the explanation of
<i>Calvin </i>is alone the right one, that the water means cleansing, and the
blood expiation, the terms being borrowed from the rites of the law; and a
reference is also made to the law when the witness of men is mentioned. &#8212;

&#8220;him that is true,&#8221; to be the Son, while the reference is to God, as
in the previous clause. The true meaning would be thus conveyed,&#8221; And we
are in the true <i>God</i>,<i> being </i>in his Son Jesus Christ;&#8221; for to
be in Christ, is to be in God. Three MSS., the Vulgate, and several of the

especially for those of the latter dispersion. But the benefit of the eastern

and its uncertainty, and not of the fading nature of riches, which would have
been most suitable, had he in view to comfort the rich at the loss of property.

Literally, &#8220;untemptable by evils,&#8221; that is, not capable of being
tempted or seduced by evils, by things wicked and sinful. He is so pure, that he
is not influenced by any evil propensities, that he is not subject to any evil
suggestions. It hence follows that he tempts or seduces no man to what is
sinful. Being himself unassailable by evils, he cannot seduce others to what is
evil. As God cannot be tempted to do what is sinful, he cannot possibly tempt
others to sin. The words may thus be rendered, &#8212; </font><br></div>

The words are very striking, &#8212; &#8221;But every one is tempted (or,

good,) and <i>is</i> caught by a bait (or, ensnared.)&#8221;</font><br></div>

This verse must be taken in connection with what as gone before. When he
mentions &#8220;every good gift,&#8221; it is in opposition to the evil of which
he says God is not the author. See
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;400711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Matthew
7:11. And &#8220;every perfect free-gift,&#8221; as
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">dw&gt;rhma</font><font face="Palatino">
means, has a reference to the correction of the evil which arises from man
himself. And he calls free-gift perfect, because it has no mixture of evil, what
he throughout denies that God is the author of. Then the latter part of the
verse bears a correspondence with the first. He calls God &#8220;the Father of
Lights.&#8221; Light in the language of scripture means especially two things,
the light of truth, divine knowledge and holiness. God is the father, the
parent, the origin , the source of these lights. Hence from him descends every
good, useful, necessary gift, to deliver men from evil, from ignorance and
delusion, and every perfect free-gift to free men from their evil lusts, and to
render them holy and happy. And to shew that God is ever the same, he adds,
&#8220;with whom there is no variableness or the shadow (or shade, of the
slightest appearance) of a change;&#8221; that is, who never varies in his
dealings with men, and shews no symptom of any change, being the author and
giver of all good, and the author of no evil, that is, of no
sin.</font><br></div>

It is commonly admitted to be an interrogatory sentence: &#8220;And do ye not
make a difference among (or, in) yourselves, and become judges, having evil
thoughts?&#8221; literally, &#8220;judges of evil thoughts,&#8221; it being, as
they say, the genitive case of possession. Or the words may be rendered,
&#8220;and become judges of evil (or, false) reasonings?&#8221; or as
<i>Beza</i> renders the sentence, &#8220;and become judges, reasoning
falsely,&#8221; concluding that the rich man was good and the poor man
bad.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It is said by <i>Beza</i> and others,
that</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">diacri&gt;nomai</font><font face="Palatino">never

difference, and also to contend and to doubt. The difference made here was the
respect of persons that was shewn, and they made this difference in themselves,
in their own minds, through the perverse or false thoughts or reasonings which
they entertained. But it appears that these preferences were shewn, not to the
members of the Church, but to such strangers as might happen to come to their
assemblies.</font><br></div>

When he says &#8220;Can faith save him?&#8221; his meaning is &#8220;Can the
faith which he says he has save him?&#8221; that is, faith which is dead and
produces no works; for that is the faith clearly intended here, as it appears
from what follows. To make the meaning more evident, <i>Macknight</i> renders
the sentence thus, &#8212; &#8221;Can this faith save him?&#8221; that is, the
faith that has not works.</font><br></div>

This is adduced as an illustration: as the saying of a man to the naked,

as the true reading, contenanced by most MSS., and found in the <i>Syr.</i> and
<i>Vulg.</i></font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">This verse is a key to the meaning of James: faith is
to be <i>proved</i> by works; then faith properly justifies and saves, and works
prove its genuineness. When he says that a man is justified by works, the
meaning according tot his verse is, that a man is proved by his works to be
justified, his faith thereby being shewn to be a living and not a dead faith. We
may well be surprised, as <i>Doddridge</i> was, that any, taking a view of this
whole passage, should ever think that there is any contrariety in what is here
said to be the teaching of Paul. The doctrine of Paul, that man is justified by
faith and not by works, that is, by a living faith, which works by love, is
perfectly consistent with what James says, that is, that a man is not justified
by a dead faith but by that faith which proves its living power by producing
good works, or by rendering obedience to God. The sum of what James says is,
that a dead faith cannot save, but a living faith, and that a living faith is a
working faith &#8212; a doctrine taught by Paul as well as by
James.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">ftd19</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
The design of alluding to the faith of devils seems to have been this, to shew
that though a good man may believe and tremble, yet if he does not obey God an
do good works, he has no true evidence of faith. Obedient faith is that which
saves, and not merely that which makes us tremble. The connection with the
preceding verse seems to be as follows, &#8212; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">In the former verse the boaster of mere faith is
challenged to prove that his faith is right and therefore saving; the challenger
would prove by his works. Then, in this verse, a test is applied &#8212; the
very first article of faith is mentioned: &#8220;Be it that you believe this,
yet this faith will not save you: the devils have this faith, and instead of
being saved they tremble.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">ftd20</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
It is justly observed by <i>Scott</i>, that there is the same difficulty in
reconciling James with himself as with Paul. And this difficulty at once
vanishes, when we take a view of the whole passage, and not confine ourselves to
single expressions.</font><br></div>

The previous sentence is hardly intelligible in our version or in
<i>Calvin&#8217;s.</i> &#8220;Seest thou how faith wrought (co-operated, by
<i>C</i>.) with his works?&#8221; The verb is
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">sunerge&gt;w</font><font face="Palatino">,
which means properly to work together, to co-operate; and it means also, as the
effect of co-operating, to aid, to help. &#8220;Seest thou how faith aided him
in his works?&#8221; <i>Schleusner</i> gives this paraphrase, &#8220;Thou sees
that Abraham was aided by his faith to do his remarkable works.&#8221;
<i>Beza&#8217;s</i> version is, &#8220;Thou seest that faith was the assistant
(<i>administer</i>) of his works.&#8221; Some give the idea of combining to
co-operating, &#8220;Thou seest that faith co-operated with his works,&#8221;
that is, in justification. It has been said, that if this combination had been
intended, it ought to have been said that works co-operated with his faith, as
faith, according to the testimony of scripture and the nature of things, is the
primary and the principal thing, and as there can be no good works without
faith. But the first explanation is the most consonant with the words and with
the drift of the passage.</font><br></div>

<i>Scott</i> considers that this wisdom was called &#8220;earthly,&#8221;

in

of his pride, ambition, malignity, and falsehood.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The word &#8220;sensual&#8221; has led some to

free from taint or pollution: the <i>kind</i> of taint must be learnt from the
passage. The wisdom from above is contrasted with the wisdom from below: the
latter has envy and contention; the former is &#8220;pure,&#8221; being free
from envy, and is &#8220;peaceable.&#8221;</font><br></div>

The word
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ajdiu&gt;critov</font><font face="Palatino">
is found only here, and has been variously rendered, because the verb from which
it comes has various meanings, &#8212; to discern, to make a difference, to
judge, to examine, to contend or litigate, and to doubt. It is rendered by the
<i>Vulg.</i>, as &#8220;not judging&#8221; &#8212; uncensorious; by <i>Beza</i>,
&#8220;without contending&#8221; &#8212; incontroversial; by <i>Erasmus</i>,
&#8220;making no difference&#8221; &#8212; impartial; and by <i>Hammond</i>,
&#8220;not doubting,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i>, as to the faith. &#8220;Uncensorious
,&#8221; or, &#8220;impartial;&#8221; seems the most suitable rendering; not

previously condemned in

contentious, but peaceable; does not create confusion, but is patient and
conciliatory; and instead of producing &#8220;every evil work,&#8221; it is full
of mercy or benevolence, and of the fruits of benevolence, being not censorious
or partial in judgment, and not dissembling, or acting dishonestly. By this
comparison, we see what were some of the things included in &#8220;every evil
work;&#8221; they were the reverse of mercy or benevolence, and its fruits, even
censoriousness or partiality, and dissimilation. And yet those who exhibited all

When it is said, &#8220;ye kill,&#8221; the meaning is, that they did so as to
the hatred or envy they entertained, for hatred is the root of murder, and
arises often from envy. What has evidently led <i>Calvin</i> and others to
conjecture a mistake here, has been the difficulty arising from the order of the
words, &#8220;Ye kill and ye envy;&#8221; but this order is wholly consonant
with the style of Scripture, where often the greater evil or good is mentioned
first, and then that which precedes or leads to it. It is the same here as
though the copulative, <i>and</i>, were rendered causatively, &#8220;ye kill
because ye envy.&#8221; Envy is murder in the sight of God.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The language of the whole passage is highly
metaphorical. He calls their contentions &#8220;wars and fightings;&#8221; for
the whole tenor of the passage is opposed to the supposition that her refers to
actual wars. He adopts a military term as to inward lusts or ambitious desires,
that they &#8220;carried on war&#8221; in their members; the expedition for
their contests was prepared within, mustered in their hearts. Then the character
of this war is more plainly defined, &#8220;Ye covet,&#8221; not, ye lust;
&#8220;ye kill,&#8221; or commit murder, for &#8220;ye envy;&#8221; when ye
cannot attain your objects, &#8220;ye wage war and fight,&#8221; that is, ye
wrangle and quarrel. Avarice and ambition were the two prevailing evils, but
especially avarice; and avarice too for the purpose of gratifying the lusts and
propensities of their sinful nature, as it appears from the third
verse.</font><br></div>

There are wagon-loads of interpretations, says <i>Erasmus</i>, on this passage.
The one given by <i>Calvin</i>, and adopted by <i>Whitby</i>, <i>Doddridge</i>,
<i>Scholefield</i>, and others, is the most satisfactory, and what alone enables
us to see a meaning in the words, &#8220;more grace,&#8221; in the following
verse. The Spirit dwells in God&#8217;s people, and he dwells there to give more
or increasing grace, according to the tenor of what is said in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;235715&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Isaiah
57:15, where God is said to &#8220;dwell with him that is of a contrite and

The passage is found in all MSS. and versions: there is, therefore, no ground to
think it an interpolation. And it is taken literally from
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;200334&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Proverbs
3:34, according to the <i>Sept.</i>; though the first clause differs from the
Hebrew in words, yet it is substantially the same. To &#8220;scorn the
scorners,&#8221; and to &#8220;resist (or, to stand in array against) the
proud&#8221; or insolent, mean the same thing.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">ftd35</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
In the seventh verse he seems still to continue military terms, &#8220;Set
yourselves, therefore, in array under God: stand up against the devil, and he
will flee from you.&#8221; It is especially to be observed, that the first thing
is to be under the banner and protection of God, and then we can successfully
stand up against the devil: apart from God, we have no power to resist
him.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The order in the following verse, the eighth, is
worthy of notice, as an example of what is very common in Scripture. The main
thing is first stated, to draw nigh to God: and then the things which are
previously necessary, to cleanse their hands and to purify their hearts &#8212;
an allusion probably to the practice among the priests of the law, of washing
themselves before they engaged in the service of the temple. They were to wash
their hands as though they had been stained with blood, as the crime of murder
had been imputed to them in
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;590402&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">James
4:2: and they were to purify their hearts from the covetings and ambitious
desires which they had entertained. Except those things were done they could not
draw nigh to God. And further, to draw nigh to God was necessary before they
could set themselves in array under his authority, so that there is a connection
between this verse and the former: the ultimate object, stated first, was
submission to God, and to be under his protection; and all that follows was
necessary for that purpose. The regular order would be, Purify your hearts,
cleanse your hands, draw nigh to God, and be subject to him. But this mode of
statement, by going backward instead of forward, is to be met with in all parts
of Scripture. See on this subject the Preface to the third volume of

Many commentators, such as <i>Grotius</i>, <i>Doddridge</i>, <i>Macknight</i>,
and <i>Scott,</i> consider that the Apostle refers at the beginning of this
chapter, not to professing Christians, but to unbelieving Jews. There is nothing
said that can lead to such an opinion: and if the two preceding chapters were
addressed (as admitted by all) to those who<i> professed</i> the faith, there is
no reason why this should not have been addressed to them; the sins here
condemned are not worse than those previously condemned. Indeed, we find by the
Epistles of Peter, and by that of Jude, that there were men professing religion
at that time, who were not a whit better (if not worse) than many who profess
religion in our age.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Besides, it was not unusual , in addresses to
Christians, to address unbelievers. Indeed, Paul expressly says, &#8220;What
have I to do to judge them that are without?&#8221;</font><br></div>

by some, to the destruction of Jerusalem, has nothing in the passage to favor
it. To &#8220;heap treasure,&#8221; or to lay up a store, has an evident
reference to the day of judgment, as Paul makes use of the same expression in

store is to be learnt from the preceding part of the verse. In treasuring
dishonest wealth, they were treasuring wrath for themselves.</font><br></div>

faith. Besides, the death of Christ is not ascribed to the rich, but to the
elders and chief priests.</font><br></div>

The illative

though found in some MSS., is not introduced into the text by <i>Griesbach</i>,
there being no sufficient evidence in its favor. Nor does there appear a
sufficient reason for the connection mentioned by <i>Calvin</i>. The two cases
seem to be different. The elders of the church were in the previous instance to
be called in, who were to pray and anoint the sick, and it is said that the
prayer of faith (<i>i.e.</i> of miraculous faith) would save the sick, and that
his sins would be forgiven him. This was clearly a case of miraculous healing.
But what is spoken of in this verse seems to be quite different. Prayer is alone
mentioned, not by the elders, but by a righteous man, not saving as in the
former case, but availing much. It seems probable then that the sins of the sick
miraculously healed were more especially against God; and that the sins which
they were to confess to one another were against the brethren, also visited with
judgment and the remedy for them was mutual confession, and mutual prayer; but
the success in this case was not as sure or as certain as in the former, only we
are told that an earnest prayer avails much. Then, to encourage this earnest or
fervent prayer, the case of Elias is adduced; but it had nothing to do with
miraculous healing.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">ftd45</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
This can hardly be admitted. The word expresses what sort of prayer is that
which avails much. Besides, to avail much, and to be effectual, are two distinct
things. The word as a verb and as a participle had commonly an active sense.
<i>Schleusner</i> gives only one instance in which it has a passive meaning,

The connection here is variously regarded. Our version and Calvin seem to
connect this verse with the foregoing, in this sense, that the Apostle prays for
the increase of grace and peace from the consideration of what God had already
done, or in conformity with his previous benefits. Others, perhaps more
correctly, view this verse as connected with the 5th, and render

Some, like <i>Bishop Warburton</i>, have very ingeniously attempted to shew that
there is here a regular order and gradation; but it is not the order of cause
and effect. Different things are mentioned, and what is added, has in some way

conduct; that virtue may be rightly formed, add knowledge; that knowledge may be
gained, add temperance; that temperance may continue, add patience or
perseverance; that perseverance may be retained, add godliness or piety, that
is, prayer to God; that godliness may not be alone, add brotherly-kindness; and
that brotherly kindness may he enlarged, add love to all mankind. The word added

The question of free-will does not properly belong to this passage; for the
Apostle writes, not to those in their natural state, but to those whom he
considered to be new creatures. The question of free-will ought to be confined
to conversion, and not extended to the state of those who have been converted.
The tenth article of the Church of England nearly meets the question, yet not
wholly: it ascribes the will to turn most distinctly to God, and says that man
cannot turn himself; but it does not expressly say whether man can resist the
good-will given him, which is the very gist of the question. But it says
further, that the grace of God by Christ &#8220;worketh with us when we have
that good-will,&#8221; which seems certainly to imply, that the good-will first
given is made thereby effectual. If there be, then, a cooperation, (as no doubt
there is,) it is the cooperation, according to this Article, of the good-will
first given, and not of anything in man by nature. &#8212;

Paul, at the beginning of this chapter, compares our state in this world in a
fading body with our state above after the resurrection in a glorified body, and
takes no account of the intervening time between death and the resurrection. By
keeping this in view, the whole passage, otherwise obscure, will appear quite
clear. He speaks of being unclothed and clothed, that is, of being divested of
one body, and of putting on another; and consistently with this view he speaks
of not being found naked, that is, without a body as a covering. &#8212;

Much has been written on this subject; and the difficulty has arisen from a
wrong construction of the passage, which is literally as follows: &#8212;
&#8220;And we have more firm the prophetic word,&#8221;
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">Kai&lt; e]coman bebaio&gt;teron
to&lt;n profhtiko&lt;n lo&gt;gon</font><font face="Palatino">, that is, we have
rendered more firm the prophetic word. This is confirmed by what follows; for
the prophetic word is compared to &#8220;a light shining in a dark place,&#8221;
and, therefore, not clear nor firm until it be fulfilled; but they were doing
well to attend to this light until the full light of the gospel shone in their
hearts. As<i> Scott</i> maintains, the reference here is clearly to the
experience of Christians to their real knowledge of divine truths; for it was to
be <i>in</i> their <i>hearts</i>, and not before their eyes.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">A great deal of learning has been spent to no purpose
on this passage. It has been by most taken as granted, that &#8220;the power and
coming of our Lord,&#8221; mentioned in verse 16<sup>th</sup>, is his second
coming, when the whole passage refers only and expressly to his first coming.
And on this gratuitous and even false supposition is grounded the elaborate
exposition of <i>Sherlock, Horsley</i>, and others. &#8211;

The Apostle does not speak of the perfect day, but of the dawn of it, and the
day-star is that which ushers in the perfect day. The gospel is the dawn and the
day-star, compared with the glimmering light of prophecy, and compared too with
the perfect day of the heavenly kingdom. Prophecy is useful still; for its
fulfillment, found in the gospel, greatly strengthens faith. &#8212;

There are in the main three renderings of this passage: &#8212; l. &#8220;No
Prophecy of Scripture is of a private impulse,&#8221; or invention; &#8212; 2.
&#8220;No prophecy of Scripture is of self-interpretation,&#8221; that is, is
its own interpreter; &#8212; 3. No prophecy of Scripture is of private
interpretation, that is, is not to be interpreted according to the fancies of
men, but according to the word of God and the guidance of his Spirit. Now which
of these corresponds with the context? Clearly the first, the two others have
nothing in the passage to countenance them. The next verse is evidently
explanatory of this sentence, which seems at once to determine its meaning; and,
as it is often the case in Scripture, the explanation is given negatively and
positively. Prophecy <i>did not</i> come from the will of man; it <i>did</i>
come from the Spirit of God. Besides, the importance attached to the
announcement, &#8220;knowing this especially,&#8221; is not so clearly borne out
as by the first exposition, because the fact that prophecy did not come from
man, is everything in the question, while the other expositions contain only
things of subordinate importance. Thus what goes before and comes after tends to
confirm the same view.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Whether we take the conjectural reading (which only
differs from the other in one small letter) or that which is found in all the

if &#8220;feigned,&#8221; then they were words used not conveying their real

says, that the Apostle had probably in view the fables concerning the visions of
angels and the miracles performed at the sepulchres of departed saints, which
the false teachers in the early ages, and the monks in latter times, fabricated,

thee?&#8221; But there is no need of this, the corresponding clause is in the
ninth verse; and this is our version. The deliverance of the just is there first

The end of this verse is not explained, but the words of the version, <i>facta

pollutions would become worse to them than their former pollutions; and this is

The Apostle evidently admits that they had a sincere or a pure mind, that is,

The two verses, the fifth and the sixth, have been differently explained.
&#8220;The earth,&#8221; say some, &#8220;subsisting from water and through
water,&#8221; that is, emerging from water and made firm and solid by means of
water; which is true, for through moisture the earth adheres together and
becomes a solid mass. Others render the last clause, &#8220;in water,&#8221; or
in the midst of water, that is, surrounded by water; and this is the most
suitable meaning.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The </font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">di
j w=n</font><font face="Palatino"> at the beginning of the sixth verse, refers,
according to <i>Beza, Whitby,</i> and others, to the heavens and the earth in
the preceding verse, the deluge being occasioned by &#8220;the windows of heaven
being opened,&#8221; and &#8220;the fountains of the great deep being broken
up.&#8221;
(</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;010711&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Genesis

overflowed with water, was destroyed.&#8221;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">The objection to this view is, as justly stated by
<i>Macknight</i>, that the correspondence between this verse and the following
is thereby lost: the reservation of the world to be destroyed by fire is
expressly ascribed, in verse seventh, to God&#8217;s word; and to the same ought
the destruction of the old world to be ascribed. This is doubtless the meaning
required by the passage, but &#8220;which&#8221; being in the plural, creates a
difficulty, and there is no different reading. <i>Macknight</i> solves the
difficulty by saying that the plural &#8220;which&#8221; or whom, refers to
&#8220;word,&#8221; meaning Christ, and &#8220;God,&#8221; as in the first verse
of this chapter, &#8220;in both which,&#8221; a reference is made to what is
implied in &#8220;the second Epistle,&#8221; that is, the first. He supposes
that there is here the same anomalous mode of speaking. But the conjecture which
has been made is not improbable, that it is a typographical mistake,
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">w=n</font><font face="Palatino">
being put for
</font><font face="Koine-Medium" color="Blue">ou=</font><font face="Palatino">

with the other:</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">5. &#8220;For of this they are wilfully
ignorant, that the heavens existed of old and the earth (which subsisted from

kept for fire to the day of judgment and of the perdition of ungodly

case, it has often the secondary meaning of earnestly desiring a thing. It is so
taken here by <i>Schleusner</i>, <i>Parkhurst</i>, and <i>Macknight</i>;
&#8220;Expecting and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God.&#8221;

It is in the feminine gender in some MSS. The authority as to the copies and
versions is nearly equal. The difference is not much as to the sense, only
&#8220;in which epistles,&#8221; reads better. So thought <i>Beza, Mill</i>, and
others.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">It has been a question as to the particular epistle
referred to by Peter; for that he alludes to some particular epistle is evident
from the manner in which he writes. The difficulty has arisen from connecting
the reference made to Paul, only with the former part of the 15th verse, while
that part ought to be viewed only as an addition to the former verse; and the
former verse stands connected with the new heavens and the new earth. So that
the subjects in hand are the day of judgment, the future state, and the
necessity of being prepared for it; and that these are the things referred to is
evident from this, that he says, that Paul speaks of them in all his epistles,
which is not true, as to what is said at the beginning of the 15th verse. The
passage then ought to be thus rendered: &#8212; </font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">14. Therefore, beloved, since ye expect
these things, diligently strive to be found by him in peace, unspotted and
unblamable;</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">15. and deem the long-suffering of our
Lord <i>to be for</i> salvation: even as Paul, our beloved brother, has,
according to the wisdom given</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino" color="Navy">16. to him, written to you; as also in
all his epistles, when speaking in them of these things; in which (epistles)
there are some things difficult to be understood,&#8221; etc.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">Now the special epistle referred to was most probably
the epistle to the Hebrews, one particular design of which was to direct the
attention of the Jews to the country promised to their fathers. Some, indeed,
hold that that epistle was written to the Jews in Judea; but others maintain
that it was written to converted Hebrews generally, whether in Judea or
elsewhere; and this passage seems to favor the latter opinion.</font><br></div>
<div><font face="Palatino">If the view given here is right, that is, that the
subjects on which reference is made to Paul, are those mentioned in the
12<sup>th</sup>, the 13<sup>th</sup>, and 14<sup>th</sup> verses, then there is
no epistle of Paul which could be more appropriately referred to than that to
the Hebrews, as the new heavens and the new earth answer exactly to &#8220;the
better and heavenly country,&#8221; mentioned in the Epistle to the Hebrews. See
</font><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">&lt;581116&gt;</font></sup><font face="Palatino">Hebrews
11:16. Besides, the exhortations and warnings of that epistle wholly coincide
with the exhortation given here by Peter. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></font><br></div>

&#8220;Grace&#8221; is the attainment, and &#8220;the knowledge&#8221; of Christ
is the way and means. The chief thing is often mentioned first in Scripture,

Some have held, that James, mentioned in the forecited places in Acts, was not
James the apostle, but another James, a disciple, and one of the seventy, who
was also called Oblias: but this is not correct. &#8212;
<i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fte2</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
So <i>Beza</i> renders the words, &#8220; To the called, sanctified by God the
Father, and preserved by Jesus Christ:&#8221; that is, to the effectually
called, (as the word commonly means,) set apart and separated by God from the
ungodly world, and kept by Christ, having been committed to his care and
protection. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fte3</font></sup><font face="Palatino">
As <i>mercy</i> is that of God, so it is more consistent to consider
&#8220;peace&#8221; and &#8220;love&#8217;&#8217; to be those of God: &#8220;
may the mercy&#8221; of God, &#8220;and the peace&#8221; of God, &#8220;and the

Then the rendering would be, &#8220;Beloved, when I was applying all care to
write to you of the common salvation, I deemed (or found) it necessary to write
to you, in order to exhort you to contend for the faith once delivered to the
saints.&#8221;  <i>Macknight </i>and some others give another meaning to the
first clause, and one more literal: &#8220;Beloved, making all haste to write to
you, concerning the common salvation, I have thought it  necessary,&#8221; etc.
For this haste the Apostle gives a reason in the following verse,  &#8220;For
some men have stealthily crept in,&#8221; etc.. This is the most  obvious
meaning of the passage. &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</font><br></div>
<div><sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">fte5</font></sup><font face="Palatino" color="Maroon">
</font><font face="Palatino">The meaning of the verb is, to combat for, to

combat for the faith;&#8221; not with the sword, says <i>Beza</i>, but with

The words literally are, &#8220;Who have been long ago (or, some time past)

foretold; and this creeping in for such a purpose was a judgment for yielding up
themselves to the delusions of Satan. The word

We may render the words &#8220; Grumblers and fault-finders,&#8221; that is, as
the word means, with their own lot: they grumbled or murmured against others,
and were discontented with their own condition; and yet walked in such a way

Though most agree that by &#8220;fear&#8221; here is meant terror, that is, that
the persons referred to are to be terrified by the judgment which awaited them;
yet what follows seems favorable to another view, that fear means the care and
caution with which they were to be treated; for the act of saving them is
compared to that of a man snatching anything from the fire, in doing which he
must be careful lest he himself should be burnt; and then the other comparison,
that of a man shunning an infected garment lest he should catch the contagion,
favors the same view.  Hence our version seems right &#8212;  &#8220;<i>with</i>
fear.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed</i>. </font><br></div>

<div><font face="Palatino">&#8220;To the only wise God (or, to the wise God

It is by acknowledging his sovereign power, his capacity to exercise that power
&#8212; his omnipotence, and his greatness in everything that constitutes
greatness, that we give him the glory, the honor, and the praise due to his
name. &#8212; Ed</font><br></div>
