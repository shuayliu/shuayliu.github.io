 The <FONT SIZE=-1>INTERNAL EVIDENCE</FONT> for the authenticity of this 
 Epistle is strong. The style, manner of thought, and doctrine, accord 
 with Paul's.  The incidental allusions also establish his authorship.

 Philippi was <I>the first</I> (that is, the farthest from Rome, and first
 which met Paul in entering Macedonia) Macedonian <I>city of the district,</I>
 called <I>Macedonia Prima</I> (so called as lying <I>farthest eastward</I>).
 The <I>Greek</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:12">Ac 16:12</A>)

 should not be translated "the <I>chief</I> city," as <I>English 
 Version,</I> but as above [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. Not it, but 
 Thessalonica, was the <I>chief</I> city of the province, and 
 Amphipolis, of the district called Macedonia Prima. It was a 
 <I>Roman</I> "colony"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:12">Ac 16:12</A>),

 made so by Augustus, to commemorate his famous victory over Brutus and 
 Cassius. A <I>colony</I> was in fact a portion of Rome itself 
 transplanted to the provinces, an offshoot from Rome, and as it were a 
 portrait of the mother city on a small scale [A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ULUS</FONT> G<FONT SIZE=-1>ELLIUS</FONT>, <I>Attic Nights,</I> 
 16.13]. Its inhabitants were Roman citizens, having the right of voting 
 in the Roman tribes, governed by their own senate and magistrates, and 
 not by the governor of the province, with the Roman law and 
 <I>Latin</I> language.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Paul, with Silas and Timothy, planted the Gospel there 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:12">Ac 16:12</A>,

 &c.), in his second missionary journey, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 51.
 Doubtless he visited it again on his journey from Ephesus into 
 Macedonia

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:1">Ac 20:1</A>);

 and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:3,6">Ac 20:3, 6</A>,

 expressly mentions his third visit on his return from Greece (Corinth) 
 to Syria by way of Macedonia. His sufferings at Philippi

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:19">Ac 16:19</A>,

 &c.) strengthened the Christian bond of union between him and his 
 Philippian converts, who also, like him, were exposed to trials for the 
 Gospel's sake

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:2">1Th 2:2</A>).

 They alone sent supplies for his temporal wants, <I>twice</I> shortly 
 after he had left them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:15,16">Php 4:15, 16</A>),

 and again a third time shortly before writing this Epistle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:10,18,2Co+11:9">Php 4:10, 18;
 2Co 11:9</A>). 

 This fervent attachment on their part was, perhaps, also in part due to
 the fact that few Jews were in Philippi, as in other scenes of his 
 labors, to sow the seeds of distrust and suspicion. There was no 
 synagogue, but merely a Jewish <I>Proseucha,</I> or oratory, by the 
 riverside. So that there only do we read of his meeting no opposition 
 from Jews, but only from the masters of the divining damsel, whose 
 gains had been put an end to by her being dispossessed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though the Philippian Church was as yet free from Judaizing influence, 
 yet it needed to be forewarned of that danger which might at any time 
 assail it from without

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:2">Php 3:2</A>);

 even as such evil influences had crept into the Galatian churches. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:2,3">Php 4:2, 3</A>

 we find a trace of the fact recorded in the history

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:13,14">Ac 16:13, 14</A>),

 that <I>female</I> converts were among the first to receive the Gospel 
 at Philippi.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As to the state of the Church, we gather from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:1,2">2Co 8:1, 2</A>

 that its members were <I>poor,</I> yet most <I>liberal;</I> and from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:28-30">Php 1:28-30</A>,

 that they were undergoing persecution. The only blemish referred to in 
 their character was, on the part of some members, a tendency to 
 dissension. Hence arise his admonitions against disputings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:27,2:1-4,12,14,4:2">Php 1:27; 2:1-4, 12, 14; 4:2</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>OBJECT</FONT> of the Epistle is general: not only to 
 thank the Philippians for their contribution sent by Epaphroditus, who 
 was now in returning to take back the apostle's letter, but to express 
 his Christian love and sympathy, and to exhort them to a life consonant 
 with that of Christ, and to warn them against existing dissensions and 
 future possible assaults of Judaizers from without. It is remarkable in 
 this Epistle alone, as compared with the others, that, amidst many 
 commendations, there are no express censures of those to whom it is 
 addressed. No doctrinal error, or schism, has as yet sprung up; the 
 only blemish hinted at is, that some of the Philippian Church were 
 somewhat wanting in lowliness of mind, the result of which want was 
 disputation. Two women, Euodias and Syntyche, are mentioned as having 
 erred in this respect

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:2,3">Php 4:2, 3</A>).

 The Epistle may be divided into <I>three</I> parts: (1) Affectionate
 address to the Philippians; reference to his own state as a prisoner at 
 Rome, and to theirs, and to his mission of Epaphroditus to them (the 
 first and second chapters).  Epaphroditus probably held a leading 
 office in the Philippian Church, perhaps as a presbyter. After Tychicus 
 and Onesimus had departed (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 62), carrying the 
 Epistles to the Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon, Paul was cheered 
 in his imprisonment by the arrival of Epaphroditus with the Philippian 
 contribution. That faithful "brother, companion in labor, and fellow 
 soldier"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:25">Php 2:25</A>),

 had brought on himself by the fatigues of the journey a dangerous 
 sickness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:26,30">Php 2:26, 30</A>).
 
 But now that he was recovered, he "longed"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:26">Php 2:26</A>)

 to return to his Philippian flock, and in person to relieve their 
 anxiety on his behalf, in respect to his sickness; and the apostle 
 gladly availed himself of the opportunity of writing to them a letter 
 of grateful acknowledgments and Christian exhortations.  (2) Caution 
 against Judaizing teachers, supported by reference to his own former 
 and present feeling towards Jewish legalism

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1-21">Php 3:1-21</A>).

 (3) Admonitions to individuals, and to the Church in general, thanks 
 for their seasonable aid, and concluding benedictions and salutations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:1-23">Php 4:1-23</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This Epistle was written from Rome during the imprisonment, the
 beginning of which is related in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:16,20,30,31">Ac 28:16, 20, 30, 31</A>.

 The reference to "C&aelig;sar's household"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:22">Php 4:22</A>),
 
 and to the "palace"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:13">Php 1:13</A>,

 <I>Greek,</I> "<I>Pr&aelig;torium,</I>" probably, <I>the barrack of the 
 Pr&aelig;torian bodyguard,</I> attached to the palace of Nero) confirms 
 this. It must have been during his <I>first</I> imprisonment at Rome, 
 for the mention of the Pr&aelig;torium agrees with the fact that it was 
 during his first imprisonment he was in the custody of the 
 Pr&aelig;torian Prefect, and his situation, described in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:12-14">Php 1:12-14</A>,
 
 agrees with his situation in the first two years of his imprisonment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:30,31">Ac 28:30, 31</A>).

 The following reasons show, moreover, that it was written towards 
 <I>the close</I> of that imprisonment: (1) He, in it, expresses his 
 expectation of the immediate decision of his cause

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:23">Php 2:23</A>).

 (2) Enough time had elapsed for the Philippians to hear of his 
 imprisonment, to send Epaphroditus to him, to hear of Epaphroditus' 
 arrival and sickness, and send back word to Rome of their distress

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:26">Php 2:26</A>).

 (3) It must have been written after the three other Epistles sent from 
 Rome, namely, Colossians, Ephesians, and Philemon; for Luke is no 
 longer with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:20">Php 2:20</A>);

 otherwise he would have been specified as saluting them, having 
 formerly labored among them, whereas he is mentioned as with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:14,Phile+1:24">Col 4:14;
 Phm 24</A>.

 Again, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:19,20">Eph 6:19, 20</A>,
 
 his freedom to preach is implied: but in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:13-18">Php 1:13-18</A>,

 his bondage is dwelt on, and it is implied that, <I>not himself,</I> 
 but <I>others,</I> preached, and made his imprisonment known. Again, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:22">Phm 22</A>,

 he confidently anticipates his release, which contrasts with the more
 depressed anticipations of this Epistle.  (4) A considerable time had 
 elapsed since the beginning of his imprisonment, for "his bonds" to 
 have become so widely known, and to have produced such good effects for 
 the Gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:13">Php 1:13</A>).

 (5) There is evidently an increase in the rigor of his imprisonment 
 implied now, as compared with the early stage of it, as described in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:1-31">Ac 28:1-31</A>;
 
 compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:29,30,2:27">Php 1:29, 30; 2:27</A>.

 History furnishes a probable clue to account for this increase of 
 vigor. In the second year of Paul's imprisonment (<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 62), Burrus, the Pr&aelig;torian Prefect, to whose 
 custody he had been committed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:16">Ac 28:16</A>,

 "the captain of the guard"), died; and Nero the emperor having divorced 
 Octavia, and married Poppoea, a Jewish proselytess (who then caused her 
 rival, Octavia, to be murdered, and gloated over the head of her 
 victim), exalted Tigellinus, the chief promoter of the marriage, a 
 monster of wickedness, to the Pr&aelig;torian Prefecture. It was then 
 he seems to have been removed from his own house into the 
 Pr&aelig;torium, or barrack of the Pr&aelig;torian guards, attached to
 the palace, for stricter custody; and hence he writes with less hopeful 
 anticipations as to the result of his trial

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:17,3:11">Php 2:17; 3:11</A>).

 Some of the Pr&aelig;torian guards who had the custody of him before,
 would then naturally make known his "bonds," in accordance with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:13">Php 1:13</A>;

 from the smaller Pr&aelig;torian bodyguard at the palace the report 
 would spread to the general permanent Pr&aelig;torian camp, which 
 Tiberius had established north of the city, outside of the walls. He 
 had arrived in Rome, February, 61; the "two whole years

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:30">Ac 20:30</A>)

 in his own hired house" ended February, 63, so that the date of this 
 Epistle, written shortly after, evidently while the danger was 
 imminent, would be about spring or summer, 63. The providence of God 
 averted the danger. He probably was thought beneath the notice of 
 Tigellinus, who was more intent on court intrigues. The death of Nero's 
 favorite, Pallas, the brother of Felix, this same year, also took out 
 of the way another source of danger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>STYLE</FONT> is abrupt and discontinuous, his fervor of affection
 leading him to pass rapidly from one theme to another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:18,19-24,25-30,3:1,2,3,4-14,15">Php 2:18, 19-24, 25-30;
 3:1, 2, 3, 4-14, 15</A>). 

 In no Epistle does he use so warm expressions of love. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:1">Php 4:1</A>

 he seems at a loss for words sufficient to express all the extent and 
 ardor of his affection for the Philippians: "My brethren dearly beloved 
 and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly 
 beloved." The mention of bishops and deacons in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:1">Php 1:1</A>

 is due to the late date of the Epistle, at a time when the Church had 
 begun to assume that order which is laid down in the Pastoral Epistles, 
 and which continued the prevalent one in the first and purest age of 
 the Church.</P>

 <B>1. Timotheus</B>--mentioned as being well known to the Philippians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:3,10-12">Ac 16:3, 10-12</A>),

 and now present with Paul. Not that Timothy had any share in writing 
 the Epistle; for Paul presently uses the first person singular, "I," 
 not "we"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:3">Php 1:3</A>).

 The mention of his name implies merely that Timothy joined in 
 affectionate remembrances to them.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>servants of Jesus Christ</B>--The oldest manuscripts read the order,
 "Christ Jesus." Paul does not call himself "an apostle," as in the
 inscriptions of other Epistles; for the Philippians needed not to be
 reminded of his apostolic authority. He writes rather in a tone of
 affectionate familiarity.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>all</B>--so

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:4,7,8,25,Php+2:17,26">Php 1:4, 7, 8, 25;
 Php 2:17, 26</A>. 

 It implies comprehensive affection which desired not to forget any one
 among them "all."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>bishops</B>--synonymous with "presbyters" in the apostolical churches;
 as appears from the same persons being called "elders of the Church" at
 Ephesus 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:17">Ac 20:17</A>),
 
 and "overseers" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28">Ac 20:28</A>),
 
 <I>Greek,</I> "bishops." And 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:5">Tit 1:5</A>,
 
 compare with 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:7">Php 1:7</A>.

 This is the earliest letter of Paul where bishops and deacons are
 mentioned, and the only one where they are separately addressed in the 
 salutation. This accords with the probable course of events, deduced 
 alike from the letters and history. While the apostles were constantly 
 visiting the churches in person or by messengers, regular pastors would 
 be less needed; but when some were removed by various causes, provision 
 for the permanent order of the churches would be needed. Hence the 
 three pastoral letters, subsequent to this Epistle, give instruction as 
 to the due appointment of bishops and deacons. It agrees with this new 
 want of the Church, when other apostles were dead or far away, and Paul 
 long in prison, that bishops and deacons should be prominent for the 
 first time in the opening salutation. The Spirit thus intimated that 
 the churches were to look up to their own pastors, now that the 
 miraculous gifts were passing into God's ordinary providence, and the 
 presence of the inspired apostles, the dispensers of those gifts, was 
 to be withdrawn [P<FONT SIZE=-1>ALEY</FONT>, "<I>Hor&aelig; 
 Paulin&aelig;</I>]. "Presbyter," implied the <I>rank;</I> "bishop," 
 <I>the duties of the office</I> [N<FONT SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT>]. 
 Naturally, when the apostles who had the chief supervision were no 
 more, one among the presbyters presided and received the name "bishop," 
 in the more restricted and modern sense; just as in the Jewish 
 synagogue one of the elders presided as "ruler of the synagogue." 
 Observe, the apostle addresses the Church (that is, the congregation) 
 more directly than its presiding ministers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:17,1Th+5:12,Heb+13:24,Re+1:4,11">Col 4:17;
 1Th 5:12; 
 Heb 13:24; 
 Re 1:4, 11</A>). 

 The bishops managed more the internal, the deacons the external,
 affairs of the Church. The plural number shows there was more than one 
 bishop or presbyter, and more than one deacon in the Church at 
 Philippi.</P>

 <A NAME="Php1_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. Grace .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. peace</B>--The very form of this salutation implies the

 <I>opportunity for self-exaltation</I>) His equality with God." His 
 argument is that the antithesis

 requires it, "He used His equality with God as <I>an opportunity, not

 Himself.</I>" But the antithesis is not between His <I>being on an 
 equality with God,</I> and His <I>emptying Himself;</I> for He never 
 emptied Himself of the fulness of His Godhead, or His "BEING <I>on an 
 equality with God</I>"; but between His being "in the FORM (that is, 
 the outward glorious self-manifestation) of God," and His "taking on 
 Him <I>the form of a servant,</I>" whereby He in a great measure

 He, though existing in the form of God, He esteemed it no robbery to be

 did as really subsist in the divine nature, as in the form of a

 it appears Epaphroditus was to set out at once to allay the anxiety of 
 the Philippians on his account, and at the same time bearing the 
 Epistle; Timothy was to follow after the apostle's liberation was 
 decided, when they could arrange their plans more definitely as to 
 <I>where</I> Timothy should, on his return with tidings from Philippi, 
 meet Paul, who was designing by a wider circuit, and slower progress, 
 to reach that city.  Paul's reason for sending Timothy so soon after 
 having heard of the Philippians from Epaphroditus was that they were
 now suffering persecutions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:28-30">Php 1:28-30</A>);

 and besides, Epaphroditus' delay through sickness on his journey to
 Rome from Philippi, made the tidings he brought to be of less recent 
 date than Paul desired. Paul himself also hoped to visit them shortly.

 <B>concision</B>--<I>Circumcision</I> had now lost its spiritual 
 significance, and was now become to those who rested on it as any 
 ground of justification, a senseless mutilation. Christians have the 
 only true <I>circumcision,</I> namely, that of the heart; legalists
 have only "concision," that is, <I>the cutting off of the flesh.</I> To 
 make "cuttings in the flesh" was expressly prohibited by the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+21:5">Le 21:5</A>):

 it was a Gentile-heathenish practice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:28">1Ki 18:28</A>);

 yet this, writes Paul indignantly, is what these <I>legalists</I> are
 virtually doing in violation of the law. There is a remarkable 
 gradation, says B<FONT SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT> [<I>Hor&aelig; 
 Apostolic&aelig;</I>] in Paul's language as to circumcision. In his 
 first recorded discourse

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:39">Ac 13:39</A>),

 circumcision is not named, but implied as included in the law of Moses 
 which cannot justify. Six or seven years later, in the Epistle to 
 Galatians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:3">Ga 3:3</A>),

 the first Epistle in which it is named, its spiritual inefficiency is 
 maintained against those Gentiles who, beginning in the Spirit, thought 
 to be perfected in the flesh. Later, in Epistle to Romans

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:28,29">Ro 2:28, 29</A>),
 
 he goes farther, and claims the substance of it for every believer,
 assigning the shadow only of it to the unbelieving Jew. In Epistle to
 Colossians 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:11,3:11">Col 2:11; 3:11</A>),

 still later, he expounds more fully the true circumcision as the
 exclusive privilege of the believer. Last of all here, the very name is 
 denied to the legalist, and a term of reproach is substituted, 
 "concision," or <I>flesh-cutting.</I> Once obligatory on all the 
 covenant-people, then reduced to a mere national distinction, it was 
 more and more associated in the apostle's experience with the open 
 hostility of the Jews, and the perverse teaching of false brethren.</P>

 later life as a proselyte, but on the eighth day after birth, as the 
 law directed in the case of Jew-born infants.

 <B>righteousness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of God by faith</B>--<I>Greek,</I>
 "which is <I>from</I> God (resting) <I>upon</I> faith." Paul was 
 transported from legal bondage into Christian freedom at once, and 
 without any gradual transition. Hence, the bands of Pharisaism were 
 loosed instantaneously; and opposition to Pharisaic Judaism took the 
 place of opposition to the Gospel. Thus God's providence fitly prepared 
 him for the work of overthrowing all idea of legal justification. "The 
 righteousness of faith," in Paul's sense, is the righteousness or 
 perfect holiness of Christ appropriated by faith, as the 
 <I>objective</I> ground of confidence for the believer, and also as a 
 new <I>subjective</I> principle of life. Hence it includes the essence 
 of a new disposition, and may easily pass into the idea of 
 sanctification, though the two ideas are originally distinct. It is not 
 any arbitrary act of God, as if he treated as sinless a man persisting 
 in sin, simply because he believes in Christ; but the <I>objective</I> 
 on the part of God corresponds to the <I>subjective</I> on the part of 
 man, namely, faith. The realization of the archetype of holiness 
 through Christ contains the pledge that this shall be realized in all 
 who are one with Him by faith, and are become the organs of His Spirit. 
 Its germ is imparted to them in believing although the fruit of a life 
 perfectly conformed to the Redeemer, can only be gradually developed in 
 this life [N<FONT SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT>].</P>
