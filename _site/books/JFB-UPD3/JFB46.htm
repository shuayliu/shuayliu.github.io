 The A<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHENTICITY</FONT> of this Epistle is attested by
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT>
 R<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT>
 [<I>First Epistle to the Corinthians,</I> 47], P<FONT SIZE=-1>OLYCARP</FONT>
 [<I>Epistle to the Philippians,</I> 11], and I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT>
 [<I>Against Heresies,</I> 4.27.3]. The city to which it was sent was famed
 for its wealth and commerce, which were chiefly due to its situation
 between the Ionian and &AElig;gean Seas on the isthmus connecting the
 Peloponese with Greece. In Paul's time it was the capital of the
 province Achaia and the seat of the Roman proconsul 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:12">Ac 18:12</A>).

 The state of morals in it was notorious for debauchery, even in the 
 profligate heathen world; so much so that "to Corinthianize" was a 
 proverbial phrase for "to play the wanton"; hence arose dangers to the 
 purity of the Christian Church at Corinth. That Church was founded by 
 Paul on his first visit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:1-17">Ac 18:1-17</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He had been the instrument of converting many Gentiles 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:2">1Co 12:2</A>),
 
 and some Jews

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:8">Ac 18:8</A>),

 notwithstanding the vehement opposition of the countrymen of the latter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:5">Ac 18:5</A>),

 during the year and a half in which he sojourned there. The converts 
 were chiefly of the humbler classes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:26">1Co 1:26</A>,
 
 &c.). Crispus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:14,Ac+18:8">1Co 1:14;
 Ac 18:8</A>), 

 Erastus, and Gaius (Caius) were, however, men of rank

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:23">Ro 16:23</A>).

 A variety of classes is also implied in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:22">1Co 11:22</A>.

 The risk of contamination by contact with the surrounding corruptions, 
 and the temptation to a craving for Greek philosophy and rhetoric 
 (which Apollos' eloquent style rather tended to foster,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:24">Ac 18:24</A>,

 &c.) in contrast to Paul's simple preaching of Christ crucified

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:1">1Co 2:1</A>,
 
 &c.), as well as the
 opposition of certain teachers to him, naturally caused him anxiety.
 Emissaries from the Judaizers of Palestine boasted of "letters of
 commendation" from Jerusalem, the metropolis of the faith. They did
 not, it is true, insist on circumcision in refined Corinth, where the
 attempt would have been hopeless, as they did among the simpler people
 of Galatia; but they attacked the apostolic authority of Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:1,2,2Co+10:1,7,8">1Co 9:1, 2;
 2Co 10:1, 7, 8</A>), 

 some of them declaring themselves followers of Cephas, the chief
 apostle, others boasting that they belonged to Christ Himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:12,2Co+10:7">1Co 1:12;
 2Co 10:7</A>), 

 while they haughtily repudiated all subordinate teaching. Those persons
 gave out themselves for apostles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:5,13">2Co 11:5, 13</A>).

 The ground taken by them was that Paul was not one of the Twelve, and
 not an eye-witness of the Gospel facts, and durst not prove his
 apostleship by claiming sustenance from the Christian Church. Another
 section avowed themselves followers of Paul himself, but did so in a
 party spirit, exalting the minister rather than Christ. The followers
 of Apollos, again, unduly prized his Alexandrian learning and
 eloquence, to the disparagement of the apostle, who studiously avoided
 any deviation from Christian simplicity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:1-5">1Co 2:1-5</A>).

 In some of this last philosophizing party there may have arisen the
 Antinomian tendency which tried to defend theoretically their own 
 practical immorality: hence their denial of the future resurrection, 
 and their adoption of the Epicurean motto, prevalent in heathen 
 Corinth, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:32">1Co 15:32</A>).

 Hence, perhaps, arose their connivance at the incestuous intercourse 
 kept up by one of the so-called Christian body with his stepmother 
 during his father's life. The household of Chloe informed Paul of many 
 other evils: such as contentions, divisions, and lawsuits brought 
 against brethren in heathen law courts by professing Christians; the 
 abuse of their spiritual gifts into occasions of display and 
 fanaticism; the interruption of public worship by simultaneous and 
 disorderly ministrations, and decorum violated by women speaking 
 unveiled (contrary to Oriental usage), and so usurping the office of 
 men, and even the holy communion desecrated by greediness and revelling 
 on the part of the communicants. Other messengers, also, came from 
 Corinth, consulting him on the subject of (1) the controversy about 
 meats offered to idols; (2) the disputes about celibacy and marriage; 
 (3) the due exercise of spiritual gifts in public worship; (4) the best 
 mode of making the collection which he had requested for the saints at 
 Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:1">1Co 16:1</A>,

 &c.). Such were the circumstances which called forth the First Epistle 
 to the Corinthians, the most varied in its topics of all the 
 Epistles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:9">1Co 5:9</A>,

 "I wrote unto you in an Epistle not to company with fornicators," it is 
 implied that Paul had written a previous letter to the Corinthians (now 
 lost). Probably in it he had also enjoined them to make a contribution 
 for the poor saints at Jerusalem, whereupon they seem to have asked 
 directions as to the mode of doing so, to which he now replies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:2">1Co 16:2</A>).

 It also probably announced his intention of visiting them on way to 
 Macedonia, and again on his return from Macedonia

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:15,16">2Co 1:15, 16</A>),

 which purpose he changed hearing the unfavorable report from Chloe's 
 household

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:5-7">1Co 16:5-7</A>),

 for which he was charged with

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:17">2Co 1:17</A>).

 In the first Epistle which we have, the subject of fornication is 
 alluded to only in a way, as if he were rather replying to an excuse 
 set up after rebuke in the matter, than introducing for the first time 
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. Preceding this former letter, he seems 
 to have paid a <I>second</I> visit to Corinth. For in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:4,13:1">2Co 12:4; 13:1</A>,

 he speaks of his intention of paying them a <I>third</I> visit, 
 implying he had already <I>twice</I> visited them.  See on

 <A HREF="JFB47.htm#2Co2_1">2Co 2:1</A>;

 <A HREF="JFB47.htm#2Co13_2">2Co 13:2</A>;
 
 also see on

 <A HREF="JFB47.htm#2Co1_15">2Co 1:15</A>;

 <A HREF="JFB47.htm#2Co1_16">2Co 1:16</A>. 

 It is hardly likely that during his three years' sojourn at Ephesus he 
 would have failed to revisit his Corinthian converts, which he could so 
 readily do by sea, there being constant maritime intercourse between 
 the two cities. This <I>second</I> visit was probably a short one 
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:7">1Co 16:7</A>);

 and attended with pain and humiliation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:1,12:21">2Co 2:1; 12:21</A>),

 occasioned by the scandalous conduct of so many of his own converts.
 His milder censures having then failed to produce reformation, he wrote 
 briefly directing them "not to company with fornicators." On their 
 misapprehending this injunction, he explained it more fully in the 
 Epistle, the first of the two extant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:9,12">1Co 5:9, 12</A>).

 That the second visit is not mentioned in Acts is no objection to its 
 having really taken place, as that book is fragmentary and omits other 
 leading incidents in Paul's life; for example, his visit to Arabia, 
 Syria, and Cilicia

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:17-21">Ga 1:17-21</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The P<FONT SIZE=-1>LACE OF</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>RITING</FONT> is fixed to be Ephesus 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:8">1Co 16:8</A>).

 The subscription in <I>English Version,</I> "From Philippi," has no 
 authority whatever, and probably arose from a mistaken translation of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:5">1Co 16:5</A>,

 "For <I>I am passing through</I> Macedonia." At the time of writing 
 Paul implies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:8">1Co 16:8</A>)

 that he intended to leave Ephesus after Pentecost <I>of that year.</I> 
 He really did leave it about Pentecost (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 57). 
 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:20">Ac 19:20</A>.

 The allusion to Passover imagery in connection with our Christian 
 Passover, Easter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:7">1Co 5:7</A>),

 makes it likely that the season was about Easter. Thus the date of the 
 Epistle is fixed with tolerable accuracy, about Easter, certainly 
 before Pentecost, in the third year of his residence at Ephesus, <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 57. For other arguments, see C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ONYBEARE</FONT> and H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON'S</FONT> <I>Life and 
 Epistles of St. Paul.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Epistle is written in the name of Sosthenes "[our] brother."
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT> supposes he is the same as the Sosthenes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:17">Ac 18:17</A>,

 who, he thinks, was converted subsequently to that occurrence. He bears 
 no part in the Epistle itself, the apostle in the very next verses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:4">1Co 1:4</A>,
 
 &c.) using the first person: so Timothy is introduced,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:1">2Co 1:1</A>.

 The bearers of the Epistle were probably Stephanas, Fortunatus, and 
 Achaicus (see the subscription,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:24">1Co 16:24</A>),
 
 whom he mentions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:17,18">1Co 16:17, 18</A>)

 as with him then, but who he implies are about to return back to 
 Corinth; and therefore he commends them to the regard of the 
 Corinthians.</P>

 manuscripts Possibly inserted from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:1">Ro 1:1</A>;

 but as likely to be genuine. Translate, literally, "a called apostle" 
 [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ONYBEARE</FONT> and H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>through the will of God</B>--not because of my own merit. Thus Paul's
 call as "an apostle by the will of God," while constituting the ground
 of the authority he claims in the Corinthian Church (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:1">Ga 1:1</A>),
 
 is a reason for humility on his own part 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:8,10">1Co 15:8, 10</A>)

 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. In assuming the ministerial office a man 
 should see he does so not of his own impulse, but by the will of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:21">Jer 23:21</A>);

 Paul if left to his own will would never have been an apostle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:16">Ro 9:16</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <A HREF="#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>.

 Associated by Paul with himself in the inscription, either in modesty, 
 Sosthenes being his inferior [C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT>], or in 
 order that the name of a "brother" of note in Corinth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:17">Ac 18:17</A>)

 might give weight to his Epistle and might show, in opposition to his 
 detractors that he was supported by leading <I>brethren.</I> Gallio had 
 driven the Jews who accused Paul from the judgment-seat. The Greek mob, 
 who disliked Jews, took the opportunity then of beating Sosthenes the 
 ruler of the Jewish synagogue, while Gallio looked on and refused to 
 interfere, being secretly pleased that the mob should second his own 
 contempt for the Jews. Paul probably at this time had showed sympathy 
 for an adversary in distress, which issued in the conversion of the 
 latter. So Crispus also, the previous chief ruler of the synagogue had 
 been converted. Saul the persecutor turned into Paul the apostle, and 
 Sosthenes the leader in persecution against that apostle, were two 
 trophies of divine grace that, side by side, would appeal with double 
 power to the Church at Corinth [B<FONT SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT>].</P>

 <B>2. the church of God</B>--He calls it so notwithstanding its many blots.
 Fanatics and sectaries vainly think to anticipate the final sifting of
 the wheat and tares 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:27-30">Mt 13:27-30</A>).

 It is a dangerous temptation to think there is no church where there is 
 not apparent perfect purity. He who thinks so, must at last separate 
 from all others and think himself the only holy man in the world, or 
 establish a peculiar sect with a few hypocrites. It was enough for Paul 
 in recognizing the Corinthians as a church, that he saw among them 
 evangelical doctrine, baptism, and the Lord's Supper" [C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>]. It was the Church of God, not of this or of that 
 favorite leader [C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>at Corinth</B>--a church at dissolute Corinth--what a paradox of grace!

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>sanctified</B>--<I>consecrated,</I> or <I>set apart as holy to God in</I> (by
 union with) <I>Christ Jesus.</I> In the <I>Greek</I> there are no words "to
 them that are"; translate simply, "men sanctified."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>called to be saints</B>--rather, "called saints"; saints by calling:
 applied by Paul to <I>all</I> professing members of the Church. As
 "sanctified in Christ" implies the fountain sources of holiness, the
 believer's original sanctification in Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11,Heb+10:10,14,1Pe+1:2">1Co 6:11;
 Heb 10:10, 14; 
 1Pe 1:2</A>) 

 in the purposes of God's grace, so "called saints" refers to their
 actual <I>call</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:30">Ro 8:30</A>),

 and the end of that call that they should be holy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:15">1Pe 1:15</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 intended for these also, as well as for the Corinthians. The true

 [<I>Epistle to the Smyr&aelig;ans,</I> 8]): not consisting of those who call
 themselves from Paul, Cephas, or any other eminent leader 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:12">1Co 1:12</A>),

 but of all, wherever they be, who call on Jesus as their Saviour in 
 sincerity (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:22">2Ti 2:22</A>).

 Still a general unity of discipline and doctrine in the several 
 churches is implied in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:17,7:17,11-16,14-33,36">1Co 4:17; 7:17; 11-16; 14-33, 36</A>.

 The worship due to God is here attributed to Jesus (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:32,Mt+4:10,Ac+9:14">Joe 2:32;

 Christians throughout Achaia, not residing in Corinth, the capital

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:1">2Co 1:1</A>).

 Paul feels the home of his converts to be also his own. Compare a

 <I>parnasin</I> of the synagogue, like the ancient "deacon" of the

 and subsequently preached in subordination to the presbyters or 
 bishops, as Stephen and Philip did.  The Church is not the appendage to 
 the priesthood; but the minister is the steward of God to the Church. 
 Man shrinks from too close contact with God; hence he willingly puts a 
 priesthood between, and would serve God by deputy. The pagan (like the 
 modern Romish) priest was rather to conceal than to explain "the 
 mysteries of God." The minister's office is to "preach" (literally, 
 "proclaim as a herald,"

 revelation), so far as they have been revealed, and so far as his 
 hearers are disposed to receive them. J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>

 Though <I>here</I> below, <I>in the case of stewards, inquiry is made, 
 that one man be found</I> (that is, proved to be) faithful; yet God's 
 steward awaits no such <I>judgment</I> of man, in man's day, but the 
 Lord's judgment in His great day. Another argument against the

 punishment for sin ("to deliver to Satan such an one," that is, so
 heinous a sinner). For instances of this power, see

 slaying of the Passover lamb, so, Christ our Passover <I>having been

 As in dissolute Corinth to "company with no fornicators," &c., would be 
 almost to company with none in the (unbelieving) world; ye need not 
 <I>utterly</I> ("altogether") forego intercourse with fornicators, &c., 
 of the unbelieving world (compare

 Joh 17:15; 
 1Jo 5:18, 19</A>). 

 As "fornicators" sin against themselves, so "extortioners" against
 their neighbors, and "idolaters" against God. The attempt to get "out 
 of the world," in violation of God's will that believers should remain 
 in it but keep themselves from its evil, led to monasticism and its 
 consequent evils.</P>

 "<I>the case being so,</I>" namely, that to avoid fornicators, &c.,
 <I>of the world,</I> you would have to leave the world altogether, which
 would be absurd. So "now" is used in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:16">Heb 11:16</A>.

 Thus we avoid making the apostle <I>now</I> retract a command which he 
 had before given.

 There is less danger in associating with open worldlings than with 
 carnal professors. Here, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:3,5">Eph 5:3, 5</A>,

 "covetousness" is joined with "fornication": the common fount of both 
 being "the fierce and ever fiercer longing of the creature, which has 
 turned from God, to fill itself with the inferior objects of sense" 
 [T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT>, <I>Greek Synonyms of the New 
 Testament</I>]. Hence "idolatry" is associated with them: and the 
 covetous man is termed an "idolater"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:1,2">Nu 25:1, 2</A>).

 The Corinthians did not fall into open idolatry, but ate things offered 
 to idols, so making a compromise with the heathen; just as they 
 connived at fornication. Thus this verse prepares for the precepts in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:4">1Co 8:4</A>,

 &c. Compare the similar case of fornication, combined with a similar

 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>before the unjust</B>--The Gentile judges are here so termed by an epithet
 appropriate to the subject in question, namely, one concerning <I>justice.</I>
 Though all Gentiles were not altogether <I>unjust,</I> yet in the highest
 view of justice which has regard to God as the Supreme Judge, they are
 so: Christians, on the other hand, as regarding God as the only Fountain
 of justice, should not expect justice from them.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>before .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. saints</B>--The Jews abroad were permitted to refer their
 disputes to Jewish <I>arbitrators</I> [J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>,
 <I>Antiquities,</I> 14.10,17].
 So the Christians were allowed to have Christian arbitrators.</P>

 <A NAME="1Co6_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. Do ye not know</B>--as a truth universally recognized by Christians.
 Notwithstanding all your glorying in your "knowledge," ye are acting
 contrary to it 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:4,5,8:1">1Co 1:4, 5; 8:1</A>).

 The oldest manuscripts have "Or" before "know ye not"; that is, "What!
 (expressing surprise) know ye not," &c.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saints .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. judge</B>--that is, "rule," including <I>judgment:</I> as
 assessors of Christ.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:28">Mt 19:28</A>,

 "judging," that is, "ruling over." (Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:14,Da+7:22,27,Re+2:26,3:21,20:4">Ps 49:14;
 Da 7:22, 27; 
 Re 2:26; 3:21; 20:4</A>). 

 There is a distinction drawn by able expositors between the saints who
 <I>judge</I> or <I>rule,</I> and the world which is ruled by them: as
 there is between the elected

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:23">Mt 20:23</A>)

 twelve apostles who sit on thrones judging, and the twelve tribes of
 Israel that are judged by them. To <I>reign,</I> and to be 
 <I>saved,</I> are not necessarily synonymous. As Jehovah employed 
 angels to carry the law into effect when He descended on Sinai to 
 establish His throne in Israel, so at His coming the saints shall 
 administer the kingdom for, and under, Him. The nations of the earth, 
 and Israel the foremost, in the flesh, shall, in this view, be the 
 <I>subjects</I> of the rule of the Lord and His saints in glorified 
 bodies.  The mistake of the Chiliasts was that they took the merely 
 carnal view, restricting the kingdom to the terrestrial part. This part 
 shall have place with the accession of spiritual and temporal blessings 
 such as Christ's presence must produce. Besides this earthly glory, 
 there shall be the heavenly glory of the saints reigning in 
 transfigured bodies, and holding such blessed intercourse with mortal 
 men, as angels had with men of old, and as Christ, Moses, and Elias, in 
 glory had with Peter, James, and John, in the flesh at the 
 transfiguration

 2Pe 1:16-18</A>).

 But here the "world" seems to be the unbelieving world that is to be
 "condemned"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:22">1Co 11:22</A>),

 rather than the whole world, including the subject nations which are to 
 be brought under Christ's sway; however, it may include <I>both</I> 
 those to be condemned, with the bad angels, and those about to be 
 brought into obedience to the sway of Christ with His saints. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:32,40">Mt 25:32, 40</A>,

 "all nations," "these my brethren" on the thrones with Him. The event 
 will decide the truth of this view.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. judge angels</B>--namely, <I>bad</I> angels. We who are now "a spectacle
 to angels" shall then "judge angels." The saints shall join in approving
 the final sentence of the Judge on them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:6">Jude 6</A>).

 Believers shall, as administrators of the kingdom under Jesus, put down
 all rule that is hostile to God. Perhaps, too, <I>good</I> angels shall 
 then receive from the Judge, with the approval of the saints, higher 
 honors.</P>

 the Church, rather than the heathen 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:28">1Co 1:28</A>).

 Questions of earthly property are of secondary consequence in the eyes 
 of true Christians, and are therefore delegated to those in a secondary 
 position in the Church.</P>

 To shame you out of your present unworthy course of litigation before 
 the heathen, I have said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:4">1Co 6:4</A>),

 "Set the least esteemed in the Church to judge." Better even this, than 
 your present course.

 <B>Is it so?</B>--Are you in such a helpless state that, &c.?

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:5,22">1Co 1:5, 22</A>).

 Paul alludes probably to the title, "cachain," or <I>wise man,</I> 
 applied to each Rabbi in Jewish councils.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>no, not one</B>--not even one, amidst so many reputed among you for

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>brethren</B>--literally, "brother"; that is, judge between brother and
 brother. As each case should arise, the arbitrator was to be chosen from
 the body of the church, such a wise person as had the charism, or gift,
 of church government.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>7. utterly a fault</B>--literally, "a shortcoming" (not so strong as
 <I>sin</I>). Your going to law at all is a falling short of your high
 privileges, not to say your doing so <I>before unbelievers,</I> which
 aggravates it.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11. ye are washed</B>--The <I>Greek</I> middle voice expresses, "Ye have
 had yourselves washed." This washing implies the admission to the
 <I>benefits of Christ's salvation</I> generally; of which the parts are;
 (1) <I>Sanctification,</I> or the setting apart from the world, and
 adoption into the Church: so "sanctified" is used

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:14,Joh+17:19">1Co 7:14;
 Joh 17:19</A>.
 
 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:2">1Pe 1:2</A>,

 where it rather seems to mean the <I>setting apart</I> of one as 
 <I>consecrated by the Spirit in the eternal purpose God.</I> (2) 
 <I>Justification</I> from condemnation through the righteousness of God 
 in Christ by faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:17">Ro 1:17</A>).

 So P<FONT SIZE=-1>AR&AElig;US</FONT>. The order of 
 <I>sanctification</I> before <I>justification</I> shows that it must be 
 so taken, and not in the sense of <I>progressive</I> sanctification. 
 "Washed" precedes both, and so must refer to the Christian's outward 
 new birth of water, the sign of the inward setting apart to the Lord by 
 the inspiration of the Spirit as the seed of new life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:5,Eph+5:26,Tit+3:5,Heb+10:22">Joh 3:5;
 Eph 5:26; 
 Tit 3:5; 
 Heb 10:22</A>). 

 Paul (compare the Church of England Baptismal Service), in charity, and
 faith in the ideal of the Church, presumes that baptism realizes its 
 original design, and that those outwardly baptized inwardly enter into 
 vital communion with Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:27">Ga 3:27</A>).

 He presents the grand ideal which those alone realized in whom the 
 inward and the outward baptism coalesced. At the same time he 
 recognizes the fact that this in many cases does not hold good

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:8-10">1Co 6:8-10</A>),

 leaving it to God to decide who are the really "washed," while he only 
 decides on broad general principles.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in the name of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Jesus, and by the Spirit</B>--rather, "in the Spirit,"
 that is, by His <I>in</I>-dwelling. Both clauses belong to the
 three--"washed, sanctified, justified."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>our God</B>--The "our" reminds the that amidst all his reproofs God is
 still the common God of himself and them.</P>

 <B>12. All things are lawful unto me</B>--These, which were Paul's own words
 on a former occasion (to the Corinthians, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:23,Ga+5:23">1Co 10:23,
 and Ga 5:23</A>),

 were made a pretext for excusing the eating of meats offered to idols,
 and so of what was generally connected with idolatry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:29">Ac 15:29</A>),

 "fornication" (perhaps in the letter of the Corinthians to Paul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:1">1Co 7:1</A>).
 
 Paul's remark had referred only to things <I>indifferent:</I> but they
 wished to treat fornication as such, on the ground that the existence
 of bodily appetites proved the <I>lawfulness</I> of their
 gratification.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>me</B>--Paul giving himself as a sample of Christians in general.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but I</B>--whatever others do, <I>I will not,</I> &c.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>lawful .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. brought under the power</B>--The <I>Greek</I> 
 words are from the same root, whence there is a play on the words: All 
 things <I>are in</I> my <I>power,</I> but I will not be <I>brought 
 under the power of any</I> of them (the "all things"). He who commits 
 "fornication," steps aside from his own legitimate power or liberty, 
 and is "brought under the power" of an harlot

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:15">1Co 6:15</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:4">1Co 7:4</A>).

 The "power" ought to be in the hands of the <I>believer,</I> not in the 
 <I>things which he uses</I> [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]; else his 
 liberty is forfeited; he ceases to be his own master

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:34-36,Ga+5:13,1Pe+2:16,2Pe+2:19">Joh 8:34-36;
 Ga 5:13; 
 1Pe 2:16; 
 2Pe 2:19</A>). 

 Unlawful things ruin thousands; "lawful" things (unlawfully used), ten
 thousands.</P>

 <A NAME="1Co6_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13.</B> The argument drawn from the indifference of meats

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:8,Ro+14:14,17">1Co 8:8;
 Ro 14:14, 17</A>; 
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:18,Col+2:20-22">Mr 7:18;
 Col 2:20-22</A>)

 to that of fornication does not hold good. Meats doubtless are
 indifferent, since both they and the "belly" for which they are created 
 are to be "destroyed" in the future state. But "the body is not 
 (created) for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body" 
 (as its Redeemer, who hath Himself assumed the body): "And God hath 
 raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us" (that is our bodies): 
 therefore the "body" is not, like the "belly," after having served a 
 temporary use, to be destroyed: Now "he that committeth fornication, 
 sinneth against his own body"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:18">1Co 6:18</A>).

 Therefore fornication is not indifferent, since it is a sin against 
 one's own body, which, like the Lord for whom it is created, is not to 
 be destroyed, but to be raised to eternal existence. Thus Paul gives 
 here the germ of the three subjects handled in subsequent sections: (1) 
 The relation between the sexes. (2) The question of meats offered to 
 idols. (3) The resurrection of the body.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>shall destroy</B>--at the Lord's coming to change the natural bodies of
 believers into spiritual bodies 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:44,52">1Co 15:44, 52</A>).

 There is a real essence underlying the superficial phenomena of the 
 present temporary organization of the body, and this essential germ, 
 when all the particles are scattered, involves the future resurrection 
 of the body incorruptible.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>raised up</B>--rather, "raised," to distinguish it from "will raise 
 <I>up</I> us"; the <I>Greek</I> of the latter being a compound, the 
 former a simple verb. Believers shall be raised up <I>out of</I> the 
 rest of the dead (see on

 <A HREF="JFB50.htm#Php3_11">Php 3:11</A>);

 when Christ comes; elsewhere, of his being possibly found alive

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:17">1Th 4:17</A>).

 In either event, the Lord's coming rather than death is the great 
 object of the Christian's expectation

 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].
 It is a fact no less certain than mysterious, that moral and spiritual
 ruin is caused by such sins; which human wisdom (when untaught by
 revelation) held to be actions as blameless as eating and drinking

 fornicator becomes one "body" with her (not one "spirit," for the spirit
 which is normally the organ of the Holy Spirit in man, is in the carnal
 so overlaid with what is sensual that it is ignored altogether). But the
 believer not only has his body sanctified by union with Christ's body,
 but also becomes "one spirit" with Him

 He certainly injures, but he does not alienate the body itself; the
 sin is not terminated in the body; he rather sins against the perishing 
 accidents of the body (as the "belly," and the body's present temporary 
 organization), and against the soul than against the body in its 
 permanent essence, designed "for the Lord." "But" the fornicator 
 alienates that body which is the Lord's, and makes it one with a

 the <I>verity</I> and <I>nature</I> of his body; not a mere

 he represented the whole company of believers (souls and bodies), that 
 is, the Church, as "the temple of God," the Spirit; so here, the 
 <I>body</I> of each individual of the Church is viewed as the ideal 
 "temple of the Holy Ghost." So

 which proves that not only the Church, but also each member of it, is 
 "the temple of the Holy Ghost." Still though many the several members 
 form one temple, the whole collectively being that which each is in 
 miniature individually. Just as the Jews had one temple only, so in the 
 fullest sense all Christian churches and individual believers form one 
 temple only. Thus "<FONT SIZE=-1>YOUR</FONT> [<I>plural</I>] body" is

 (ideal) body," that of "Christ," whose "members your bodies" are

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:15">1Co 6:15</A>).

 In this consists the sin of fornication, that it is a sacrilegious 
 desecration of God's temple to profane uses. The unseen, but much more 
 efficient, Spirit of God in the spiritual temple now takes the place of 
 the visible Shekinah in the old material temple. The whole man is the 
 temple; the soul is the inmost shrine; the understanding and heart, the 
 holy place; and the body, the porch and exterior of the edifice.  
 Chastity is the guardian of the temple to prevent anything unclean 
 entering which might provoke the indwelling God to abandon it as 
 defiled [T<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT>, <I>On the Apparel of 
 Women</I>]. None but God can claim a temple; here the Holy Ghost is 
 assigned one; therefore the Holy Ghost is God.

 <B>else .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. children unclean</B>--that is, beyond the hallowed pale of
 God's people: in contrast to "holy," that is, all that is within the
 consecrated limits [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ONYBEARE</FONT> and
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>]. The phraseology accords with
 that of the Jews, who regarded the heathen as "unclean," and all of the
 elect nation as "holy," that is, partakers of the holy covenant.
 Children were included in the covenant, as God made it not only with
 Abraham, but with his "seed after" him 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:7">Ge 17:7</A>).

 So the faith of one Christian parent gives to the children a near 
 relationship to the Church, just as if both parents were Christians 
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:16">Ro 11:16</A>).
 
 Timothy, the bearer of this Epistle, is an instance in point

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:1">Ac 16:1</A>).

 Paul appeals to the Corinthians as recognizing the principle, that the 
 infants of heathen parents would not be admissible to Christian 
 baptism, because there is no faith on the part of the parents; but 
 where one parent is a believer, the children are regarded as not aliens 
 from, but admissible even in infancy as sharers in, the Christian 
 covenant: for the Church presumes that the believing parent will rear 
 the child in the Christian faith. Infant baptism tacitly superseded 
 infant circumcision, just as the Christian Lord's day gradually 
 superseded the Jewish sabbath, without our having any express command 
 for, or record of, transference. The setting aside of circumcision and 
 of sabbaths in the case of the Gentiles was indeed expressly commanded 
 by the apostles and Paul, but the substitution of infant baptism and of 
 the Lord's day were tacitly adopted, not expressly enacted. No explicit 
 mention of it occurs till I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT> in the 
 third century; but no society of Christians that we read of disputed 
 its propriety till fifteen hundred years after Christ. Anabaptists 
 would have us defer baptism till maturity as the child cannot 
 understand the nature of it. But a child may be made heir of an estate: 
 it is <I>his,</I> though incapable at the time of using or comprehending its
 advantage; he is not hereafter <I>to acquire the title and claim</I> to 
 it: he will hereafter understand his claim, and be capable of employing
 his wealth: he will then, moreover, become responsible for the use he 
 makes of it [A<FONT SIZE=-1>RCHBISHOP</FONT> W<FONT

 Lu 14:26</A>. 

 The believer does not lie under the same obligation in the case of a
 union with an unbeliever, as in the case of one with a believer. In the 
 former case he is not bound not to separate, if the unbeliever separate 
 or "depart," in the latter nothing but "fornication" justifies

 question of eating meats offered to idols (referred to in the letter of
 the Corinthians, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:1">1Co 7:1</A>)

 might seem unimportant, it is not so with some, and the infirmities of 
 such should be respected. The portions of the victims not offered on 
 the altars belonged partly to the priests, partly to the offerers; and 
 were eaten at feasts in the temples and in private houses and were 
 often sold in the markets; so that Christians were constantly exposed 
 to the temptation of receiving them, which was forbidden

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:2,Ps+106:28">Nu 25:2;
 Ps 106:28</A>). 

 The apostles forbade it in their decree issued from Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:1-29,21:25">Ac 15:1-29; 21:25</A>);

 but Paul does not allude here to that decree, as he rests his precepts
 rather on his own independent apostolic authority.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>we know that we all have knowledge</B>--The Corinthians doubtless had
 referred to their "knowledge" (namely, of the indifference of meats, as
 in themselves having no sanctity or pollution). Paul replies, "We are
 aware that we all have [speaking <I>generally,</I> and so far as Christian
 <I>theory</I> goes; for in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:7">1Co 8:7</A>

 all meats are indifferent, yet "this knowledge is not in all" in the 
 same degree as we have it. Paul had admitted to the Corinthians that 
 "we all have knowledge"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:1">1Co 8:1</A>),

 <B>with conscience</B>--an ancient reading; but other very old manuscripts
 read "association" or "habit." In either reading the meaning is: Some
 Gentile Christians, whether from old <I>association</I> of ideas or
 misdirected <I>conscience,</I> when they ate such meats, ate them with some
 feeling as if the idol were something real 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:4">1Co 8:4</A>),

 and had changed the meats by the fact of the consecration into 
 something either holy or else polluted.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>unto this hour</B>--after they have embraced Christianity; an implied
 censure, that they are not further advanced by this time in Christian
 "knowledge."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>their conscience .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is defiled</B>--by their eating it "as a thing
 offered to idols." If they ate it unconscious at the time that it had
 been offered to idols, there would be no defilement of conscience. But
 conscious of what it was, and not having such knowledge as other
 Corinthians boasted of, namely, that an idol is nothing and can
 therefore neither pollute nor sanctify meats, they by eating them sin
 against conscience (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:15-23">Ro 14:15-23</A>).

 It was on the ground of Christian expediency, not to cause a 
 stumbling-block to "weak" brethren, that the Jerusalem decree against 
 partaking of such meats (though indifferent <I>in themselves</I>) was 
 passed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:1-29">Ac 15:1-29</A>).

 And yet professing Christians at Corinth virtually tempted their 
 brethren to their damnation, so far were they from sacrificing aught
 for their salvation. Note here, that it is no argument against the 
 dogma that <I>Christ died for all, even for those who perish,</I> to 
 say that thus He would have died <I>in vain</I> for many. Scripture is 
 our rule, not our suppositions as to consequences. More is involved in 
 redemption than the salvation of man: the <I>character of God</I> as at 
 once just and loving is vindicated even in the case of the lost for 
 they might have been saved, and so even in their case Christ has not 
 died in vain. So the mercies of God's providence are not in vain, 
 though many abuse them.  Even the condemned shall manifest God's love 
 in the great day, in that they too had the offer of God's mercy. It 
 shall be the most awful ingredient in their cup that they might have 
 been saved but would not: Christ died to redeem even them.</P>

 that the Christian ministry is of a sacrificial character as the Jewish
 priesthood, but simply, that as the latter was supported by the
 contributions of the people, so should the former. The stipends of the
 clergy were at first from voluntary offerings at the Lord's Supper. At
 the love-feast preceding it every believer, according to his ability,
 offered a gift; and when the expense of the table had been defrayed, the
 bishop laid aside a portion for himself, the presbyters, and deacons;
 and with the rest relieved widows, orphans, confessors, and the poor
 generally [T<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT>, <I>Apology,</I> 39]. The stipend was in proportion

 <B>baptized unto Moses</B>--the servant of God and representative of the Old
 Testament covenant of the law: as Jesus, the Son of God, is of the
 Gospel covenant 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:17,Heb+3:5,6">Joh 1:17;
 Heb 3:5, 6</A>). 

 The people were led to believe in Moses as God's servant by the miracle
 of the cloud protecting them, and by their being conducted under him 
 safely through the Red Sea; therefore they are said to be "baptized 
 unto" him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:31">Ex 14:31</A>).

 "Baptized" is here equivalent to "<I>initiated</I>": it is used in 
 accommodation to Paul's argument to the Corinthians; they, it is true, 
 have been "baptized," but so also virtually were the Israelites of old; 
 if the virtual baptism of the latter availed not to save them from the 
 doom of lust, neither will the actual baptism of the former save them.  
 There is a resemblance between the symbols also: for the cloud and sea 
 consist of water, and as these took the Israelites out of sight, and 
 then restored them again to view, so the water does to the baptized 
 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].  O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT> 
 understands "the cloud" and "the sea" as symbolizing the <I>Spirit</I> 
 and <I>water</I> respectively

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:5,Ac+10:44-47">Joh 3:5;

 Christ is the pillar cloud that screens us from the heat of God's
 wrath.  Christ as "the light of the world" is our "pillar of fire" to 
 guide us in the darkness of the world. As the rock when smitten sent 
 forth the waters, so Christ, having been once for all smitten, sends 
 forth the waters of the Spirit. As the manna bruised in mills fed 
 Israel, so Christ, when "it pleased the Lord to bruise Him," has become 
 our spiritual food. A strong proof of inspiration is given in this 
 fact, that the <I>historical</I> parts of Scripture, without the 
 consciousness even of the authors, are covert prophecies of the 
 future.</P>

 <B>3. same spiritual meat</B>--As the Israelites had the water from the 
 rock, which answered to <I>baptism,</I> so they had the manna which 
 corresponded to the other of the two Christian sacraments, the Lord's 
 Supper. Paul plainly implies the <I>importance</I> which was attached 
 to these two sacraments by all Christians in those days: "an inspired 
 protest against those who lower their dignity, or deny their necessity" 
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. Still he guards against the other 
 extreme of thinking the mere external possession of such privileges 
 will ensure salvation. Moreover, had there been seven sacraments, as 
 Rome teaches, Paul would have alluded to them, whereas he refers to 
 only the two. He does not mean by "the same" that <I>the Israelites and 
 we Christians</I> have the "same" sacrament; but that <I>believing and 
 unbelieving</I> Israelites alike had "the same" spiritual privilege of 
 the manna (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:17">1Co 10:17</A>).

 It was "<I>spiritual</I> meat" or food; because given by the power of 
 God's spirit, not by human labor [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT> and

 Not that the Israelites clearly understood the signification; but 
 believers among them would feel that in the type something more was 
 meant; and their implicit and reverent, though indistinct, faith was 
 counted to them for justification, of which the manna was a kind of 
 sacramental seal. "They are not to be heard which feign that the old 
 fathers did look only for transitory promises" [Article VII, Church of 
 England], as appears from this passage (compare

 The minister "blesses" (that is, <I>consecrates with blessing</I>) the 
 cup, not by any priestly transmitted authority of his own, but as 
 representative of the congregation, who virtually through him bless the 
 cup. The consecration is the corporate act of the whole Church. The act 
 of <I>joint blessing</I> by him and them (not "the cup" itself, which, 
 as also "the bread," in the <I>Greek</I> is in the accusative), and the 
 consequent drinking of it together, constitute the communion, that is, 
 the joint participation "of the blood of Christ." Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:18">1Co 10:18</A>,

 "They who eat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are partakers" (joint communicants). "Is" 
 in both cases in this verse is literal, not <I>represents.</I> He who 
 with faith partakes of the cup and the bread, partakes really but 
 spiritually of the blood and body of Christ

 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> explains, "The cup .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is the

 It is not said, "The cup .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is <I>the blood,</I>" or "the 
 bread .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is <I>the body,</I>" but "is the <I>communion</I> 
 [joint-participation] of the blood .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. body." If the bread 
 be changed into the literal body of Christ, where is the sign of the 
 sacrament? Romanists eat Christ "<I>in remembrance</I> of Himself." To 
 drink literal <I>blood</I> would have been an abomination to Jews,

 <B>19, 20. What say I then?</B>--The inference might be drawn from the
 analogies of the Lord's Supper and Jewish sacrifices, that an idol is
 <I>really what the heathen thought it to be, a god,</I> and that in eating
 idol-meats they had fellowship with the god. This verse guards against
 such an inference: "What would I say then? that a thing sacrificed to an
 idol is any real thing (in the sense that the heathen regard it), or
 that an idol is any real thing?" (The oldest manuscripts read the words
 in this order. Supply "<I>Nay</I>") "But [I say] that the things which the
 Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils (demons)." Paul here
 introduces a new fact. It is true that, as I said, an idol has no
 reality in the sense that the heathen regard it, but it has a reality in
 another sense; heathendom being under Satan's dominion as "prince of
 this world," <I>he</I> and <I>his demons</I> are in fact the powers worshipped
 by the heathen, whether they are or are not conscious of it

 same relation, analogically, to Christ's sacrifice, as the Jews'
 sacrificial feasts did to their sacrifices (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:7">Mal 1:7</A>,

 The heathen sacrifices were offered to idol nonentities, behind which

 distinction of sexes in Christ, claimed equality with the male sex, 
 and, overstepping the bounds of propriety, came forward to pray and

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>show</B>--<I>announce publicly.</I> The <I>Greek</I> does not mean to
 dramatically <I>represent,</I> but "ye publicly profess each of you, the
 Lord has died <FONT SIZE=-1>FOR ME</FONT>"
 [W<FONT SIZE=-1>AHL</FONT>]. This word, as "is" in Christ's
 institution 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:24,25">1Co 11:24, 25</A>),

 implies not <I>literal</I> presence, but a <I>vivid realization, by 
 faith,</I> of Christ in the Lord's Supper, as a living person, not a 
 mere abstract dogma, "bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:30">Eph 5:30</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:23">Ge 2:23</A>);

 and ourselves "members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones," 
 "our sinful bodies made clean by His body (once for all offered), and 
 our souls washed through His most precious blood" [<I>Church of England 
 Prayer Book</I>]. "Show," or "announce," is an expression applicable to 
 <I>new</I> things; compare "show" as to the Passover

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:8">Ex 13:8</A>).

 So the Lord's death ought always to be fresh in our memory; compare in 
 heaven,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:6">Re 5:6</A>.

 That the Lord's Supper is in <I>remembrance</I> of Him, implies that He 
 is bodily absent, though spiritually present, for we cannot be said to 
 commemorate one absent.  The fact that we not only show the Lord's 
 death in the supper, but <I>eat</I> and <I>drink</I> the pledges of it, 
 could only be understood by the Jews, accustomed to such feasts after 
 propitiatory sacrifices, as implying our <I>personal appropriation</I> 
 therein of the benefits of that death.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>till he come</B>--when there shall be no longer need of symbols of His
 body, the body itself being manifested. The <I>Greek</I> expresses the
 <I>certainly</I> of His coming. Rome teaches that we eat Christ present
 corporally, "till He come" corporally; a contradiction in terms. The
 showbread, literally, "bread of the presence," was in the sanctuary, but
 not in the Holiest Place 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:1-8">Heb 9:1-8</A>);

 so the Lord's Supper in heaven, the antitype to the Holiest Place, 
 shall be superseded by Christ's own bodily presence; then the wine 
 shall be drunk "anew" in the Father's kingdom, by Christ and His people 
 together, of which heavenly banquet, the Lord's Supper is a spiritual 
 foretaste and specimen

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:29">Mt 26:29</A>).

 Meantime, as the showbread was placed <I>anew,</I> every sabbath, on 
 the table before the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:5-8">Le 24:5-8</A>);

 so the Lord's death was <I>shown,</I> or announced <I>afresh</I> at the 
 Lord's table the first day of every week in the primitive Church. We 
 are now "priests unto God" in the dispensation of Christ's spiritual 
 presence, antitypical to the <FONT SIZE=-1>HOLY PLACE</FONT>: the 
 perfect and eternal dispensation, which shall not begin till Christ's 
 coming, is antitypical to the <FONT SIZE=-1>HOLIEST PLACE</FONT>, which 
 Christ our High Priest alone in the flesh as yet has entered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:6,7">Heb 9:6, 7</A>);

 but which, at His coming, we, too, who are believers, shall enter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:15,21:22">Re 7:15; 21:22</A>).

 The supper joins the two closing periods of the Old and the New
 dispensations. The first and second comings are considered as 
 <I>one</I> coming, whence the expression is not "return," but "come" 
 (compare, however,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:3">Joh 14:3</A>).</P>

 <B>27. eat and drink</B>--So one of the oldest manuscripts reads. But 
 three or four equally old manuscripts, the <I>Vulgate</I> and C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>YPRIAN</FONT>, read, "or." Romanists quote this reading in 
 favor of communion in one kind.  This consequence does not follow. Paul 
 says, "Whosoever is guilty of unworthy conduct, <I>either</I> in eating 
 the bread, <I>or</I> in drinking the cup, is guilty of the body and 
 blood of Christ." Impropriety in only <I>one</I> of the two elements, 
 vitiates true communion in <I>both.</I> Therefore, in the end of the 
 verse, he says, not "body <I>or</I> blood," but "body and blood." Any 
 who takes the bread without the wine, <I>or</I> the wine without the 
 bread, "<I>unworthily</I>" communicates, and so "is guilty of Christ's 
 body and blood"; for he disobeys Christ's express command to partake of 
 both. If we do not partake of the sacramental symbol of the Lord's
 death worthily, we share in the guilt of that death. (Compare "crucify
 to themselves the Son of God afresh,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:6">Heb 6:6</A>).

 <I>Unworthiness in the person,</I> is not what ought to exclude any,
 but <I>unworthily communicating:</I> However unworthy we be, if we 
 examine ourselves so as to find that we penitently believe in Christ's 
 Gospel, we may worthily communicate.</P>

 body. Most of the oldest manuscripts omit "Lord's" (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:27">1Co 11:27</A>).

 Omitting also "unworthily," with most of the oldest manuscripts, we 
 must translate, "He that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh 
 judgment to himself, IF he discern not the body"

 <B>1. spiritual gifts</B>--the signs of the Spirit's continued efficacious
 presence in the Church, which is Christ's body, the complement of His
 incarnation, as the body is the complement of the head. By the love
 which pervades the whole, the gifts of the several members, forming
 reciprocal complements to each other, tend to the one object of
 perfecting the body of Christ. The ordinary and permanent gifts are
 comprehended together with the extraordinary, without distinction
 specified, as both alike flow from the divine indwelling Spirit of life.
 The extraordinary gifts, so far from making professors more peculiarly
 <I>saints</I> than in our day, did not always even <I>prove</I> that such
 persons were in a safe state at all 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:22">Mt 7:22</A>).

 They were needed at first in the Church: (1) as a pledge to Christians 
 themselves who had just passed over from Judaism or heathendom, that 
 God was in the Church; (2) for the propagation of Christianity in the 
 world; (3) for the edification of the Church. Now that we have the 
 whole <I>written</I> New Testament (which they had not) and 
 Christianity established as the result of the miracles, we need no 
 further miracle to attest the truth.  So the pillar of cloud which 
 guided the Israelites was withdrawn when they were sufficiently assured 
 of the Divine Presence, the manifestation of God's glory being 
 thenceforward enclosed in the Most Holy Place [A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>RCHBISHOP</FONT> W<FONT SIZE=-1>HATELY</FONT>]. Paul sets forth 
 in order: (1). The unity of the body

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:1-27">1Co 12:1-27</A>).

 three several <I>genera: allo</I> marks the species, <I>hetero</I> the 
 <I>genera</I> (compare <I>Greek,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:39-41">1Co 15:39-41</A>).

 I. Gifts of intellect, namely, (1) wisdom; (2) knowledge. II. Gifts 
 dependent on a special <I>faith,</I> namely, that of miracles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:20">Mt 17:20</A>):

 (1) healings; (2) workings of miracles; (3) prophecy of future events; 
 (4) discerning of spirits, or the divinely given faculty of 
 distinguishing between those really inspired, and those who pretended 
 to inspiration. III. Gifts referring to the <I>tongues:</I> (1) diverse 
 kinds of tongues; (2) interpretation of tongues. The catalogue in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:28">1Co 12:28</A>

 is not meant strictly to harmonize with the one here, though there are 
 some particulars in which they correspond. The three genera are 
 summarily referred to by single instances of each in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:8">1Co 13:8</A>.

 The first genus refers more to believers; the second, to unbelievers.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>by .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by</B>--The first in 
 <I>Greek</I> is, "By means of," or "through the operation of"; the
 second is, "according to" the disposing of (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:11">1Co 12:11</A>);

 the third is, "in," that is, <I>under the influence of</I> (so the 
 <I>Greek,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:43,Lu+2:27">Mt 22:43;

 <I>wisdom,</I> namely, new revelations of the divine wisdom in 
 redemption, as contrasted with human philosophy

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>word of knowledge</B>--ready <I>utterance supernaturally</I>
 imparted of truths <FONT SIZE=-1>ALREADY REVEALED</FONT> (in this it is 
 distinguished from "the word of wisdom," which related to <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>NEW</FONT> revelations). Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:6">1Co 14:6</A>,

 where "revelation" (answering to "wisdom" here) is distinguished from
 "knowledge" [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENDERSON</FONT>]. <I>Wisdom</I> or 
 <I>revelation</I> belonged to the "prophets"; <I>knowledge,</I> to the 
 "teachers." <I>Wisdom</I> penetrates deeper than <I>knowledge. 
 Knowledge</I> relates to things that are to be done. <I>Wisdom,</I> to 
 things eternal: hence, <I>wisdom</I> is not, like <I>knowledge,</I> 
 said to "pass away"

 <B>9. faith</B>--not of doctrines, but of miracles: confidence in God, by
 the impulse of His Spirit, that He would enable them to perform any
 required miracle (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:2,Mk+11:23,Jam+5:15">1Co 13:2;
 Mr 11:23;
 Jas 5:15</A>).

 Its nature, or principle, is the same as that of saving faith, namely,
 reliance on God; the producing cause, also, in the same,' namely, a 
 power altogether supernatural

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:19,20">Eph 1:19, 20</A>).

 But the objects of faith differ respectively. Hence, we see, saving 
 faith does not save by its instrinsic merit, but by the merits of Him 
 who is the object of it.

 <B>healing</B>--<I>Greek</I> plural, "healings"; referring to different kinds
 of disease which need different kinds of healing

 <B>10. working of miracles</B>--As "healings" are miracles, those here
 meant must refer to miracles of special and extraordinary
 <FONT SIZE=-1>POWER</FONT> (so the
 <I>Greek</I> for "miracles" means); for example, healings might be effected
 by human skill in course of time; but the raising of the dead, the
 infliction of death by a word, the innocuous use of poisons, &c., are
 <I>miracles of special power.</I> Compare

 but, as its position between "miracles" and a "discerning of spirits"
 implies, <I>the inspired disclosure of the future</I>

 Eph 3:5; 4:11</A>). 

 As <I>prophecy</I> is part of the whole scheme of redemption, an
 inspired insight into the obscurer parts of the existing Scriptures, 
 was the necessary preparation for the miraculous foresight of the 
 future.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>discerning of spirits</B>--discerning between the operation of God's
 Spirit, and the evil spirit, or unaided human spirit

 <B>12, 13.</B> Unity, not unvarying uniformity, is the law of God in the
 world of grace, as in that of nature. As the many members of the body
 compose an organic whole and none can be dispensed with as needless, so
 those variously gifted by the Spirit, compose a spiritual organic whole,
 the body of Christ, into which all are baptized by the one Spirit.

 There is an indirect allusion to the Lord's Supper, as there is a 
 direct allusion to baptism in the beginning of the verse. So the 
 "Spirit, the water, and the blood"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:8">1Jo 5:8</A>),

 first person. A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> thinks there is an allusion 
 to a practice at Corinth of baptizing a living person <I>in behalf 
 of</I> a friend who died unbaptized; thus Paul, without giving the 
 least sanction to the practice, uses an <I>ad hominem</I> argument from 
 it against its practicers, some of whom, though using it, denied the 
 resurrection: "What account can they give of their practice; why are 
 they at the trouble of it, if the dead rise not?" [So Jesus used an 
 <I>ad hominem</I> argument,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:27">Mt 12:27</A>].

 But if so, it is strange there is no direct censure of it. Some 
 Marcionites adopted the practice at a later period, probably from 
 taking this passage, as A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> does; but, 
 generally, it was unknown in the Church. B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> 
 translates, "over (immediately upon) the dead," that is, who will be 
 gathered to the dead <I>immediately after</I> baptism. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:1">Job 17:1</A>,

 "the graves are ready for me." The price they get for their trouble is,

 Many in the ancient Church put off baptism till near death. This seems 
 the better view; though there may have been some rites of symbolical 
 baptism at Corinth, now unknown, perhaps grounded on Jesus' words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:22,23">Mt 20:22, 23</A>),

 do? Besides, the latter have mouldered into dust. <I>How</I> then can they
 rise again? If it be a different body, how can the personal identity be

 answers the question of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:35">1Co 15:35</A>,
 
 "How?" and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:37-41,43">1Co 15:37-41, 43</A>,

 the question, "With <I>what kind</I> of body?" He converts the very 
 objection (the death of the natural body) into an argument. Death, so 
 far from preventing <I>quickening,</I> is the necessary prelude and 
 prognostication of it, just as the seed "is not quickened" into a new 
 sprout with increased produce, "except it die" (except a dissolution of 
 its previous organization takes place). Christ by His death for us has 
 not given us a reprieve from death as to the life which we have from 
 Adam; nay, He permits the law to take its course on our fleshly nature; 
 but He brings from Himself new spiritual and heavenly life out of death

 [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>].
 There is not an identity of all the particles of the old and the new
 body. For the perpetual transmutation of matter is inconsistent with
 this. But there is a hidden germ which constitutes the identity of body
 amidst all outward changes: the outward accretions fall off in its
 development, while the germ remains the same. Every such germ ("seed,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:38">1Co 15:38</A>)

 "shall have its own body," and be instantly recognized, just as each 
 plant now is known from the seed that was sown (see on

 <A HREF="#1Co6_13">1Co 6:13</A>). 

 So Christ by the same image illustrated the truth that His death was 
 the necessary prelude of His putting on His glorified body, which is 
 the ground of the regeneration of the many who believe

 Progress is the law of the spiritual, as of the natural world. Death is

 So the beginning of the year was changed from autumn to spring when
 Israel was brought out of Egypt. Three annual feasts, all typical of 
 Christian truths, were directed to be kept on the first day of the 
 week: the feast of the wave offering of the first sheaf, answering to 
 the Lord's resurrection; Pentecost, or the feast of weeks, typical of 
 the fruits of the resurrection in the Christian Church

 was directed to be kept as a holy sabbath

 The Christian Sabbath commemorates the respective works of the Three 
 Persons of the Triune God--creation, redemption (the resurrection), and 
 sanctification (on Pentecost the Holy Ghost being poured out). Jesus

 it is still more so now.

 and yet the passage here implies that Paul did not expect him to arrive

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:21,22">Ac 19:21, 22</A>

 clears up the difficulty: Timothy, when sent from Ephesus, where this 
 Epistle was written, did not proceed direct to Corinth, but <I>went 
 first to Macedonia;</I> thus though sent before the letter, he might 
 not reach Corinth till after it was received in that city. The 
 undesigned coincidence between the Epistle and the history, and the 
 clearing up of the meaning of the former (which does not mention the 
 journey to Macedonia at all) by the latter, is a sure mark of 
 genuineness [P<FONT SIZE=-1>ALEY</FONT>, <I>Hor&aelig;

 Corinth; for in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:22">Ac 19:22</A>

 only <I>Macedonia</I> is mentioned; but it does not follow that though 
 Macedonia was the immediate object of his mission, Corinth was not the 
 ultimate object.  The "<FONT SIZE=-1>IF</FONT> Timothy come," implies 
 uncertainty.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:1">2Co 1:1</A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:18">2Co 12:18</A>,

 speaking of <I>Titus</I> and others sent to Corinth, does not mention 
 Timothy, which it would have probably done, had one so closely 
 connected with the apostle as Timothy was, stayed as his delegate at 
 Corinth. The mission of Titus then took place, when it became uncertain 
 whether Timothy could go forward from Macedonia to Corinth, Paul being 
 anxious for <I>immediate</I> tidings of the state of the Corinthian 
 Church. A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> argues that if so, Paul's 
 adversaries would have charged him with fickleness in this case also

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:17">2Co 1:17</A>),

 as in the case of his own change of purpose. But Titus was sent 
 <I>directly</I> to Corinth, so as to arrive there before Timothy could 
 by the route through Macedonia. Titus' presence would thus make amends 
 for the disappointment as to the intended visit of Timothy and would 
 disarm adversaries of a charge in this respect

 He was a <I>young man,</I> younger probably than those usually employed 
 in the Christian missions; whence Paul apprehending lest he should, on 
 that account, be exposed to contempt, cautions him, "Let no man despise 
 thy youth" [P<FONT SIZE=-1>ALEY</FONT>, <I>Hor&aelig;

 "Peace" is the salutation of kindness and respect in the East; and so
 it stands for every blessing.  Perhaps here there is too a contrast 
 between "peace" and the "contentions" prevalent at Corinth

 <B>12. Apollos, I greatly desired .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to come unto you</B>--He says this
 lest they should suspect that he from jealousy prevented Apollos' coming
 to them; perhaps they had expressly requested Apollos to be sent to
 them. Apollos was not at Ephesus when Paul wrote (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:19,1Co+1:1">1Co 16:19,
 and 1Co 1:1</A>).

 Probably Apollos' unwillingness to go to Corinth at this time was
 because, being aware of the undue admiration of his rhetorical style
 which led astray many at Corinth, he did not wish to sanction it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:12,3:4">1Co 1:12; 3:4</A>).

 Paul's noble freedom from all selfish jealousy led him to urge Apollos
 to go; and, on the other hand, Apollos, having heard of the abuse of 
 his name at Corinth to party purposes, perseveringly refused to go. 
 Paul, of course, could not state in his letter particularly these 
 reasons in the existing state of division prevalent there. He calls 
 Apollos "brother" to mark the unity that was between the two.

 Originally driven out of Italy by Claudius, they had come to Corinth
 (whence their salutation of the Corinthians is appropriate here), and 
 then had removed with Paul from Corinth to Ephesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:2,18,19,26">Ac 18:2, 18, 19, 26</A>);

 here, as at Rome subsequently, they set up a Church (or assembly of 
 believers) at their house

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:3,5">Ro 16:3, 5</A>).

 A pattern to Christian husbands and wives.  Their Christian 
 self-devoting love appears wherever they were

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:3,4">Ro 16:3, 4</A>).

 Even the gifted Apollos, so highly admired at Corinth, owed much of
 his knowledge to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:24-26">Ac 18:24-26</A>).
 
 In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:20">1Co 16:20</A>,

 "All the brethren" (that is, the whole Church) seem to be distinguished 
 from "the church that is in their house," which was but a partial and 
 private assembly out of the general Church at Corinth. N<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT> thinks

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:23">Ro 16:23</A>

 refers to "<I>the whole Church</I>" <I>meeting at the house of 
 Gaius</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:15">Col 4:15</A>).

 "Synagogue" implies an assembly in general, without reference to the 
 character or motives of its members. "Church," like the <I>Hebrew 
 Kahal,</I> implies an assembly <I>legally</I> convened; as, for 
 instance, the Jews met as a body politic to receive the law (hence 
 Stephen calls it "the <I>Church</I> in the wilderness,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:38">Ac 7:38</A>),

 and having a legal bond of union.  Christ's followers when dispersed 
 from one another cease to be a <I>congregation</I> (synagogue), but 
 still are a <I>Church,</I> having the common bond of union to the same 
 Head by the same faith and hope [V<FONT SIZE=-1>ITRINGA</FONT>, 
 <I>Synagogue and Temple</I>]. From this we may explain Paul's entering 
 "<I>into every house</I> and haling men and women": he would in 
 searching for Christians go to their several "houses"' of prayer.

 source of every good [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>].
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> explains, "in a Christian
 manner," as mindful of your common Lord. "In the Lord" seems to me to
 refer to <I>their union together in Christ,</I> their prayers for one
 another's good being in virtue of that union.</P>

 <B>the Lord</B>--who ought to be "loved" above Paul, Apollos, and all 
 other teachers. Love to one another is to be in connection with love to 
 Him above all. I<FONT SIZE=-1>GNATIUS</FONT> [<I>Epistle to the
 Romans,</I> 7] writes of Christ, "My love, has been crucified" (compare

 <I>love,</I> and therefore are altogether in harmony with the profession of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:5">1Co 16:5</A>),

 because the deputies of the Corinthians had accompanied Paul thither.  
 From Ephesus there was a road to Corinth above Philippi.</P>
