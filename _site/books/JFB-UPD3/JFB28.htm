 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> first of the twelve minor prophets in the order of the canon
 (called "minor," not as less in point of inspired authority, but simply
 in point of size). The twelve are first mentioned by Jesus, the son of
 Sirach 
 
 (<U>Ecclesiasticus 49:10</U>). 
 
 St. Stephen, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:42">Ac 7:42</A>
 
 (in referring to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:27">Am 5:27</A>),

 quotes them as forming one collective body of writings, "the book of 
 the prophets." So J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> and M<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ELITO</FONT>, the first Greek father who has left us a 
 catalogue of these books. The collection of the sacred books is by 
 Jewish tradition attributed to the great synagogue of learned scribes 
 formed by Ezra. Many think Nehemiah completed this collection by adding 
 to the books already in the canon those of his own times. Malachi, the 
 last in the series, probably aided him in determining with infallible 
 authority what books were entitled to be ranked in the inspired canon. 
 The chronological order differs from the canonical. Joel, about 810 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>; Jonah, about 810 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>,
 or, as others, <I>first,</I> 862 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>; Amos, about
 790 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>; Hosea, about 784 <FONT
 SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> Hosea, the contemporary of Isaiah, Micah, and Amos,
 seems to have entered on his prophetical office in the last years of 
 Jeroboam (contemporary in part with Uzziah), and to have ended it in 
 the beginning of Hezekiah's reign, 722 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, that
 is, about <I>sixty</I> years in all, from 784 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>
 to 722 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> The prophets, however, were not
 uninterruptedly engaged in prophesying. Considerable intervals elapsed, 
 though their office as divinely commissioned public teachers was never 
 wholly laid aside. The Book of Hosea which we have constitutes only 
 that portion of his public teachings which the Holy Spirit saw fit to 
 preserve for the benefit of the Church. The cause of his being placed 
 first of the twelve was, probably, the length, the vivid earnestness, 
 and patriotism of his prophecies, as well as their closer resemblance 
 to those of the greater prophets. His style is abrupt, sententious, and 
 unrounded; the connecting particles are few; there are changes of 
 person, and anomalies of gender, number, and construction. His name 
 means <I>Salvation.</I> He was son of Beeri, of the tribe of Issachar, 
 born in Beth-shemesh [J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>]. His mention, in the 
 inscription, of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, is 
 no proof that he belonged to Judah: for the prophets in Israel regarded 
 its separation from Judah, <I>civil</I> as well as religious, as an 
 apostasy from God, who promised the dominion of the theocracy to the 
 line of David. Hence Elijah in Israel took <I>twelve</I> stones to 
 represent Judah, as well as Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:31">1Ki 18:31</A>).

 Hence Hosea dates from Judah's kings, as well as from Jeroboam of 
 Israel, though he belonged to Israel, with whose sins and fate his book 
 is chiefly occupied. He, however, makes incidental references to Judah. 
 His first prophecy foretells the overthrow of Jehu's house, fulfilled 
 on the death of Jeroboam, Jehu's great-grandson

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:12">2Ki 15:12</A>),

 in Zachariah, Jeroboam's son, the fourth and last from Jehu, conspired 
 against by Shallum. This first prediction was doubtless in Jeroboam's 
 life, as Zachariah, his son, was only suffered to reign six months; 
 thus the inscription is verified that "the word of the Lord came unto 
 him in the days of Jeroboam"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:1">Ho 1:1</A>).
 
 Again, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:14">Ho 10:14</A>,

 Shalmaneser's expedition against Israel is alluded to <I>as past,</I> 
 that is, the first inroad against King Hoshea, who began to reign in 
 the twelfth year of Ahaz; so that as Ahaz' whole reign was sixteen 
 years, the prophecy seems to have been given about the beginning of 
 Hezekiah's reign. Thus the inscription is confirmed that the exercise 
 of his prophetical functions was of such a protracted duration.</P>

 forty-one years' reign. From his time forth <I>all</I> Israel's kings

 As Israel was most flourishing externally under Jeroboam II, who 
 recovered the possessions seized on by Syria, Hosea's prophecy of its 
 downfall at that time was the more striking as it could not have been 
 foreseen by mere human sagacity. Jonah the prophet had promised success 
 to Jeroboam II from God, not for the king's merit, but from God's mercy 
 to Israel; so the coast of Israel was restored by Jeroboam II from the 
 entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain

 &c. Besides the loathsomeness of such a marriage, if an external act,
 it would require years for the birth of three children, which would 
 weaken the symbol (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+4:4">Eze 4:4</A>).

 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENDERSON</FONT> objects that there is no hint of the 
 transaction being fictitious: Gomer fell into lewdness <I>after</I> her 
 union with Hosea, not before; for thus only she was a fit symbol of 
 Israel, who lapsed into spiritual whoredom <I>after</I> the marriage 
 contract with God on Sinai, and made even before at the call of the 
 patriarchs of Israel.  Gomer is called "a wife of whoredoms," 
 anticipatively.

 <B>children of whoredoms</B>--The kingdom collectively is viewed as a

 not the prophet's own, but born of adultery, and presented to him as 
 his [K<FONT SIZE=-1>ITTO</FONT>, <I>Biblical Cyclop&aelig;dia</I>]. 
 Rather, "children of whoredoms" means that the children, like their 
 mother, fell into spiritual fornication.  Compare "bare <I>him</I> a

 until they were incurable [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>].  But as it is

 The intervals between the marriage and the successive births of the 
 three children, imply that three successive generations are intended. 
 Jezreel, the first child, represents the dynasty of Jeroboam I and his 
 successors, ending with Jehu's shedding the blood of Jeroboam's line in 
 Jezreel; it was there that Jezebel was slain, in vengeance for Naboth's 
 blood shed in the same Jezreel

 The scenes of Jezreel were to be enacted over again on Jehu's

 pitied"), the second child, is a <I>daughter,</I> representing the 
 effeminate period which followed the overthrow of the first dynasty, 
 when Israel was at once abject and impious. Lo-Ammi ("not my people"),

 Israel's perversity and consequent punishment, is made a reason why God
 should at last have mercy on her. As the "therefore"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:9">Ho 2:9</A>)

 expresses Israel's punishment as the <I>consequence</I> of Israel's
 guilt, so "therefore" here, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:6">Ho 2:6</A>,
 
 expresses, that when that punishment has effected its designed end, the
 hedging up her way with thorns so that she returns to God, her first
 love, the <I>consequence</I> in God's wondrous grace is, He "speaks
 comfortably" (literally, "speaks to her heart"; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:8,Ru+2:13">Jud 19:8;
 Ru 2:13</A>). 

 So obstinate is she that God has to "allure her," that is, so to temper
 judgment with unlooked-for grace as to <I>win</I> her to His ways. For 
 this purpose it was necessary to "bring her into the wilderness" (that 
 is, into temporal want and trials) first, to make her sin hateful to 
 her by its bitter fruits, and God's subsequent grace the more precious 
 to her by the contrast of the "wilderness." J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> 
 makes the "bringing into the wilderness" to be rather a <I>deliverance 
 from her enemies,</I> just as ancient Israel was brought into the 
 wilderness from the bondage of Egypt; to this the phrase here alludes 
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:15">Ho 2:15</A>).

 The wilderness sojourn, however, is not literal, but moral: while still 
 in the land of their enemies <I>locally,</I> by the discipline of the 
 trial rendering the word of God sweet to them, they are to be brought 
 <I>morally</I> into the wilderness state, that is, into a state of 
 preparedness for returning to their temporal and spiritual privileges 
 in their own land; just as the literal wilderness prepared their 
 fathers for Canaan: thus the bringing of them into the <I>wilderness 
 state</I> is <I>virtually</I> a deliverance from their enemies.</P>

 <B>Achor</B>--that is, "trouble." As formerly Israel, after their tedious

 that <I>trouble</I> was presently turned into <I>joy</I> at the great victory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:1-8:28">Jos 7:1-8:28</A>);

 no idol, or false god, no ephod, or teraphim. Exactly describing their
 state for the last nineteen centuries, separate from idols, yet without
 any legal sacrifice to Jehovah, whom they profess to worship, and
 without being acknowledged by Him as His Church. So
 K<FONT SIZE=-1>IMCHI</FONT>, a Jew,
 explains it. The ephod was worn by the high priest above the tunic and
 robe. It consisted of two finely wrought pieces which hung down, the one
 in front over the breast, the other on the back, to the middle of the
 thigh; joined on the shoulders by golden clasps set in onyx stones with
 the names of the twelve tribes, and fastened round the waist by a girdle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+28:6-12">Ex 28:6-12</A>).

 In the breast were the Urim and Thummim by which God gave responses to
 the Hebrews. The latter was one of the five things which the second 
 temple lacked, and which the first had. It, as representing the 
 divinely constituted priesthood, is opposed to the idolatrous 
 "teraphim," as "sacrifice" (to Jehovah) is to "an (idolatrous) image."

 "<I>From</I> the time that he (Israel) was <I>in</I> Egypt, I called him My
 son," which the parallelism proves. So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:9,13:4">Ho 12:9

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:22">Ex 4:22</A>

 his Egyptian sojourn

 have "called," Israel from Egypt.

 therefore, in quoting this prophecy (typically and primarily referring 
 to Israel, antitypically and fully to Messiah), applies it to Jesus' 
 sojourn <I>in</I> Egypt, not His return <I>from</I> it.  Even from His 
 infancy, partly spent in Egypt, God called Him His son.  God included 
 Messiah, and Israel for Messiah's sake, in one common love, and 
 therefore in one common prophecy. Messiah's people and Himself are one, 
 as the Head and the body.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:3">Isa 49:3</A>

 caused the infant Jesus, and Israel in its national infancy (compare

 relation to the Church, this verse is expressed in language alluding to 
 Messiah's (who is the ideal Israel) grand victory over the grave and
