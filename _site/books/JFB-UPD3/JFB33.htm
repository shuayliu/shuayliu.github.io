 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ICAH</FONT> was a native of Moresheth, not the same as
 Mareshah in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:15">Mic 1:15</A>,

 but the town called Moresheth-gath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:14">Mic 1:14</A>),

 which lay near Eleutheropolis, west of Jerusalem, on the border of the 
 Philistine country; so called to distinguish it from Moresheth of 
 Judah. His full name is <I>Micaiah</I> (not the Micaiah mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:8">1Ki 22:8</A>,

 the son of Imlah), signifying, <I>Who is like Jehovah?</I> The time of 
 his prophesying is stated in the introduction to be in the reigns of 
 Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, that is, between 757 and 699

 quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:12">Mic 3:12</A>,

 as delivered in the reign of Hezekiah. He was thus a contemporary of 
 Isaiah and Hosea. The idolatries practised in the reign of Ahaz accord 
 with Micah's denunciations of such gross evils, and confirm the truth 
 of the time assigned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:1">Mic 1:1</A>.

 His prophecies are partly against Israel (Samaria), partly against 
 Judah. As Samaria, Israel's metropolis, was taken first, and Jerusalem, 
 the capital of Judah subsequently, in the introductory heading,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+1:1">Mic 1:1</A>,

 <I>Samaria</I> is put first, then <I>Jerusalem.</I> He prophesies the 
 capture of both; the Jews' captivity and restoration; and the coming and
 reign of Messiah. His style is full, round, and perspicuous; his 
 diction pure, and his parallelisms regular.  His description of Jehovah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:18,19">Mic 7:18, 19</A>)

 is not surpassed by any elsewhere in Scripture. The similarity between 
 Isaiah and Micah in some passages (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:1-3,Isa+2:2-4">Mic 4:1-3,
 with Isa 2:2-4</A>)

 is to be accounted for by their being contemporaries, acquainted with
 each other's inspired writings, and having the same subjects for their 
 theme. H<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGSTENBERG</FONT> maintains that the passage in 
 Micah is the original. Isaiah was somewhat the older, being a prophet 
 in the reign of Uzziah, Jotham's predecessor, whereas Micah began his 
 prophecies under Jotham.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The book consists of two parts: (1) the first through fifth
 chapters; (2) the sixth and seventh chapters, a dialogue or
 contestation between Jehovah and His people, in which He reproaches
 them with their unnatural and ungrateful conduct, and threatens
 judgment for their corruptions, but consoles them with the promise of
 restoration from captivity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Micah stands sixth of the minor prophets in the <I>Hebrew</I> canon, but
 third in the <I>Septuagint.</I></P>

 <B>2. all that therein is</B>--<I>Hebrew,</I> "whatever fills it." 
 Micaiah, son of Imlah, our prophet's namesake, begins his prophecy
 similarly, "Hearken, O people, every one of you." Micah designedly uses 
 the same preface, implying that his ministrations are a continuation of 
 his predecessor's of the same name. Both probably had before their
 mind Moses' similar attestation of heaven and earth in a like case

 terrors which attend Jehovah's coming in judgment (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:5">Jud 5:5</A>).

 Neither men of high degree, as the mountains, nor men of low degree, as
 the valleys, can secure themselves or their land from the judgments of
 God.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:1-3">Isa 64:1-3</A>).

 The third clause, "as wax," &c., answers to the first in the
 parallelism, "the mountains shall be molten"; the fourth, "as the 
 waters," &c., to the second, "the valleys shall be cleft." As wax melts
 by fire, so the mountains before God, at His approach; and as waters 
 poured down a steep cannot stand but are diffused abroad, so the 
 valleys shall be cleft before Jehovah.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and what are the high places of Judah?</B>--What city is the cause of the
 idolatries on the high places of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem (compare

 Such a heap of stones and rubbish as is gathered out of fields, to 
 clear them

 Palestine is of a soil abounding in stones, which are gathered out
 before the vines are planted

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>as plantings of a vineyard</B>--as a place where vines are planted.
 Vineyards were cultivated on the sides of hills exposed to the sun. The
 hill on which Samaria was built by Omri, had been, doubtless, planted
 with vines originally; now it is to be reduced again to its original
 state 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:24">1Ki 16:24</A>).

 beneath. A graphic picture of the present appearance of the ruins,
 which is as though "the buildings of the ancient city had been thrown
 down from the brow of the hill"
 [<I>Scottish Mission of Inquiry,</I> pp. 293,294].

 foundations

 her idols as the "rewards" or "hire" for worshipping them

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the
 hire of an harlot</B>--Israel gathered (made for herself) her idols from
 the gold and silver received from false gods, as she thought, the "hire"
 of her worshipping them; and they shall again become what they had been
 before, the hire of spiritual harlotry, that is, the prosperity of the
 foe, who also being worshippers of idols will ascribe the acquisition to
 their idols [M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT>].
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT> explains it,
 <I>The offerings sent to Israel's temple by the Assyrians,</I> whose idolatry
 Israel adopted, shall go back to the Assyrians, her teachers in
 idolatry, as the hire or <I>fee for having taught it.</I> The image of a
 <I>harlot's hire</I> for the supposed temporal reward of spiritual
 fornication, is more common in Scripture

 judgment affects himself, in order that he might affect the minds of his
 countrymen similarly.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>stripped</B>--that is, <I>of shoes,</I> or <I>sandals,</I> as the <I>Septuagint</I> translates. Otherwise "naked" would be a tautology.

 <B>naked</B>--"Naked" means <I>divested of the upper garment</I>

 "Naked and barefoot," the sign of mourning

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>it is come</B>--the wound, or impending calamity (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:28">Isa 10:28</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he is come .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even to Jerusalem</B>--The evil is no longer limited to
 Israel. The prophet foresees Sennacherib coming even "to the gate" of
 the principal city. The use of "it" and "he" is appropriately distinct.
 "It," the calamity, "came unto" Judah, many of the inhabitants of which
 suffered, but did not reach the citizens of Jerusalem, "the gate" of
 which the foe ("he") "came unto," but did not enter

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10. Declare ye it not at Gath</B>--on the borders of Judea, one of the
 five cities of the Philistines, who would exult at the calamity of the
 Hebrews 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:20">2Sa 1:20</A>).

 Gratify not those who exult over the falls of the Israel of God.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>weep ye not at all</B>--Do not betray your inward sorrow by outward
 weeping, within the cognizance of the enemy, lest they should exult at
 it. R<FONT SIZE=-1>ELAND</FONT> translates, "Weep not <I>in Acco,</I>" that is, Ptolemais, now
 St. Jean d'Acre, near the foot of Mount Carmel; allotted to Asher, but
 never occupied by that tribe 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:31">Jud 1:31</A>);

 Acco's inhabitants would, therefore, like Gath's, rejoice at Israel's
 disaster. Thus the parallelism is best carried out in all the three 
 clauses of the verse, and there is a similar play on sounds in each, in 
 the <I>Hebrew Gath,</I> resembling in sound the <I>Hebrew</I> for 
 "declare"; <I>Acco,</I> resembling the <I>Hebrew</I> for "weep"; and 
 <I>Aphrah,</I> meaning "dust." While the Hebrews were not to expose 
 their misery to foreigners, they ought to bewail it in their own 
 cities, for example, Aphrah or Ophrah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:23,1Sa+13:17">Jos 18:23;

 <B>inhabitant of Saphir</B>--a village amidst the hills of Judah, between
 Eleutheropolis and Ascalon, called so, from the <I>Hebrew</I> word for
 "beauty." Though thy name be "beauty," which heretofore was thy
 characteristic, thou shalt have thy "shame" made "naked." This city
 shall be dismantled of its walls, which are the garments, as it were, of
 cities; its citizens also shall be hurried into captivity, with persons
 exposed

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth</B>--Its inhabitants did not
 come forth to console the people of Beth-ezel in their mourning, because
 the calamity was universal; none was exempt from it (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:25">Jer 6:25</A>).
 
 "Zaanan" is the same as Zenan, in Judah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:37">Jos 15:37</A>),

 meaning the "place of flocks." The form of the name used is made like 
 the <I>Hebrew</I> for "came forth." Though in name seeming to imply 
 that thou dost <I>come forth,</I> thou "camest not forth."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Beth-ezel</B>--perhaps Azal 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:5">Zec 14:5</A>),

 near Jerusalem. It means a "house on the side," or "near." Though <I>so 
 near,</I> as its name implies, to Zaanan, Beth-ezel received no succor 
 or sympathy from Zaanan.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he shall receive of you his standing</B>--"he," that is, the foe; "his
 standing," that is, his sustenance
 [P<FONT SIZE=-1>ISCATOR</FONT>]. Or, "he shall be caused a
 delay by you, Zaanan." He shall be brought to a stand for a time in
 besieging you; hence it is said just before, "Zaanan came not forth,"
 that is, shut herself up within her walls to withstand a siege. But it
 was only for a time. She, too, fell like Beth-ezel before her
 [V<FONT SIZE=-1>ATABLUS</FONT>].
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>AURER</FONT> construes thus: "The inhabitant of Zaanan came not
 forth; the mourning of Beth-ezel <I>takes away from</I> you her shelter."
 Though Beth-ezel be <I>at your side</I> (that is, near), according to her
 name, yet as she also mourns under the oppression of the foe, she cannot
 give you shelter, or be <I>at your side</I> as a helper (as her name might
 lead you to expect), if you come forth and be intercepted by him from
 returning to Zaanan.</P>

 [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>].
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT> translates, "<I>is grieved</I> for her goods," "taken
 away" from her. This accords with the meaning of Maroth, "bitterness,"
 to which allusion is made in "is grieved." But the antithesis favors
 <I>English Version,</I> "waited carefully (that is, anxiously) for

 renunciation to Moresheth-gath," that is, thou shalt renounce all claim
 to it, being compelled to yield it up to the foe. "Thou," that is,
 Judah. "Israel" in this verse is used for the kingdom of <I>Judah,</I> which
 was the chief representative of the whole nation of Israel.
 Moresheth-gath is so called because it had fallen for a time under the

 he, by an independent testimony of the Spirit, confirms the prophet, 
 Little in <I>worldly</I> importance, thou art not least (that is, far

 princes of Judah, in the spiritual significance of being the birthplace 
 of Messiah

 several heads or "princes"; hence in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:6">Mt 2:6</A>

 it is quoted "princes," substantially the same as in Micah, and
 authoritatively explained in Matthew. It is not so much this thousand 
 that is preferred to the other thousands of Judah, but the Governor or 
 Chief Prince out of it, who is preferred to the governors of all the 
 other thousands. It is called a "town" (rather in the <I>Greek,</I> 
 "village"),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:42">Joh 7:42</A>;

 though scarcely containing a thousand inhabitants, it is ranked among 
 the "thousands" or larger divisions of the tribe, because of its being 
 the cradle of David's line, and of the Divine Son of David. Moses 
 divided the people into thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, with 
 their respective "rulers"

 <B>goings forth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from everlasting</B>--The plain antithesis of this
 clause, to "come forth out of thee" (<I>from Beth-lehem</I>), shows that
 the eternal generation of the Son is meant. The terms convey the
 strongest assertion of infinite duration of which the <I>Hebrew</I> language is capable (compare

 Pr 8:22, 23;

 Messiah's generation as man coming forth unto God to do His will on
 earth is <I>from Beth-lehem;</I> but as Son of God, His goings forth 
 are <I>from everlasting.</I> The promise of the Redeemer at first was 
 vaguely general

 Deliverer should come, namely, the seed of Abraham, the Jews

 then the particular tribe, Judah

 up," though Messiah has been "brought forth" eighteen and a half 
 centuries ago. But the Church's throes are included, which are only to
 be ended when Christ, having been preached for a witness to all

 The mention of "Shittim" agrees with this: as it was the scene of

 But the clause, "from Shittim," alone applies to Balaam. "Remember" 
 God's kindnesses "from Shittim," the scene of Balaam's wicked counsel 
 taking effect in Israel's sin, whereby Israel merited utter destruction 
 but for God's sparing mercy, "to Gilgal," the place of Israel's first

 To have this "good" first "showed," or <I>revealed</I> by the Spirit,
 is the only basis for the superstructure of the moral requirements 
 which follow.  Thus the way was prepared for the Gospel. The banishment

 Messiah.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:5">Mic 6:5</A>,

 where also Balaam is referred to). "Lo, the people shall dwell
 <I>alone</I>"

 To "feed in the wood in Carmel," is to feed in the rich pastures among 
 its woods. To "sleep in the woods," is the image of <I>most perfect 
 security</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:25">Eze 34:25</A>).

 So that the Jews' "security," as well as their <I>distinct 
 nationality,</I> is here foretold. Also

 Parallel to this passage is

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:19">Jer 50:19</A>.

 Bashan and Gilead, east of Jordan, were chosen by Reuben, Gad, and half 
 Manasseh, as abounding in pastures suited for their many cattle

 the person is changed from the first to the third, "us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:14">Mic 7:14</A>,

 assuring him, that as He delivered His people from Egypt by miraculous

 They shall be struck dumb at Israel's marvellous deliverance, and no
 longer boast that God's people is destroyed.

 shall be said [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>]. Once they had eagerly drunk in all rumors as so
 many messages of victories; but then they shall be afraid of hearing
 them, because they continually fear new disasters, when they see the God
 of Israel to be so powerful
 [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>]. They shall close their ears so as
 not to be compelled to hear of Israel's successes.</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:45">Ps 18:45</A>),

 to give themselves up to the conquerors. More literally, "they shall
 tremble from," that is, tremblingly come forth from their coverts.

 <B>like worms</B>--reptiles or crawlers

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they shall be afraid of the Lord</B>--or, they shall <I>in fear turn 
 with haste</I> to the Lord. Thus the antithesis is brought out. They 
 shall tremble forth <I>from</I> their holes: they shall in trepidation 
 turn <I>to</I> the Lord for salvation (compare <I>Note,</I> see on

 <B>18.</B> Grateful at such unlooked-for grace being promised to Israel,
 Micah breaks forth into praises of Jehovah.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>passeth by the transgression</B>--not conniving at it, but forgiving it;
 leaving it unpunished, as a traveller <I>passes by</I> what he chooses not
 to look into

 Contrast

 delights in loving-kindness, and is averse from wrath.</P>

 <B>subdue our iniquities</B>--literally, "tread under foot," as being hostile
 and deadly to us. Without subjugation of our bad propensities, even
 pardon could not give us peace. When God takes away the guilt of sin
 that it may not condemn us, He takes away also the power of sin that it
 may not rule us.

 <B>cast .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. into .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. depths of the sea</B>--never to rise again to view,

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to Jacob .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Abraham</B>--Thou shalt make good to their posterity the
 promise made to the patriarchs. God's promises are called "mercy,"
 because they flow slowly from grace; "truth," because they will be
 surely performed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:9,10">Ps 105:9, 10</A>).

 The promise to Abraham is in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:2">Ge 12:2</A>;
 
 to Isaac, in

 to Jacob, in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:13">Ge 28:13</A>.

 This unchangeable promise implied an engagement that the seed of the 
 patriarchs should never perish, and should be restored to their 
 inheritance as often as they turned wholly to God
