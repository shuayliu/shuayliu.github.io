 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> states it as the opinion of those before 
 him that this was among <I>the universally acknowledged</I> Epistles. 
 The <I>Peschito Syriac Version</I> contains it. The fragment of the 
 canon called M<FONT SIZE=-1>URATORI'S</FONT> omits it. Excepting this, 
 and the Paulician heretics, who rejected it, all ancient testimony is 
 on its side. The <I>internal evidence</I> is equally strong. The author 
 calls himself the apostle Peter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1">1Pe 1:1</A>,

 and "a witness of Christ's sufferings," and an "elder,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:1">1Pe 5:1</A>.

 The energy of the style harmonizes with the warmth of Peter's
 character; and, as E<FONT SIZE=-1>RASMUS</FONT> says, this Epistle is 
 full of apostolic dignity and authority and is worthy of the leader 
 among the apostles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 P<FONT SIZE=-1>ETER'S PERSONAL HISTORY</FONT>.--Simon, Or Simeon, was a 
 native of Bethsaida on the Sea of Galilee, son of Jonas or John. With 
 his father and his brother Andrew he carried on trade as a fisherman at 
 Capernaum, his subsequent place of abode. He was a married man, and 
 tradition represents his wife's name as <I>Concordia</I> or 
 <I>Perpetua.</I> 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT> says
 that she suffered martyrdom, her husband encouraging her to be faithful 
 unto death, "Remember, dear, our Lord." His wife's mother was restored 
 from a fever by Christ. He was brought to Jesus by his brother Andrew, 
 who had been a disciple of John the Baptist, but was pointed to the 
 Saviour as "the Lamb of God" by his master

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:29">Joh 1:29</A>).

 Jesus, on first beholding him, gave him the name by which chiefly he is 
 known, indicative of his subsequent character and work in the Church, 
 "Peter" (<I>Greek</I>) or "Cephas" (<I>Aramaic</I>), <I>a stone</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:18">Mt 4:18</A>).

 He did not join our Lord finally until a subsequent period. The leading 
 incidents in his apostolic life are well known: his walking on the 
 troubled waters to meet Jesus, but sinking through doubting

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:30">Mt 14:30</A>);

 his bold and clear acknowledgment of the divine person and office of 
 Jesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:16,Mk+8:29,Joh+11:27">Mt 16:16;
 Mr 8:29; 
 Joh 11:27</A>),

 notwithstanding the difficulties in the way of such belief, whence he
 was then also designated as <I>the stone,</I> or <I>rock</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:18">Mt 16:18</A>);

 but his rebuke of his Lord when announcing what was so unpalatable to 
 carnal prejudices, Christ's coming passion and death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:22">Mt 16:22</A>);

 his passing from one extreme to the opposite, in reference to Christ's 
 offer to wash his feet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:8,9">Joh 13:8, 9</A>);

 his self-confident assertion that <I>he</I> would never forsake his 
 Lord, whatever others might do

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:33">Mt 26:33</A>),

 followed by his base denial of Christ thrice with curses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:75">Mt 26:75</A>);

 his deep penitence; Christ's full forgiveness and prophecy of his 
 faithfulness unto death, after he had received from him a profession of 
 "love" as often repeated as his previous denial

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:15-17">Joh 21:15-17</A>).

 These incidents illustrate his character as zealous, pious, and 
 ardently attached to the Lord, but at the same time impulsive in 
 feeling, rather than calmly and continuously steadfast.  Prompt in 
 action and ready to avow his convictions boldly, he was hasty in 
 judgment, precipitate, and too self-confident in the assertion of his 
 own steadfastness; the result was that, though he abounded in animal 
 courage, his moral courage was too easily overcome by fear of man's 
 opinion. A wonderful change was wrought in him by his restoration after 
 his fall, through the grace of his risen Lord. His zeal and ardor 
 became sanctified, being chastened by a spirit of unaffected humility. 
 His love to the Lord was, if possible, increased, while his mode of 
 manifesting it now was in doing and suffering for His name, rather than 
 in loud protestations. Thus, when imprisoned and tried before the 
 Sanhedrim for preaching Christ, he boldly avowed his determination to 
 continue to do so. He is well called "the mouth of the apostles." His 
 faithfulness led to his apprehension by Herod Agrippa, with a view to 
 his execution, from which, however, he was delivered by the angel of 
 the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the ascension he took the lead in the Church; and on the descent 
 of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, he exercised the designed power of 
 "the keys" of Christ's kingdom, by opening the door of the Church, in 
 preaching, for the admission of thousands of Israelites; and still more 
 so in opening (in obedience to a special revelation) an entrance to the 
 "devout" (that is, Jewish proselyte from heathendom) <I>Gentile,</I> 
 Cornelius: the forerunner of the harvest gathered in from 
 <I>idolatrous</I> Gentiles at Antioch. This explains in what sense 
 Christ used as to him the words, "Upon this rock I will build my
 Church"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:18">Mt 16:18</A>),

 namely, on the preaching of Christ, the true "Rock," by connection with
 whom only he was given the designation: a title shared in common on the 
 same grounds by the rest of the apostles, as the first founders of the 
 Church on Christ, "the chief corner-stone"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:20">Eph 2:20</A>).

 A name is often given in <I>Hebrew,</I> not that the person is actually 
 the thing itself, but has some special relation to it; as Elijah means 
 <I>Mighty Jehovah,</I> so Simon is called Peter "the rock," not that he 
 is so, save by connection with Jesus, the only true Rock

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:16,1Co+3:11">Isa 28:16;
 1Co 3:11</A>).

 As subsequently he identified himself with "Satan," and is therefore
 <I>called so</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:23">Mt 16:23</A>),

 in the same way, by his clear confession of Christ, the Rock, he became 
 identified with Him, and is accordingly so called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:18">Mt 16:18</A>).

 It is certain that there is no instance on record of Peter's having 
 ever claimed or exercised supremacy; on the contrary, he is represented 
 as <I>sent</I> by the apostles at Jerusalem to confirm the Samaritans 
 baptized by Philip the deacon; again at the council of Jerusalem, not 
 he, but James the president, or leading bishop in the Church of that 
 city, pronounced the authoritative decision:

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:19">Ac 15:19</A>,

 "My <I>sentence</I> is," &c. A kind of primacy, doubtless (though 
 certainly not supremacy), was given him on the ground of his age, and 
 prominent earnestness, and boldness in taking the lead on many 
 important occasions. Hence he is called "first" in enumerating the 
 apostles. Hence, too, arise the phrases, "Peter and the Eleven," "Peter 
 and the rest of the apostles"; and Paul, in going up to Jerusalem after 
 his conversion, went to see Peter in particular.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Once only he again betrayed the same spirit of vacillation through fear 
 of man's reproach which had caused his denial of his Lord. Though at 
 the Jerusalem council he advocated the exemption of Gentile converts 
 from the ceremonial observances of the law, yet he, after having 
 associated in closest intercourse with the Gentiles at Antioch, 
 withdrew from them, through dread of the prejudices of his Jewish 
 brethren who came from James, and timidly dissembled his conviction of 
 the religious equality of Jew and Gentile; for this Paul openly 
 withstood and rebuked him: a plain refutation of his alleged 
 <I>supremacy</I> and <I>infallibility</I> (except where specially 
 inspired, as in writing his Epistles). In all other cases he showed 
 himself to be, indeed, as Paul calls him, "a pillar"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:9">Ga 2:9</A>).

 Subsequently we find him in "Babylon," whence he wrote this First
 Epistle to the Israelite believers of the dispersion, and the Gentile 
 Christians united in Christ, in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and 
 Bithynia.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> [<I>On Illustrious Men,</I> 1] states that
 "Peter, after having been bishop of Antioch, and after having preached 
 to the believers of the circumcision in Pontus, &c.  [plainly inferred 
 from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1">1Pe 1:1</A>],

 in the second year of Claudius went to Rome to refute Simon Magus, and 
 for twenty-five years there held the episcopal chair, down to the last 
 year of Nero, that is, the fourteenth, by whom he was crucified with 
 his head downwards, declaring himself unworthy to be crucified as his 
 Lord, and was buried in the Vatican, near the triumphal way." E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Chronicles,</I> Anno 3], also asserts his 
 episcopate at Antioch; his assertion that Peter founded that Church 
 contradicts

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:19-22">Ac 11:19-22</A>.

 His journey to Rome to oppose Simon Magus arose from 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>USTIN'S</FONT> story of the statue found at Rome (really
 the statue of the Sabine god, <I>Semo Sanctus,</I> or Hercules, 
 mistaken as if Simon Magus were worshipped by that name, "Simoni Deo 
 Sancto"; found in the Tiber in 1574, or on an island in the Tiber in 
 1662), combined with the account in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:9-24">Ac 8:9-24</A>.

 The twenty-five years' bishopric is chronologically impossible, as it 
 would make Peter, at the interview with Paul at Antioch, to have been 
 then for some years bishop of Rome! His crucifixion is certain from 
 Christ's prophecy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:18,19">Joh 21:18, 19</A>.

 D<FONT SIZE=-1>IONYSIUS OF</FONT> C<FONT SIZE=-1>ORINTH</FONT> (in
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 2.25])
 asserted in an epistle to the Romans, that Paul and Peter planted both
 the Roman and Corinthian churches, and endured martyrdom in Italy at
 the same time. So T<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT> [<I>Against
 Marcion,</I> 4.5, and <I>The Prescription Against Heretics,</I> 36,
 38]. Also Caius, the presbyter of Rome, in 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 2.25]
 asserts that some memorials of their martyrdom were to be seen at Rome
 on the road to Ostia. So E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>
 [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 2.25, and <I>Demonstration of the
 Gospel,</I> 3.116]. So L<FONT SIZE=-1>ACTANTIUS</FONT> [<I>Of the
 Manner in Which the Persecutors Died,</I> 2]. Many of the details are
 palpably false; whether the <I>whole</I> be so or not is dubious,
 considering the tendency to concentrate at Rome events of interest
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. What is certain is, that Peter was not
 there before the writing of the Epistle to the Romans 
 (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 58), otherwise he would have been mentioned
 in it; nor during Paul's first imprisonment at Rome, otherwise he would
 have been mentioned in some one of Paul's many other Epistles written
 from Rome; nor during Paul's second imprisonment, at least when he was
 writing the Second Epistle to Timothy, just before his martyrdom. He
 <I>may</I> have gone to Rome after Paul's death, and, as common
 tradition represents, been imprisoned in the Mamertine dungeon, and 
 crucified on the Janiculum, on the eminence of St. Pietro in Montorio, 
 and his remains deposited under the great altar in the center of the 
 famous basilica of St. Peter. A<FONT SIZE=-1>MBROSE</FONT> 
 [<I>Epistles,</I> 33 (Edition Paris, 1586), p. 1022] relates that St.
 Peter, not long before his death, being overcome by the solicitations 
 of his fellow Christians to save himself, was fleeing from Rome when he
 was met by our Lord, and on asking, "Lord, whither goest Thou?"
 received the answer, "I go to be crucified afresh." On this he returned
 and joyfully went to martyrdom. The church called "<I>Domine quo
 vadis</I>" on the Appian Way, commemorates the legend. It is not
 unlikely that the whole tradition is built on the connection which
 existed between Paul and Peter. As Paul, "the apostle of the
 uncircumcision," wrote Epistles to Galatia, Ephesus, and Colosse, and
 to Philemon at Colosse, making the Gentile Christians the persons
 prominently addressed, and the Jewish Christians subordinately so; so,
 vice versa, Peter, "the apostle of the circumcision," addressed the
 same churches, the Jewish Christians in them primarily, and the Gentile
 Christians also, secondarily.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>O WHOM HE ADDRESSES THIS EPISTLE</FONT>.--The heading,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1">1Pe 1:1</A>,

 "to the elect strangers (spiritually <I>pilgrims</I>) <I>of the
 dispersion</I>" (<I>Greek</I>), clearly marks the Christians of the 
 <I>Jewish</I> dispersion as prominently addressed, but still including 
 also <I>Gentile</I> Christians as grafted into the Christian Jewish 
 stock by adoption and faith, and so being part of the true Israel.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:14,2:9,10,3:6,4:3">1Pe 1:14; 2:9, 10; 3:6; 4:3</A>

 clearly prove this. Thus he, the apostle of the circumcision, sought to
 unite in one Christ Jew and Gentile, promoting thereby the same work 
 and doctrine as Paul the apostle of the uncircumcision. The provinces 
 are named by Peter in the heading in the order proceeding from 
 northeast to south and west. Pontus was the country of the Christian 
 Jew Aquila. To Galatia Paul paid two visits, founding and confirming 
 churches. Crescens, his companion, went there about the time of Paul's
 last imprisonment, just before his martyrdom. Ancyra was subsequently 
 its ecclesiastical metropolis. Men of Cappadocia, as well as of 
 "Pontus" and "Asia," were among the hearers of Peter's effective sermon 
 on the Pentecost whereon the Spirit decended on the Church; these 
 probably brought home to their native land the first tidings of the 
 Gospel. Proconsular "Asia" included Mysia, Lydia, Caria, Phrygia,
 Pisidia, and Lyaconia. In Lycaonia were the churches of Iconium, 
 founded by Paul and Barnabas; of Lystra, Timothy's birthplace, where 
 Paul was stoned at the instigation of the Jews; and of Derbe, the 
 birthplace of Gaius, or Caius. In Pisidia was Antioch, where Paul was 
 the instrument of converting many, but was driven out by the Jews. In 
 Caria was Miletus, containing doubtless a Christian Church. In Phrygia, 
 Paul preached both times when visiting Galatia in its neighborhood, and 
 in it were the churches of Laodicea, Hierapolis, and Colosse, of which
 last Church Philemon and Onesimus were members, and Archippus and
 Epaphras leaders. In Lydia was the Philadelphian Church, favorably
 noticed in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:7">Re 3:7</A>,

 &c.; that of Sardis, the capital, and of Thyatira, and of Ephesus,
 founded by Paul, and a scene of the labors of Aquila and Priscilla and
 Apollos, and subsequently of more than two whole years' labor of Paul
 again, and subsequently censured for falling from its first love in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:4">Re 2:4</A>.

 Smyrna of Ionia was in the same quarter, and as one of the seven
 churches receives unqualified praise. In Mysia was Pergamos. Troas, 
 too, is known as the scene of Paul's preaching and raising Eutychus to 
 life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:6-10">Ac 20:6-10</A>),

 and of his subsequently staying for a time with Carpus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:13">2Ti 4:13</A>).

 Of "Bithynia," no Church is expressly named in Scripture elsewhere. 
 When Paul at an earlier period "assayed to go into Bithynia"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:7">Ac 16:7</A>),

 the Spirit suffered him not. But afterwards, we infer from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1">1Pe 1:1</A>,

 the Spirit did impart the Gospel to that country, possibly by Peter's 
 ministry, In government, these several churches, it appears from this 
 Epistle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:1,2">1Pe 5:1, 2</A>,

 "Feed," &c.), were much in the same states as when Paul addressed the 
 Ephesian "elders" at Miletus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:17,28">Ac 20:17, 28</A>,

 "feed") in very similar language; elders or presbyter-bishops ruled, 
 while the apostles exercised the general superintendence. They were 
 exposed to persecutions, though apparently not systematic, but rather 
 annoyances and reproach arising from their not joining their heathen 
 neighbors in riotous living, into which, however, some of them were in 
 danger of falling. The evils which existed among themselves, and which 
 are therefore reproved, were ambition and lucre-seeking on the part of 
 the presbyters

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:2,3">1Pe 5:2, 3</A>),

 evil thoughts and words among the members in general, and a want of 
 sympathy and generosity towards one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 H<FONT SIZE=-1>IS OBJECT</FONT> seems to be, by the prospect of their 
 heavenly portion and by Christ's example, to afford consolation to the 
 persecuted, and prepare them for a greater approaching ordeal, and to 
 exhort all, husbands, wives, servants, presbyters, and people, to a due 
 discharge of relative duties, so as to give no handle to the enemy to 
 reproach Christianity, but rather to win them to it, and so to
 establish them in "the true grace of God wherein they stand"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:12">1Pe 5:12</A>).

 However, see on

 <A HREF="#1Pe5_12">1Pe 5:12</A>, 

 on the oldest reading.  A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> rightly argues that 
 "exhorting and testifying" there, refer to Peter's <I>exhortations</I> 
 throughout the Epistle grounded on <I>testimony</I> which he bears 
 <I>to the Gospel truth, already well known to his readers by the 
 teaching of Paul in those churches.</I> They were already introduced 
 "into" (so the <I>Greek,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:12">1Pe 5:12</A>)

 this <I>grace of God</I> as their safe <I>standing-ground.</I> Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:1">1Co 15:1</A>,

 "I declare unto you the Gospel <I>wherein ye stand.</I>" Therefore he 
 does not, in this Epistle, set forth a complete statement of this

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>IME AND PLACE OF WRITING</FONT>.--It was plainly before
 the open and <I>systematic</I> persecution of the later years of Nero 
 had begun. That this Epistle was written after Paul's Epistles, even 
 those written during his imprisonment at Rome, ending in <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 63, appears from the acquaintance which Peter in 
 this Epistle shows he has with them.  Compare

 Moreover, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:13">1Pe 5:13</A>,

 Mark is mentioned as with Peter in Babylon. This must have been after

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:10">Col 4:10</A>

 (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 61-63), when Mark was with Paul at Rome, but 
 intending to go to Asia Minor. Again, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:11">2Ti 4:11</A>

 (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 67 or 68), Mark was in or near Ephesus, in 
 Asia Minor, and Timothy is told to bring him to Rome. So that it is 
 likely it was after this, namely, after Paul's martyrdom, that Mark 
 joined Peter, and consequently that this Epistle was written. It is not 
 likely that Peter would have entrenched on Paul's field of labor, the 
 churches of Asia Minor, <I>during Paul's lifetime.</I> The death of the 
 apostle of the uncircumcision, and the consequent need of someone to 
 follow up his teachings, probably gave occasion to the testimony given 
 by Peter to the same churches, collectively addressed, in behalf of the 
 same truth.  The relation in which the Pauline Gentile churches stood 
 towards the apostles at Jerusalem favors this view. Even the Gentile 
 Christians would naturally look to the spiritual fathers of the Church 
 at Jerusalem, the center whence the Gospel had emanated to them, for 
 counsel wherewith to meet the pretensions of Judaizing Christians and 
 heretics; and Peter, always prominent among the apostles in Jerusalem, 
 would even when elsewhere feel a deep interest in them, especially when 
 they were by death bereft of Paul's guidance. B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT> [<I>Hor&aelig; Evangelic&aelig;</I>] suggests that 
 false teachers may have appealed from Paul's doctrine to that of James 
 and Peter. Peter then would naturally write to confirm the doctrines of 
 grace and tacitly show there was no difference between his teaching and 
 Paul's. B<FONT SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT> prefers dating the Epistle <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 58, after Paul's second visit to Galatia, when 
 Silvanus was with him, and so could not have been with Peter (<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 54), and before his imprisonment at Rome, when Mark 
 was with him, and so could not have been with Peter (<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 62); perhaps when Paul was detained at 
 C&aelig;sarea, and so debarred from personal intercourse with those 
 churches. I prefer the view previously stated. This sets aside the 
 tradition that Paul and Peter suffered martyrdom together at Rome. 
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN'S</FONT> and E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS'</FONT> 
 statement that Peter visited the churches of Asia in person seems very 
 probable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>PLACE OF WRITING</FONT> was doubtless Babylon on the
 Euphrates

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:13">1Pe 5:13</A>).

 It is most improbable that in the midst of writing matter-of-fact 
 communications and salutations in a remarkably plain Epistle, the 
 symbolical language of prophecy (namely, "Babylon" for <I>Rome</I>) 
 should be used. J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> [<I>Antiquities,</I> 
 15.2.2; 3.1] states that there was a <I>great multitude of Jews</I> in 
 the Chaldean Babylon; it is therefore likely that "the apostle of the 
 circumcision"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:7,8">Ga 2:7, 8</A>)

 would at some time or other visit them. Some have maintained that the 
 Babylon meant was in Egypt because Mark preached in and around 
 Alexandria after Peter's death, and therefore it is likely he did so 
 along with that apostle in the same region previously. But no mention 
 elsewhere in <I>Scripture</I> is made of this Egyptian Babylon, but 
 only of the Chaldean one. And though towards the close of Caligula's 
 reign a persecution drove the Jews thence to Seleucia, and a plague 
 five years after still further thinned their numbers, yet this does not 
 preclude their return and multiplication during the twenty years that 
 elapsed between the plague and the writing of the Epistle. Moreover, 
 the order in which the countries are enumerated, from northeast to 
 south and west, is such as would be adopted by one writing from the 
 Oriental Babylon on the Euphrates, not from Egypt or Rome. Indeed, 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>OSMAS</FONT> I<FONT SIZE=-1>NDICOPLEUSTES</FONT>, in the 
 sixth century, understood the Babylon meant to be <I>outside</I> the 
 Roman empire. Silvanus, Paul's companion, became subsequently Peter's, 
 and was the carrier of this Epistle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 S<FONT SIZE=-1>TYLE</FONT>.--Fervor and practical truth, rather than 
 logical reasoning, are the characteristics, of this Epistle, as they 
 were of its energetic, warm-hearted writer. His familiarity with Paul's 
 Epistles shown in the language accords with what we should expect from 
 the fact of Paul's having "communicated the Gospel which he preached 
 among the Gentiles" (as revealed specially to him) to Peter among
 others "of reputation"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:2">Ga 2:2</A>).

 Individualities occur, such as baptism, "the answer of a good 
 conscience toward God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:21">1Pe 3:21</A>);

 "consciousness of God" (<I>Greek</I>),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:19">1Pe 2:19</A>,

 as a motive for enduring sufferings; "living hope"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:3">1Pe 1:3</A>);

 "an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:4">1Pe 1:4</A>);
 
 "kiss of charity"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:14">1Pe 5:14</A>).

 Christ is viewed less in relation to His past sufferings than as at 
 present exalted and hereafter to be manifested in all His majesty. 
 <I>Glory</I> and <I>hope</I> are prominent features in this Epistle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:8">1Pe 1:8</A>),

 so much so that W<FONT SIZE=-1>EISS</FONT> entitles him "the apostle of 
 hope." The realization of future bliss as near causes him to regard 
 believers as but "strangers" and "sojourners" here. Chastened fervor, 
 deep humility, and ardent love appear, just as we should expect from 
 one who had been so graciously restored after his grievous fall. "Being 
 converted," he truly does "strengthen his brethren." His fervor shows 
 itself in often repeating the same thought in similar words.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In some passages he shows familiarity with the Epistle of James, the
 apostle of special weight with the Jewish legalizing party, whose
 inspiration he thus confirms (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:6,7,Jam+1:2,3">1Pe 1:6, 7
 with Jas 1:2, 3</A>;

 both quoting

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:34">Pr 3:34</A>).

 In most of these cases Old Testament quotations are the common ground
 of both. "Strong susceptibility to outward impressions, liveliness of 
 feeling, dexterity in handling subjects, dispose natures like that of 
 Peter to repeat afresh the thoughts of others" [S<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>TEIGER</FONT>].</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 similar: an undesigned coincidence, and so a mark of genuineness

 interview after His resurrection, recorded in

 W<FONT SIZE=-1>IESINGER</FONT> well says, "He who in loving impatience
 cast himself into the sea to meet the Lord, is also the man who most 
 earnestly testifies to the hope of His return; he who dated his own 
 faith from the sufferings of his Master, is never weary in holding up 
 the suffering form of the Lord before his readers to comfort and 
 stimulate them; he before whom the death of a martyr is in assured 
 expectation, is the man who, in the greatest variety of aspects, sets 
 forth the duty, as well as the consolation, of suffering for Christ; as 
 a rock of the Church he grounds his readers against the storm of 
 present tribulation on the true Rock of ages."</P>

 "the outcasts of Israel"; the designation peculiarly given to <I>the 
 Jews</I> in their dispersed state throughout the world ever since the 
 Babylonian captivity. These he, as the apostle of the circumcision, 
 primarily addresses, but not in the limited temporal sense only; he 
 regards their temporal condition as a shadow of their spiritual calling 
 to be <I>strangers</I> and pilgrims on earth, looking for the heavenly 
 Jerusalem as their home. So the <I>Gentile</I> Christians, as the 
 spiritual Israel, are included secondarily, as having the same high 
 calling. He

 plainly refers to Christian <I>Gentiles</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:17,1Pe+2:11">1Pe 1:17;
 1Pe 2:11</A>). 

 Christians, if they rightly consider their calling, must never settle
 themselves here, but feel themselves <I>travellers.</I> As the Jews in 
 their <I>dispersion</I> diffused through the nations the knowledge of 
 the one God, preparatory to Christ's first advent, so Christians, by 
 their dispersion among the unconverted, diffuse the knowledge of 
 Christ, preparatory to His second advent. "The children of God 
 scattered abroad" constitute one whole in Christ, who "gathers them 
 together in one," now partially and in Spirit, hereafter perfectly and 
 visibly. "Elect," in the <I>Greek</I> order, comes before "strangers"; 
 <I>elect,</I> in relation to heaven, <I>strangers,</I> in relation to 
 the earth. The <I>election</I> here is that of individuals to eternal 
 life by the sovereign grace of God, as the sequel shows. "While each is 
 certified of his own election by the Spirit, he receives no assurance 
 concerning others, nor are we to be too inquisitive

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:21,22">Joh 21:21, 22</A>];

 Peter numbers them among the <I>elect,</I> as they carried the 
 appearance of having been regenerated" [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>]. 
 He calls the whole Church by the designation strictly belonging only to 
 the better portion of them [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>].  The election 
 to <I>hearing,</I> and that to <I>eternal life,</I> are distinct. 
 Realization of our election is a strong motive to holiness. The 
 minister invites all, yet he does not hide the truth that in none but 
 the elect will the preaching effect eternal blessing. As the chief 
 fruit of exhortations, and even of threatenings, redounds to "the 
 elect"; therefore, at the outset, Peter addresses <I>them.</I> S<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>TEIGER</FONT> translates, to "the elect pilgrims who form the 
 dispersion in Pontus.", &c. The <I>order</I> of the provinces is that

 "(Unto) a lively hope" is further explained by "(To) an inheritance

 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> and S<FONT SIZE=-1>TEIGER</FONT> to join as 
 in <I>Greek,</I> "Unto a hope <I>living</I> (possessing life and 
 vitality) <I>through</I> the resurrection of Jesus Christ." Faith, the 
 subjective means of the spiritual resurrection of the soul, is wrought 
 by the same power whereby Christ was raised from the dead. Baptism is 
 an objective means

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:21">1Pe 3:21</A>).

 Its moral fruit is a new life. The connection of our sonship with the 
 resurrection appears also in

 (2) as an exemplary cause, all the saints being about to rise after the
 similitude of His resurrection. Our "hope" is, Christ rising from the 
 dead hath ordained the power, and is become the pattern of the 
 believer's resurrection. The soul, born again from its natural state 
 into the life of grace, is after that born again unto the life of 
 glory.

 primary cause, God's mercy; (2) the proximate cause, Christ's death and 
 resurrection; (3) the formal cause, our regeneration; (4) the final 
 cause, our eternal bliss. As John is the disciple of <I>love,</I> so 
 Paul of <I>faith,</I> and Peter of <I>hope.</I> Hence, Peter, most of 
 all the apostles, urges the resurrection of Christ; an undesigned

 faculties now capable of fully knowing. Peter, sanguine, impulsive, and

 certain of the redemption being about to come. They did not like us 
 fully <I>see,</I> but they <I>desired</I> to see the one and the same 
 Christ whom we fully see in spirit. "As Simeon was anxiously desiring 
 previously, and tranquil in peace only when he had seen Christ, so all 
 the Old Testament saints saw Christ only hidden, and as it were 
 absent--absent not in power and grace, but inasmuch as He was not yet 
 manifested in the flesh" [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>]. The prophets, 
 as <I>private individuals,</I> had to reflect on the hidden and 
 far-reaching sense of their own prophecies; because their words, <I>as 
 prophets, in their public function,</I> were not so much their own as 
 the Spirit's, speaking by and in them: thus Caiaphas. A striking 
 testimony to verbal inspiration; the <I>words</I> which the inspired 
 authors wrote are God's words expressing the mind of the Spirit, which 
 the writers themselves searched into, to fathom the deep and precious 
 meaning, even as the believing readers did. "Searched" implies that 
 they had determinate marks to go by in their search.

 events and features should characterize the time of His coming. The 
 "or" implies that some of the prophets, if they could not as

 Not that their prophecies were unattended with spiritual instruction as

 Angels do not any more than ourselves possess an

 on same word. As the cherubim stood bending over the mercy seat, the 
 emblem of redemption, in the holiest place, so the angels intently gaze 
 upon and desire to fathom the depths of "the great mystery of 
 godliness, God manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, <I>seen

 Their "ministry to the heirs of salvation" naturally disposes them to 
 wish to penetrate this mystery as reflecting such glory on the love, 
 justice, wisdom, and power of their and our God and Lord.  They can 
 know it only through its manifestation in the Church, as they 
 personally have not the direct share in it that we have. "Angels have 
 only the contrast between good and evil, without the power of 
 conversion from sin to righteousness: witnessing such conversion in the

 up, both to shorten the garment so as not to impede motion, and to gird

 But the Lamb who redeems the spiritual Israelites does so "without 
 money or price." Devoted by sin to the justice of God, the Church of 
 the first-born is redeemed from sin and the curse with Christ's 
 precious blood

 In all these passages there is the idea of <I>substitution,</I> the
 giving of one for another by way of a ransom or equivalent. Man is 
 "sold under sin" as a slave; shut up under condemnation and the curse. 
 The ransom was, therefore, paid to the righteously incensed Judge, and 
 was accepted as a vicarious satisfaction for our sin by God, inasmuch 
 as it was His own love as well as righteousness which appointed it. An 
 Israelite sold as a bond-servant for debt might be redeemed by one of 
 his brethren. As, therefore, we could not redeem ourselves, Christ 
 assumed our nature in order to become our nearest of kin and brother, 
 and so our God or Redeemer. Holiness is the natural fruit of redemption 
 "from our vain conversation"; for He <I>by</I> whom we are redeemed is 
 also He <I>for</I> whom we are redeemed. "Without the righteous
 abolition of the curse, either there could be found no deliverance, or, 
 what is impossible, the grace and righteousness of God must have come 
 in collision" [S<FONT SIZE=-1>TEIGER</FONT>]; but now, Christ having 
 borne the curse of our sin, frees from it those who are made God's 
 children by His Spirit.

 our atoning Redeemer: so the passover lamb, and every sacrificial

 Israel's redemption from Egypt required the blood of the paschal lamb,

 acceptance of Him as our righteous substitute; (2) because by it and 
 His glorification He received power, namely, the Holy Spirit, to impart 
 to His elect "faith": the same power enabling us to believe as raised 
 Him from the dead. Our faith must not only be <FONT SIZE=-1>IN</FONT> 
 Christ, but <FONT SIZE=-1>BY</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-1>THROUGH</FONT> 
 Christ. "Since in Christ's resurrection and consequent dominion our

 We are born again <I>of the Spirit,</I> yet not without the use of

 those who sow to the flesh. "The Gospel bears incorruptible fruits, not
 dead works, because it is itself incorruptible" 
 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. The word is an eternal divine power. For
 though the voice or speech vanishes, there still remains the kernel, 
 the truth comprehended in the voice. This sinks into the heart and is 
 living; yea, it is God Himself. So God to Moses,

 "The <I>Gospel</I> shall never cease, though its ministry shall"

 can cast off the old as an outward thing, so that the Christian,

 himself externally as a new man. But to unbelievers the demand is

 exhortations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:2,11">1Pe 2:2, 11</A>,

 &c., on their conscious sense of their high privileges as <I>living 
 stones in the course of being built up into a spiritual house</I> (that 
 is, "the habitation of the Spirit").

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>priesthood</B>--Christians are both the spiritual <I>temple</I> and 
 the <I>priests</I> of the temple. There are two <I>Greek</I> words for 
 "temple"; <I>hieron</I> (<I>the sacred place</I>), the whole building, 
 including the courts wherein the sacrifice <I>was killed;</I> and 
 <I>naos</I> (<I>the dwelling,</I> namely, of God), the inner shrine 
 wherein God peculiarly manifested Himself, and where, in the holiest 
 place, the <I>blood</I> of the slain sacrifice was presented before 
 Him. All believers alike, and not merely ministers, are now the 
 dwelling of God (and are called the "<I>naos,</I>" <I>Greek,</I> not 
 the <I>hieron</I>) and priests unto God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:6">Re 1:6</A>).

 The minister is not, like the Jewish priest (<I>Greek,</I> 
 "<I>hiercus</I>"), admitted nearer to God than the people, but merely 
 for order's sake leads the spiritual services of the people.  
 <I>Priest</I> is the abbreviation of <I>presbyter</I> in the <I>Church 
 of England Prayer Book,</I> not corresponding to the Aaronic 
 <I>priest</I> (<I>hiereus,</I> who offered <I>literal</I> sacrifices). 
 Christ is the only literal <I>hiereus-priest</I> in the New Testament 
 through whom alone we may always draw near to God. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:9">1Pe 2:9</A>,

 "a royal priesthood," that is, <I>a body of priest-kings,</I> such as 
 was Melchisedec. The Spirit never, in New Testament, gives the name 
 <I>hiereus,</I> or <I>sacerdotal</I> priest, to ministers of the 
 Gospel.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>holy</B>--consecrated to God.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>spiritual sacrifices</B>--not the literal one of the mass, as the 
 Romish self-styled disciples of Peter teach. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:7">Isa 56:7</A>,

 which compare with "<I>acceptable</I> to God" here;

 "Among spiritual sacrifices the first place belongs to the general
 oblation of ourselves. For never can we offer anything to God until we 
 have offered ourselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:5">2Co 8:5</A>)

 in sacrifice to Him. There follow afterwards prayers, giving of thanks, 
 alms deeds, and all exercises of piety" [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>].
 Christian houses of worship are never called temples because the 
 <I>temple</I> was a place for <I>sacrifice,</I> which has no place in 
 the Christian dispensation; the Christian temple is the congregation of 
 spiritual worshippers. The synagogue (where reading of Scripture and 
 prayer constituted the worship) was the model of the Christian house of 
 worship (compare <I>Note,</I> see on

 wicked to punishment, not to crime [J. C<FONT SIZE=-1>APPEL</FONT>]. 
 "Appointed" or "set" (not here "FORE-ordained") refers, not to the 
 eternal counsel so directly, as to the penal justice of God. Through 
 the same Christ whom sinners rejected, they shall be rejected; unlike 
 believers, they are by God <I>appointed unto wrath</I> as <FONT

 <I>create,</I> the punishment of sin, not sin itself. Peter, with 
 characteristic boldness, brands as <I>darkness</I> what all the world 
 calls <I>light;</I> reason, without the Holy Spirit, in spite of its 
 vaunted power, is spiritual darkness. "It cannot apprehend what faith 
 is: there it is stark blind; it gropes as one that is without eyesight,

 "Other men <I>narrowly look at</I> (so the <I>Greek</I> implies) the

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT> contrasts the early Christians and the
 heathen: these delighted in the bloody gladiatorial spectacles of the 
 amphitheater, whereas a Christian was excommunicated if he went to it 
 at all. No Christian was found in prison for crime, but only for the 
 faith. The heathen excluded slaves from some of their religious 
 services, whereas Christians had some of their presbyters of the class 
 of slaves. Slavery silently and gradually disappeared by the power of 
 the Christian law of love, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to 
 you, do ye even so to them." When the pagans deserted their nearest 
 relatives in a plague, Christians ministered to the sick and dying.  
 When the Gentiles left their dead unburied after a battle and cast 
 their wounded into the streets, the disciples hastened to relieve the 
 suffering.

 nomination and in the exercise of their authority, earthly governors 
 are but human institutions, being <I>of men,</I> and <I>in relation to 
 men.</I> The apostle speaks as one raised above all human things. But 
 lest they should think themselves so ennobled by faith as to be raised 
 above subordination to human authorities, he tells them to <I>submit 
 themselves for the sake of Christ,</I> who desires you to be subject, 
 and who once was subject to earthly rulers Himself, though having all 
 things subject to Him, and whose honor is at stake in you as His 
 earthly representatives. Compare

 <B>king</B>--The Roman emperor was "supreme" in the Roman provinces to

 The distinction between "the king as supreme" and "governors sent by
 him" implies that "if the king command one thing, and the subordinate
 magistrate another, we ought rather to obey the superior" 
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT> in G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>].
 Scripture prescribes nothing upon the form of government, but simply 
 subjects Christians to that everywhere subsisting, without entering 
 into the question of the <I>right</I> of the rulers (thus the Roman 
 emperors had by force seized supreme authority, and Rome had, by 
 unjustifiable means, made herself mistress of Asia), because the <I>de

 of God.</P>

 <B>for the punishment</B>--No tyranny ever has been so unprincipled as 
 that some appearance of equity was not maintained in it; however 
 corrupt a government be, God never suffers it to be so much so as not 
 to be better than anarchy [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>]. Although bad 
 kings often oppress the good, yet that is scarcely ever done by public 
 authority (and it is of what is done by public authority that Peter 
 speaks), save under the mask of right. Tyranny harasses many, but 
 anarchy overwhelms the whole state [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ORNEIUS</FONT>]. The 
 only justifiable exception is in cases where obedience to the earthly 
 king plainly involves disobedience to the express command of the King

 explaining

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:18,19">1Pe 3:18, 19</A>,

 are open to us: (1) "Quickened in Spirit," that is, <I>immediately</I> 
 on His release from the "flesh," the energy of His undying spirit-life 
 was "quickened" by God the Father, into new modes of action, namely, 
 "in the Spirit He <I>went</I> down (as subsequently He <I>went</I> up 
 to heaven,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:22">1Pe 3:22</A>,

 the same <I>Greek</I> verb) and heralded [not <I>salvation,</I> as
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, contrary to Scripture, which everywhere 
 represents man's state, whether saved or lost, after death 
 irreversible. Nor is any mention made of the <I>conversion</I> of the 
 spirits in prison. See on

 <A HREF="#1Pe3_20">1Pe 3:20</A>. 

 Nor is the phrase here 'preached <I>the Gospel</I>' 
 (<I>evangelizo</I>), but 'heralded' (<I>ekeruxe</I>) or 'preached'; but 
 simply <I>made the announcement</I> of His finished work; so the same 
 <I>Greek</I> in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:45">Mr 1:45</A>,

 'publish,' confirming Enoch and Noah's testimony, and thereby declaring
 the virtual condemnation of their unbelief, and the salvation of Noah 
 and believers; a sample of the similar opposite effects of the same 
 work on <I>all</I> unbelievers, and believers, respectively; also a 
 consolation to those whom Peter addresses, in their sufferings at the 
 hands of unbelievers; specially selected for the sake of 'baptism,' its 
 'antitype'

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:21">1Pe 3:21</A>),

 which, as a seal, marks believers as separated from the rest of the 
 doomed world] to the spirits (His <I>Spirit</I> speaking to the 
 <I>spirits</I>) in prison (in Hades or Sheol, awaiting the judgment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:4">2Pe 2:4</A>),

 which were of old disobedient when," &c. (2) The strongest point in 
 favor of (1) is the position of "sometime," that is, <I>of old,</I> 
 connected with "disobedient"; whereas if the <I>preaching</I> or 
 announcing were a thing long past, we should expect "sometime," or 
 <I>of old,</I> to be joined to "went and preached." But this 
 transposition may express that <I>their disobedience preceded His 
 preaching.</I> The <I>Greek</I> participle expresses the reason of His 
 <I>preaching,</I> "<I>inasmuch as</I> they were sometime disobedient" 
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:6">1Pe 4:6</A>).

 Also "went" seems to mean a <I>personal</I> going, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:22">1Pe 3:22</A>,

 not merely <I>in spirit.</I> But see the answer below. The objections 
 are "quickened" must refer to Christ's <I>body</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:21">1Pe 3:21</A>,

 end), for as His <I>Spirit</I> never ceased to live, it cannot be said 
 to be "quickened." Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:21,Ro+8:11">Joh 5:21;
 Ro 8:11</A>, 

 and other passages, where "quicken" is used of the <I>bodily</I>
 resurrection. Also, not His <I>Spirit,</I> but His <I>soul,</I> went to 
 Hades. His Spirit was commended by Him at death to His Father, and was 
 thereupon "in Paradise." The theory--(1) would thus require that His 
 descent to the spirits in prison should be <I>after</I> His 
 resurrection! Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:9,10">Eph 4:9, 10</A>,

 which makes the <I>descent</I> precede the <I>ascent.</I> Also 
 Scripture elsewhere is silent about such a heralding, though possibly 
 Christ's death had immediate effects on the state of both the godly and 
 the ungodly in Hades: the souls of the godly heretofore in comparative 
 confinement, perhaps then having been, as some Fathers thought, 
 translated to God's immediate and heavenly presence; but this cannot be 
 <I>proved</I> from Scripture. Compare however,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:13,Col+1:18">Joh 3:13;
 Col 1:18</A>. 

 <I>Prison</I> is always used in a <I>bad</I> sense in Scripture.
 "Paradise" and "Abraham's bosom," the abode of good spirits in Old 
 Testament times, are separated by a wide gulf from Hell or Hades, and 
 cannot be called "prison." Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:2,4">2Co 12:2, 4</A>,

 where "paradise" and the "third heaven" correspond. Also, why should 
 the antediluvian unbelievers in particular be selected as the objects 
 of His preaching in Hades? Therefore explain: "Quickened in spirit, in 
 which (as distinguished from <I>in person;</I> the words "in which," 
 that is, <I>in spirit,</I> expressly obviating the objection that 
 "went" implies a <I>personal going</I>) He went (in the person of Noah, 
 "a preacher of righteousness,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:5">2Pe 2:5</A>:

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:17">Eph 2:17</A>,

 is the best reply to his argument from "went" that a <I>local</I> going 
 to Hades <I>in person</I> is meant. As "He <FONT SIZE=-1>CAME</FONT> 
 and preached peace" <I>by His Spirit</I> in the apostles and ministers 
 after His death and ascension: so before His incarnation He preached in 
 Spirit through Noah to the antediluvians,

 "Christ should show," literally, "<I>announce</I> light to the
 Gentiles") and preached unto the spirits in prison, that is, the 
 antediluvians, whose bodies indeed seemed free, but their spirits were 
 in prison, shut up in the earth as one great condemned cell (exactly 
 parallel to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:22,23">Isa 24:22, 23</A>

 "upon the earth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they shall be gathered together as 
 <I>prisoners</I> are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up <I>in 
 the prison,</I>" &c.  [just as the fallen angels are judicially 
 regarded as "in chains of darkness," though for a time now at large on 
 the earth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:4">1Pe 2:4</A>],
 
 where

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:18">1Pe 3:18</A>

 has a plain allusion to the flood, "the <I>windows from on high</I> are 
 open," compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:11">Ge 7:11</A>);

 from this prison the only way of escape was that preached by Christ in 
 Noah.  Christ, who in our times came in the flesh, in the days of Noah 
 preached <I>in Spirit</I> by Noah to the spirits then in prison

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1">Isa 61:1</A>,

 end, "the Spirit of the Lord God hath sent me to <I>proclaim</I> the 
 opening of the <I>prison</I> to them that are bound"). So in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11">1Pe 1:11</A>,

 "the Spirit of Christ" is said to have testified in the prophets. As 
 Christ suffered even to death by enemies, and was afterwards quickened 
 in virtue of His "Spirit" (or divine nature,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:3,4,1Co+15:45">Ro 1:3, 4;

 was the raising of His body

 end) from the prison of the grave and His soul from Hades; so the same 
 Spirit of Christ enabled Noah, amidst reproach and trials, to preach to 
 the disobedient spirits fast bound in wrath. That Spirit in you can

 <B>souls</B>--As this term is here used of <I>living</I> persons, why 
 should not "spirits" also? Noah preached to their ears, but Christ 
 <I>in spirit,</I> to their <I>spirits,</I> or spiritual natures.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saved by water</B>--The same water which drowned the unbelieving, 
 buoyed up the ark in which the eight were saved. Not as some translate, 
 "were brought safe <I>through</I> the water." However, the sense of the 
 preposition may be as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:15">1Co 3:15</A>,

 "they were safely preserved through the water," though having to be 
 <I>in the water.</I></P>

 <B>21. whereunto</B>--The oldest manuscripts read, "which": literally, 
 "which (namely, <I>water,</I> in general; being) the antitype (of the 
 water of the flood) is now saving (the salvation being not yet fully 
 realized by us, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:1,2,5,Jude+1:5">1Co 10:1, 2, 5;

 <I>puts into a state of salvation</I>) us also (two oldest manuscripts
 read '<I>you</I>' for 'us': <I>You also,</I> as well as Noah and his 
 party), to wit, baptism." Water saved Noah not of itself, but by 
 sustaining the ark built in <I>faith,</I> resting on God's word: it was 
 to him the sign and mean of a kind of <I>regeneration,</I> of the 
 earth. The flood was for Noah a baptism, as the passage through the Red 
 Sea was for the Israelites; by baptism in the flood he and his family 
 were transferred from the old world to the new: from immediate 
 destruction to lengthened probation; from the companionship of the 
 wicked to communion with God; from the severing of all bonds between 
 the creature and the Creator to the privileges of the covenant: so we 
 by spiritual baptism. As there was a Ham who forfeited the privileges 
 of the covenant, so many now. The antitypical water, namely, baptism, 
 saves you also not of itself, nor the mere material water, but the 
 spiritual thing conjoined with it, repentance and faith, of which it is 
 the sign and seal, as Peter proceeds to explain. Compare the union of 
 the sign and thing signified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:5,Eph+5:26,Tit+3:5,Heb+10:22">Joh 3:5;

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>not the,</B> &c.--"flesh" bears the emphasis. "Not the putting away 
 of the filth of <I>the flesh</I>" (as is done by a mere water baptism, 
 unaccompanied with the Spirit's baptism, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:11">Eph 2:11</A>),

 but of the soul. It is the ark (Christ and His Spirit-filled Church), 
 not the water, which is the instrument of salvation: the water only 
 flowed round the ark; so not the mere water baptism, but the water when 
 accompanied with the Spirit.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>answer</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "interrogation"; referring to the 
 <I>questions</I> asked of candidates for baptism; eliciting a 
 confession of faith "toward God" and a renunciation of Satan ([A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT>, <I>The Creed,</I> 4.1]; [C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>YPRIAN</FONT>, <I>Epistles,</I> 7, <I>To Rogatianus</I>]), 
 which, when flowing from "a good conscience," assure one of being 
 "saved." Literally, "a good conscience's interrogation (including the 
 satisfactory <I>answer</I>) toward God." I prefer this to the 
 translation of W<FONT SIZE=-1>AHL</FONT>, A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> 
 and others, "<I>inquiry</I> of a good conscience <I>after God</I>": not 
 one of the parallels alleged, not even

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:7">2Sa 11:7</A>,

 in the <I>Septuagint,</I> is strictly in point. Recent Byzantine 
 <I>Greek</I> idiom (whereby the term meant: (1) the question; (2) the 
 stipulation; (3) the engagement), easily flowing from the usage of the 
 word as Peter has it, confirms the former translation.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>by the resurrection of Jesus</B>--joined with "saves you": In so far 
 as baptism applies to us the power of Christ's resurrection. As 
 Christ's death unto sin is the source of the believer's death unto, and 
 so deliverance from, sin's penalty and power; so His resurrection life 
 is the source of the believer's new spiritual life.</P>

 The Christian is by faith one with Christ: as then Christ by death is

 <B>gospel preached also to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dead</B>--as well as to them

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:5">1Pe 4:5</A>,

 which refutes the explanation "dead" <I>in sins.</I> Moreover, the 
 absence of the <I>Greek</I> article does not necessarily restrict the 
 sense of "dead" to particular dead persons, for there is no 
 <I>Greek</I> article in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:5">1Pe 4:5</A>

 also, where "the dead" is universal in meaning. The sense seems to be, 
 Peter, as representing the true attitude of the Church in every age, 
 expecting Christ at any moment, says, The Judge is ready to judge the 
 quick and dead--<I>the dead,</I> I say, <I>for</I> they, too, in their 
 lifetime, have had the Gospel preached to them, that so they might be 
 judged at last in the same way as those living now (and those who shall 
 be so when Christ shall come), namely, "men in the flesh," and that 
 they might, having escaped condemnation by embracing the Gospel so 
 preached, live unto God in the spirit (though death has passed over 
 their flesh),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:38">Lu 20:38</A>,

 thus being made like Christ in death and in life (see on

 He says, "live," not "made alive" or quickened; for they are supposed

 The Gospel, substantially, was "preached" to the Old Testament Church; 
 though not so fully as to the New Testament Church. It is no valid 
 objection that the Gospel has not been preached to <I>all</I> that 
 shall be found dead at Christ's coming. For Peter is plainly referring 
 only to those within reach of the Gospel, or who might have known God 
 through His ministers in Old and New Testament times.  Peter, like 
 Paul, argues that those found <I>living</I> at Christ's coming shall 
 have no advantage above the <I>dead</I> who shall then be raised, 
 inasmuch as the latter <I>live unto,</I> or "according to," <I>God,</I> 
 even already in His purpose. A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT> explanation 
 is wrong, "that they might be judged according to men as regards the 
 flesh," that is, <I>be in the state of the completed sentence on 
 sin,</I> which is <I>death after the flesh.</I> For "judged" cannot 
 have a different meaning in this verse from what "judge" bears in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:5">1Pe 4:5</A>.

 "Live according to God" means, live a life with God, <I>such as God 
 lives,</I> divine; as contrasted with "according to men in the flesh," 
 that is, a life such as men live in the flesh.</P>

 was not an idolater, but a proselyte) were converted, and wide 
 missionary work began, they could be no longer looked on as a <I>Jewish 
 sect,</I> and so <I>the Gentiles</I> designated them by the new name 
 "Christians." The rise of the new name marked a new epoch in the 
 Church's life, a new stage of its development, namely, its missions to 
 the Gentiles. The idle and witty people of Antioch, we know from 
 heathen writers, were famous for inventing nicknames. The date of this 
 Epistle must have been when this had become the generally recognized 
 designation <I>among Gentiles</I> (<I>it is never applied by Christians 
 to each other,</I> as it was in after ages--an undesigned proof that 
 the New Testament was composed when it professes), and when the name 
 exposed one to reproach and suffering, though not seemingly as yet to 
 <I>systematic</I> persecution.

 might have said as the contrast, "but let him esteem it an honor to 
 himself"; but the honor is to be given <I>to God,</I> who counts him 
 worthy of such an honor, involving exemption from the coming judgments 
 on the ungodly.

 Judgment is already begun, the Gospel word, as a "two-edged sword,"
 having the double effect of saving some and condemning others, and
 shall be consummated at the last judgment. "When power is given to the
 destroyer, he observes no distinction between the righteous and the
 wicked; not only so, but he begins first at the righteous"
 [W<FONT SIZE=-1>ETSTEIN</FONT> from <I>Rabbins</I>]. But God limits the

 "The righteous" man has always more or less of trial, but the issue is

 Seeing that the godly know that their sufferings are <I>by God's 
 will,</I> to chasten them that they may not perish with the world, they 
 have good reason to trust God cheerfully amidst sufferings, persevering 
 <I>in well-doing.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>let them</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "let them <I>also,</I>" "let <I>even</I> 
 them," as well as those not suffering. Not only under ordinary 
 circumstances, but <I>also</I> in time <I>of suffering, let</I> 
 believers <I>commit.</I> (Compare <I>Note,</I> see on

 <B>according to the will of God</B>--(See on

 God's will that the believer should suffer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:17">1Pe 4:17</A>),

 is for his good. One oldest manuscript and <I>Vulgate</I> read, "in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:15">1Pe 4:15</A>.

 Our committing of ourselves to God is to be, not in indolent and 
 passive quietism, but accompanied with active <I>well-doings.</I>

 <B>faithful</B>--to His covenant promises.

 <B>Creator</B>--who is therefore also our Almighty Preserver. He, not 
 we, must <I>keep</I> our souls. Sin destroyed the original spiritual 
 relation between creature and Creator, leaving that only of government. 
 Faith restores it; so that the believer, living to <I>the will of 
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:2">1Pe 4:2</A>),

 Peter, in true humility for the Gospel's sake, does not put forward his 
 <I>apostleship</I> here, wherein he <I>presided over the elders.</I> In
 the apostleship the apostles have no successors, for "the signs of an 
 apostle" have not been transmitted. The presidents over the presbyters 
 and deacons, by whatever name designated, <I>angel, bishop,</I> or 
 <I>moderator,</I> &c., though <I>of the same</I> ORDER <I>as the 
 presbyters,</I> yet have virtually succeeded to a superintendency of 
 the Church analogous to that exercised by the apostles (this 
 superintendency and priority existed from the earliest times after the 
 apostles [T<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT>]); just as the Jewish 
 synagogue (the model which the Church followed) was governed by a 
 council of presbyters, presided over by one of themselves, "the chief 
 ruler of the synagogue." (Compare V<FONT SIZE=-1>ITRINGA</FONT>

 <B>5. ye younger</B>--The <I>deacons</I> were originally the younger 
 men, the <I>presbyters</I> older; but subsequently as presbyter 
 expressed the <I>office</I> of Church ruler or teacher, so <I>Greek</I> 
 "<I>neoteros</I>" means not (as literally) <I>young men</I> in age, but 
 <I>subordinate ministers</I> and servants of the Church. So Christ uses 
 the term "younger." For He explains it by "he that doth serve," 
 literally, "he that ministereth as a deacon"; just as He explains "the 
 greatness" by "he that is chief," literally, "he that <I>ruleth,</I>" 
 the very word applied to the <I>bishops</I> or <I>presbyters.</I> So 
 "the young men" are undoubtedly the deacons of the Church of Jerusalem, 
 of whom, as being all <I>Hebrews,</I> the Hellenistic Christians 
 subsequently complained as neglecting their <I>Grecian</I> widows, 
 whence arose the appointment of the seven others, <I>Hellenistic</I> 
 deacons. So here, Peter, having exhorted the <I>presbyters,</I> or 
 elders, not to lord it over those committed to them, adds, Likewise ye 
 <I>neoters</I> or younger, that is, subordinate ministers and deacons, 
 submit cheerfully to the command of the elders [M<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OSHEIM</FONT>]. There is no Scripture sanction for "younger"
 meaning <I>laymen</I> in general (as A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> 
 explains): its use in this sense is probably of later date. The 
 "<I>all</I> of you" that follows, refers to the <I>congregation</I> 
 generally; and it is likely that, like Paul, Peter should notice, 
 previous to the general congregation, the <I>subordinate ministers</I> 
 as well as the <I>presbyters,</I> writing as he did to the same region 
 (Ephesus), and to confirm the teaching of the apostle of the Gentiles.

 <B>13. The .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at Babylon</B>--A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, 
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>, and others translate, "She that is elected 
 together with you in Babylon," namely, <I>Peter's wife,</I> whom he 
 <I>led about</I> with him in his missionary journeys. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:7">1Pe 3:7</A>,

 "<I>heirs together</I> of the grace of life." But why she should be 
 called "elected together with you <I>in Babylon,</I>" as if there had 
 been no Christian woman in Babylon besides, is inexplicable on this 
 view. In <I>English Version</I> the sense is clear: "That portion of 
 <I>the whole dispersion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1">1Pe 1:1</A>,

 <I>Greek</I>), or Church of Christianized Jews, with Gentile converts, 
 which resides in Babylon." As Peter and John were closely associated, 
 Peter addresses the Church in John's peculiar province, Asia, and 
 closes with "your <I>co-elect</I> sister Church at <I>Babylon</I> 
 saluteth you"; and John similarly addresses the "elect lady," that is, 
 <I>the Church in Babylon,</I> and closes with "the children of thine 
 elect sister (the Asiatic Church) greet thee"; (compare

 <A HREF="JFB63.htm#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>

 to Second John).  E<FONT SIZE=-1>RASMUS</FONT> explains, "Mark <I>who 
 is in the place of a son</I> to me": compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:12">Ac 12:12</A>,

 implying Peter's connection with Mark; whence the mention of him in 
 connection with <I>the Church</I> at Babylon, in which he labored under 
 Peter before he went to Alexandria is not unnatural. P<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>APIAS</FONT> reports from the presbyter John [E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>, <I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.39], that Mark 
 was interpreter of Peter, recording in his Gospel the facts related to 
 him by Peter. Silvanus or Silas had been substituted for John Mark, as 
 Paul's companion, because of Mark's temporary unfaithfulness. But now 
 Mark restored is associated with Silvanus, Paul's companion, in Peter's 
 esteem, as Mark was already reinstated in Paul's esteem. That Mark had 
 a spiritual connection with the Asiatic' churches which Peter 
 addresses, and so naturally salutes them, appears from

 <B>Babylon</B>--The Chaldean Babylon on the Euphrates. See

 <A HREF="#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>,

 <FONT SIZE=-1>ON THE PLACE OF WRITING</FONT> this Epistle, in proof 
 that <I>Rome</I> is not meant as Papists assert; compare L<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT> <I>sermon.</I> How unlikely that in a 
 <I>friendly salutation</I> the enigmatical title of Rome given in 
 <I>prophecy</I> (John,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:5">Re 17:5</A>),

 should be used! Babylon was the center from which the Asiatic 
 <I>dispersion</I> whom Peter addresses was derived.  
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>HILO</FONT> [<I>The Embassy to Gaius,</I> 36] and 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> [<I>Antiquities,</I> 15.2.2; 23.12]
 inform us that Babylon contained a great many Jews in the apostolic age 
 (whereas those at Rome were comparatively few, about eight thousand 
 [J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, <I>Antiquities,</I> 17.11]); so it 
 would naturally be visited by the apostle of the circumcision. It was 
 the headquarters of those whom he had so successfully addressed on 
 Pentecost,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:9">Ac 2:9</A>,

 Jewish "Parthians .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dwellers in Mesopotamia" (the 
 Parthians were then masters of Mesopotamian Babylon); these he 
 ministered to <I>in person.</I> His other hearers, the Jewish "dwellers 
 in Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia," he now ministers to 
 by letter. The earliest distinct authority for Peter's martyrdom <I>at 
 Rome</I> is D<FONT SIZE=-1>IONYSIUS</FONT>, bishop of Corinth, in the 
 latter half of the second century. The desirableness of representing 
 Peter and Paul, the two leading apostles, as together founding the 
 Church of the metropolis, seems to have originated the tradition. 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> R<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT> [<I>First 
 Epistle to the Corinthians,</I> 4.5], often quoted for, is really 
 against it. He mentions Paul and Peter together, but makes it as a 
 <I>distinguishing</I> circumstance of Paul, that he preached both in 
 the East and West, implying that Peter never was in the West. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:14">2Pe 1:14</A>,

 he says, "I must <I>shortly</I> put off this tabernacle," implying his 
 martyrdom was near, yet he makes no allusion to Rome, or any intention 
 of his visiting it.</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:16">Ro 16:16</A>,

 "an <I>holy</I> kiss": the token of love to God and the brethren.
 <I>Love</I> and <I>holiness</I> are inseparable. Compare the instance,

 <B>Peace</B>--Peter's closing salutation; as Paul's is, "Grace be with 
 you," though he accompanies it with "peace be to the brethren." "Peace" 
 (flowing from <I>salvation</I>) was Christ's own salutation after the 
 resurrection, and from Him Peter derives it.

 addressed to the same region, the same limitation of the salutation 
 occurs, whence, perhaps, Peter here adopts it. Contrast, "Be <I>with 
 you all,</I>"
