 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHOR</FONT>.--He calls himself in the address "the
 servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James." See

 <A HREF="JFB59.htm#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>

 <I>to the Epistle of James,</I> in proof of James the <I>apostle,</I>
 and James <I>the Lord's brother,</I> the bishop of Jerusalem, being one
 and the same person.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:19">Ga 1:19</A>

 alone seems to me to prove this. Similarly, Jude the brother of our
 Lord, and Jude the apostle, seem to be one and the same. J<FONT
 SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> [<I>Against Helvidius</I>], rightly maintains that
 by the Lord's brethren are meant his cousins, children of Mary and
 Cleophas (the same as Alph&aelig;us). From

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:5">1Co 9:5</A>

 (as "brethren of the Lord" stands between "other apostles" and 
 "Cephas"), it seems natural to think that the <I>brethren of the 
 Lord</I> are distinguished from the apostles only because <I>all</I> 
 his brethren were not apostles, but only James and Jude. Jude's reason 
 for calling himself "brother of James," was that James, as bishop of
 Jerusalem, was better known than himself. Had he been, in the strict 
 sense, <I>brother of our Lord,</I> he probably would have so entitled 
 himself.  His omission of mention of his <I>apostleship</I> is no proof 
 that he was not an apostle; for so also James omits it in his heading; 
 and Paul, in his Epistles to the Philippians, Thessalonians, and 
 Philemon, omits it.  Had the writer been a counterfeiter of the apostle 
 Jude, he would doubtless have called himself an "apostle." He was 
 called also Lebb&aelig;us and Thaddeus, probably to distinguish him 
 from Judas Iscariot, the traitor. Lebb&aelig;us, from <I>Hebrew</I> 
 "<I>leeb,</I>" "heart," means <I>courageous.</I> Thaddeus is the same 
 as Theudas, from <I>Hebrew</I> "<I>thad,</I>" the "breast." Luke and 
 John, writing later than Matthew, when there would be no confusion 
 between him and Judas Iscariot, give his name Judas. The only 
 circumstance relating to him recorded in the Gospels occurs in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:22">Joh 14:22</A>,

 "Judas saith unto Him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that Thou wilt
 manifest Thyself unto us, and not unto the world?" 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> [<I>Commentary on Matthew</I>] says that he
 was sent to Edessa, to Abgarus, king of Osroene, or Edessa, and that he 
 preached in Syria, Arabia, Mesopotamia, and Persia, in which last 
 country he suffered martyrdom. The story is told on E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>USEBIUS'</FONT> authority, that Abgarus, on his sickbed, having 
 heard of Jesus' power to heal, sent to beg Him to come and cure him, to 
 which the Lord replied, praising his faith, that though he had not seen 
 the Saviour, he yet believed; adding, "As for what thou hast written, 
 that I should come to thee, it is necessary that all those things for 
 which I was sent should be fulfilled by Me in this place, and that 
 having filled them I should be received up to Him that sent Me. When, 
 therefore, I shall be received into heaven, I will send unto thee some 
 one of My disciples who shall both heal thy distemper and give life to 
 thee and those with thee." Thomas is accordingly said to have been 
 inspired to send Thaddeus for the cure and baptism of Abgarus. The 
 letters are said to have been shown Thaddeus among the archives of
 Edessa. It is possible such a message was verbally sent, and the
 substance of it registered in writing afterwards (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:1-27,Mt+15:22">2Ki 5:1-27;
 and Mt 15:22</A>).

 H<FONT SIZE=-1>EGESIPPUS</FONT> (in E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>
 [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.20]) states that when Domitian 
 inquired after David's posterity, some grandsons of Jude, called the 
 Lord's brother, were brought into his presence. Being asked as to their 
 possessions, they said that they had thirty-nine acres of the value of 
 nine thousand denarii, out of which they paid him taxes, and lived by 
 the labor of their hands, a proof of which they gave by showing the 
 hardness of their hands. Being interrogated as to Christ and His 
 kingdom, they replied that it was not of this world, but heavenly; and 
 that it would be manifested at the end of the world, when He would come 
 in glory to judge the living and the dead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHENTICITY</FONT>.--E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>
 [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.25], reckons it among the
 <I>Antilegomena</I> or <I>controverted</I> Scriptures, "though
 recognized by the majority." The reference to the contest of Michael,
 the archangel, with the devil, for the body of Moses, not mentioned 
 elsewhere in the Old Testament, but found in the <I>apocryphal</I> 
 "Book of Enoch," probably raised doubts as to its authenticity, as 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> [<I>On Illustrious Men,</I> 4] says. 
 Moreover, its not being addressed to one particular Church, or 
 individual, caused it not to be so immediately recognized as canonical. 
 A counterfeiter would have avoided using what did not occur in the Old 
 Testament, and which might be regarded as apocryphal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As to the book of Enoch, if quoted by Jude, his quotation of a passage 
 from it gives an inspired sanction only to <I>the truth of that 
 passage,</I> not to the whole book; just as Paul, by inspiration, 
 sanctions particular sentiments from A<FONT SIZE=-1>RATUS</FONT>, 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>PIMENIDES</FONT>, and M<FONT SIZE=-1>ENANDER</FONT>, but 
 not all their writings. I think, rather as there is some slight 
 variation between Jude's statement and that of the book of Enoch, that 
 Jude, though probably not ignorant of the book of Enoch, stamps with 
 inspired sanction the current tradition of the Jews as to Enoch's 
 prophecies; just as Paul mentions the names of the Egyptian magicians,
 "Jannes and Jambres"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:8">2Ti 3:8</A>),

 not mentioned in the Old Testament. At all events, the prophecy
 ascribed to Enoch by Jude was really his, being sanctioned as such by
 this inspired writer. So also the narration as to the archangel
 Michael's dispute with Satan concerning the body of Moses, is by Jude's
 inspired authority

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:9">Jude 9</A>)

 declared true. The book of Enoch is quoted by
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>USTIN</FONT>
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ARTYR</FONT>,
 I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT>,
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT>
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT>, &c. Bruce, the Abyssinian traveller,
 brought home three copies of it in <I>Ethiopic,</I> from Alexandria, of 
 which Archbishop Lawrence, in 1821, gave an English translation. The 
 <I>Ethiopic</I> was a version from the <I>Greek,</I> and the 
 <I>Greek</I> doubtless a version from the <I>Hebrew,</I> as the names 
 of the angels in it show. The <I>Apostolic Constitutions,</I> O<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT> [<I>Against Celsus</I>], J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>, and A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT>, pronounce it 
 not canonical.  Yet it is in the main edifying, vindicating God's 
 government of the world, natural and spiritual, and contradicting none 
 of the Scripture statements. The name <I>Jesus</I> never occurs, though 
 "Son of man," so often given to Messiah in the Gospels, is frequent, 
 and terms are used expressive of His dignity, character, and acts, 
 exceeding the views of Messiah in any other Jewish book. The writer 
 seems to have been a Jew who had become thoroughly imbued with the 
 sacred writings of Daniel.  And, though many coincidences occur between 
 its sentiments and the New Testament, the Messianic portions are not 
 distinct enough to prove that the writer knew the New Testament. 
 Rather, he seems to have immediately preceded Christ's coming, about 
 the time of Herod the Great, and so gives us a most interesting view of 
 believing Jews' opinions before the advent of our Lord. The Trinity is 
 recognized (Enoch 60:13,14).  Messiah is "the elect One" existing from 
 eternity (Enoch 48:2,3,5); "All kings shall fall down before Him, and 
 worship and fix their hopes on this Son of man" (Enoch 61:10-13). He is 
 the object of worship (Enoch 48:3,4); He is the supreme Judge (Enoch 
 60:10,11; 68:38,39).  There shall be a future state of retribution 
 (Enoch 93:8,9; 94:2,4; 95; 96; 99; 103); The eternity of future 
 punishment (Enoch 103:5). V<FONT SIZE=-1>OLKMAR</FONT>, in A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, thinks the book was written at the time of the 
 sedition of Barchochebas (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 132), by a follower 
 of Rabbi Akiba, the upholder of that impostor. This would make the book 
 Antichristian in its origin. If this date be correct, doubtless it 
 copied some things from Jude, giving them the Jewish, not the 
 Christian, coloring.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Demonstration of the Gospel,</I> 3.5] 
 remarks, it accords with John's humility that in Second and Third John 
 he calls himself "the elder." For the same reason James and Jude call 
 themselves "servants of Jesus Christ." C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT> [<I>Adumbrations,</I> in <I>Epistle of 
 Jude,</I> p. 1007] says, "Jude, through reverential awe, did not call 
 himself <I>brother,</I> but <I>servant,</I> of Jesus Christ, and 
 brother of James."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT> [<I>On the Apparel of Women,</I> 3]
 cites the Epistle as that of the apostle James. 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT> in
 <I>Miscellanies</I> [3.2.11] quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:8,17">Jude 8, 17</A>

 as Scripture, in <I>The Instructor</I> [3.8.44],

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:5">Jude 5</A>.

 The M<FONT SIZE=-1>URATORI</FONT> fragment asserts its canonicity 
 [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OUTH</FONT>, <I>Sacred Fragments,</I> 1.306]. 
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT> [<I>Commentary</I> on Matthew 13:55] says,
 "Jude wrote an Epistle of few lines, but one filled full of the strong 
 words of heavenly grace." Also, in his <I>Commentary</I> on Matthew 
 22:23, O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT> quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:6">Jude 6</A>;

 and on Matthew 18:10, he quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:1">Jude 1</A>.

 He calls the writer "Jude the apostle," in the <I>Latin</I> remains of 
 his works (compare D<FONT SIZE=-1>AVIDSON</FONT>, <I>Introduction to 
 the New Testament,</I> vol. 3, p. 498). J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> 
 [<I>On Illustrious Men,</I> 4] reckons it among the Scriptures. Though 
 the oldest manuscripts of the Peschito omit it, E<FONT SIZE=-1>PHREM 
 THE</FONT> S<FONT SIZE=-1>YRIAN</FONT> recognizes it. W<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ORDSWORTH</FONT> reasons for its genuineness thus: Jude, we 
 know, died before John, that is, before the beginning of the second 
 century. Now E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical 
 History,</I> 3.32] tells us that James was succeeded in the bishopric 
 of Jerusalem by Symeon his brother; and also that Symeon sat in that 
 see till <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 107, when as a martyr he was 
 crucified in his hundred twentieth year. We find that the Epistle to 
 Jude was known in the East and West in the second century; it was 
 therefore circulated in Symeon's lifetime. It never would have received 
 currency such as it had, nor would Symeon have permitted a letter 
 bearing the name of an apostle, his own brother Jude, brother of his 
 own apostolical predecessor, James, to have been circulated, if it were 
 not really Jude's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>O WHOM ADDRESSED</FONT>.--The references to Old
 Testament history,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:5,7">Jude 5, 7</A>,

 and to Jewish tradition, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>,

 &c., make it likely that <I>Jewish</I> Christians are the readers to 
 whom Jude mainly (though including also <I>all</I> Christians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:1">Jude 1</A>)

 writes, just as the kindred Epistle, Second Peter, is addressed 
 primarily to the same class; compare

 <A HREF="JFB60.htm#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>
 
 to First Peter and

 <A HREF="JFB61.htm#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>
 
 to Second Peter.

 The persons stigmatized in it were not merely <I>libertines</I> (as 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> thinks), though no doubt that was one of 
 their prominent characteristics, but heretics in <I>doctrine,</I> 
 "denying the only Lord God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ." Hence he 
 urges believers "earnestly to contend for <I>the faith</I> once 
 delivered unto the saints"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:3">Jude 3</A>).

 Insubordination, self-seeking, and licentiousness, the fruit of 
 Antinomian teachings, were the evils against which Jude warns his 
 readers; reminding them that, to build themselves in their most holy 
 faith, and to pray in the Holy Ghost, are the only effectual 
 safeguards. The same evils, along with mocking skepticism, shall 
 characterize the last days before the final judgment, even as in the 
 days when Enoch warned the ungodly of the coming flood. As Peter was in 
 Babylon in writing

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:13">1Pe 5:13</A>,

 and probably also in writing Second Peter (compare

 <A HREF="JFB60.htm#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>
 
 to First Peter and

 <A HREF="JFB61.htm#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>

 to Second Peter), Jude addressed his Epistle primarily to <I>the Jewish 
 Christians in and about Mesopotamian Babylon</I> (a place of great 
 resort to the Jews in that day), or else to <I>the Christian Jews 
 dispersed in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1">1Pe 1:1</A>),

 the persons addressed by Peter. For Jude is expressly said to have 
 preached in <I>Mesopotamia</I> [J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>, 
 <I>Commentary on Matthew</I>], and his Epistle, consisting of only 
 twenty-five verses, contains in them no less than eleven passages from 
 Second Peter (see my

 <A HREF="JFB61.htm#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>
 
 to Second Peter for the list). Probably in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:4">Jude 4</A>

 he witnesses to the fulfilment of Peter's prophecy, "There <I>are</I> 
 certain men <I>crept in unawares,</I> who were before of old ordained 
 (rather as <I>Greek,</I> "forewritten," that is, announced 
 <I>beforehand</I> by the apostle Peter's <I>written</I> prophecy) to 
 this <I>condemnation,</I> ungodly men <I>denying</I> the only Lord God, 
 and our Lord Jesus Christ." Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:1">2Pe 2:1</A>,

 "There <I>shall</I> be false teachers among you who <I>privily</I> 
 shall bring in <I>damnable</I> heresies, even <I>denying the Lord</I> 
 that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift <I>destruction.</I>" 
 Also

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:17,18">Jude 17, 18</A>

 plainly refers to <I>the very words</I> of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:3">2Pe 3:3</A>,

 "Remember the words which were spoken before of the <I>apostles</I> of 
 our Lord Jesus; how they told you there should be <I>mockers in the 
 last time</I> who should <I>walk after their own</I> ungodly 
 <I>lusts.</I>" This proves, in opposition to A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, that Jude's Epistle is later than Peter's (whose 
 inspiration he thus confirms, just as Peter confirms Paul's,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:15,16">2Pe 3:15, 16</A>),

 not vice versa.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>IME AND PLACE OF 
 WRITING</FONT>.--A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> thinks, that, considering
 Jude was writing to Jews and citing signal instances of divine 
 vengeance, it is very unlikely he would have omitted to allude to the 
 destruction of Jerusalem if he had written after that event which 
 uprooted the Jewish polity and people.  He conjectures from the tone 
 and references that the writer lived in Palestine. But as to the 
 former, negative evidence is doubtful; for neither does John allude in 
 his Epistles, written after the destruction of Jerusalem, to that 
 event. M<FONT SIZE=-1>ILL</FONT> fixes on <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 90, 
 after the death of all the apostles save John.  I incline to think from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:17,18">Jude 17, 18</A>

 that some time had elapsed since the Second Epistle of Peter (written
 probably about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 68 or 69) when Jude wrote,
 and, therefore, that the Epistle of Jude was written <I>after</I> the
 destruction of Jerusalem.</P>

 God's eternal character as the Punisher of sin, as set forth in
 Scripture "of old," is the ground on which such apostate characters are 
 ordained to condemnation. Scripture is the reflection of God's book of 
 life in which believers are "written among the living." "Forewritten" 
 is applied also in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:4">Ro 15:4</A>

 to the things written in Scripture. Scripture itself reflects God's 
 character from everlasting, which is the ground of His decrees from 
 everlasting.  B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> explains it as an abbreviated 
 phrase for, "They were <I>of old foretold</I> by Enoch

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>,

 were present before the eyes, "<FONT SIZE=-1>THIS</FONT>." Enoch's

 before the flood, the type of the last judgment

 be, not that the angels carnally <I>fornicated</I> with the daughters 
 of men, but that their ambition, whereby their affections went <I>away 
 from</I> God and they fell, is in God's view a sin of like kind 
 spiritually as Sodom's going <I>away</I> from God's order of nature 
 after strange flesh; the sin of the apostate angels after their kind is 
 analogous to that of the human Sodomites after their kind. Compare the

 kept them <I>in His purpose;</I> that is their sure doom; moreover, as 
 yet, Satan and his demons roam at large on the earth. An earnest of 
 their doom is their having been cast out of heaven, being already 
 restricted to "the darkness of this present world," the "air" that 
 surrounds the earth, their peculiar element now. They lurk in places of 
 gloom and death, looking forward with agonizing fear to their final 
 torment in the bottomless pit. He means not literal chains and 
 darkness, but figurative in this present world where, with restricted

 <B>about the body of Moses</B>--his literal body. Satan, as having the 
 power of death, opposed the raising of it again, on the ground of 
 Moses' sin at Meribah, and his murder of the Egyptian. That Moses' body 
 was raised, appears from his presence with Elijah and Jesus (who were 
 in the body) at the Transfiguration: the sample and earnest of the 
 coming resurrection kingdom, to be ushered in by Michael's standing up 
 for God's people. Thus in each dispensation a sample and pledge of the 
 future resurrection was given: Enoch in the patriarchal dispensation, 
 Moses in the Levitical, Elijah in the prophetical. It is noteworthy 
 that the same rebuke is recorded here as was used by the Angel of the 
 Lord, or Jehovah the Second Person, in pleading for Joshua, the 
 representative of the Jewish Church, against Satan, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:2">Zec 3:2</A>;

 whence some have thought that also here "the body of Moses" means the 
 Jewish Church accused by Satan, before God, for its filthiness, on 
 which ground he demands that divine justice should take its course 
 against Israel, but is rebuked by the Lord who has "chosen Jerusalem": 
 thus, as "the body of Christ" is <I>the Christian Church,</I> so "the 
 body of Moses" is the Jewish Church. But the literal body is evidently 
 here meant (though, secondarily, the Jewish Church is typified by 
 Moses' body, as it was there represented by Joshua the high priest); 
 and Michael, whose connection seems to be so close with Jehovah-Messiah 
 on the one hand, and with Israel on the other, naturally uses the same 
 language as his Lord. As Satan (<I>adversary</I> in court) or the devil 
 (<I>accuser</I>) accuses alike the Church collectively and "the 
 brethren" individually, so Christ pleads for us as our Advocate. 
 Israel's, and all believers' full justification, and the accuser's 
 being rebuked finally, is yet future. J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> 
 [<I>Antiquities,</I>4.8], states that God hid Moses' body, lest, if it 
 had been exposed to view, it would have been made an idol of. Jude, in 
 this account, either adopts it from the apocryphal "assumption of 
 Moses" (as O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT> [<I>Concerning 
 Principalities,</I> 3.2] thinks), or else from the ancient tradition on 
 which that work was founded. <I>Jude,</I> as inspired, could 
 distinguish how much of the tradition was true, how much false. 
 <I>We</I> have no such means of distinguishing, and therefore can be 
 sure of no tradition, save that which is in the <I>written word.</I>

 rail even at the time when he fought with the devil, the prince of evil 
 spirits--not from fear of him, but from reverence of God, whose 
 delegated power in this world Satan once had, and even in some degree

 the same as Peter, read here "deceivings" for "love-feasts," but the 
 weightiest manuscript and authorities support <I>English Version</I> 
 reading. The love-feast accompanied the Lord's Supper

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:17-34">1Co 11:17-34</A>,

 to the <I>sacrificing priesthood</I> also: so ministers in the Lord's 
 Supper have sought to make it a <I>sacrifice,</I> and themselves the 
 <I>sacrificing</I> priests, usurping the function of our only Christian 
 sacerdotal <I>Priest,</I> Christ Jesus. Let them beware of Korah's

 <I>with fear.</I> Feasting is not faulty in itself [B<FONT

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14.</B> See

 <A HREF="#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>

 on the source whence Jude derived this prophecy of Enoch. The Holy
 Spirit, by Jude, has sealed the truth of this much of the matter 
 contained in the book of Enoch, though probably that book, as well as 
 Jude, derived it from tradition (compare <I>Note,</I> see on

 <A HREF="#Jude1_9">Jude 9</A>). 

 There are reasons given by some for thinking the book of Enoch copied 
 from Jude rather than vice versa. It is striking how, from the first, 
 prophecy hastened towards its consummation. The earliest prophecies of 
 the Redeemer dwell on His second coming in glory, rather than His first 
 coming in lowliness (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15,Ro+16:20">Ge 3:15
 with Ro 16:20</A>).

 Enoch, in his translation without death, illustrated that truth which
 he all his life preached to the unbelieving world, the certainty of the 
 Lord's coming, and the resurrection of the dead, as the only effectual 
 antidote to their skepticism and self-wise confidence in nature's 
 permanence.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>And Enoch</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "Moreover, also Enoch," &c.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>seventh from Adam</B>--<I>Seven</I> is the sacred number. In Enoch, 
 freedom from death and the sacred number are combined: for every 
 seventh object is most highly valued. Jude thus shows the antiquity of 
 the prophecies.  Compare <I>Note,</I> see on

 <A HREF="#Jude1_4">Jude 4</A>, 

 "of old." There were only <I>five</I> fathers between Enoch and Adam. 
 The <I>seventh</I> from Adam prophesied the things which shall close 
 the <I>seventh age</I> of the world [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of these</B>--in relation to these. The reference of his prophecies 
 was not to the antediluvians alone, but to <I>all</I> the ungodly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:15">Jude 15</A>).

 His prophecy applied primarily indeed to the flood, but ultimately to 
 the final judgment.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>cometh</B>--literally, "came." Prophecy regards the future as 
 certain as if it were <I>past.</I>

 think Lamech's speech, which is also in poetic parallelism, was 
 composed in mockery of Enoch's prophecy: as Enoch foretold Jehovah's 
 coming to judgment, so Lamech presumes on impunity in polygamy and 
 murder (just as Cain the murderer seemed to escape with impunity).

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:18">Jude 18</A>,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:2,3">2Pe 3:2, 3</A>

 is referred to (at least in part), I cannot imagine, seeing that Jude 
 quotes the very words of <I>Peter</I> as the words which <I>the 
 apostles</I> used to speak to his (Jude's) readers.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>walk after their own ungodly lusts</B>--literally, "after (according

 Peter and Paul had foretold.

 spiritual reality: for outwardly they took part in Church ordinances

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:12">Jude 12</A>).

 Some oldest manuscripts omit "themselves": then understand it, 
 "separate," cast out members of the Church by excommunication

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:5,66:5,Lu+6:22,Joh+9:34">Isa 65:5; 66:5;

 compare "casteth them out of the Church;"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:10">3Jo 10</A>).

 Many, however, understand "themselves," which indeed is read in some of 
 the oldest manuscripts as <I>English Version</I> has it. Arrogant 
 setting up of themselves, as having greater sanctity and a wisdom and 
 peculiar doctrine, distinct from others, is implied.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>sensual</B>--literally, "animal-souled": as opposed to the 
 <I>spiritual,</I> or "having the Spirit." It is translated, "the 
 <I>natural</I> man,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:14">1Co 2:14</A>.

 In the threefold division of man's being, <I>body, soul, and 
 spirit,</I> the due state in God's design is, that "the spirit," which 
 is the recipient of the Holy Spirit uniting man to God, should be 
 first, and should rule the soul, which stands intermediate between 
 <I>the body</I> and <I>spirit:</I> but in the <I>animal,</I> or 
 <I>natural</I> man, the spirit is sunk into subserviency to the animal 
 soul, which is earthly in its motives and aims. The "carnal" sink 
 somewhat lower, for in these <I>the flesh,</I> the lowest element and 
 corrupt side of man's bodily nature, reigns paramount.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>having not the Spirit</B>--In the animal and natural man <I>the 
 spirit,</I> his higher part, which ought to be the receiver of the Holy 
 Spirit, is not so; and therefore, his spirit not being in its normal 
 state, he is said <I>not to have the spirit</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:5,6">Joh 3:5, 6</A>).

 In the completion of redemption the parts of redeemed man shall be 
 placed in their due relation: whereas in the ungodly, <I>the soul</I> 
 severed from <I>the spirit</I> shall have for ever animal life without 
 union to God and heaven--a living death.</P>

 None can pray aright save by being <I>in the Spirit,</I> that is, in

 that, among the charisms bestowed at the beginning of the New Testament 
 dispensation, was <I>the gift of prayer,</I> bestowed on someone who 
 prayed in the name of the rest, and taught others to pray. Moreover, 
 their prayers so conceived and often used, were received and preserved

 The three classes are: (1) those who <I>contend with you</I> 
 (accusative case in oldest manuscripts), whom you should 
 <I>convict;</I> (2) those who are as brands already in <I>the fire,</I>
