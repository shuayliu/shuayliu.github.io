 <B>1, 2. a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim</B>--The first word being in the
 dual number, signifies the double city--the old and new town of Ramah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:19">1Sa 1:19</A>).

 There were five cities of this name, all on high ground.  This city had
 the addition of Zophim attached to it, because it was founded by Zuph, 
 "an Ephrathite," that is a native of Ephratha.  Beth-lehem, and the 
 expression "of Ramathaim-zophim" must, therefore, be understood as 
 Ramah in the land of Zuph in the hill country of Ephratha. Others, 
 considering "mount Ephraim" as pointing to the locality in Joseph's 
 territory, regard "Zophim" not as a proper but a common noun, 
 signifying watchtowers, or watchmen, with reference either to the 
 height of its situation, or its being the residence of prophets who 
 were watchmen

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:17">Eze 3:17</A>).

 Though a native of Ephratha or Beth-lehem-judah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:2">Ru 1:2</A>),

 Elkanah was a Levite

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:33,34">1Ch 6:33, 34</A>).

 Though of this order, and a good man, he practised polygamy. This was
 contrary to the original law, but it seems to have been prevalent among 
 the Hebrews in those days, when there was no king in Israel, and every 
 man did what seemed right in his own eyes

 <B>3. this man went up out of his city yearly to worship in Shiloh</B>--In
 that place was the "earth's one sanctuary," and thither he repaired at
 the three solemn feasts, accompanied by his family at one of
 them--probably the passover. Although a Levite, he could not personally
 offer a sacrifice--that was exclusively the office of the priests; and
 his piety in maintaining a regular attendance on the divine ordinances
 is the more worthy of notice because the character of the two priests
 who administered them was notoriously bad. But doubtless he believed,
 and acted on the belief, that the ordinances were "effectual means of
 salvation, not from any virtue in them, or in those who administered
 them, but from the grace of God being communicated through them."</P>

 <B>4. when .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. portions</B>--The

 before the Lord. (See on

 <A HREF="JFB03.htm#Le3_3">Le 3:3</A>;

 <A HREF="JFB05.htm#De12_12">De 12:12</A>).

 It was out of these consecrated viands Elkanah gave portions to all the
 members of his family; but "unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion"; that
 is, a larger choice, according to the Eastern fashion of showing regard
 to beloved or distinguished guests. (See on

 been jealousy of the husband's superior affection, as in this case of
 Hannah.</P>

 <B>11. she prayed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she vowed a vow</B>--Here is a specimen of the intense
 desire that reigned in the bosoms of the Hebrew women for children.
 This was the burden of Hannah's prayer; and the strong preference she
 expressed for a male child originated in her purpose of dedicating him
 to the tabernacle service. The circumstance of his birth bound him to
 this; but his residence within the precincts of the sanctuary would
 have to commence at an earlier age than usual, in consequence of the
 Nazarite vow.</P>

 <B>12-18. Eli marked her mouth</B>--The suspicion of the aged priest seems to
 indicate that the vice of intemperance was neither uncommon nor
 confined to one sex in those times of disorder. This mistaken
 impression was immediately removed, and, in the words, "God grant," or
 rather, "will grant," was followed by an invocation which, as Hannah
 regarded it in the light of a prophecy pointing to the accomplishment
 of her earnest desire, dispelled her sadness, and filled her with
 confident hope 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:18">1Sa 1:18</A>].

 The character and services of the expected child were sufficiently

 names of children were given sometimes by the fathers, and sometimes by
 the mothers (see

 But Hannah, like other pious women, was in the habit of going, only she

 <B>mine horn is exalted in the Lord</B>--Allusion is here made to a
 peculiarity in the dress of Eastern women about Lebanon, which seems to
 have obtained anciently among the Israelite women, that of wearing a
 tin or silver horn on the forehead, on which their veil is suspended.
 Wives, who have no children, wear it projecting in an oblique
 direction, while those who become mothers forthwith raise it a few
 inches higher, inclining towards the perpendicular, and by this slight
 but observable change in their headdress, make known, wherever they go,
 the maternal character which they now bear.</P>

 heaped up to dry in the sun, and used as fuel, was, and is, one of the
 common haunts of the poorest mendicants; and the change that had been
 made in the social position of Hannah, appeared to her grateful heart
 as auspicious and as great as the elevation of a poor despised beggar

 <B>10. the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. exalt the horn of
 his anointed</B>--This is the first place in Scripture where the word
 "anointed," or Messiah, occurs; and as there was no king in Israel at
 the time, it seems the best interpretation to refer it to Christ. There
 is, indeed, a remarkable resemblance between the song of Hannah and
 that of Mary

 <B>12. Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial</B>--not only careless and
 irreligious, but men loose in their actions, and vicious and scandalous
 in their habits. Though professionally engaged in sacred duties, they
 were not only strangers to the power of religion in the heart, but they
 had thrown off its restraints, and even ran, as is sometimes done in
 similar cases by the sons of eminent ministers, to the opposite extreme
 of reckless and open profligacy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13-17. the priests' custom with the people</B>--When persons wished to
 present a sacrifice of peace offering on the altar, the offering was
 brought in the first instance to the priest, and as the Lord's part was
 burnt, the parts appropriated respectively to the priests and offerers
 were to be sodden. But Eli's sons, unsatisfied with the breast and
 shoulder, which were the perquisites appointed to them by the divine
 law 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:27,Le+7:31,32">Ex 29:27;
 Le 7:31, 32</A>), 

 not only claimed part of the offerer's share, but rapaciously seized
 them previous to the sacred ceremony of heaving or waving (see on

 <A HREF="JFB03.htm#Le7_29">Le 7:29</A>);

 and moreover they committed the additional injustice of taking up with
 their fork those portions which they preferred, while still raw. Pious 
 people revolted at such rapacious and profane encroachments on the dues 
 of the altar, as well as what should have gone to constitute the family 
 and social feast of the offerer. The truth is, the priests having 
 become haughty and unwilling in many instances to accept invitations to 
 those feasts, presents of meat were sent to them; and this, though done 
 in courtesy at first, being, in course of time, established into a 
 right, gave rise to all the rapacious keenness of Eli's sons.</P>

 priest's family.

 apparel. All weaving stuffs, manufacture of cloth, and making of suits
 were anciently the employment of women.</P>

 appeared in the increase of Hannah's family

 institution which continued down to the time of Christ 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:37">Lu 2:37</A>).

 Eli was, on the whole, a good man, but lacking in the moral and
 religious training of his family. He erred on the side of parental 
 indulgence; and though he reprimanded them (see on

 <A HREF="JFB05.htm#De21_18">De 21:18</A>),

 yet, from fear or indolence, he shrank from laying on them the
 restraints, or subjecting them to the discipline, their gross 
 delinquencies called for. In his judicial capacity, he winked at their 
 flagrant acts of maladministration and suffered them to make reckless 
 encroachments on the constitution, by which the most serious injuries 
 were inflicted both on the rights of the people and the laws of 
 God.</P>

 <B>27. there came a man of God unto Eli, and said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that there shall not

 East, been attached to old age, that it would be felt to be a great
 calamity, and sensibly to lower the respectability of any family which
 could boast of few or no old men. The prediction of this prophet was
 fully confirmed by the afflictions, degradation, poverty, and many
 untimely deaths with which the house of Eli was visited after its
 announcement (see

 <B>1. the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli</B>--His ministry
 consisted, of course, of such duties in or about the sanctuary as were
 suited to his age, which is supposed now to have been about twelve
 years. Whether the office had been specially assigned him, or it arose
 from the interest inspired by the story of his birth, Eli kept him as
 his immediate attendant; and he resided not <I>in</I> the sanctuary, but in
 one of the tents or apartments around it, assigned for the
 accommodation of the priests and Levites, <I>his</I> being near to that of
 the high priest.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the word of the Lord was precious in those days</B>--It was very rarely
 known to the Israelites; and in point of fact only two prophets are
 mentioned as having appeared during the whole administration of the
 judges

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>there was no open vision</B>--no publicly recognized prophet whom the
 people could consult, and from whom they might learn the will of God.
 There must have been certain indubitable evidences by which a
 communication from heaven could be distinguished. Eli knew them, for he
 may have received them, though not so frequently as is implied in the
 idea of an "open vision."</P>

 <B>5-18. he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me</B>--It is
 evident that his sleeping chamber was close to that of the aged high
 priest and that he was accustomed to be called during the night. The three
 successive calls addressed to the boy convinced Eli of the divine
 character of the speaker, and he therefore exhorted the child to give a
 reverential attention to the message. The burden of [the Lord's
 message] was an extraordinary premonition of the judgments that
 impended over Eli's house; and the aged priest, having drawn the
 painful secret from the child, exclaimed, "It is the Lord; let him do
 what seemeth him good." Such is the spirit of meek and unmurmuring
 submission in which we ought to receive the dispensations of God,
 however severe and afflictive. But, in order to form a right estimate
 of Eli's language and conduct on this occasion, we must consider the
 overwhelming accumulation of judgments denounced against his person,
 his sons, his descendants--his altar, and nation. With such a
 threatening prospect before him, his piety and meekness were wonderful.
 In his personal character he seems to have been a good man, but his
 sons' conduct was flagrantly bad; and though his misfortunes claim our
 sympathy, it is impossible to approve or defend the weak and unfaithful
 course which, in the retributive justice of God, brought these
 adversities upon him.</P>

 <B>1. the word of Samuel came to all Israel</B>--The character of Samuel as a
 prophet was now fully established. The want of an "open vision" was
 supplied by him, for "none of his words were let fall to the ground"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:19">1Sa 3:19</A>);

 and to his residence in Shiloh all the people of Israel repaired to
 consult him as an oracle, who, as the medium of receiving the divine 
 command, or by his gift of a prophet, could inform them what was the 
 mind of God. It is not improbable that the rising influence of the 
 young prophet had alarmed the jealous fears of the Philistines. They 
 had kept the Israelites in some degree of subjection ever since the 
 death of Samson and were determined, by further crushing, to prevent 
 the possibility of their being trained by the counsels, and under the 
 leadership, of Samuel, to reassert their national independence. At all 
 events, the Philistines were the aggressors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:2">1Sa 4:2</A>).

 But, on the other hand, the Israelites were rash and inconsiderate in
 rushing to the field without obtaining the sanction of Samuel as to the 
 war, or having consulted him as to the subsequent measures they took.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Israel went out against the Philistines to battle</B>--that is, to resist
 this new incursion.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Eben-ezer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Aphek</B>--Aphek, which means "strength," is a name applied
 to any fort or fastness. There were several Apheks in Palestine; but
 the mention of Eben-ezer determines this "Aphek" to be in the south,
 among the mountains of Judah, near the western entrance of the pass of
 Beth-horon, and consequently on the borders of the Philistine territory.
 The first encounter at Aphek being unsuccessful, the Israelites
 determined to renew the engagement in better circumstances.</P>

 <B>3-9. Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh
 unto us</B>--Strange that they were so blind to the real cause of the
 disaster and that they did not discern, in the great and general
 corruption of religion and morals 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:22-25,7:3,Ps+78:58">1Sa 2:22-25; 7:3;
 Ps 78:58</A>), 

 the reason why the presence and aid of God were not extended to them.
 Their first measure for restoring the national spirit and energy ought 
 to have been a complete reformation--a universal return to purity of 
 worship and morals. But, instead of cherishing a spirit of deep 
 humiliation and sincere repentance, instead of resolving on the 
 abolition of existing abuses, and the re-establishing of the pure 
 faith, they adopted what appeared an easier and speedier course--they 
 put their trust in ceremonial observances, and doubted not but that the 
 introduction of the ark into the battlefield would ensure their 
 victory. In recommending this extraordinary step, the elders might 
 recollect the confidence it imparted to their ancestors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:35,14:44">Nu 10:35; 14:44</A>),

 as well as what had been done at Jericho. But it is more probable that
 they were influenced by the heathenish ideas of their idolatrous 
 neighbors, who carried their idol Dagon, or his sacred symbols, to 
 their wars, believing that the power of their divinities was 
 inseparably associated with, or residing in, their images. In short, 
 the shout raised in the Hebrew camp, on the arrival of the ark, 
 indicated very plainly the prevalence among the Israelites at this time 
 of a belief in national deities--whose influence was local, and whose 
 interest was especially exerted in behalf of the people who adored 
 them. The joy of the Israelites was an emotion springing out of the 
 same superstitious sentiments as the corresponding dismay of their 
 enemies; and to afford them a convincing, though painful proof of their 
 error, was the ulterior object of the discipline to which they were now 
 subjected--a discipline by which God, while punishing them for their 
 apostasy by allowing the capture of the ark, had another end in 
 view--that of signally vindicating His supremacy over all the gods of 
 the nations.</P>

 <B>13-18. Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside</B>--The aged priest, as a public
 magistrate, used, in dispensing justice, to seat himself daily in a
 spacious recess at the entrance gate of the city. In his intense
 anxiety to learn the issue of the battle, he took up his usual place as
 the most convenient for meeting with passers-by. His seat was an
 official chair, similar to those of the ancient Egyptian judges, richly
 carved, superbly ornamented, high, and <I>without a back.</I> The calamities
 announced to Samuel as about to fall upon the family of Eli

 by that of his daughter-in-law, whose infant son received a name that
 perpetuated the fallen glory of the church and nation

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:19-22">1Sa 4:19-22</A>].
 
 The public disaster was completed by the capture of the ark. Poor Eli!
 He was a good man, in spite of his unhappy weaknesses. So strongly were
 his sensibilities enlisted on the side of religion, that the news of
 the capture of the ark proved to him a knell of death; and yet his
 overindulgence, or sad neglect of his family--the main cause of all the
 evils that led to its fall--has been recorded, as a beacon to warn all
 heads of Christian families against making shipwreck on the same rock.</P>

 the symbol of the divine presence. Though set up, it fell again, and
 lay in a state of complete mutilation; its head and arms, severed from
 the trunk, were lying in distant and separate places, as if violently
 cast off, and only the fishy part remained. The degradation of their
 idol, though concealed by the priests on the former occasion, was now
 more manifest and infamous. It lay in the attitude of a vanquished
 enemy and a suppliant, and this picture of humiliation significantly
 declared the superiority of the God of Israel.</P>

 Beth-shemesh reapers pried into it beneath the wagon cover; and instead
 of covering it up again, as a sacred utensil, they let it remain
 exposed to common inspection, wishing it to be seen, in order that all
 might enjoy the triumph of seeing the votive offerings presented to it,
 and gratify curiosity with the sight of the sacred shrine. This was the
 offense of those Israelites (Levites, as well as common people), who
 had treated the ark with less reverence than the Philistines
 themselves.

 <B>he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten
 men</B>--Beth-shemesh being only a village, this translation <I>must</I> be
 erroneous, and should be, "he smote fifty out of a thousand," being

 reformation was effected through the influence of Samuel. Disgusted
 with their foreign servitude, and panting for the restoration of
 liberty and independence, they were open to salutary impressions; and
 convinced of their errors, they renounced idolatry. The
 re-establishment of the faith of their fathers was inaugurated at a
 great public meeting, held at Mizpeh in Judah, and hallowed by the
 observance of impressive religious solemnities. The drawing water, and
 pouring it out before the Lord, seems to have been a symbolical act by
 which, in the people's name, Samuel testified their sense of national
 corruption, their need of that moral purification of which water is the
 emblem, and their sincere desire to pour out their hearts in repentance
 before God.</P>

 <B>7-11. when the Philistines heard,</B> &c.--The character and importance of
 the national convention at Mizpeh were fully appreciated by the
 Philistines. They discerned in it the rising spirit of religious
 patriotism among the Israelites that was prepared to throw off the yoke
 of their domination. Anxious to crush it at the first, they made a
 sudden incursion while the Israelites were in the midst of their solemn
 celebration. Unprepared for resistance, they besought Samuel to
 supplicate the divine interposition to save them from their enemies.
 The prophet's prayers and sacrifice were answered by such a tremendous
 storm of thunder and lightning that the assailants, panic-struck, were
 disordered and fled. The Israelites, recognizing the hand of God,
 rushed courageously on the foe they had so much dreaded and committed
 such immense havoc, that the Philistines did not for long recover from
 this disastrous blow. This brilliant victory secured peace and
 independence to Israel for twenty years, as well as the restitution of
 the usurped territory.</P>

 <B>1-5. when Samuel was old</B>--He was now about fifty-four years of age,
 having discharged the office of sole judge for twelve years. Unable,
 from growing infirmities, to prosecute his circuit journeys through the
 country, he at length confined his magisterial duties to Ramah and its
 neighborhood 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:15">1Sa 7:15</A>),

 delegating to his sons as his deputies the administration of justice in
 the southern districts of Palestine, their provincial court being held 
 at Beer-sheba. The young men, however, did not inherit the high 
 qualities of their father. Having corrupted the fountains of justice 
 for their own private aggrandizement, a deputation of the leading men 
 in the country lodged a complaint against them in headquarters, 
 accompanied with a formal demand for a change in the government. The 
 limited and occasional authority of the judges, the disunion and 
 jealousy of the tribes under the administration of those rulers, had 
 been creating a desire for a united and permanent form of government; 
 while the advanced age of Samuel, together with the risk of his death 
 happening in the then unsettled state of the people, was the occasion 
 of calling forth an expression of this desire now.</P>

 <B>6-10. the thing displeased Samuel when they said, Give us a king to
 judge us</B>--Personal and family feelings might affect his views of
 this public movement. But his dissatisfaction arose principally from
 the proposed change being revolutionary in its character. Though it
 would not entirely subvert their theocratic government, the appointment
 of a visible monarch would necessarily tend to throw out of view their
 unseen King and Head. God intimated, through Samuel, that their request
 would, in anger, be granted, while at the same time he apprised them of
 some of the evils that would result from their choice.</P>

 monarchy, notwithstanding the restrictions prescribed by the law,
 gradually slid.

 affected humility, which Oriental people are wont to use.</P>

 <B>3. the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. arise, go seek the asses</B>--The probability is that the family of
 Kish, according to the immemorial usage of Oriental shepherds in the
 purely pastoral regions, had let the animals roam at large during the
 grazing season, at the close of which messengers were despatched in
 search of them. Such travelling searches are common; and, as each
 owner has his own stamp marked on his cattle, the mention of it to the
 shepherds he meets gradually leads to the discovery of the strayed
 animals. This ramble of Saul's had nothing extraordinary in it, except
 its <I>superior</I> directions and issue, which turned its uncertainty into
 certainty.</P>

 <B>4, 5. he passed through mount Ephraim</B>--This being situated on the
 north of Benjamin, indicates the direction of Saul's journey. The
 district explored means the whole of the mountainous region, with its
 valleys and defiles, which belonged to Ephraim. Turning apparently
 southwards--probably through the verdant hills between Shiloh and the
 vales of Jordan (Shalisha and Shalim)--he approached again the borders
 of Benjamin, scoured the land of Zuph, and was proposing to return,
 when his servant recollected that they were in the immediate
 neighborhood of the man of God, who would give them counsel.</P>

 Rachel's sepulchre, which lay in Saul's way homeward 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:2">1Sa 10:2</A>],
 
 lead to the conclusion that "this city" was not the Ramah where Samuel
 dwelt.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>peradventure he can show us our way that we should go</B>--It seems strange
 that a dignified prophet should be consulted in such an affair. But it
 is probable that at the introduction of the prophetic office, the seers
 had discovered things lost or stolen, and thus their power for higher
 revelations was gradually established.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>7. Saul said to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring
 the man?</B>--According to Eastern notions, it would be considered a want
 of respect for any person to go into the presence of a superior man of
 rank or of official station without a present of some kind in his hand,
 however trifling in value.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the bread is spent in our vessels</B>--Shepherds, going in quest of their
 cattle, put up in a bag as much flour for making bread as will last
 sometimes for thirty days. It appears that Saul thought of giving the
 man of God a cake from his travelling bag, and this would have been
 sufficient to render the indispensable act of civility--the customary
 tribute to official dignity.</P>

 on an eminence; and on their way they met a band of young maidens going
 out to the well, which, like all similar places in Palestine, was
 beyond the precincts of the town. From these damsels they learned that
 the day was devoted to a festival occasion, in honor of which Samuel
 had arrived in the city; that a sacrifice had been offered, which was
 done by prophets in extraordinary circumstances at a distance from the
 tabernacle, and that a feast was to follow--implying that it had been a
 peace offering; and that, according to the venerable practice of the
 Israelites, the man of God was expected to ask a special blessing on
 the food in a manner becoming the high occasion.</P>

 description of Saul, the time of his arrival, and the high office to
 which he was destined, had been secretly intimated to Samuel from
 heaven. The future king of Israel was to fight the battles of the Lord
 and protect His people. It would appear that they were at this time
 suffering great molestation from the Philistines, and that this was an
 additional reason of their urgent demands for the appointment of a king

 in earnest.</P>

 This was, most probably, the right shoulder;
 which, as the perquisite of the sacrifice, belonged to Samuel, and
 which he had set aside for his expected guest. In the sculptures of the
 Egyptian shambles, also, the first joint taken off was always the right
 shoulder for the priest. The meaning of those distinguished attentions

 there 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:6">Jos 2:6</A>),

 when, doubtless, Samuel revealed the secret and described the peculiar
 duties of a monarch in a nation so related to the Divine King as 
 Israel. Next morning early, Samuel roused his guest, and conveying him 
 on his way towards the skirts of the city, sought, before parting, a

 ceremony of investiture with the royal office among the Hebrews and

 which was meant to be only a prophetic intimation of the person

 was performed by the high priest, and perhaps with the holy oil, but
 that is not certain. The first of a dynasty was thus anointed, but not 
 his heirs, unless the succession was disputed

 and he lived; that in every great crisis, such as a hostile incursion
 on the country, he should repair to Gilgal, where he was to remain

 is passed over, but the third is specially described.  The spectacle of
 a man, though more fit to look after his father's cattle than to take 
 part in the sacred exercises of the young prophets--a man without any 
 previous instruction, or any known taste, entering with ardor into the 
 spirit, and skilfully accompanying the melodies of the sacred band, was 
 so extraordinary a phenomenon, that it gave rise to the proverb, "Is 
 Saul also among the prophets?" (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:24">1Sa 19:24</A>).

 The prophetic spirit had come upon him; and to Saul it was as personal
 and experimental an evidence of the truth of God's word that had been 
 spoken to him, as converts to Christianity have in themselves from the 
 sanctifying power of the Gospel.</P>

 <B>17-25. Samuel called the people together .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at Mizpeh</B>--a shaft-like
 hill near Hebron, five hundred feet in height. The national assemblies
 of the Israelites were held there. A day having been appointed for the
 election of a king, Samuel, after having charged the people with a
 rejection of God's institution and a superseding of it by one of their
 own, proceeded to the nomination of the new monarch. As it was of the
 utmost importance that the appointment should be under the divine
 direction and control, the determination was made by the miraculous
 lot, tribes, families, and individuals being successively passed until
 Saul was found. His concealment of himself must have been the result
 either of innate modesty, or a sudden nervous excitement under the
 circumstances. When dragged into view, he was seen to possess all those
 corporeal advantages which a rude people desiderate in their
 sovereigns; and the exhibition of which gained for the prince the
 favorable opinion of Samuel also. In the midst of the national
 enthusiasm, however, the prophet's deep piety and genuine patriotism
 took care to explain "the manner of the kingdom," that is, the royal
 rights and privileges, together with the limitations to which they were
 to be subjected; and in order that the constitution might be ratified
 with all due solemnity, the charter of this constitutional monarchy was
 recorded and laid up "before the Lord," that is, deposited in the
 custody of the priests, along with the most sacred archives of the
 nation.</P>

 about five miles north of Jerusalem.

 honor of the sovereign and the splendor of the royal household are
 upheld, not by a fixed rate of taxation, but by presents brought at
 certain seasons by officials, and men of wealth, from all parts of the
 kingdom, according to the means of the individual, and of a customary
 registered value. Such was the tribute which Saul's opponents withheld,
 and for want of which he was unable to set up a kingly establishment
 for a while. But "biding his time," he bore the insult with a prudence
 and magnanimity which were of great use in the beginning of his
 government.</P>

 the Jabeshites useful as tributaries, whence he did not wish to render

 This particular form of war-summons was suited to the character and
 habits of an agricultural and pastoral people. Solemn in itself, the 
 denunciation that accompanied it carried a terrible threat to those 
 that neglected to obey it. Saul conjoins the name of Samuel with his 
 own, to lend the greater influence to the measure, and to strike 
 greater terror unto all contemners of the order. The small contingent 
 furnished by Judah suggests that the disaffection to Saul was strongest

 vengeance on the minority who opposed Saul, had not he, either from
 principle or policy, shown himself as great in clemency as in valor.
 The calm and sagacious counsel of Samuel directed the popular feelings
 into a right channel, by appointing a general assembly of the militia,
 the really effective force of the nation, at Gilgal, where, amid great
 pomp and religious solemnities, the victorious leader was confirmed in

 <B>17-25. Is it not wheat harvest to-day?</B>--That season in Palestine
 occurs at the end of June or beginning of July, when it seldom or never
 rains, and the sky is serene and cloudless. There could not, therefore,
 have been a stronger or more appropriate proof of a divine mission than
 the phenomenon of rain and thunder happening, without any prognostics
 of its approach, upon the prediction of a person professing himself to
 be a prophet of the Lord, and giving it as an attestation of his words
 being true. The people regarded it as a miraculous display of divine
 power, and, panic-struck, implored the prophet to pray for them.
 Promising to do so, he dispelled their fears. The conduct of Samuel,
 in this whole affair of the king's appointment, shows him to have been
 a great and good man who sank all private and personal considerations
 in disinterested zeal for his country's good and whose last words in
 public were to warn the people, and their king, of the danger of
 apostasy and disobedience to God.</P>

 demolition of this standard, so obnoxious to a young and noble-hearted

 <B>Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land</B>--This, a well-known
 sound, was the usual Hebrew war-summons; the first blast was answered
 by the beacon fire in the neighboring places. A second blast was
 blown--then answered by a fire in a more distant locality, whence the
 proclamation was speedily diffused over the whole country. As the

 and although aware of the restrictions under which he held the
 sovereignty, he wished to rule as an autocrat, who possessed absolute
 power both in civil and sacred things. This occasion was his first
 trial. Samuel waited till the last day of the seven, in order to put
 the constitutional character of the king to the test; and, as Saul, in
 his impatient and passionate haste knowingly transgressed

 spirit which inspired this enterprise suggested the means of its

 which a yoke of oxen might plow</B>--This was a very ancient mode of

 scrambling up the rock had been surprised and killed, and the spectacle
 of twenty corpses would suggest to others that they were attacked by a
 numerous force. The success of the adventure was aided by a panic that
 struck the enemy, produced both by the sudden surprise and the shock of

 the text, reads, "the ephod"; that is, the priestly cape, which the
 high priest put on when consulting the oracle. That this should be at

 favor of His people, requested the priest to cease, that they might
 immediately join in the contest. The season for consultation was

 spoil</B>--at evening, when the time fixed by Saul had expired. Faint
 and famishing, the pursuers fell voraciously upon the cattle they had
 taken, and threw them on the ground to cut off their flesh and eat them
 raw, so that the army, by Saul's rashness, were defiled by eating
 blood, or living animals; probably, as the Abyssinians do, who cut a
 part of the animal's rump, but close the hide upon it, and nothing
 mortal follows from that wound. They were painfully conscientious in
 keeping the king's order for fear of the curse, but had no scruple in
 transgressing God's command. To prevent this violation of the law, Saul
 ordered a large stone to be rolled, and those that slaughtered the oxen
 to cut their throats on that stone. By laying the animal's head on the
 high stone, the blood oozed out on the ground, and sufficient evidence
 was afforded that the ox or sheep was dead before it was attempted to
 eat it.</P>

 During these Saul had been left to act in a great measure at his own

 his possessing the character of a theocratic monarch in Israel; and in
 announcing the duty required of him, Samuel brought before him his
 official station as the Lord's vicegerent, and the peculiar obligation
 under which he was laid to act in that capacity. He had formerly done
 wrong, for which a severe rebuke and threatening were administered to

 booty, as the cattle. By this wilful and partial obedience to a

 Scripture to Him when bad men give Him cause to alter His course and
 method of procedure, and to treat them as if He did "repent" of
 kindness shown. To the heart of a man like Samuel, who was above all
 envious considerations, and really attached to the king, so painful an
 announcement moved all his pity and led him to pass a sleepless night
 of earnest intercession.</P>

 monument, it was surmounted, according to the ancient fashion, by the 
 figure of a hand, the symbol of power and energy. The erection of this 
 vainglorious trophy was an additional act of disobedience. His pride

 partial and delusive self-love, or he was, in his declaration to
 Samuel, acting the part of a bold and artful hypocrite. He professed to
 have fulfilled the divine command, and that the blame of any defects in
 the execution lay with the people. Samuel saw the real state of the
 case, and in discharge of the commission he had received before setting
 out, proceeded to denounce his conduct as characterized by pride,
 rebellion, and obstinate disobedience. When Saul persisted in declaring
 that he had obeyed, alleging that the animals, whose bleating was
 heard, had been reserved for a liberal sacrifice of thanksgiving to
 God, his shuffling, prevaricating answer called forth a stern rebuke
 from the prophet. It well deserved it--for the destination of the spoil
 to the altar was a flimsy pretext--a gross deception, an attempt to
 conceal the selfishness of the original motive under the cloak of
 religious zeal and gratitude.</P>

 <B>24-26. I have sinned .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. turn again with me, that I may worship the
 Lord</B>--The erring, but proud and obstinate monarch was now humbled.
 He was conscience-smitten for the moment, but his confession proceeded
 not from sincere repentance, but from a sense of danger and desire of
 averting the sentence denounced against him. For the sake of public
 appearance, he besought Samuel not to allow their serious differences
 to transpire, but to join with him in a public act of worship. Under
 the influence of his painfully agitated feelings, he designed to offer
 sacrifice, partly to express his gratitude for the recent victory, and
 partly to implore mercy and a reversal of his doom. It was, from
 another angle, a politic scheme, that Samuel might be betrayed into a
 countenancing of his design in reserving the cattle for sacrificing.
 Samuel declined to accompany him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I feared the people, and obeyed their voice</B>--This was a different
 reason from the former he had assigned. It was the language of a man
 driven to extremities, and even had it been true, the principles
 expounded by Samuel showed that it could have been no extenuation of
 the offense. The prophet then pronounced the irreversible sentence of
 the rejection of Saul and his family. He was judicially cut off for his
 disobedience.</P>

 <B>1. the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for
 Saul</B>--Samuel's grief on account of Saul's rejection, accompanied,
 doubtless, by earnest prayers for his restitution, showed the amiable
 feelings of the man; but they were at variance with his public duty as
 a prophet. The declared purpose of God to transfer the kingdom of
 Israel into other hands than Saul's was not an angry menace, but a
 fixed and immutable decree; so that Samuel ought to have sooner
 submitted to the peremptory manifestation of the divine will. But to
 leave him no longer room to doubt of its being unalterable, he was sent
 on a private mission to anoint a successor to Saul
 (see on

 <A HREF="#1Sa10_1">1Sa 10:1</A>).

 The immediate designation of a king was of the greatest importance for
 the interests of the nation in the event of Saul's death, which, to 
 this time, was dreaded; it would establish David's title and comfort 
 the minds of Samuel and other good men with a right settlement, 
 whatever contingency might happen.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I have provided me a king</B>--The language is remarkable, and intimates a
 difference between this and the former king. Saul was the people's
 choice, the fruit of their wayward and sinful desires for their own
 honor and aggrandizement. The next was to be a king who would consult
 the divine glory, and selected from that tribe to which the pre-eminence
 had been early promised

 the execution.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I am come to sacrifice</B>--It seems to have been customary with Samuel
 to do this in the different circuits to which he went, that he might
 encourage the worship of God.</P>

 any guest he pleased.</P>

 <A NAME="1Sa16_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. the elders of the town trembled at his coming</B>--Beth-lehem was an
 obscure town, and not within the usual circuit of the judge. The elders
 were naturally apprehensive, therefore, that his arrival was occasioned
 by some extraordinary reason, and that it might entail evil upon their
 town, in consequence of the estrangement between Samuel and the king.</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:14,15">Ex 19:14, 15</A>).

 The elders were to sanctify themselves. Samuel himself took the
 greatest care in the sanctification of Jesse's family. Some, however, 
 think that the former were invited only to join in the sacrifice, while 
 the family of Jesse were invited by themselves to the subsequent 
 feast.</P>

 spoke of him as the most unfit. God, in His providence, so ordered it,
 that the appointment of David might the more clearly appear to be a
 divine purpose, and not the design either of Samuel or Jesse. David

 youth, and especially an Oriental youth, to make a parade of his
 gallantry. But David's piety sank all consideration of his own prowess

 which the fate of his kingdom depended, and with a champion supporting

 accoutrements, which would be of the best style. It is probable that
 Saul's coat of mail, or corslet, was a loose shirt, otherwise it could

 sometimes recited some verses, filled with allusions and epithets of
 the most opprobrious kind, hurling contempt and defiance at one
 another. This kind of abusive dialogue is common among the Arab
 combatants still. David's speech, however, presents a striking contrast

 and to God he ascribed all the glory of the triumph he anticipated.</P>

 in great retirement, superintending the school of the prophets,
 established in the little hamlet of Naioth, in the neighborhood of
 Ramah. It was a retreat congenial to the mind of David; but Saul,
 having found out his asylum, sent three successive bodies of men to
 apprehend him. The character of the place and the influence of the
 sacred exercises produced such an effect on them that they were
 incapable of discharging their commission, and were led, by a
 resistless impulse, to join in singing the praises of God. Saul, in a
 fit of rage and disappointment, determined to go himself. But, before
 reaching the spot, his mental susceptibilities were roused even more
 than his messengers, and he was found, before long, swelling the ranks
 of the young prophets. This singular change can be ascribed only to the
 power of Him who can turn the hearts of men even as the rivers of
 water.</P>

 <B>1-3. David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
 Jonathan</B>--He could not remain in Naioth, for he had strong reason to
 fear that when the religious fit, if we may so call it, was over, Saul
 would relapse into his usual fell and sanguinary temper. It may be
 thought that David acted imprudently in directing his flight to Gibeah.
 But he was evidently prompted to go thither by the most generous
 feelings--to inform his friend of what had recently occurred, and to
 obtain that friend's sanction to the course he was compelled to adopt.
 Jonathan could not be persuaded there was any real danger after the
 oath his father had taken; at all events, he felt assured his father
 would do nothing without telling him. Filial attachment naturally
 blinded the prince to defects in the parental character and made him
 reluctant to believe his father capable of such atrocity. David
 repeated his unshaken convictions of Saul's murderous purpose, but in
 terms delicately chosen 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:3">1Sa 20:3</A>),

 not to wound the filial feelings of his friend; while Jonathan,

 at Naioth might have wrought a sanctified improvement on Saul's temper 
 and feelings, undertook to inform David of the result of his 
 observations at home.</P>

 <B>5. David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow the new moon, and I
 should not fail to sit with the king at meat</B>--The beginning of a new
 month or moon was always celebrated by special sacrifices, followed by
 feasting, at which the head of a family expected all its members to be
 present. David, both as the king's son-in-law and a distinguished
 courtier, dined on such occasions at the royal table, and from its
 being generally known that David had returned to Gibeah, his presence
 in the palace would be naturally expected. This occasion was chosen by
 the two friends for testing the king's state of feeling. As a suitable
 pretext for David's absence, it was arranged that he should visit his
 family at Beth-lehem, and thus create an opportunity of ascertaining how
 his non-appearance would be viewed. The time and place were fixed for
 Jonathan reporting to David; but as circumstances might render another
 interview unsafe, it was deemed expedient to communicate by a concerted
 signal.</P>

 <B>11. Jonathan said to David, Come, let us go into the field</B>--The
 private dialogue, which is here detailed at full length, presents a
 most beautiful exhibition of these two amiable and noble-minded
 friends. Jonathan was led, in the circumstances, to be the chief
 speaker. The strength of his attachment, his pure disinterestedness,
 his warm piety, his invocation to God (consisting of a prayer and a
 solemn oath combined), the calm and full expression he gave of his
 conviction that his own family were, by the divine will, to be
 disinherited, and David elevated to the possession of the throne, the
 covenant entered into with David on behalf of his descendants, and the
 imprecation 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:16">1Sa 20:16</A>)

 denounced on any of them who should violate his part of the conditions,
 the reiteration of this covenant on both sides

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:17">1Sa 20:17</A>)

 to make it indissoluble--all this indicates such a power of mutual
 affection, such magnetic attractiveness in the character of David, such 
 susceptibility and elevation of feeling in the heart of Jonathan, that 
 this interview for dramatic interest and moral beauty stands unrivalled 
 in the records of human friendship.</P>

 wall</B>--The left-hand corner at the upper end of a room was and still
 is in the East, the most honorable place. The person seated there has
 his left arm confined by the wall, but his right hand is at full
 liberty. From Abner's position next the king, and David's seat being
 left empty, it would seem that a state etiquette was observed at the
 royal table, each of the courtiers and ministers having places assigned
 them according to their respective gradations of rank.

 Oriental form of abuse. Saul was not angry with his wife; it was the
 son alone, upon whom he meant, by this style of address, to discharge
 his resentment. The principle on which it is founded seems to be, that
 to a genuine filial instinct it is a more inexpiable offense to hear
 the name or character of a parent traduced, than any personal reproach.
 This was, undoubtedly, one cause of "the fierce anger" in which the
 high-minded prince left the table without tasting a morsel.</P>

 <B>1. Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech</B>--Nob, a city of the priests

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:19">1Sa 22:19</A>),

 was in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, on the Mount of Olives--a little
 north of the top, and on the northeast of the city. It is computed to 
 have been about five miles distant from Gibeah.  Ahimelech, the same as 
 Ahiah, or perhaps his brother, both being sons of Ahitub (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:3,1Sa+22:4-11,20">1Sa 14:3,
 with 1Sa 22:4-11, 20</A>).

 His object in fleeing to this place was partly for the supply of his
 necessities, and partly for comfort and counsel, in the prospect of 
 leaving the kingdom.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David</B>--suspecting some
 extraordinary occurrence by his appearing so suddenly, and in such a
 style, for his attendants were left at a little distance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let
 no man know</B>--This was a direct falsehood, extorted through fear. David
 probably supposed, like many other persons, that a lie is quite
 excusable which is told for the sole purpose of saving the speaker's
 life. But what is essentially sinful, can never, from circumstances,
 change its immoral character; and David had to repent of this vice of
 lying

 <B>4. there is hallowed bread</B>--There would be plenty of bread in his
 house; but there was no time to wait for it. "The hallowed bread" was
 the old shew-bread, which had been removed the previous day, and which
 was reserved for the use of the priests alone 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:9">Le 24:9</A>).

 Before entertaining the idea that this bread could be lawfully given to
 David and his men, the high priest seems to have consulted the oracle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:10">1Sa 22:10</A>)

 as to the course to be followed in this emergency. A dispensation to

 David and his attendants seem to have been lurking in some of the
 adjoining caves, to elude pursuit, and to have been, consequently, 
 reduced to great extremities of hunger.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the bread is in a manner common</B>--that is, now that it is no longer
 standing on the Lord's table. It is eaten by the priests, and may also,
 in our circumstances, be eaten by us.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel</B>--that is,
 though the hallowed bread had been but newly placed on the vessel, the
 ritual ordinance would have to yield to the great law of necessity and
 mercy (see on

 square, and all about fifteen or twenty feet deep, with perpendicular
 sides, in the soft limestone or chalky rocks. They are on the borders
 of the Philistine plain at the base of the Judea mountains, six miles
 southwest from Beth-lehem, and well adapted for concealing a number of

 The king of Moab was an enemy of Saul

 and the great-grandson of Ruth, of course, was related to the family of
 Jesse. David, therefore, had less anxiety in seeking an asylum within 
 the dominions of this prince than those of Achish, because the Moabites 
 had no grounds for entertaining vindictive feelings against him, and 
 their enmity, to Saul rendered them the more willing to receive so

 <B>2. Saul .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. went .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to seek David .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. upon the rocks of the
 wild goats</B>--Nothing but the blind infatuation of fiendish rage
 could have led the king to pursue his outlawed son-in-law among those
 craggy and perpendicular precipices, where were inaccessible hiding
 places. The large force he took with him seemed to give him every

 <B>3. he came to the sheepcotes</B>--most probably in the upper ridge 
 of Wady Chareitun. There a large cave--I am quite disposed to say
 <I>the</I> cave--lies hardly five minutes to the east of the village 
 ruin, on the south side of the wady. It is high upon the side of the 
 calcareous rock, and it has undergone no change since David's time. The 
 same narrow natural vaulting at the entrance; the same huge natural 
 chamber in the rock, probably the place where Saul lay down to rest in 
 the heat of the day; the same side vaults, too, where David and his men 
 were concealed. There, accustomed to the obscurity of the cavern, they 
 saw Saul enter, while, blinded by the glare of the light outside, he

 never made any promise of delivering Saul into David's hand; but, from
 the general and repeated promises of the kingdom to him, they concluded
 that the king's death was to be effected by taking advantage of some
 such opportunity as the present. David steadily opposed the urgent
 instigations of his followers to put an end to his and their troubles
 by the death of their persecutor (a revengeful heart would have
 followed their advice, but David rather wished to overcome evil with
 good, and heap coals of fire upon his head); he, however, cut off a
 fragment from the skirt of the royal robe. It is easy to imagine how
 this dialogue could be carried on and David's approach to the king's
 person could have been effected without arousing suspicion. The bustle
 and noise of Saul's military men and their beasts, the number of cells
 or divisions in these immense caverns (and some of them far interior)
 being enveloped in darkness, while every movement could be seen at the
 cave's mouth--the probability that the garment David cut from might
 have been a loose or upper cloak lying on the ground, and that Saul
 might have been asleep--these facts and presumptions will be sufficient
 to account for the incidents detailed.</P>

 <B>8-15. David also arose .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and went out of the cave, and cried after
 Saul</B>--The closeness of the precipitous cliffs, though divided by deep
 wadies, and the transparent purity of the air enable a person standing
 on one rock to hear distinctly the words uttered by a speaker standing
 on another 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:7">Jud 9:7</A>).

 The expostulation of David, followed by the visible tokens he furnished
 of his cherishing no evil design against either the person or the 
 government of the king, even when he had the monarch in his power, 
 smote the heart of Saul in a moment and disarmed him of his fell 
 purpose of revenge. He owned the justice of what David said, 
 acknowledged his own guilt, and begged kindness to his house. He seems 
 to have been naturally susceptible of strong, and, as in this instance, 
 of good and grateful impressions. The improvement of his temper, 
 indeed, was but transient--his language that of a man overwhelmed by 
 the force of impetuous emotions and constrained to admire the conduct, 
 and esteem the character, of one whom he hated and dreaded. But God 
 overruled it for ensuring the present escape of David.  Consider his 
 language and behavior. This language--"a dead dog," "a flea," terms by 
 which, like Eastern people, he strongly expressed a sense of his 
 lowliness and the entire committal of his cause to Him who alone is the 
 judge of human actions, and to whom vengeance belongs, his steady 
 repulse of the vindictive counsels of his followers; the relentings of 
 heart which he felt even for the apparent indignity he had done to the 
 person of the Lord's anointed; and the respectful homage he paid the 
 jealous tyrant who had set a price on his head--evince the magnanimity 
 of a great and good man, and strikingly illustrate the spirit and 
 energy of his prayer "when he was in the cave"

 Scripture worthies.

 <B>buried him in his house at Ramah</B>--that is, his own mausoleum. The
 Hebrews took as great care to provide sepulchers anciently as people do
 in the East still, where every respectable family has its own house of
 the dead. Often this is in a little detached garden, containing a
 small stone building (where there is no rock), resembling a house,
 which is called the sepulcher of the family--it has neither door nor

 <B>the wilderness of Paran</B>--stretching from Sinai to the borders of
 Palestine in the southern territories of Judea. Like other
 wildernesses, it presented large tracts of natural pasture, to which
 the people sent their cattle at the grazing season, but where they were
 liable to constant and heavy depredations by prowling Arabs. David and
 his men earned their subsistence by making reprisals on the cattle of
 these freebooting Ishmaelites; and, frequently for their useful
 services, they obtained voluntary tokens of acknowledgment from the
 peaceful inhabitants.</P>

 &c.--David and his men lurked in these deserts, associating with the
 herdsmen and shepherds of Nabal and others and doing them good offices,
 probably in return for information and supplies obtained through them.
 Hence when Nabal held his annual sheep-shearing in Carmel, David felt
 himself entitled to share in the festival and sent a message,
 recounting his own services and asking for a present. "In all these
 particulars we were deeply struck with the truth and strength of the
 biblical description of manners and customs almost identically the same
 as they exist at the present day. On such a festive occasion, near a
 town or village, even in our own time, an Arab sheik of the neighboring
 desert would hardly fail to put in a word either in person or by
 message; and his message, both in form and substance, would be only a
 transcript of that of David" [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>].</P>

 <B>10-12. Nabal answered David's servants, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Who is David?</B>
 &c.--Nabal's answer seems to indicate that the country was at the time
 in a loose and disorderly state. David's own good conduct, however, as
 well as the important services rendered by him and his men, were
 readily attested by Nabal's servants. The preparations of David to
 chastise his insolent language and ungrateful requital are exactly what
 would be done in the present day by Arab chiefs, who protect the cattle
 of the large and wealthy sheep masters from the attacks of the
 marauding border tribes or wild beasts. Their protection creates a
 claim for some kind of tribute, in the shape of supplies of food and
 necessaries, which is usually given with great good will and gratitude;
 but when withheld, is enforced as a right. Nabal's refusal, therefore,
 was a violation of the established usages of the place.</P>

 She acknowledged the demand of her formidable neighbors; but justly
 considering, that to atone for the insolence of her husband, a greater
 degree of liberality had become necessary, she collected a large amount
 of food, accompanying it with the most valued products of the country.

 referred to the unmerited reproach

 who no sooner take a fancy for a lady than they despatch a messenger to
 intimate their royal wishes that she should henceforth reside in the
 palace; and her duty is implicitly to obey. David's conduct shows that
 the manners of the Eastern nations were already imitated by the great
 men in Israel; and that the morality of the times which God permitted,
 gave its sanction to the practice of polygamy. His marriage with
 Abigail brought him a rich estate.</P>

 themselves to Saul, by giving him secret information

 The knowledge of their treachery makes it appear strange that David
 should return to his former haunt in their neighborhood; but, perhaps 
 he did it to be near Abigail's possessions, and under the impression 
 that Saul had become mollified. But the king had relapsed into his old 
 enmity. Though Gibeah, as its name imports, stood on an elevated 
 position, and the desert of Ziph, which was in the hilly region of
 Judea, may have been higher than Gibeah, it was still necessary to
 descend in leaving the latter place; thence Saul

 usually made in a circular form. The circumference is lined by the
 baggage and the men, while the chief's station is in the center,
 whether he occupy a tent or not. His spear, stuck in the ground,
 indicates his position. Similar was the disposition of Saul's camp--in
 this hasty expedition he seems to have carried no tent, but to have
 slept on the ground. The whole troop was sunk in sleep around him.</P>

 warfare in ancient times.

 <B>let me smite him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even to the earth at once</B>--The ferocious
 vehemence of the speaker is sufficiently apparent from his language,
 but David's magnanimity soared far above the notions of his followers.
 Though Saul's cruelty and perfidy and general want of right principle
 had sunk him to a low pitch of degradation, yet that was no reason for
 David's imitating him in doing wrong. Besides, he was the sovereign;
 David was a subject. Though God had rejected him from the kingdom, it
 was in every way the best and most dutiful course, instead of
 precipitating his fall by imbruing their hands in his blood and thereby
 contracting the guilt of a great crime, to wait the awards of that
 retributive providence which sooner or later would take him off by some
 sudden and mortal blow. He who, with impetuous haste was going to
 exterminate Nabal, meekly spared Saul. But Nabal refused to give a
 tribute to which justice and gratitude, no less than custom, entitled
 David. Saul was under the judicial infatuation of heaven. Thus David
 withheld the hand of Abishai; but, at the same time, he directed him to
 carry off some things which would show where they had been, and what
 they had done. Thus he obtained the best of victories over him, by
 heaping coals of fire on his head.</P>

 warrior is at rest. This common custom of Arab sheiks was also the
 practice of the Hebrew chiefs.

 <B>at his bolster</B>--literally, "at his head"; perhaps, Saul as a sovereign
 had the distinguished luxury of a bolster carried for him. A "cruse of
 water" is usually, in warm climates, kept near a person's couch, as a
 drink in the night time is found very refreshing. Saul's cruse would
 probably be of superior materials, or more richly ornamented than
 common ones, and therefore by its size or form be easily distinguished.</P>

 The extraordinary purity and elasticity of the air in Palestine enable
 words to be distinctly heard that are addressed by a speaker from the 
 top of one hill to people on that of another, from which it is 
 separated by a deep intervening ravine. Hostile parties can thus speak 
 to each other, while completely beyond the reach of each other's 
 attack. It results from the peculiar features of the country in many of

 rows of the sleeping soldiers, constituted the point of this sarcastic
 taunt. This new evidence of David's moderation and magnanimous
 forbearance, together with his earnest and kindly expostulation,

 Whether David had received a special invitation from him or a mere
 permission to enter his territories, cannot be determined. It is
 probable that the former was the case. From the universal notoriety
 given to the feud between Saul and David, which had now become
 irreconcilable, it might appear to Achish good policy to harbor him as

 <B>3. Now Samuel is dead,</B> &c.--This event is here alluded to as affording
 an explanation of the secret and improper methods by which Saul sought
 information and direction in the present crisis of his affairs.
 Overwhelmed in perplexity and fear, he yet found the common and
 legitimate channels of communication with Heaven shut against him. And
 so, under the impulse of that dark, distempered, superstitious spirit
 which had overmastered him, he resolved, in desperation, to seek the
 aid of one of those fortune telling impostors whom, in accordance with
 the divine command

 now Sulem, a village which still exists on the slope of a range called
 "Little Hermon." On the opposite side, on the rise of Mount Gilboa, 
 hard by "the spring of Jezreel," was Saul's army--the Israelites, 
 according to their wont, keeping to the heights, while their enemies 
 clung to the plain.</P>

 <B>7, 8. Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
 familiar spirit</B>--From the energetic measures which he himself had
 taken for extirpating the dealers in magical arts (the profession
 having been declared a capital offense), his most attached courtiers
 might have had reason to doubt the possibility of gratifying their
 master's wish. Anxious inquiries, however, led to the discovery of a
 woman living very secluded in the neighborhood, who had the credit of
 possessing the forbidden powers. To her house he repaired by night in
 disguise, accompanied by two faithful servants.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>En-dor</B>--"the fountain of the circle" (that figure being constantly
 affected by magicians) was situated directly on the other side of the
 Gilboa range, opposite Tabor; so that, in this midnight adventure, Saul
 had to pass over the shoulder of the ridge on which the Philistines
 were encamped.</P>

 and it was her supposed power in calling back the dead of which Saul
 was desirous to avail himself. Though she at first refused to listen to 
 his request, she accepted his pledge that no risk would be incurred by 
 her compliance. It is probable that his extraordinary stature, the 
 deference paid him by his attendants, the easy distance of his camp 
 from En-dor, and the proposal to call up the great prophet and first 
 magistrate in Israel (a proposal which no private individual would 
 venture to make), had awakened her suspicions as to the true character 
 and rank of her visitor. The story has led to much discussion whether 
 there was a real appearance of Samuel or not.  On the one hand, the 
 woman's profession, which was forbidden by the divine law, the refusal 
 of God to answer Saul by any divinely constituted means, the well-known 
 age, figure, and dress of Samuel, which she could easily represent 
 herself, or by an accomplice--his apparition being evidently at some 
 distance, being muffled, and not actually seen by Saul, whose attitude 
 of prostrate homage, moreover, must have prevented him distinguishing 
 the person though he had been near, and the voice seemingly issuing out 
 of the ground, and coming along to Saul--and the vagueness of the 
 information, imparted much which might have been reached by natural 
 conjecture as to the probable result of the approaching conflict--the 
 woman's representation--all of this has led many to think that this was 
 a mere deception. On the other hand, many eminent writers (considering 
 that the apparition came before her arts were put in practice; that she 
 herself was surprised and alarmed; that the prediction of Saul's own 
 death and the defeat of his forces was confidently made), are of 
 opinion that Samuel really appeared.</P>

 battle as Waterloo really took place.  Gilboa, Jezreel, Shunem, En-dor, 
 are all found, still bearing the same names. They lie within sight of 
 each other. Aphek is the only one of the cluster not yet identified. 
 Jezreel on the northern slope of Gilboa, and at the distance of twenty 
 minutes to the east, is a large fountain, and a smaller one still 
 nearer; just the position which a chieftain would select, both on

 Ziklag</B>--While the strength of the Philistine forces was poured out
 of their country into the plain of Esdraelon, the Amalekite marauders
 seized the opportunity of the defenseless state of Philistia to invade
 the southern territory. Of course, David's town suffered from the
 ravages of these nomad plunderers, in revenge for his recent raid upon
 their territory.</P>

 But their apparent clemency did not arise from humane considerations.
 It is traceable to the ancient war usages of the East, where the men of 
 war, on the capture of a city, were unsparingly put to death, but there 
 were no warriors in Ziklag at the time. The women and boys were

 close combat, threw them into panic and disorder. Taking advantage of 
 the heights of Mount Gilboa, [the Israelites] attempted to rally, but 
 in vain. Saul and his sons fought like heroes; but the onset of the 
 Philistines being at length mainly directed against the quarter where 
 they were, Jonathan and two brothers, Abinadab or Ishui

 he requested his armor bearer to despatch him. However, that officer
 refused to do so. Saul then falling on the point of his sword killed 
 himself; and the armor bearer, who, according to Jewish writers, was 
 Doeg, following the example of his master, put an end to his life also.  
 They died by one and the same sword--the very weapon with which they

 <B>11-13. the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the
 Philistines had done</B>--Mindful of the important and timely services
 Saul had rendered them, they gratefully and heroically resolved not to

 family.</P>

 <B>12. valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul
 and the bodies of his sons</B>--Considering that Beth-shan is an hour and a
 half's distance, and by a narrow upland passage, to the west of the
 Jordan (the whole being a journey from Jabesh-gilead of about ten
 miles), they must have made all haste to travel thither to carry off
 the headless bodies and return to their own side of the Jordan in the
 course of a single night.

 on this occasion to prevent all risk of the Beth-shanites coming to
 disinter the royal remains for further insult.</P>
