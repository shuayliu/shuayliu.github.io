 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> following reasons seem to have induced Paul to write this Second
 Epistle to the Corinthians: (1) That he might explain the reasons for
 his having deferred to pay them his promised visit, by taking Corinth
 as his way to Macedonia 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:19,2Co+1:15,16">1Co 4:19;

 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:5">1Co 16:5</A>);
 
 and so that he might set forth to them his apostolic walk in general

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12,24,6:3-13,7:2">2Co 1:12, 24; 6:3-13; 7:2</A>).

 (2) That he might commend their obedience in reference to the
 directions in his First Epistle, and at the same time direct them now 
 to forgive the offender, as having been punished sufficiently

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:1-11,7:6-16">2Co 2:1-11; 7:6-16</A>).

 (3) That he might urge them to collect for the poor saints at Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:1-9,15">2Co 8:1-9, 15</A>).

 (4) That he might maintain his apostolic authority and reprove 
 gainsayers.</P>

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>TIME OF WRITING</FONT> was after Pentecost, <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 57, when Paul left Ephesus for Troas. Having stayed 
 in the latter place for some time preaching the Gospel with effect

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:12">2Co 2:12</A>),

 he went on to Macedonia, being eager to meet Titus there, having been
 disappointed in his not coming to Troas, as had been agreed on between 
 them. Having heard from him the tidings he so much desired of the good 
 effect produced on the Corinthians by his First Epistle, and after 
 having tested the liberality of the Macedonian churches

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:1">2Co 8:1</A>),

 he wrote this Second Epistle, and then went on to Greece, where he 
 abode for three months; and then, after travelling by land, reached 
 Philippi on his return at Passover or Easter, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 
 58

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:1-6">Ac 20:1-6</A>).

 So that this Epistle must have been written about autumn, <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 57.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Macedonia was <FONT SIZE=-1>THE PLACE</FONT> from which it was written

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:2">2Co 9:2</A>,

 where the present tense, "I boast," or "am boasting," implies his 
 presence <I>then</I> in Macedonia).  In Asia (Lydian Asia) he had 
 undergone some great peril of his life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:8,9">2Co 1:8, 9</A>),

 whether the reference be [P<FONT SIZE=-1>ALEY</FONT>] to the tumult at 
 Ephesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:23-41">Ac 19:23-41</A>),

 or, as A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> thinks, to a dangerous illness in 
 which he despaired of life. Thence he passed by Troas to Philippi, the 
 first city which would meet him in entering Macedonia. The importance 
 of the Philippian Church would induce him to stay there some time; as 
 also his desire to collect contributions from the Macedonian churches 
 for the poor saints at Jerusalem. His anxiety of mind is recorded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:5">2Co 7:5</A>)

 as occurring <I>when he came into Macedonia,</I> and therefore must 
 have been at <I>Philippi,</I> which was the first city of Macedonia in 
 coming from Troas; and here, too, from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:6">2Co 7:6</A>,
 
 compared with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:5">2Co 7:5</A>,

 must have been the scene of his receiving the comforting tidings from
 Titus.  "Macedonia" is used for <I>Philippi</I> in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:9">2Co 11:9</A>,

 as is proved by comparison with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:15,16">Php 4:15, 16</A>.
 
 So it is probably used here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:5">2Co 7:5</A>).
 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> argues from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:1">2Co 8:1</A>,

 where he speaks of the "grace bestowed on the <I>churches</I> (plural) 
 of Macedonia," that Paul must have visited <I>other</I> churches in 
 Macedonia, besides Philippi, when he wrote, for example, Thessalonica, 
 Berea, &c., and that Philippi, the <I>first</I> on his route, is less 
 likely to have been the scene of his writing than the <I>last</I> on 
 his route, whichever it was, perhaps Thessalonica. But Philippi, as 
 being the chief town of the province, was probably the place to which 
 all the collections of the churches were sent. Ancient tradition, too 
 (as appears from the subscription to this Epistle), favors the view 
 that Philippi was the place from which this Epistle was sent by the 
 hands of Titus who received, besides, a charge to prosecute at Corinth 
 the collection which he had begun at his first visit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:6">2Co 8:6</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>STYLE</FONT> is most varied, and passes rapidly from one phase of
 feeling to another; now joyous and consolatory, again severe and full
 of reproof; at one time gentle and affectionate, at another, sternly
 rebuking opponents and upholding his dignity as an apostle. This
 variety of style accords with the warm and earnest character of the
 apostle, which nowhere is manifested more beautifully than in this
 Epistle. His bodily frailty, and the chronic malady under which he
 suffered, and which is often alluded to 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:7,5:1-4,12:7-9">2Co 4:7; 5:1-4; 12:7-9</A>;
 
 compare <I>Note,</I> see on

 <A HREF="#2Co1_8">2Co 1:8</A>), 

 must have been especially trying to one of his ardent temperament. But 
 besides this, was the more pressing anxiety of the "care of all the 
 churches." At Corinth, as elsewhere, Judaizing emissaries wished to 
 bind legal fetters of letter and form (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:3-18">2Co 3:3-18</A>)

 on the freedom and catholicity of the Church. On the other hand, there 
 were free thinkers who defended their immorality of practice by infidel 
 theories

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:12,32-36">1Co 15:12, 32-36</A>).
 
 These were the "fightings without," and "fears within" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:5,6">2Co 7:5, 6</A>)

 which agitated the apostle's mind until Titus brought him comforting 
 tidings from Corinth. Even then, while the majority at Corinth had 
 testified their repentance, and, as Paul had desired, excommunicated 
 the incestuous person, and contributed for the poor Christians of 
 Judea, there was still a minority who, more contemptuously than ever, 
 resisted the apostle. These accused him of crafty and mercenary 
 motives, as if he had personal gain in view in the collection being 
 made; and this, notwithstanding his scrupulous care to be above the 
 possibility of reasonable suspicion, by having others besides himself 
 to take charge of the money. This insinuation was palpably inconsistent 
 with their other charge, that he could be no true apostle, as he did 
 not claim maintenance from the churches which he founded. Another 
 accusation they brought of cowardly weakness; that he was always 
 threatening severe measures without daring to execute them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:8-16,13:2">2Co 10:8-16; 13:2</A>);

 and that he was vacillating in his teaching and practice, circumcising
 Timothy, and yet withholding circumcision from Titus; a Jew among the 
 Jews, and a Greek among the Greeks. That most of these opponents were 
 of the Judaizing party in the Church, appears from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:22">2Co 11:22</A>.

 They seem to have been headed by an emissary from Judea ("he that 
 cometh,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:4">2Co 11:4</A>),

 who had brought "letters of commendation"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:1">2Co 3:1</A>)

 from members of the Church at Jerusalem, and who boasted of his purity 
 of Hebrew descent, and his close connection with Christ Himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:13,23">2Co 11:13, 23</A>).

 His partisans contrasted his high pretensions with the timid humility 
 of Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:3">1Co 2:3</A>);

 and his rhetoric with the apostle's plain and unadorned style

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:6,10:10,13">2Co 11:6; 10:10, 13</A>).

 It was this state of things at Corinth, reported by Titus, that caused
 Paul to send him back forthwith thither with this Second Epistle, which 
 is addressed, not to Corinth only

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:2">1Co 1:2</A>),

 but to all the churches also in Achaia 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:1">2Co 1:1</A>),

 which had in some degree been affected by the same causes as affected 
 the Corinthian Church. The widely different tone in different parts of 
 the Epistle is due to the diversity which existed at Corinth between 
 the penitent majority and the refractory minority. The former he 
 addresses with the warmest affection; the latter with menace and 
 warning. Two deputies, chosen by the churches to take charge of the 
 contribution to be collected at Corinth, accompanied Titus

 He had been sent before to Macedonia, and had met Paul at Philippi, 
 when the apostle passed over from Troas to Macedonia (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:12,13">2Co 2:12, 13</A>;

 strongly testified their disapproval of the accusation brought by the 
 Jews against Paul. Hence, the apostle was enabled to labor in the whole 
 province of Achaia with such success as to establish several churches 
 there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:8,2Th+1:4">1Th 1:8;

 where, writing from Corinth, he speaks of the "churches," namely, not
 only the Corinthian, but others also--Athens, Cenchrea, and, perhaps, 
 Sicyon, Argos, &c. He addresses "the Church in Corinth," 
 <I>directly,</I> and all "the saints" in the province, 
 <I>indirectly.</I> In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:2">Ga 1:2</A>

 <B>comfort</B>--which flows from His "mercies" experienced. Like a true man

 The "tribulation" of believers is not inconsistent with God's mercy, 
 and does not beget in them suspicion of it; nay, in the end they feel

 imparts <I>the only true and perfect</I> comfort <I>in every

 him, he considered granted not for himself alone, but that he might have
 the greater ability to help others
 [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>]. So participation in all the
 afflictions of man peculiarly qualified Jesus to be man's comforter in
 all his various afflictions

 when the whole multitude were wrought up to fury by Demetrius, on the 
 plea of Paul and his associates having assailed the religion of Diana 
 of Ephesus. The words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:9">2Co 1:9</A>),

 "we had the sentence of death in ourselves," mean, that <I>he looked 
 upon himself as a man condemned to die</I> [P<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ALEY</FONT>].  A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> thinks the danger at 
 Ephesus was comparatively so slight that it cannot be supposed to be 
 the subject of reference here, without exposing the apostle to a charge 
 of cowardice, very unlike his fearless character; hence, he supposes 
 Paul refers to some deadly <I>sickness</I> which he had suffered under

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:9,10">2Co 1:9, 10</A>).

 But there is little doubt that, had Paul been found by the mob in the 
 excitement, he would have been torn in pieces; and probably, besides 
 what Luke in Acts records, there were other dangers of an equally 
 distressing kind, such as, "lyings in wait of the Jews"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:19">Ac 20:19</A>),

 his ceaseless foes. They, doubtless, had incited the multitude at 
 Ephesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:9">Ac 19:9</A>),

 and were the chief of the "many adversaries" and "[wild] beasts," which 
 he had to fight with there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:32,16:9">1Co 15:32; 16:9</A>).

 regard himself as all but dead

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:29,12:10">2Co 11:29; 12:10</A>).

 What makes my supposition probable is, that the very cause of his not 
 having visited Corinth directly as he had intended, and for which he 
 proceeds to apologize

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:15-23">2Co 1:15-23</A>),
 
 was, that there might be time to see whether the evils arising there
 not only from Greek, but from <I>Jewish</I> disturbers of the Church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:29">2Co 11:29</A>),

 would be checked by his first Epistle; there not being fully so was 
 what entailed on him the need of writing this second Epistle. His not 
 specifying this here <I>expressly</I> is just what we might expect in 
 the outset of this letter; towards the close, when he had won their 
 favorable hearing by a kindly and firm tone, he gives a more distinct 
 reference to Jewish agitators

 his hope of the resurrection was what buoyed him up in contending with

 We <I>glory</I> in this in spite of all our adversities. 
 <I>Sincerity</I> in <I>Greek</I> implies the non-admixture of any 
 foreign element. He had no sinister or selfish aims (as some

 "Fleshly wisdom" suggests tortuous and insincere courses; but the

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:3,15:15">Ro 12:3; 15:15</A>),

 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ONYBEARE</FONT> and
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT> think Paul had been suspected of writing privately
 to some individuals in the Church in a different strain from that of his
 public letters; and translates, "I write nothing else to you but what ye
 read <I>openly</I> (the <I>Greek</I> meaning, 'ye <I>read aloud,</I>' namely,

 The majority at Corinth had shown a willing compliance with Paul's
 directions in the first Epistle: but some were still refractory. Hence 
 arises the difference of tone in different parts of this Epistle.  See

 which, combined with the words here, implies that the insinuation of 
 some at Corinth, that he would not come at all, rested on the fact of 
 his having thus <I>disappointed</I> them. His change of intention, and 
 ultimate resolution of going through Macedonia first, took place before 
 his sending Timothy from Ephesus into Macedonia, and therefore

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:17">1Co 4:17</A>)
 
 before his writing the first Epistle. Compare

 Macedonia</I>);

 <B>that ye might have a second benefit</B>--one in going to, the other in
 returning from, Macedonia. The "benefit" of his visits consisted in the
 grace and spiritual gifts which he was the means of imparting

 <B>16.</B> This intention of visiting them <I>on the way</I> to Macedonia, as

 The repetition of the "yea" and "nay" hardly agrees with A<FONT
 SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT> view, "What I purpose do I purpose according to 
 the changeable purposes of the fleshly (worldly) man, that there may be 
 with me the yea yea, and the nay nay (that is, both affirmation and 
 negation concerning the same thing)?" The repetition will thus stand

 Nay, my object was that he "who was made sorry by me" (namely, <I>the

 as, if I were to come then, it would have to be "in heaviness" (causing 
 <I>sorrow</I> both to him and them, owing to their impenitent state). 
 He refers to the first Epistle (compare

 at the apostle's desire.  Besides his other reasons for deferring his
 visit, he had the further view, though, perhaps, unperceived by them, 
 of making an experiment of their fidelity. This accounts for his 
 deferring to give, in his Epistle, the <I>reason</I> for his change of 
 plan (resolved on before writing it).  This full discovery of his 
 motive comes naturally from him now, in the second Epistle, after he 
 had seen the success of his measures, but would not have been a 
 seasonable communication before. All this accords with reality, and is 
 as remote as possible from imposture [P<FONT SIZE=-1>ALEY</FONT>, 
 <I>Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;</I>]. The interchange of feeling is marked

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:4">2Co 2:4</A>),

 already determined on; as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:3">1Co 5:3</A>,

 "I have judged already"; or, as speaking generally of forgiveness 
 granted, or to be granted. It is for your sakes I have forgiven, and do 
 forgive, that the Church (of which you are constituent members) may 
 suffer no hurt by the loss of a soul, and that ye may learn leniency as 
 well as faithfulness.

 "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my spirit, with

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11.</B> Literally, "That we may have no advantage gained over us by 
 Satan," namely, by letting one of our members be lost to us through 
 despair, we ourselves furnishing Satan with the weapon, by our 
 repulsive harshness to one now penitent. The loss of a single sinner is
 a common loss; therefore, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:10">2Co 2:10</A>,

 he said, "for your sakes." Paul had "delivered" the offender "to Satan 
 for the destruction of the flesh, that the Spirit might be saved"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:5">1Co 5:5</A>).

 Satan sought to destroy the spirit also: to let him do so, would be to 
 give him an advantage, and let him <I>overreach</I> us.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>not ignorant of his devices</B>--"Ignorant" and "devices" are words akin

 <B>12.</B> Paul expected to meet Titus at Troas, to receive the tidings as to
 the effect of his first Epistle on the Corinthian Church; but,
 disappointed in his expectation <I>there,</I> he passed on to Macedonia,
 where he met him at last 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:5,6,7">2Co 7:5, 6, 7</A>)

 The <I>history</I> (Acts) does not record his passing through Troas, in 
 going from Ephesus <I>to</I> Macedonia; but it does in coming 
 <I>from</I> that country

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:6">Ac 20:6</A>);
 
 also, that he had disciples there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:7">Ac 20:7</A>),

 which accords with the <I>Epistle</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:12">2Co 2:12</A>,

 "a door was opened unto me of the Lord"). An undesigned coincidence 
 marking genuineness [P<FONT SIZE=-1>ALEY</FONT>, <I>Hor&aelig; 
 Paulin&aelig;</I>].  Doubtless Paul had fixed a time with Titus to meet 
 him at Troas; and had desired him, if detained so as not to be able to 
 be at Troas at that time, to proceed at once to Macedonia to Philippi, 
 the next station on his own journey. Hence, though a wide door of 
 Christian usefulness opened to him at Troas, his eagerness to hear from 
 Titus the tidings from Corinth, led him not to stay longer there when 
 the time fixed was past, but he hastened on to Macedonia to meet him 
 there [B<FONT SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to <I>preach</I></B>--literally, "for the Gospel." He had been at Troas
 before, but the vision of a man from Macedonia inviting him to come
 over, prevented his remaining there 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:8-12">Ac 16:8-12</A>).

 On his return to Asia, after the longer visit mentioned here, he stayed 
 seven days

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:6">Ac 20:6</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and</B>--that is, <I>though</I> Paul would, under ordinary circumstances, have
 gladly stayed in Troas.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>door .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. opened .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the Lord</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "<I>in</I> the Lord," that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:9">Ge 8:9</A>).
 
 As here his "spirit" had no rest; so in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:5">2Co 7:5</A>,

 his "flesh." His "spirit" under the Holy Spirit, hence, concluded that 
 it was not necessary to avail himself of the "door" of usefulness at 
 Troas any longer.

 <B>14. Now</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "But." Though we left Troas disappointed in not
 meeting Titus there, and in having to leave so soon so wide a door,
 "thanks be unto God," we were triumphantly blessed in both the good news
 of you from Titus, and in the victories of the Gospel everywhere in our
 progress. The cause of triumph cannot be restricted (as A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>
 explains) to the former; for "always," and "in every place," show that
 the latter also is intended.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>causeth us to triumph</B>--The <I>Greek,</I> is rather, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col 2:15</A>,
 
 "triumphs over us": "leadeth us in triumph." Paul regarded himself as a
 signal trophy of God's victorious power in Christ. His Almighty
 Conqueror was leading him about, through all the cities of the Greek
 and Roman world, as an illustrious example of His power at once to
 subdue and to save. The foe of Christ was now the servant of Christ. As
 to be led in triumph by man is the most miserable, so to be led in
 triumph by God is the most glorious, lot that can befall any
 [T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT>].
 Our only true triumphs are God's triumphs over us. His defeats of us are
 our only true victories [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. The image is taken from the triumphal
 procession of a victorious general. The <I>additional</I> idea is perhaps
 included, which distinguishes God's triumph from that of a human
 general, that the captive is brought into <I>willing</I> obedience

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:5">2Co 10:5</A>)

 to Christ, and so <I>joins in the triumph:</I> God "leads him in 
 triumph" as one not merely <I>triumphed over,</I> but also as one 
 <I>triumphing over</I> God's foes with God (which last will apply to 
 the apostle's triumphant missionary progress under the leading of God). 
 So B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>: "<I>Who shows us in triumph,</I> not 
 [merely] as conquered, but as the ministers of His victory. Not only 
 the victory, but the open 'showing' of the victory is marked: for there 
 follows, <I>Who maketh manifest.</I>"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>savour</B>--retaining the image of a triumph. As the approach of the
 triumphal procession was made known by the <I>odor</I> of incense scattered
 far and wide by the incense-bearers in the train, so God "makes manifest
 by us" (His now at once triumphed over and triumphing captives, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:10">Lu 5:10</A>,

 "Catch," literally, "Take captive so as to preserve alive") the sweet 
 savor of the knowledge of Christ, the triumphant Conqueror

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col 2:15</A>),

 everywhere. As the <I>triumph</I> strikes the eyes, so the savor the 
 nostrils; thus every sense feels the power of Christ's Gospel. This 
 <I>manifestation</I> (a word often recurring in his Epistles to the 
 Corinthians, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:5">1Co 4:5</A>)

 still light; and honey, though it taste bitter to the sick, is in

 As some of the conquered foes led in triumph were put to death when the

 Even in <I>writing the letter</I> of the New Testament, Paul and the 
 other sacred writers were ministers <I>not of the letter, but of the 
 spirit.</I> No piety of spirit could exempt a man from the yoke of the 
 letter of each legal ordinance under the Old Testament; for God had 
 appointed this as the way in which He chose a devout Jew to express his 
 state of mind towards God. Christianity, on the other hand, makes the 
 spirit of our outward observances everything, and the letter a 
 secondary consideration

 Note, the spiritualism of rationalists is very different. It would 
 admit no "stereotyped revelation," except so much as man's own inner 
 instrument of revelation, the conscience and reason, can approve of: 
 thus making the conscience judge of the written word, whereas the 
 apostles make the written word the judge of the conscience

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:11,1Pe+4:1">Ac 17:11;

 True spirituality rests on the whole written word, applied to the soul
 by the Holy Spirit as the only infallible interpreter of its 
 far-reaching spirituality.  The <I>letter</I> is nothing without the 
 <I>spirit,</I> in a subject essentially spiritual. The <I>spirit</I> is

 "<I>the letter</I> killeth," and this seems the probable reading. Even
 if we read as <I>English Version,</I> "The ministration of death 
 (written) in letters," alludes to <I>the literal precepts</I> of the 
 law as only bringing us the knowledge of sin and "<I>death,</I>" in

 The opposition between "the letters" and "the Spirit"

 according to the <I>Septuagint</I> is adopted by Paul, that Moses in 
 going in to speak to God <I>removed the veil till he came out and had 
 spoken to the people;</I> and then <I>when he had done speaking,</I> he 
 put on the veil <I>that they might not look on the end,</I> or the 
 fading, <I>of that transitory glory.</I> The veil was the symbol of
 <I>concealment,</I> put on directly after Moses' speaking; so that
 God's revelations by him were interrupted by intervals of concealment
 [ALFORD]. But A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT> view does not accord with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:7">2Co 3:7</A>;

 the Israelites "could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the
 glory of his countenance." Plainly Moses' veil was put on <I>because 
 of</I> their not having been able to "look steadfastly at him." Paul 
 here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:13">2Co 3:13</A>)

 passes from the literal fact to the truth symbolized by it, the 
 blindness of Jews and Judaizers to the ultimate end of the law: stating 
 that Moses <I>put on the veil that they might not look steadfastly 
 at</I> (Christ,

 <I>the end of that</I> (law) <I>which</I> (like Moses' glory) <I>is 
 done away.</I> Not that <I>Moses</I> had this <I>purpose;</I> but often 
 God attributes to His prophets the purpose which He has Himself.  
 Because the Jews <I>would not see,</I> God judicially gave them up 
 <I>so as not to see.</I> The glory of Moses' face is antitypically 
 Christ s glory shining behind the veil of legal ordinances. The veil 
 which has been taken off to the believer is left on to the unbelieving 
 Jew, so that he should not see

 He stops short at the letter of the law, not seeing the end of it. The
 evangelical glory of the law, like the shining of Moses' face, cannot 
 be borne by a carnal people, and therefore remains veiled to them until 
 the Spirit comes to take away the veil

 <I>therefore</I> remains untaken away from them, <I>because</I> they

 If they once saw that the law is done away in Him, the veil would be no

 Hence arises his ambition to be accepted at the Lord's coming judgment.
 Hence, too, his endeavor to deal openly with men, as with God, in
 preaching; thus giving the Corinthians whereof to boast concerning him
 against his adversaries. His constraining motive is the transforming
 love of Christ, by whom God has wrought reconciliation between Himself
 and men, and has committed to the apostle the ministry of
 reconciliation.</P>

 If this daily <I>delivering unto death</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:11">2Co 3:11</A>)

 It stands in contrast to "in the heavens."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>house of <I>this</I> tabernacle</B>--rather, "house of the tabernacle."
 "House" expresses more <I>permanency</I> than belongs to the body;
 therefore the qualification, "of the tabernacle" (implying that it is
 <I>shifting,</I> not stationary), is added
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:19,2Pe+1:13,14">Job 4:19;
 2Pe 1:13, 14</A>).

 It thus answers to the tabernacle in the wilderness. Its wooden frame
 and curtains wore out in course of time when Israel dwelt in Canaan, 
 and a fixed temple was substituted for it.  The temple and the 
 tabernacle in all essentials were one; there was the same ark, the same 
 cloud of glory. Such is the relation between the "earthly" body and the 
 resurrection body. The Holy Spirit is enshrined in the believer's body 
 as in a sanctuary

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:16">1Co 3:16</A>).

 As the ark went first in taking down the wilderness tabernacle, so the 
 soul (which like the ark is sprinkled with blood of atonement, and is 
 the sacred deposit in the inmost shrine,

 in the dissolution of the body; next the coverings were removed, 
 answering to the flesh; lastly, the framework and boards, answering to 
 the bones, which are last to give way

 <B>we have</B>--in <I>assured</I> prospect of possession, as certain as if it

 it is not fresh and perfect from His hands, as our resurrection body

 For instance, the outward distinctions of Jew or Gentile, rich or poor,

 flesh, but he had looked for Christ or the Messiah). When once he was 
 converted he no longer "conferred with flesh and blood"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:16">Ga 1:16</A>).

 He had this advantage over the Twelve, that as one born out of due time
 he had never known Christ save in His heavenly life. To the Twelve it 
 was "expedient that Christ should go away" that the Comforter should 
 come, and so they might know Christ in the higher spiritual aspect and 
 in His new life-giving power, and not merely "after the flesh," in the 
 carnal aspect of Him

 advantage of their belonging to Israel, the nation of Christ, or on

 This is at variance with both Romish Mariolatry and transubstantiation.
 Two distinct <I>Greek</I> verbs are used here for "know"; the first 
 ("<I>know</I> we no man") means "to be personally acquainted with"; the 
 latter ("known Christ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  more") is 
 to <I>recognize,</I> or estimate. Paul's <I>estimate</I> of Christ, or

 "We know Christ no more after the flesh." As Christ has entered on His 
 new heavenly life by His resurrection and ascension, so all who are "in

 are new creatures

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:9-11">Ro 6:9-11</A>).

 "New" in the <I>Greek</I> implies a new nature quite different from 
 anything previously existing, not merely <I>recent,</I> which is 
 expressed by a different <I>Greek</I> word

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:15">Ga 6:15</A>).

 <I>to His favor</I> by satisfying the claims of justice against us. Our 
 position judicially considered in the eye of the law is altered, not as 
 though the mediation of Christ had made a change in God's character, 
 nor as if the love of God was produced by the mediation of Christ; nay, 
 the mediation and sacrifice of Christ was the provision of God's love, 
 not its moving cause

 Christ's blood was the price paid at the expense of God Himself, and

 separate, but as the eternally harmonious attributes in the one and the 
 same God

 reconciling the world to Himself is implied

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:19">2Co 5:19</A>),

 namely, by His "not imputing their trespasses to them." God not merely, 
 as subsequently, reconciles the world by inducing them to lay aside 
 their enmity, but in the first instance, does so by satisfying His own 
 justice and righteous enmity against sin

 reconciliation was being carried into effect

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:21">2Co 5:21</A>),

 namely, when "God made Jesus, who knew no sin, to be sin for us." The
 compound of "was" and the participle "reconciling," instead of the 
 imperfect (<I>Greek</I>), may also imply the <I>continuous</I> purpose 
 of God, from before the foundation of the world, to reconcile man to 
 Himself, whose fall was foreseen. The expression " <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>IN</FONT> Christ" for "<I>by</I> Christ" may be used to imply 
 <I>additionally</I> that God was <FONT SIZE=-1>IN</FONT> Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:38,14:10">Joh 10:38; 14:10</A>),

 and so <I>by</I> Christ (the God-man) was reconciling .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

 manuscripts omit "Jesus"),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:18">2Co 5:18</A>,

 is different.  "In" must mean here <I>in the person of</I> Christ. The 
 <I>Greek Katallasson</I> implies "changing" or <I>altering</I> the 
 judicial status from one of condemnation to one of justification. The 
 <I>atonement</I> (<I>at-one-ment</I>), or <I>reconciliation,</I> is the 
 removal of the bar to peace and acceptance with a holy God, which His 
 righteousness interposed against our sin. The first step towards 
 restoring peace between us and God was on God's side

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:16">Joh 3:16</A>).

 The <I>change</I> therefore <I>now</I> to be effected must be on the 
 part of offending man, God the offended One being already reconciled. 
 It is man, not God, who now needs to be reconciled, and to lay aside 
 his enmity against God

 The <I>manner</I> of the reconciling is by His "not imputing to men
 their trespasses," but imputing them to Christ the Sin-bearer. There is 
 no incongruity that a father should be offended with that son whom he 
 loveth, and at that time offended with him when he loveth him. So, 
 though God loved men whom He created, yet He was offended with them 
 when they sinned, and gave His Son to suffer for them, that through 
 that Son's obedience He might be reconciled to them (reconcile them to 
 Himself, that is, restore them <FONT SIZE=-1>WITH JUSTICE</FONT> to His

 not "repentance" merely, but "repentance unto salvation"; this, he 
 says, <I>none will ever regret,</I> however attended with "sorrow" at
 the time.  "<I>Repentance</I>" implies a <I>coming to a right mind;</I> 
 "regret" implies merely uneasiness of feeling at the past or present,

 <I>Greek,</I> "stricken with remorse," not as <I>English Version,</I>
 "repented himself"); so that, though always accompanying repentance, it 
 is not always accompanied by repentance. "Repentance" removes the 
 impediments in the way of "salvation" (to which "death," namely, of the 
 soul, is opposed). "The sorrow of the world" is not at the <I>sin</I> 
 itself, but at its <I>penal consequences:</I> so that the tears of pain

 <B>that our care for you,</B> &c.--Some of the oldest manuscripts read
 thus, "That <FONT SIZE=-1>YOUR</FONT>

 the words, "unto you," thus, would be rather obscure; still the
 obscurity of the genuine reading may have been the very reason for the
 change being made by correctors into the reading of <I>English Version.</I>
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> explains the reading: "He wrote in order to bring out their zeal
 on his behalf (that is, to obey his command), and make it manifest
 <I>to themselves</I> in God's sight, that is, to bring out <I>among them</I> their zeal to regard and obey him." But some of the oldest manuscripts
 and versions (including the <I>Vulgate</I> and old <I>Italian</I>) support
 <I>English Version.</I> And the words, "to you," suit it better than the
 other reading.

 "I wrote .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that ye might know the love which I have more 
 abundantly <I>unto you,</I>" plainly accords with it, and disproves 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT> assertion that <I>English Version</I> is 
 <I>inconsistent with the fact</I> as to the purpose of his letter. His 
 writing, he says, was not so much for the sake of the individual

 The importance given in this Epistle to the collection, arose as well 
 from Paul's engagement

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:10">Ga 2:10</A>),

 as also chiefly from his hope to conciliate the Judaizing Christians at

 on the part of the latter towards their Jewish brethren.</P>

 affliction."

 stinted gifts, but of "abounding in the <I>riches</I> of liberality"
 (not as <I>Margin,</I> "simplicity"; though the idea of <I>singleness</I>

 <B>18. the brother, whose praise is in the gospel</B>--whose praise is known
 in connection with the Gospel: <I>Luke</I> may be meant; not that "the
 Gospel" here refers to his <I>written</I> Gospel; but the language implies
 some one well known throughout the churches, and at that time with Paul,
 as Luke then was 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:6">Ac 20:6</A>).
 
 Not a Macedonian, as appears from

 Luke was the most prominent, having been his companion in preaching the
 Gospel at his first entrance into Europe

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:10">Ac 16:10</A>).

 The fact that the person here referred to was "chosen of the churches" 
 as their trustee to travel with Paul in conveying the contribution to 
 Jerusalem, implies that he had resided among them some time before: 
 this is true of Luke, who after parting from Paul at Philippi (as he 
 marks by the change from "we" to "they,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:11">Ac 16:11</A>)

 six years before, is now again found in his company in Macedonia. In 
 the interim he had probably become so well known that "his praise was 
 throughout all the churches." Compare

 "to the glory" of the Lord. It was also done in order to produce a

 <B>1. Would to God</B>--Translate as <I>Greek,</I> "I would that."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>bear with me</B>--I may ask not unreasonably to be borne with; not so the
 false apostles 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:4,20">2Co 11:4, 20</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>my</B>--not in the oldest manuscripts.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>folly</B>--The <I>Greek</I> is a milder term than that for "foolishness" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:19,Mt+5:22,25:2">1Co 3:19;
 Mt 5:22; 25:2</A>. 

 The <I>Greek</I> for "folly" here implies <I>imprudence;</I> the
 <I>Greek</I> for "foolishness" includes the idea of <I>perversity</I> 
 and <I>wickedness.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:16">2Co 11:16</A>).

 But the <I>Greek</I> and the sense favor the translation, "But indeed 
 (I need not wish it, for) ye <I>do</I> bear with me"; still I wish you 
 to bear with me further, while I enter at large into 
 self-commendations.</P>

 <A NAME="2Co11_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. For I am jealous</B>--The justification of his self-commendations lies
 in his zealous care lest they should fall from Christ, to whom he, as
 "the friend of the Bridegroom" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:29">Joh 3:29</A>),

 has espoused them; in order to lead them back from the false apostles 
 to Christ, he is obliged to boast as an apostle of Christ, in a way 
 which, but for the motive, would be "folly."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>godly jealousy</B>--literally, "jealousy of God" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12">2Co 1:12</A>,

 "godly sincerity," literally, "sincerity of God"). "If I am immoderate, 
 I am immoderate to God" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. A jealousy which 
 has God's honor at heart

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:10">1Ki 19:10</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. espoused you</B>--Paul uses a <I>Greek</I> term applied properly to
 <I>the bridegroom,</I> just as he ascribes to himself "jealousy," a feeling
 properly belonging to the husband; so entirely does he identify himself
 with Christ.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>present <I>you as</I> a chaste virgin to Christ</B>--at His coming, when the
 heavenly <I>marriage</I> shall take place 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:6,Re+19:7,9">Mt 25:6;
 Re 19:7, 9</A>). 

 What Paul here says he desires to do, namely, "present" the Church as
 "a chaste virgin" to Christ, <I>Christ Himself</I> is said to do in the 
 fuller sense. Whatever ministers do effectively, is really done by 
 Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:27-32">Eph 5:27-32</A>).

 The <I>espousals</I> are going on now. He does not say "chaste 
 virgins"; for not individual members, but the whole body of believers 
 conjointly constitute the Bride.</P>

 not inconsistent with love. His source of fear was their yielding 
 character.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>subtilty</B>--the utter foe of the "simplicity" which is intent on
 <FONT SIZE=-1>ONE</FONT>

 Spirit 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:4">2Co 11:4</A>);

 but loves him with tender <FONT SIZE=-1>SINGLENESS OF AFFECTION</FONT>.  
 Where Eve first gave way, was in mentally harboring for a moment the 
 possibility insinuated by the serpent, of G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT> not 
 having her truest interests at heart, and of this "other" professing 
 friend being more concerned for her than God.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>corrupted</B>--so as to lose their virgin purity through seducers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:4">2Co 11:4</A>).
 
 The same <I>Greek</I> stands for "minds" as for "thoughts"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:5">2Co 10:5</A>,

 also see on

 <A HREF="#2Co10_5">2Co 10:5</A>); 

 <I>intents of the will,</I> or <I>mind.</I> The oldest manuscripts 
 after "simplicity," add, "and the purity" or "chastity."

 were possible, ye might then bear with them (see on

 <A HREF="#2Co11_1">2Co 11:1</A>). 

 But there can be no <I>new Gospel;</I> there is but the <I>one</I> 
 which I first preached; therefore it ought not to be "borne" by you, 
 that the false teachers should attempt to supersede me.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he that cometh</B>--the high-sounding title assumed by the false teachers,
 who arrogated Christ's own peculiar title (<I>Greek,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:3,Heb+10:37">Mt 11:3,
 and Heb 10:37</A>),

 "He that is coming." Perhaps he was leader of the party which assumed
 peculiarly to be "Christ's"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:7,1Co+1:12">2Co 10:7;
 1Co 1:12</A>); 

 hence his assumption of the title.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>preacheth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. receive</B>--is preaching .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ye are receiving.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Jesus</B>--the "Jesus" of Gospel <I>history.</I> He therefore does not say
 "Christ," which refers to the <I>office.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>another .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. another</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "another Jesus .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a <I>different</I> Spirit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a <I>different</I> Gospel." <I>Another</I> implies a distinct
 individual of the same kind; <I>different</I> implies one quite distinct in
 kind.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which ye have not received</B>--from us.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>spirit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. received .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gospel 
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. accepted</B>--The will of man is passive in <FONT
 SIZE=-1>RECEIVING</FONT> the "Spirit"; but it is actively concurrent
 with the will of God (which goes before to give the good will) in <FONT
 SIZE=-1>ACCEPTING</FONT> the "Gospel."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>ye might well bear with him</B>--There would be an excuse for your
 conduct, though a bad one (for ye ought to give heed to no Gospel other 
 than what ye have already heard from me,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:6,7">Ga 1:6, 7</A>);

 but the false teachers do not even pretend they have "another Jesus"
 and a "different Gospel" to bring before you; they merely try to 
 supplant me, your accredited Teacher. Yet ye not only "bear with" them, 
 but prefer them.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I was not</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "That I have not been, and am not."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the very chiefest apostles</B>--James, Peter, and John, the 
 witnesses of Christ's transfiguration and agony in Gethsemane. Rather, 
 "those overmuch apostles," those <I>surpassers of the apostles</I> in 
 their own esteem. This sense is proved by the fact that the context 
 contains no comparison between him and the apostles, but only between 
 him and the false teachers;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:6">2Co 11:6</A>

 also alludes to these, and not to the apostles; compare also the 
 parallel phrase, "false apostles" (see on

 to yourselves to decide whether I be rude in speech .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. : 
 for we have been thoroughly (literally, "in everything") made manifest

 would receive no help); and this "in the beginning of the Gospel," that

 its aim, namely, to draw off the Corinthians from their false teachers

 The "My" is omitted in some of the oldest manuscripts; the sense is the
 same, "power" (referring to God's power) standing absolutely, in 
 contrast to "weakness" (put absolutely, for man's weakness). Paul often 
 repeats the word "weakness" or "infirmity" (the eleventh, twelfth, and 
 thirteenth chapters) as being Christ's own word. The Lord has more need 
 of our weakness than of our strength: our strength is often His rival; 
 our weakness, His servant, drawing on His resources, and showing forth 
 His glory. Man's extremity is God's opportunity; man's security is 
 Satan's opportunity. God's way is not to take His children out of 
 trial, but to give them strength to bear up against it

 apostleship. The apostles have no literal successors (compare

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>mighty deeds</B>--palpable works of divine omnipotence. The silence of
 the apostles in fourteen Epistles, as to miracles, arises from the
 design of those Epistles being hortatory, not controversial. The passing
 allusions to miracles in seven Epistles prove that the writers were not
 enthusiasts to whom <I>miracles</I> seem the most important thing.
 <I>Doctrines</I> were with them the important matter, save when convincing
 adversaries. In the seven Epistles the mention of miracles is not
 <I>obtrusive,</I> but marked by a calm air of assurance, as of facts
 <I>acknowledged on all hands,</I> and therefore unnecessary to dwell on.
 This is a much stronger proof of their reality than if they were
 formally and obtrusively asserted. Signs and wonders is the regular
 formula of the Old Testament, which New Testament readers would
 necessarily understand of supernatural works. Again, in the Gospels the
 miracles are so inseparably and congruously tied up with the history,
 that you cannot deny the former without denying the latter also. And
 then you have a greater difficulty than ever, namely,
 <I>to account for the rise of Christianity;</I> so that the infidel has
 something infinitely more difficult to believe than that which he
 rejects, and which the Christian more rationally accepts.</P>

 The apostle in this case, where ordinary testimony was to be had, does 
 not look for an immediate revelation, nor does he order the culprits to 
 be cast out of the church before his arrival. Others understand the 
 "two or three witnesses" to mean <I>his two or three visits</I> as 
 establishing either (1) the truth of the facts alleged against the 
 offenders, or (2) the reality of his threats. I prefer the first 
 explanation to either of the two latter.</P>

 "this is the <I>third</I> time I am coming to you," as Paul could not
