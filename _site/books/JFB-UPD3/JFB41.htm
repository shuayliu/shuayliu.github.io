 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HAT</FONT> the Second Gospel was written by Mark is universally agreed,
 though by what Mark, not so. The great majority of critics take the
 writer to be "John whose surname was Mark," of whom we read in the
 Acts, and who was "sister's son to Barnabas" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:10">Col 4:10</A>).

 But no reason whatever is assigned for this opinion, for which the 
 tradition, though ancient, is not uniform; and one cannot but wonder 
 how it is so easily taken for granted by W<FONT SIZE=-1>ETSTEIN</FONT>, 
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>UG</FONT>, M<FONT SIZE=-1>EYER</FONT>, E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>BRARD</FONT>, L<FONT SIZE=-1>ANGE</FONT>, E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LLICOTT</FONT>, D<FONT SIZE=-1>AVIDSON</FONT>, T<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT>, &c.  A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> goes the 
 length of saying it "has been universally believed that he was the same 
 person with the John Mark of the Gospels." But G<FONT
 SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT> thought differently, and so did S<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>CHLEIERMACHER</FONT>, C<FONT SIZE=-1>AMPBELL</FONT>, B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>URTON</FONT>, and D<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OSTA</FONT>; and the grounds on which it is concluded that they 
 were two different persons appear to us quite unanswerable. "Of John, 
 surnamed Mark," says C<FONT SIZE=-1>AMPBELL</FONT>, in his Preface to 
 this Gospel, "one of the first things we learn is, that he attended 
 Paul and Barnabas in their apostolical journeys, when these two 
 travelled together

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:25,13:5">Ac 12:25; 13:5</A>).

 And when afterwards there arose a dispute between them concerning him,
 insomuch that they separated, Mark accompanied his uncle Barnabas, and 
 Silas attended Paul. When Paul was reconciled to Mark, which was 
 probably soon after, we find Paul again employing Mark's assistance, 
 recommending him, and giving him a very honorable testimony

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:10,2Ti+4:11,Phile+1:24">Col 4:10;
 2Ti 4:11; 
 Phm 24</A>).

 But we hear not a syllable of his attending Peter as his minister, or
 assisting him in any capacity." And yet, as we shall presently see, no
 tradition is more ancient, more uniform, and better sustained by 
 internal evidence, than that Mark, in his Gospel, was but "the 
 interpreter of Peter," who, at the close of his first Epistle speaks of 
 him as "Marcus my son"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:13">1Pe 5:13</A>),

 that is, without doubt, his son in the Gospel--converted to Christ 
 through his instrumentality. And when we consider how little the 
 Apostles Peter and Paul were together--how seldom they even met--how 
 different were their tendencies, and how separate their spheres of 
 labor, is there not, in the absence of all evidence of the fact, 
 something approaching to violence in the supposition that the same Mark 
 was the intimate associate of both? "In brief," adds C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AMPBELL</FONT>, "the accounts given of Paul's attendant, and 
 those of Peter's interpreter, concur in nothing but the name, Mark or 
 Marcus; too slight a circumstance to conclude the sameness of the 
 person from, especially when we consider how common the name was at 
 Rome, and how customary it was for the Jews in that age to assume some 
 Roman name when they went thither."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Regarding the Evangelist Mark, then, as another person from Paul's
 companion in travel, all we know of his personal history is that he was
 a convert, as we have seen, of the Apostle Peter. But as to his Gospel,
 the tradition regarding Peter's hand in it is so ancient, so uniform,
 and so remarkably confirmed by internal evidence, that we must regard
 it as an established fact. "Mark," says P<FONT SIZE=-1>APIAS</FONT> (according to the
 testimony of E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>, [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.39]), "becoming
 <I>the interpreter of Peter,</I> wrote accurately, though not in order,
 whatever he remembered of what was either said or done by Christ; for
 he was neither a hearer of the Lord nor a follower of Him, but
 afterwards, as I said, [he was a follower] of Peter, who arranged the
 discourses for use, but not according to the order in which they were
 uttered by the Lord." To the same effect I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT>
 [<I>Against Heresies,</I> 3. 1]: "Matthew published a Gospel while Peter
 and Paul were preaching and founding the Church at Rome; and after
 their departure (or decease), Mark,
 <I>the disciple and interpreter of Peter,</I> he also gave forth to us in
 writing the things which were preached by Peter." And
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT>
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT> is still more specific, in a passage preserved to
 us by E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 6.14]: "Peter having
 publicly preached the word at Rome, and spoken forth the Gospel by the
 Spirit, many of those present exhorted Mark, as
 <I>having long been a follower of his,</I> and remembering what he had
 said, to write what had been spoken; and that having prepared the
 Gospel, he delivered it to those who had asked him for it; which, when
 Peter came to the knowledge of, he neither decidedly forbade nor
 encouraged him." E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS'</FONT> own testimony, however, from other accounts,
 is rather different: that Peter's hearers were so penetrated by his
 preaching that they gave Mark, as being <I>a follower of Peter,</I> no
 rest till he consented to write his Gospel, as a memorial of his oral
 teaching; and "that the apostle, when he knew by the revelation of the
 Spirit what had been done, was delighted with the zeal of those men,
 and sanctioned the reading of the writing (that is, of this Gospel of
 Mark) in the churches" [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 2.15]. And giving
 in another of his works a similar statement, he says that "Peter, from
 excess of humility, did not think himself qualified to write the
 Gospel; but Mark, his acquaintance and pupil, is said to have recorded
 his relations of the actings of Jesus. And Peter testifies these things
 of himself; for all things that are recorded by Mark are said to be
 memoirs of Peter's discourses." It is needless to go farther--to
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT>, who says Mark composed his Gospel "as Peter guided" or
 "directed him, who, in his Catholic Epistle, calls him his son," &c.;
 and to J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>, who but echoes
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This, certainly, is a remarkable chain of testimony; which,
 confirmed as it is by such striking internal evidence, may be regarded
 as establishing the fact that the Second Gospel was drawn up mostly
 from materials furnished by Peter. In D<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>OSTA'S</FONT> <I>Four Witnesses</I> the
 reader will find this internal evidence detailed at length, though all
 the examples are not equally convincing. But if the reader will refer
 to our remarks on

 <A HREF="#Mr16_7">Mr 16:7</A>,

 and

 <A HREF="JFB43.HTM#Joh18_27">Joh 18:27</A>,

 he will have convincing evidence of a <I>Petrine</I> hand in this
 Gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It remains only to advert, in a word or two, to the <I>readers</I> for
 whom this Gospel was, in the first instance, designed, and the <I>date</I> of it. That it was not for <I>Jews</I> but <I>Gentiles,</I> is evident from the
 great number of explanations of Jewish usages, opinions, and places,
 which to a Jew would at that time have been superfluous, but were
 highly needful to a Gentile. We can here but refer to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:18,7:3,4,12:18,13:3,14:12,15:42">Mr 2:18;
 7:3, 4; 12:18; 13:3; 14:12; 15:42</A>,

 for examples of these. Regarding the date of this Gospel--about which
 nothing certain is known--if the tradition reported by I<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT> can be relied on, that it was written at
 Rome, "after the departure of Peter and Paul," and if by that word 
 "departure" we are to understand their <I>death,</I> we may date it 
 somewhere between the years 64 and 68; but in all likelihood this is 
 too late. It is probably nearer the truth to date it eight or ten years 
 earlier.</P>

 <B>1. The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God</B>--By
 the "Gospel" of Jesus Christ here is evidently meant the blessed Story
 which our Evangelist is about to tell of His Life, Ministry, Death,
 Resurrection, and Glorification, and of the begun Gathering of Believers
 in His Name. The abruptness with which he announces his subject, and the
 energetic brevity with which, passing by all preceding events, he
 hastens over the ministry of John and records the Baptism and Temptation
 of Jesus--as if impatient to come to the Public Life of the Lord of
 glory--have often been noticed as characteristic of this Gospel--a
 Gospel whose direct, practical, and singularly vivid setting imparts to
 it a preciousness peculiar to itself. What strikes every one is, that
 though the briefest of all the Gospels, this is in some of the principal
 scenes of our Lord's history the fullest. But what is not so obvious is,
 that wherever the finer and subtler feelings of humanity, or the deeper
 and more peculiar hues of our Lord's character were brought out, these,
 though they should be lightly passed over by all the other Evangelists,
 are sure to be found here, and in touches of such quiet delicacy and
 power, that though scarce observed by the cursory reader, they leave
 indelible impressions upon all the thoughtful and furnish a key to much
 that is in the other Gospels. These few opening words of the Second
 Gospel are enough to show, that though it was the purpose of this
 Evangelist to record chiefly the outward and palpable facts of our
 Lord's public life, he recognized in Him, in common with the Fourth
 Evangelist, the glory of the Only-begotten of the Father.</P>

 (Instead of the words, "as it is written in the Prophets," there is 
 weighty evidence in favor of the following reading: "As it is written 
 in Isaiah the prophet." This reading is adopted by all the latest 
 critical editors. If it be the true one, it is to be explained 
 thus--that of the two quotations, the one from Malachi is but a later 
 development of the great primary one in Isaiah, from which the whole 
 prophetical matter here quoted takes its name. But the received text is 
 quoted by I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT>, before the end of the 
 second century, and the evidence in its favor is greater in 
 <I>amount,</I> if not in weight. The chief objection to it is, that if 
 this was the true reading, it is difficult to see how the other one 
 could have got in at all; whereas, if it be not the true reading, it is 
 very easy to see how it found its way into the text, as it removes the 
 startling difficulty of a prophecy beginning with the words of Malachi 
 being ascribed to Isaiah.) For the exposition, see on

 The frequency with which this character of "impurity" is ascribed to
 evil spirits--some twenty times in the Gospels--is not to be overlooked.

 the question was, "Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time?"

 Themselves tormentors and destroyers of their victims, they discern in 
 Jesus their own destined tormentor and destroyer, anticipating and 
 dreading what they know and feel to be awaiting them!  Conscious, too, 
 that their power was but permitted and temporary, and perceiving in 
 Him, perhaps, the woman's Seed that was to bruise the head and destroy 
 the works of the devil, they regard His approach to them on this 
 occasion as a signal to let go their grasp of this miserable victim.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God</B>--This and other even
 more glorious testimonies to our Lord were given, as we know, with no
 good will, but in hope that, by the acceptance of them, He might appear
 to the people to be in league with evil spirits--a calumny which His
 enemies were ready enough to throw out against Him. But a Wiser than
 either was here, who invariably rejected and silenced the testimonies
 that came to Him from beneath, and thus was able to rebut the
 imputations of His enemies against Him 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:24-30">Mt 12:24-30</A>).

 The expression, "Holy One of God," seems evidently taken from that 
 Messianic Psalm

 those traces of Peter's hand in this Gospel, of which we shall find many
 more. The house being his, and the illness and cure so nearly affecting
 himself, it is interesting to observe this minute specification of the
 number and names of the witnesses; interesting also as the first
 occasion on which the sacred triumvirate of Peter and James and John are
 selected from among the rest, to be a threefold cord of testimony to
 certain events in their Lord's life

 we see how unlawful they would have deemed it to bring their sick to 
 Jesus for a cure during the sabbath hours. They waited, therefore, till

 in prayer." He was about to begin His first preaching and healing
 circuit; and as on similar solemn occasions

 He spent some time in special prayer, doubtless with a view to it. What
 would one not give to have been, during the stillness of those grey 
 morning hours, within hearing--not of His "strong crying and tears," 
 for He had scarce arrived at the stage for that--but of His calm, 
 exalted anticipations of the work which lay immediately before Him, and 
 the outpourings of His soul about it into the bosom of Him that sent 
 Him! He had doubtless enjoyed some uninterrupted hours of such 
 communings with His heavenly Father ere His friends from Capernaum 
 arrived in search of Him. As for them, they doubtless expected, after 
 such a day of miracles, that the next day would witness similar 
 manifestations. When morning came, Peter, loath to break in upon the 
 repose of his glorious Guest, would await His appearance beyond the 
 usual hour; but at length, wondering at the stillness, and gently 
 coming to see where the Lord lay, he finds it--like the sepulchre 
 afterwards--empty! Speedily a party is made up to go in search of Him, 
 Peter naturally leading the way.</P>

 brethren.</P>

 "sought after Him"--and who, on going to Peter's house, and there 
 learning that Peter and a few more were gone in search of Him, had set 
 out on the same errand--would have arrived, and "came unto Him and 
 stayed Him, that He should not depart from them"

 "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world,"
 &c.--another proof, by the way, that the lofty phraseology of the 
 Fourth Gospel was not unknown to the authors of the others, though 
 their design and point of view are different. The language in which our 
 Lord's reply is given by Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:43">Lu 4:43</A>)

 expresses the high necessity under which, in this as in every other 
 step of His work, He acted--"I must preach the kingdom of God to other 
 cities also; for therefore"--or, "to this end"--"am I sent." An act of 
 self-denial it doubtless was, to resist such pleadings to return to 
 Capernaum. But there were overmastering considerations on the other 
 side.</P>

 occurred at his informant's own door, these details are the vivid
 recollections of that honored disciple.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and he preached the word unto them</B>--that is, indoors; but in the
 hearing, doubtless, of the multitude that pressed around. Had He gone
 forth, as He naturally would, the paralytic's faith would have had no
 such opportunity to display itself. Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:17">Lu 5:17</A>)

 furnishes an additional and very important incident in the scene--as 
 follows: "And it came to pass on a certain day, as He was teaching, 
 that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were 
 come out of every town," or village, "of Galilee, and Judea, and 
 Jerusalem." This was the highest testimony yet borne to our Lord's 
 growing influence, and the necessity increasingly felt by the 
 ecclesiastics throughout the country of coming to some definite 
 judgment regarding Him. "And the power of the Lord was [present] to 
 heal them"--or, "was [efficacious] to heal them," that is, the sick 
 that were brought before Him. So that the miracle that is now to be 
 described was among the most glorious and worthy to be recorded of many 
 then performed; and what made it so was doubtless the faith which was 
 manifested in connection with it, and the proclamation of the 
 forgiveness of the patient's sins that immediately preceded it.</P>

 in Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:19">Lu 5:19</A>),

 "when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because 
 of the multitude," they "went upon the housetop"--the flat or 
 terrace-roof, universal in Eastern houses.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up,
 they let down the bed</B>--or portable couch

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>wherein the sick of the palsy lay</B>--Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:19">Lu 5:19</A>)

 says, they "let him down through the tilling with his couch into the 
 midst before Jesus." Their whole object was to <I>bring the patient 
 into the presence of Jesus;</I> and this not being possible in the 
 ordinary way, because of the multitude that surrounded Him, they took 
 the very unusual method here described of accomplishing their object, 
 and succeeded. Several explanations have been given of the way in which 
 this was done; but unless we knew the precise plan of the house, and 
 the part of it from which Jesus taught--which may have been a 
 quadrangle or open court, within the buildings of which Peter's house 
 was one, or a gallery covered by a veranda--it is impossible to 
 determine precisely how the thing was done. One thing, however, is 
 clear, that we have both the accounts from an eye-witness.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr2_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. When Jesus saw their faith</B>--It is remarkable that all the three
 narratives call it "<I>their</I> faith" which Jesus saw. That the patient
 himself had faith, we know from the proclamation of his forgiveness,
 which Jesus made before all; and we should have been apt to conclude
 that his four friends bore him to Jesus merely out of benevolent
 compliance with the urgent entreaties of the poor sufferer. But here we
 learn, not only that his bearers had the same faith with himself, but
 that Jesus marked it as a faith which was not to be defeated--a faith
 victorious over all difficulties. This was the faith for which He was
 ever on the watch, and which He never saw without marking, and, in those
 who needed anything from Him, richly rewarding.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son</B>--"be of good cheer"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:2">Mt 9:2</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>thy sins be forgiven thee</B>--By the word "be," our translators perhaps
 meant "are," as in Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:20">Lu 5:20</A>).

 For it is not a command to his sins to depart, but an authoritative 
 proclamation of the man's pardoned state as a believer. And yet, as the 
 Pharisees understood our Lord to be <I>dispensing</I> pardon by this 
 saying, and Jesus not only acknowledges that they were right, but 
 founds His whole argument upon the correctness of it, we must regard 
 the saying as a royal proclamation of the man's forgiveness by Him to 
 whom it belonged to dispense it; nor could such a style of address be 
 justified on any lower supposition.  (See on

 Mic 7:18; 
 Ex 34:6, 7</A>, 

 &c.). Nor was their first question altogether unnatural, though in our
 Lord's sole case it was unfounded.  That a man, to all appearances like 
 one of themselves, should claim authority and power to forgive sins, 
 they could not, on the first blush of it, but regard as in the last 
 degree startling; nor were they entitled even to weigh such a claim, as 
 worthy of a hearing, save on supposition of resistless evidence 
 afforded by Him in support of the claim. Accordingly, our Lord deals 
 with them as men entitled to such evidence, and supplies it; at the 
 same time chiding them for rashness, in drawing harsh conclusions 
 regarding Himself.</P>

 <B>7. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it,
 and it yielded no fruit</B>--This case is that of ground not thoroughly
 cleaned of the thistles, &c.; which, rising above the good seed,
 "choke" or "smother" it, excluding light and air, and drawing away the
 moisture and richness of the soil. Hence it "becomes unfruitful"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:22">Mt 13:22</A>);

 it grows, but its growth is checked, and it never ripens. The evil here 
 is neither a hard nor a shallow soil--there is <I>softness</I> enough, 
 and <I>depth</I> enough; but it is the existence in it of what draws 
 all the moisture and richness of the soil away to itself, and so 
 <I>starves the plant.</I> What now are these "thorns?" See on

 goodness of this last soil consists in its qualities being precisely 
 the reverse of the other three soils: from its softness and tenderness, 
 receiving and cherishing the seed; from its depth, allowing it to take 
 firm root, and not quickly losing its moisture; and from its cleanness, 
 giving its whole vigor and sap to the plant. In such a soil the seed 
 "brings forth fruit," in all different degrees of profusion, according 
 to the measure in which the soil possesses those qualities.  See on

 discipleship, next to the Twelve.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>asked of him the parable</B>--The reply would seem to intimate that 
 this parable of the sower was of that fundamental, comprehensive, and 
 introductory character which we have assigned to it (see on

 <B>13. Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all 
 parables?</B>--Probably this was said not so much in the spirit of 
 rebuke, as to call their attention to the exposition of it which He was 
 about to give, and so train them to the right apprehension of His
 future parables. As in the parables which we have endeavored to explain
 in

 <A HREF="JFB40.HTM#Chapter13">Mt 13.</A>,

 we shall take this parable and the Lord's own exposition of the
 different parts of it together.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr4_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14. The sower soweth the word</B>--or, as in Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:11">Lu 8:11</A>),

 "Now the parable is this: The seed is the <I>word of God.</I>" But who 
 is "the sower?" This is not expressed here because if "the word of God" 
 be the seed, every scatterer of that precious seed must be regarded as 
 a sower.  It is true that in the parable of the tares it is said, "He 
 that soweth the good seed is the Son of man," as "He that soweth the 
 tares is the devil"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:37,38">Mt 13:37, 38</A>).

 But these are only the great unseen parties, struggling in this world
 for the possession of man. Each of these has his agents among men 
 themselves; and Christ's agents in the sowing of the good seed are the 
 <I>preachers</I> of the word. Thus, as in all the cases about to be 
 described, the sower is the same, and the seed is the same; while the 
 result is entirely different, the whole difference must lie in the 
 <I>soils,</I> which mean the <I>different states of the human 
 heart.</I> And so, the great general lesson held forth in this parable 
 of the sower is, that however faithful the preacher, and how pure 
 soever his message, <I>the effect of the preaching of the word depends 
 upon the state of the hearer's heart.</I> Now follow the cases.  See on

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:19">Mt 13:19</A>),

 "When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it 
 not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown

 it not

 as God's means of restoring them to Himself; it penetrates not, makes 
 no impression, but lies loosely on the surface of the heart, till the 
 wicked one--afraid of losing a victim by his "believing to salvation"

 &c.--"Immediately" the seed in such a case "springs up"--all the
 quicker from the shallowness of the soil--"because it has no depth of
 earth." But the sun, beating on it, as quickly scorches and withers it
 up, "because it has no root" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:6">Mr 4:6</A>),
 
 and "lacks moisture"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:13">Lu 8:13</A>);

 <I>but the</I> heat of tribulation or persecution because of the word, 
 or <I>the trials which their new profession brings upon them quickly 
 dries up their relish for the truth, and withers all the hasty promise 
 of fruit which they showed.</I> Such disappointing issues of a faithful

 which are the fruit of this worldly "care"; third, "The pleasures of
 this life," or "the lusts of other things entering in"--the enjoyments
 in themselves may be innocent, which worldly prosperity enables one to
 indulge. These "<I>choke</I>" or "<I>smother</I>" the word; drawing off so
 much of one's attention, absorbing so much of one's interest, and using
 up so much of one's time, that only the dregs of these remain for
 spiritual things, and a fagged, hurried, and heartless formalism is at
 length all the religion of such persons. What a vivid picture is this
 of the mournful condition of many, especially in great commercial
 countries, who once promised much fruit! "They bring no fruit
 <I>to perfection</I>"

 sixty, and some an hundred</B>--A heart soft and tender, stirred to its
 depths on the great things of eternity, and jealously guarded from
 worldly engrossments, such only is the "honest and good heart"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:15">Lu 8:15</A>),

 which "keeps," that is, "retains" the seed of the word, and bears fruit 
 just in proportion as it is such a heart. Such "bring forth fruit with 
 <I>patience</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:15">Mr 4:15</A>),

 or continuance, "enduring to the end"; in contrast with those in whom
 the word is "choked" and brings no fruit <I>to perfection.</I> The 
 "thirtyfold" is designed to express the <I>lowest</I> degree of 
 fruitfulness; the "hundredfold" the <I>highest;</I> and the "sixtyfold" 
 the <I>intermediate</I> degrees of fruitfulness. As a "hundredfold," 
 though not unexampled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:12">Ge 26:12</A>),
 
 is a rare return in the natural husbandry, so the highest degrees of
 spiritual fruitfulness are too seldom witnessed. The closing words of
 this introductory parable seem designed to call attention to the
 <I>fundamental</I> and <I>universal</I> character of it.</P>

 the ground; and should sleep, and rise night and day</B>--go about his
 other ordinary occupations, leaving it to the well-known laws of
 vegetation under the genial influences of heaven. This is the sense of

 <B>when the even was come</B>--(See on

 This must have been the earlier evening--what we should call the 
 afternoon--since after all that passed on the other side, when He 
 returned to the west side, the people were waiting for Him in great 
 numbers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:21,Lu+8:40">Mr 4:21;

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side</B>--to the
 east side of the lake, to grapple with a desperate case of possession,
 and set the captive free, and to give the Gadarenes an opportunity of
 hearing the message of salvation, amid the wonder which that marvellous
 cure was fitted to awaken and the awe which the subsequent events could
 not but strike into them.</P>

 <B>36. And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as
 he was in the ship</B>--that is, without any preparation, and without so
 much as leaving the vessel, out of which He had been all day teaching.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>And there were also with him other little ships</B>--with passengers,
 probably, wishing to accompany Him.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr4_37"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>37. And there arose a great storm of wind</B>--"a tempest of wind." To
 such sudden squalls the Sea of Galilee is very liable from its position,
 in a deep basin, skirted on the east by lofty mountain ranges, while on
 the west the hills are intersected by narrow gorges through which the
 wind sweeps across the lake, and raises its waters with great rapidity
 into a storm.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and the waves beat into the ship</B>--kept beating or pitching on the ship.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>so that it was now full</B>--rather, "so that it was already filling." In
 Matthew 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:24">Mt 8:24</A>),

 "insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves"; but this is too 
 strong. It should be, "so that the ship was getting covered by the 
 waves." So we must translate the word used in Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:23">Lu 8:23</A>)

 --not as in our version--"And there came down a storm on the lake, and 
 they were filled [with water]"--but "they were getting filled," that 
 is, those who sailed; meaning, of course, that their ship was so.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr4_38"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>38. And he was in the hinder part of the ship</B>--or stern.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>asleep on a pillow</B>--either a place in the vessel made to receive the
 head, or a cushion for the head to rest on. It was evening; and after
 the fatigues of a busy day of teaching under the hot sun, having nothing
 to do while crossing the lake, He sinks into a deep sleep, which even
 this tempest raging around and tossing the little vessel did not
 disturb.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and they awake him, and say unto him, Master</B>--or "Teacher." In Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:24">Lu 8:24</A>)

 this is doubled--in token of their life-and-death earnestness--"Master, 
 Master."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>carest thou not that we perish?</B>--Unbelief and fear made them sadly
 forget their place, to speak so. Matthew 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:25">Mt 8:25</A>)

 has it, "Lord, save us, we perish." When those accustomed to fish upon 
 that deep thus spake, the danger must have been imminent. They say
 nothing of what would become of <I>Him,</I> if they perished; nor
 think, whether, if He could not perish, it was likely He would let this 
 happen to them; but they hardly knew what they said.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr4_39"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:24">Lu 8:24</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and said unto the sea, Peace, be still</B>--two sublime words of command,
 from a Master to His servants, the elements.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm</B>--The sudden hushing
 of the wind would not at once have calmed the sea, whose commotion would
 have settled only after a considerable time. But the word of command was
 given to both elements at once.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr4_40"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>40. And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful?</B>--There is a natural
 apprehension under danger; but there was unbelief in their fear. It is
 worthy of notice how considerately the Lord defers this rebuke till He
 had first removed the danger, in the midst of which they would not have
 been in a state to listen to anything.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>how is it that ye have no faith?</B>--next to none, or none in present
 exercise. In Matthew 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:26">Mt 8:26</A>)

 it is, "Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?" <I>Faith</I> they 
 had, for they applied to Christ for relief: but <I>little,</I> for they 
 were afraid, though Christ was in the ship.  Faith dispels fear, but 
 only in proportion to its strength.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr4_41"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>41. And they feared exceedingly</B>--were struck with deep awe.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the 
 wind and the sea obey him?</B>--"What is this? Israel has all along 
 been singing of J<FONT SIZE=-1>EHOVAH</FONT>, 'Thou rulest the raging
 of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, Thou stillest them!' 'The
 Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the

 But, lo, in this very boat of ours is One of our own flesh and blood,
 who with His word of command hath done the same!  Exhausted with the
 fatigues of the day, He was but a moment ago in a deep sleep,
 undisturbed by the howling tempest, and we had to waken Him with the
 cry of our terror; but rising at our call, His majesty was felt by the
 raging elements, for they were instantly 
 hushed--'W<FONT SIZE=-1>HAT</FONT>

 out all their mind, perhaps this would have been it: "If we must quit

 this is given with majestic brevity--"Go!" The owners, if Jews, drove 
 an illegal trade; if heathens, they insulted the national religion: in 
 either case the permission was just.

 their own senses, to the reality of both miracles.</P>

 who supplies the missing piece of information here. This is a striking 
 case of what are called <I>Undesigned Coincidences</I> amongst the 
 different Evangelists; one of them taking a thing for granted, as 
 familiarly known at the time, but which we should never have known but 
 for one or more of the others, and without the knowledge of which some 
 of their statements would be unintelligible. The clothing which the 
 poor man would feel the want of the moment his consciousness returned 
 to him, was doubtless supplied to him by some of the Twelve.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and in his right mind</B>--but now, oh, in what a lofty sense! (Compare
 an analogous, though a different kind of case,

 themselves.</P>

 Alas, no! For Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:37">Lu 8:37</A>)

 says, "Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round 
 about besought Him to depart from them; for they were taken with great 
 fear." The evil spirits had thus, alas!  their object. Irritated, the 
 people could not suffer His presence; yet awe-struck, they dared not 
 order Him off: so they entreat Him to withdraw, and--He takes them at 
 their word.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr5_18"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>18. he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might
 be with him</B>--the grateful heart, fresh from the hand of demons,
 clinging to its wondrous Benefactor. How exquisitely natural!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>19. Howbeit, Jesus suffered him not,</B> &c.--To be a missionary for
 Christ, in the region where he was so well known and so long dreaded,
 was a far nobler calling than to follow Him where nobody had ever heard
 of him, and where other trophies not less illustrious could be raised by
 the same power and grace.</P>

 demoniac, to the west side, at Capernaum.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>much people gathered unto him</B>--who "gladly received Him; for they were
 all waiting for Him" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:40">Lu 8:40</A>).

 The abundant teaching earlier that day

 &c., and Mt 13:1-58</A>)

 had only whetted the people's appetite: and disappointed, as would
 seem, that He had left them in the evening to cross the lake, they 
 remain hanging about the beach, having got a hint, probably through 
 some of His disciples, that He would be back the same evening. Perhaps 
 they witnessed at a distance the sudden calming of the tempest. The 
 tide of our Lord's popularity was now fast rising.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and he was nigh unto the sea.</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mr5_22"> </A>

 <B>22. And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue</B>--of
 which class there were but few who believed in Jesus 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:48">Joh 7:48</A>).
 
 One would suppose from this that the ruler had been with the multitude
 on the shore, anxiously awaiting the return of Jesus, and immediately on
 His arrival had accosted Him as here related. But Matthew 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:18">Mt 9:18</A>)

 tells us that the ruler came to Him while He was in the act of speaking 
 at His own table on the subject of fasting; and as we must suppose that 
 this converted publican ought to know what took place on that memorable 
 occasion when he made a feast to his Lord, we conclude that here the 
 right order is indicated by the First Evangelist alone.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Jairus by name</B>--or "Jaeirus." It is the same name as <I>Jair,</I> in the
 Old Testament

 "worshipped Him." The meaning is the same in both.</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:42">Lu 8:42</A>)

 says, "He had one only daughter, about twelve years of age." According 
 to a well-known rabbin, quoted by L<FONT SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT>, a 
 daughter, till she had completed her twelfth year, was called
 "little," or "a little maid"; after that, "a young woman."

 <B>lieth at the point of death</B>--Matthew 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:18">Mt 9:18</A>)

 gives it thus: "My daughter is even now dead"--"has just expired." The 
 news of her death reached the father after the cure of the woman with 
 the issue of blood: but Matthew's brief account gives only the 
 <I>result,</I> as in the case of the centurion's servant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:5">Mt 8:5</A>,

 <B>come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall
 live</B>--or, "that she may be healed and live," according to a fully
 preferable reading. In one of the class to which this man belonged, so
 steeped in prejudice, such faith would imply more than in others.</P>

 medical treatment, but to the much varied treatment which she underwent.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather
 grew worse</B>--pitiable case, and affectingly aggravated; emblem of our
 natural state as fallen creatures

 will still more appear as we proceed.</P>

 <B>27. When she had heard of Jesus, came</B>--This was the right experiment
 at last. What had she "heard of Jesus?" No doubt it was His marvellous
 cures she had heard of; and the hearing of these, in connection with her
 bitter experience of the vanity of applying to any other, had been
 blessed to the kindling in her soul of a firm confidence that He who had
 so willingly wrought such cures on others was able and would not refuse
 to heal her also.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in the press behind</B>--shrinking, yet seeking.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>touched his garment</B>--According to the ceremonial law, the touch of
 anyone having the disease which this woman had would have defiled the
 person touched. Some think that the recollection of this may account for
 her stealthily approaching Him in the crowd behind, and touching but the
 hem of His garment. But there was an instinct in the faith which brought
 her to Jesus, which taught her, that if that touch could set her free
 from the defiling disease itself, it was impossible to communicate
 defilement to Him, and that this wondrous Healer must be above such
 laws.</P>

 was her issue of blood stanched 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:44">Lu 8:44</A>),

 but the cause of it was thoroughly removed, insomuch that by her bodily

 <B>had gone out of him</B>--He was conscious of the forthgoing of His
 healing power, which was not--as in prophets and apostles--something
 <I>foreign to Himself</I> and imparted merely, but what He had
 <I>dwelling within Him</I> as "His own fulness."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>turned him about in the press</B>--crowd.

 "When all denied, Peter and they that were with Him said, Master."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched
 me?</B>--"Askest thou, Lord, who touched Thee? Rather ask who touched Thee
 not in such a throng." "And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched Me"--"a
 certain person has touched Me"--"for I perceive that virtue is gone out
 of Me"

 Yes, the multitude "<I>thronged</I> and <I>pressed</I> Him"--they 
 <I>jostled against</I> Him, but all <I>involuntarily;</I> they were 
 merely <I>carried along;</I> but one, one only--"a certain 
 person--<FONT SIZE=-1>TOUCHED</FONT> H<FONT SIZE=-1>IM</FONT>," with 
 the conscious, voluntary, dependent touch of faith, reaching forth its 
 hand expressly to have contact with Him. This and this only Jesus 
 acknowledges and seeks out. Even so, as A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT> 
 long ago said, <I>multitudes still come similarly close to Christ in 
 the means of grace, but all to no purpose, being only sucked into the 
 crowd.</I> The voluntary, living contact of faith is that electric

 her.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr5_33"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>33. But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in
 her</B>--alarmed, as a humble, shrinking female would naturally be, at
 the necessity of so public an exposure of herself, yet conscious that
 she had a tale to tell which would speak for her.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth</B>--In Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:47">Lu 8:47</A>)

 it is, "When the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, 
 and falling down before Him, she declared unto Him before all the 
 people for what cause she had touched Him, and how she was healed 
 immediately." This, though it tried the modesty of the believing woman, 
 was just what Christ wanted in dragging her forth, her public testimony 
 to the facts of her case--the disease, with her abortive efforts at a 
 cure, and the instantaneous and perfect relief which her touching the 
 Great Healer had brought her.</P>

 <B>thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy
 plague</B>--Though healed as soon as she believed, it seemed to her a

 royal seal upon it. But what a glorious dismissal from the lips of Him

 bound him in prison</B>--in the castle of Mach&aelig;rus, near the southern
 extremity of Herod's dominions, and adjoining the Dead Sea
 [J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, <I>Antiquities,</I> 18.5,2].

 <B>his brother Philip's wife</B>--and therefore the niece of both brothers.
 This Philip, however, was not the tetrarch of that name mentioned in

 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu3_1">Lu 3:1</A>), 

 but one whose distinctive name was "Herod Philip," another son of Herod 
 the Great--who was disinherited by his father. Herod Antipas' own wife 
 was the daughter of Aretas, king of Arabia; but he prevailed on 
 Herodias, his half-brother Philip's wife, to forsake her husband and 
 live with him, on condition, says J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> 
 [<I>Antiquities,</I> 18.5,1], that he should put away his own wife. 
 This involved him afterwards in war with Aretas, who totally defeated 
 him and destroyed his army, from the effects of which he was never able 
 to recover himself.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr6_18"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>18. For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have 
 thy brother's wife</B>--Noble fidelity! It was not lawful because 
 Herod's wife and Herodias' husband were both living; and further, 
 because the parties were within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity 
 (see

 speak to him; still less would she quarrel with him.

 <B>knowing that he was a just man and an holy</B>--Compare the case of 
 Elijah with Ahab, after the murder of Naboth

 that is, from the wicked designs of Herodias, who had been watching for
 some pretext to get Herod entangled and committed to despatch him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and when he heard him, he did many things</B>--many good things under the
 influence of the Baptist on his conscience.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and heard him gladly</B>--a striking statement this, for which we are
 indebted to our graphic Evangelist alone, illustrating the working of
 contrary principles in the slaves of passion. But this only shows how
 far Herodias must have wrought upon him, as Jezebel upon Ahab, that he
 should at length agree to what his awakened conscience kept him long
 from executing.</P>

 Herod."

 <I>estates</I> of Galilee</B>--This graphic minuteness of detail adds much to

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>sware unto her Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, unto the half of my

 will in a capricious moment say and do what in their cool moments they
 bitterly regret.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr6_24"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>24. And she said, The head of John the Baptist</B>--Abandoned women are
 more shameless and heartless than men. The Baptist's fidelity marred the
 pleasures of Herodias, and this was too good an opportunity of getting
 rid of him to let slip.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr6_25"> </A>

 <A NAME="Mr6_26"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>26. And the king was exceeding sorry</B>--With his feelings regarding
 John, and the truths which so told upon his conscience from that
 preacher's lips, and after so often and carefully saving him from his
 paramour's rage, it must have been very galling to find himself at
 length entrapped by his own rash folly.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>yet for his oath's sake</B>--See how men of no principle, but troublesome
 conscience, will stick at breaking a rash oath, while yielding to the
 commission of the worst crimes!

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and for their sakes which sat with him</B>--under the influence of that
 false shame, which could not brook being thought to be troubled with
 religious or moral scruples. To how many has this proved a fatal snare!

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he would not reject her.</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mr6_27"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 in attendance. The word is Roman, denoting one of the Imperial Guard.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in
 the prison</B>--after, it would seem, more than twelve months'
 imprisonment. Blessed martyr! Dark and cheerless was the end reserved
 for thee: but now thou hast thy Master's benediction, "Blessed is he
 whosoever shall not be offended in Me" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:6">Mt 11:6</A>),

 and hast found the life thou gavest away

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:39">Mt 10:39</A>).

 But where are they in whose skirts is found thy blood?</P>

 <A NAME="Mr6_28"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>28. And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and
 the damsel gave it to her mother</B>--Herodias did not shed the blood of
 the stern reprover; she only got it done, and then gloated over it, as
 it streamed from the trunkless head.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr6_29"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>29. And when his disciples heard of it</B>--that is, the Baptist's own
 disciples.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb</B>--"and went
 and told Jesus" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:12">Mt 14:12</A>).

 If these disciples had, up to this time, stood apart from Him, as 
 adherents of John

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:2">Mt 11:2</A>),

 perhaps they now came to Jesus, not without some secret reflection on 
 Him for His seeming neglect of their master; but perhaps, too, as 
 orphans, to cast in their lot henceforth with the Lord's disciples. How 
 Jesus felt, or what He said, on receiving this intelligence, is not 
 recorded; but He of whom it was said, as He stood by the grave of His 
 friend Lazarus, "Jesus wept," was not likely to receive such 
 intelligence without deep emotion. And one reason why He might not be 
 unwilling that a small body of John's disciples should cling to him to 
 the last, might be to provide some attached friends who should do for 
 his precious body, on a small scale, what was afterwards to be done for 
 His own.</P>

 Here, for the first time, all the four streams of sacred text run
 parallel. The occasion and all the circumstances of this grand section
 are thus brought before us with a vividness quite remarkable.</P>

 <I>Five Thousand Miraculously Fed</I>

 Capernaum, on returning from their mission 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:7-13">Mr 6:7-13</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had
 taught</B>--Observe the various reasons He had for crossing to the other
 side. First, Matthew 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:13">Mt 14:13</A>)

 says, that "when Jesus heard" of the murder of His faithful 
 forerunner--from those attached disciples of his who had taken up his 
 body and laid it in a sepulchre (see on

 <A HREF="#Mr6_29">Mr 6:29</A>)

 --"He departed by ship into a desert place apart"; either to avoid some 
 apprehended consequences to Himself, arising from the Baptist's death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:23">Mt 10:23</A>),

 or more probably to be able to indulge in those feelings which that 
 affecting event had doubtless awakened, and to which the bustle of the 
 multitude around Him was very unfavorable. Next, since He must have 
 heard the report of the Twelve with the deepest interest, and probably 
 with something of the emotion which He experienced on the return of the 
 Seventy (see on

 <A HREF="JFB42.htm#Lu10_17">Lu 10:17-22</A>), 

 He sought privacy for undisturbed reflection on this begun preaching 
 and progress of His kingdom. Once more, He was wearied with the 
 multitude of "comers and goers"--depriving Him even of leisure enough 
 to take His food--and wanted <I>rest:</I> "Come ye yourselves apart 
 into a desert place, and rest a while," &c. Under the combined 
 influence of all these considerations, our Lord sought this change.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr6_31"> </A>

 <A NAME="Mr6_32"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>32. And they departed into a desert place by ship privately</B>--"over
 the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias," says John

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:1">Joh 6:1</A>),

 the only one of the Evangelists who so fully describes it; the others
 having written when their readers were supposed to know something of 
 it, while the last wrote for those at a greater distance of time and 
 place. This "desert place" is more definitely described by Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:10">Lu 9:10</A>)

 as "belonging to the city called Bethsaida." This must not be 
 confounded with the town so called on the western side of the lake (see 
 on

 <A HREF="JFB40.htm#Mt11_21">Mt 11:21</A>). 

 This town lay on its northeastern side, near where the Jordan empties 
 itself into it: in Gaulonitis, out of the dominions of Herod Antipas, 
 and within the dominions of Philip the Tetrarch

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:1">Lu 3:1</A>),

 who raised it from a village to a city, and called it <I>Julias,</I> in 
 honor of Julia, the daughter of Augustus [J<FONT

 <A NAME="Mr6_33"> </A>

 <B>33. And the people</B>--the multitudes.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saw them departing, and many knew him</B>--The true reading would seem to
 be: "And many saw them departing, and knew or recognized [them]."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and ran afoot</B>--Here, perhaps, it should be rendered "by land"--running
 round by the head of the lake, and taking one of the fords of the river,
 so as to meet Jesus, who was crossing with the Twelve by ship.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>thither out of all cities, and outwent them</B>--got before them.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and came together unto him</B>--How exceedingly graphic is this! every
 touch of it betokening the presence of an eye-witness. John 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:3">Joh 6:3</A>)

 says, that "Jesus went up into a mountain"--somewhere in that hilly 
 range, the green tableland which skirts the eastern side of the 
 lake.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr6_34"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>34. And Jesus, when he came out of the ship</B>--having gone on shore.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saw much people</B>--a great multitude.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep
 not having a shepherd</B>--At the sight of the multitudes who had followed
 Him by land and even got before Him, He was so moved, as was His wont in
 such cases, with compassion, because they were like shepherdless sheep,
 as to forego both privacy and rest that He might minister to them. Here
 we have an important piece of information from the Fourth Evangelist

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:4">Joh 6:4</A>),

 "And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh"--rather, "Now the 
 passover, the feast of the Jews, was nigh." This accounts for the 
 multitudes that now crowded around Him. They were on their way to keep 
 that festival at Jerusalem. But Jesus did not go up to this festival, 
 as John expressly tells us,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:1">Joh 7:1</A>)

 that "Jesus said to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may 
 eat? (And this He said to prove him: for He Himself knew what He would 
 do)." The subject may have been introduced by some remark of the

 they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes</B>--John is more precise and
 full: "One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto
 Him, There is a lad here which hath five barley loaves and two small
 fishes: but what are they among so many?"

 Probably this was the whole stock of provisions then at the command of 
 the disciples--no more than enough for one meal to them--and entrusted 
 for the time to this lad. "He said, Bring them hither to me"

 thanksgiving for the meal, and benediction of it as the food of 
 thousands, was the crisis of the miracle.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before
 them</B>--thus virtually holding forth these men as His future ministers.

 adds, "and likewise of the fishes, as much as they would"--to show that 
 vast as was the multitude, and scanty the provisions, the meal to each 
 and all of them was a plentiful one. "When they were filled, He said 
 unto His disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing 
 be lost"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:12">Joh 6:12</A>).

 fishes</B>--"Therefore (says

 they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the 
 fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto 
 them that had eaten." The article here rendered "baskets" in all the 
 four narratives was part of the luggage taken by Jews on a journey--to 
 carry, it is said, both their provisions and hay to sleep on, that they 
 might not have to depend on Gentiles, and so run the risk of ceremonial 
 pollution. In this we have a striking corroboration of the truth of the 
 four narratives. Internal evidence renders it clear, we think, that the 
 first three Evangelists wrote independently of each other, though the 
 fourth must have seen all the others. But here, each of the first three 
 Evangelists uses the same word to express the apparently insignificant 
 circumstance that the baskets employed to gather up the fragments were 
 of the kind which even the Roman satirist, J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>UVENAL</FONT>, knew by the name of <I>cophinus,</I> while in 
 both the narratives of the feeding of the Four Thousand the baskets 
 used are expressly said to have been of the kind called <I>spuris.</I>

 One very important particular given by John alone 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:15">Joh 6:15</A>)

 introduces this portion: "When Jesus therefore perceived that they 
 would take Him by force, to make Him a king, He departed again into a 
 mountain Himself alone."</P>

 and to go to the other side before</B>--Him.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:21">Joh 12:21</A>).
 
 John

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:17">Joh 6:17</A>)

 says they "went over the sea towards Capernaum"--the wind, probably, 
 occasioning this slight deviation from the direction of Bethsaida.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>while he sent away the people</B>--"the multitude." His object in this was
 to put an end to the misdirected excitement in His favor 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:15">Joh 6:15</A>),

 into which the disciples themselves may have been somewhat drawn. The 
 word "constrained" implies reluctance on their part, perhaps from 
 unwillingness to part with their Master and embark at night, leaving 
 Him alone on the mountain.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr6_46"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>46. And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to
 pray</B>--thus at length getting that privacy and rest which He had vainly
 sought during the earlier part of the day; opportunity also to pour out
 His soul in connection with the extraordinary excitement in His favor
 that evening--which appears to have marked the zenith of His reputation,
 for it began to decline the very next day; and a place whence He might
 watch the disciples on the lake, pray for them in their extremity, and
 observe the right time for coming to them, in a new manifestation of His
 glory, on the sea.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr6_47"> </A>

 <B>47. And when even was come</B>--the later evening (see on

 It had come even when the disciples embarked

 Joh 6:16</A>).

 <B>the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land</B>--John
 says 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:17">Joh 6:17</A>),

 "It was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them." Perhaps they made no 
 great effort to push across at first, having a lingering hope that 
 their Master would yet join them, and so allowed the darkness to come 
 on. "And the sea arose" (adds the beloved disciple,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:18">Joh 6:18</A>),
 
 "by reason of a great wind that blew."</P>

 <B>48. And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto
 them</B>--putting forth all their strength to buffet the waves and bear on
 against a head wind, but to little effect. He "saw" this from His
 mountain top, and through the darkness of the night, for His heart was
 all with them: yet would He not go to their relief till His own time
 came.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and about the fourth watch of the night</B>--The Jews, who used to 
 divide the night into three watches, latterly adopted the Roman 
 division into four watches, as here. So that, at the rate of three 
 hours to each, the fourth watch, reckoning from six <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>P.M.</FONT>, would be three o'clock in the morning. "So when
 they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:19">Joh 6:19</A>)

 --rather more than halfway across. The lake is about seven miles broad
 at its widest part. So that in eight or nine hours they had only made 
 some three and a half miles. By this time, therefore, they must have 
 been in a state of exhaustion and despondency bordering on despair; and 
 now at length, having tried them long enough.

 ship"

 He would appear to them at first like a dark moving speck upon the 
 waters; then as a human figure; but in the dark tempestuous sky, and 
 not dreaming that it could be their Lord, they take it for a spirit.

 --"It is I," which from the mouth that spake it and the circumstances
 in which it was uttered, passes the power of language to express. Here 
 were they in the midst of a raging sea, their little bark the sport of 
 the elements, and with just enough of light to descry an object on the 
 waters which only aggravated their fears. But Jesus deems it enough to 
 dispel all apprehension to let them know that <I>He was there.</I> From 
 other lips that "I am" would have merely meant that the person speaking 
 was such a one and not another person. That, surely, would have done 
 little to calm the fears of men expecting every minute, it may be, to 
 go to the bottom.  But spoken by One who at that moment was "treading 
 upon the waves of the sea," and was about to hush the raging elements 
 with His word, what was it but the Voice which cried of old in the ears 
 of Israel, even from the days of Moses, "I <FONT SIZE=-1>AM</FONT>"; 
 "I, <FONT SIZE=-1>EVEN</FONT> I, <FONT SIZE=-1>AM</FONT> H<FONT

 Now, that Word is "made flesh, and dwells among us," uttering itself
 from beside us in dear familiar tones--"It is the Voice of my Beloved!"
 How far was this apprehended by these frightened disciples? There was
 one, we know, in the boat who outstripped all the rest in susceptibility
 to such sublime appeals. It was not the deep-toned writer of the Fourth
 Gospel, who, though he lived to soar beyond all the apostles, was as yet
 too young for prominence, and all unripe. It was Simon Barjonas. Here
 follows a very remarkable and instructive episode, recorded by Matthew

 otherwise, without any <I>felt</I> power to keep him up? He then "begins to

 terror); but implying also a glad welcome, their first fears now
 converted into wonder and delight. "And immediately," adds the beloved
 disciple, "they were at the land whither they went," or "were bound."
 This additional miracle, for as such it is manifestly related, is
 recorded by the fourth Evangelist alone. As the storm was suddenly
 calmed, so the little bark--propelled by the secret power of the Lord of
 nature now sailing in it--glided through the now unruffled waters, and,
 while they were wrapt in wonder at what had happened, not heeding their

 The first words of this narrative show that the incident followed, in
 point of time, immediately on what precedes it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>24. And from thence he arose, and went into the borders</B>--or "unto
 the borders."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of Tyre and Sidon</B>--the two great Ph&oelig;nician seaports, but here
 denoting the territory generally, to the frontiers of which Jesus now
 came. But did Jesus actually enter this heathen territory? The whole
 narrative, we think, proceeds upon the supposition that He did. His
 immediate object seems to have been to avoid the wrath of the Pharisees
 at the withering exposure He had just made of their traditional
 religion.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and entered into an house, and would have no man know it</B>--because He
 had not come there to minister to heathens. But though not "<I>sent</I> but
 to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:24">Mt 15:24</A>),

 He hindered not the lost sheep of the vast Gentile world from coming to 
 Him, nor put them away when they did come--as this incident was 
 designed to show.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but he could not be hid</B>--Christ's fame had early spread from Galilee
 to this very region 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:8,Lu+6:17">Mr 3:8;

 <B>25. For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean
 spirit</B>--or, as in Matthew

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:22">Mt 15:22</A>),

 "was badly demonized."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>heard of him</B>--One wonders how; but distress is quick of hearing.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and fell at his feet:</B></P>

 <A NAME="Mr7_26"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>26. The woman was a Greek</B>--that is, "a Gentile," as in the <I>Margin.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>a Syroph&oelig;nician by nation</B>--so called as inhabiting the
 Ph&oelig;nician tract of Syria. J<FONT SIZE=-1>UVENAL</FONT> uses the
 same term, as was remarked by
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>USTIN</FONT>
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ARTYR</FONT> and
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT>. Matthew

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:22">Mt 15:22</A>)

 calls her "a woman
 of Canaan"--a more intelligible description to his Jewish readers
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:30,32,33">Jud 1:30, 32, 33</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her
 daughter</B>--"She cried unto Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son
 of David: my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:22">Mt 15:22</A>).
 
 Thus, though no Israelite herself, she salutes Him as Israel's promised
 Messiah. Here we must go to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:23-25">Mt 15:23-25</A>

 for some important links in the dialogue omitted by our Evangelist.</P>

 <P>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:23">Mt 15:23</A>:

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B><I>But he answered her not a word</I></B>--The design of this was first,
 perhaps, to show that He was not <I>sent</I> to such as she. He had said
 expressly to the Twelve, "Go not into the way of the Gentiles"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:5">Mt 10:5</A>);

 and being now among them Himself, He would, for consistency's sake, let 
 it be seen that He had not gone thither for <I>missionary</I> purposes. 
 Therefore He not only kept silence, but had actually left the house, 
 and--as will presently appear--was proceeding on His way back, when 
 this woman accosted Him. But another reason for keeping silence plainly 
 was to try and whet her faith, patience, and perseverance. And it had 
 the desired effect: "She <I>cried after them,</I>" which shows that He 
 was already on His way from the place.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B><I>And His disciples came and besought Him, saying, Send her away; for</I>
 <I>she crieth after us</I></B>--They thought her troublesome with her
 importunate cries, just as they did the people who brought young
 children to be blessed of Him, and they ask their Lord to "send her
 away," that is, to grant her request and be rid of her; for we gather
 from His reply that they meant to solicit favor for her, though not for
 her sake so much as their own.</P>
 
 <P>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:24">Mt 15:24</A>:

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B><I>But He answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep 
 of</I> <I>the house of Israel</I></B>--a speech evidently intended for 
 the disciples themselves, to satisfy them that, though the grace He was 
 about to show to this Gentile believer was <I>beyond His strict</I> 
 commission, He had not gone <I>spontaneously</I> to dispense it. Yet 
 did even this speech open a gleam of hope, could she have discerned it. 
 For thus might she have spoken: "I am not <FONT SIZE=-1>SENT</FONT>, 
 did He say? Truth, Lord, Thou comest not hither in quest of <I>us,</I> 
 but I come in quest of <I>Thee;</I> and must I go empty away? So did 
 not the woman of Samaria, whom when Thou foundest her on Thy way to 
 Galilee, Thou sentest away to make many rich!" But this our poor 
 Syroph&oelig;nician could not attain to. What, then, can she answer to 
 such a speech? Nothing. She has reached her lowest depth, her darkest 
 moment: she will just utter her last cry:</P>

 <P>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:25">Mt 15:25</A>:

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B><I>Then came she and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me!</I></B>--This
 appeal, so artless, wrung from the depths of a believing heart, and
 reminding us of the publican's "God be merciful to me a sinner," moved
 the Redeemer at last to break silence--but in what style? Here we
 return to our own Evangelist.</P>

 <B>27. But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be 
 filled</B>--"Is there hope for me here?" "Filled
 <FONT SIZE=-1>FIRST</FONT>?" "Then my turn, it seems, <I>is</I> coming!--but
 then, 'The <FONT SIZE=-1>CHILDREN</FONT> first?' Ah! when, on that rule,
 shall my turn ever come!" But ere she has time for these ponderings of
 His word, another word comes to supplement it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto
 the dogs</B>--Is this the death of her hopes? Nay, rather it is life from
 the dead. Out of the eater shall come forth meat 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+14:14">Jud 14:14</A>).

 "At evening-time, it shall be light"

 "Ah! I have it now.  Had He kept silence, what could I have done but go 
 unblest? but He hath spoken, and the victory is mine."</P>

 <A NAME="Mr7_28"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>28. And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord</B>--or, as the same
 word is rendered in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:27">Mt 15:27</A>.
 
 "Truth, Lord."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>yet the dogs eat of the children's crumbs</B>--"which fall from their
 master's table" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:27">Mt 15:27</A>).

 "I thank Thee, O blessed One, for that word! That's my whole case. Not 
 of the children? True. A dog? True also: <I>Yet</I> the dogs under the 
 table are allowed to eat of the children's crumbs--the droppings from 
 their master's full table: Give me that, and I am content: One crumb of 
 power and grace from Thy table shall cast the devil out of my 
 daughter." Oh, what lightning quickness, what reach of instinctive 
 ingenuity, do we behold in this heathen woman!</P>

 <A NAME="Mr7_29"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>29. And he said unto her</B>--"O woman, great is thy faith"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:28">Mt 15:28</A>).

 As B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> beautifully remarks, Jesus "marvelled" 
 only at two things--<I>faith</I> and <I>unbelief</I> (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:9">Lu 7:9</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy
 daughter</B>--That moment the deed was done.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr7_30"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>30. And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out,
 and her daughter laid upon the bed</B>--But Matthew

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:28">Mt 15:28</A>)

 is more specific; "And her daughter was made whole from that very
 hour." The wonderfulness of this case in all its features has been felt 
 in every age of the Church, and the balm it has administered, and will 
 yet administer, to millions will be known only in that day that shall 
 reveal the secrets of all hearts.</P>

 <I>Deaf and Dumb Man Healed</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:31-37">Mr 7:31-37</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>31. And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came
 unto the Sea of Galilee</B>--or, according to what has very strong claims
 to be regarded as the true text here, "And again, departing from the
 coasts of Tyre, He came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee." The
 manuscripts in favor of this reading, though not the most numerous, are
 weighty, while the versions agreeing with it are among the most ancient;
 and all the best critical editors and commentators adopt it. In this
 case we must understand that our Lord, having once gone out of the Holy
 Land the length of Tyre, proceeded as far north as Sidon, though without
 ministering, so far as appears, in those parts, and then bent His steps
 in a southeasterly direction. There is certainly a difficulty in the
 supposition of so long a <I>detour</I> without any missionary object: and
 some may think this sufficient to cast the balance in favor of the
 received reading. Be this as it may, on returning from these coasts of
 Tyre, He passed

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>through the midst of the coasts</B>--frontiers.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of Decapolis</B>--crossing the Jordan, therefore, and approaching the
 lake on its east side. Here Matthew, who omits the details of the cure
 of this deaf and dumb man, introduces some particulars, from which we
 learn that it was only one of a great number. "And Jesus," says that
 Evangelist 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:29-31">Mt 15:29-31</A>),

 "departed from thence, and came nigh unto the Sea of Galilee, and went 
 up into a mountain"--the mountain range bounding the lake on the 
 northeast, in Decapolis: "And great multitudes came unto Him, having 
 with them lame, blind, dumb, maimed"--not "mutilated," which is but a 
 secondary sense of the word, but "deformed"--"and many others, and cast 
 them down at Jesus' feet; and He healed them: insomuch that the 
 multitude [multitudes] wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the 
 maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see; and they 
 glorified the God of Israel"--who after so long and dreary an absence 
 of visible manifestation, had returned to bless His people as of old 
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:16">Lu 7:16</A>).

 Beyond this it is not clear from the Evangelist's language that the 
 people saw into the claims of Jesus. Well, of these cases Mark here 
 singles out one, whose cure had something peculiar in it.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr7_32"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>32. And they bring unto him one that was deaf .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and 
 they beseech him to put his hand upon him</B>--In their eagerness they
 appear to have been somewhat too officious. Though usually doing as
 here suggested, He will deal with this case in His own way.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr7_33"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>33. And he took him aside from the multitude</B>--As in another case
 He "took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:23">Mr 8:23</A>),

 probably to fix his undistracted attention on Himself, and, by means of
 certain actions He was about to do, to awaken and direct his attention 
 to the proper source of relief.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and put his fingers into his ears</B>--As his indistinct articulation
 arose from his deafness, our Lord addresses Himself to this first. To
 the impotent man He said, "Wilt thou be made whole?" to the blind men,
 "What will ye that I shall do unto you?" and "Believe ye that I am able
 to do this?" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:6,Mt+20:32,Mt+9:28">Joh 5:6;
 Mt 20:32; 9:28</A>). 

 But as this patient could <I>hear</I> nothing, our Lord substitutes
 symbolical actions upon each of the organs affected.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and he spit and touched his tongue</B>--moistening the man's parched
 tongue with saliva from His own mouth, as if to lubricate the organ or
 facilitate its free motion; thus indicating the source of the healing
 virtue to be His own person. (For similar actions, see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:23,Joh+9:6">Mr 8:23;
 Joh 9:6</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Mr7_34"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>34. And looking up to heaven</B>--ever acknowledging His Father, 
 even while the healing was seen to flow from Himself (see on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh5_19">Joh 5:19</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he sighed</B>--"over the wreck," says
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT>, "which sin had brought
 about, and the malice of the devil in deforming the fair features of
 God's original creation." But, we take it, there was a yet more painful
 impression of that "evil thing and bitter" whence all our ills have
 sprung, and which, when "Himself took our infirmities and bare our
 sicknesses"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:17">Mt 8:17</A>),

 became mysteriously His own.

 <B>and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened</B>--Our Evangelist, as
 remarked on

 <A HREF="#Mr5_41">Mr 5:41</A>,

 loves to give such wonderful words just as they were spoken.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr7_35"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>35. And straightway his ears were opened</B>--This is mentioned first as
 the source of the other derangement.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain</B>--The cure
 was thus alike instantaneous and perfect.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr7_36"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>36. And he charged them that they should tell no man</B>--Into this very
 region He had sent the man out of whom had been cast the legion of
 devils, to proclaim "what the Lord had done for him" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:19">Mr 5:19</A>).

 Now He will have them "tell no man." But in the former case there was
 no danger of obstructing His ministry by "blazing the matter"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:45">Mr 1:45</A>),

 as He Himself had left the region; whereas now He was sojourning in it.

 seemed only to whet their determination to publish His fame.</P>

 words of the first creation

 by the way</B>--In their eagerness they seem not to have thought of the
 need of provisions for such a length of time; but the Lord thought of
 it. In Matthew 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:32">Mt 15:32</A>)

 five thousand, they evidently <I>now</I> meant no more by it than that
 <I>they</I> had not the means of feeding the multitude; modestly leaving
 the Lord to decide what was to be done. And this will the more appear
 from His not now trying them, as before, by saying, "They need not
 depart, give ye them to eat"; but simply asking what they had, and then
 giving His directions.</P>

 them away</B>--Had not our Lord distinctly referred, in this very 
 chapter and in two successive sentences, to the feeding of the five 
 thousand and of the four thousand as two distinct miracles, many 
 critics would have insisted that they were but two different 
 representations of one and the same miracle, as they do of the two 
 expulsions of the buyers and sellers from the temple, at the beginning 
 and end of our Lord's ministry. But even in spite of what our Lord 
 says, it is painful to find such men as N<FONT SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT> 
 endeavoring to identify the two miracles. The localities, though both 
 on the eastern side of the lake, were different; the time was 
 different; the preceding and following circumstances were different; 
 the period during which the people continued fasting was different--in 
 the one case not even one entire day, in the other three days; the 
 number fed was different--five thousand in the one case, in the other 
 four thousand; the number of the loaves was different--five in the one 
 case, in the other seven; the number of the fishes in the one case is 
 definitely stated by all the four Evangelists--two; in the other case 
 both give them indefinitely--"a few small fishes"; in the one case the 
 multitude were commanded to sit down "upon the green grass"; in the 
 other "on the ground"; in the one case the number of the baskets taken 
 up filled with the fragments was twelve, in the other seven; but more 
 than all, perhaps, because apparently quite incidental, in the one case 
 the name given to the kind of baskets used is the same in all the four 
 narratives--the <I>cophinus</I> (see on

 <A HREF="#Mr6_43">Mr 6:43</A>); 

 in the other case the name given to the kind of baskets used, while it 
 is the same in both the narratives, is quite different--the 
 <I>spuris,</I> a basket large enough to hold a man's body, for Paul was 
 let down in one of these from the wall of Damascus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:25">Ac 9:25</A>).

 It might be added, that in the one case the people, in a frenzy of 
 enthusiasm, would have taken Him by force to make Him a king; in the 
 other case no such excitement is recorded. In view of these things, who 
 could have believed that these were one and the same miracle, even if 
 the Lord Himself had not expressly distinguished them?</P>

 western shore of the lake, and probably not far apart.  From the former

 Mary Magdalene. Dalmanutha may have been a village, but it cannot now

 The first part of the answer is given in Matthew alone

 "He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be 
 fair weather; for the sky is red. And in the morning, It will be foul 
 weather to-day: for the sky is red and lowering [sullen, gloomy]. 
 Hypocrites!  ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern 
 the signs of the times?" The same simplicity of purpose and careful 
 observation of the symptoms of approaching events which they showed in 
 common things would enable them to "discern the signs of the times"--or 
 rather "seasons," to which the prophets pointed for the manifestation 
 of the Messiah. The scepter had departed from Judah; Daniel's seventy 
 weeks were expiring, &c.; and many other significant indications of the 
 close of the old economy, and preparations for a freer and more 
 comprehensive one, might have been discerned. But all was lost upon

 show how deeply He was hurt at this want of spiritual apprehension, and
 worse still, their low thoughts of Him, as if He would utter so solemn 
 a warning on so petty a subject. It will be seen, however, from the 
 very form of their conjecture, "It is because <I>we</I> have no bread," 
 and our Lord's astonishment that they should not by that time have 
 known better with what He took up His attention--that He ever left 
 <I>the whole care for His own temporal wants to the Twelve:</I> that He 
 did this so entirely, that finding they were reduced to their last loaf 
 they felt as if unworthy of such a trust, and could not think but that 
 the same thought was in their Lord's mind which was pressing upon their 
 own; but that in this they were so far wrong that it hurt His 
 feelings--sharp just in proportion to His love--that such a thought of 
 Him should have entered their minds! Who that, like angels, "desire to

 Lord's miracles, we see from this that they were not wrought at random,
 but that He carefully noted their minutest details, and desired that
 this should be done by those who witnessed, as doubtless by all who read
 the record of them. Even the different kind of baskets used at the two
 miraculous feedings, so carefully noted in the two narratives, are here

 The Transfiguration appears to have taken place at night. In the 
 morning, as He came down from the hill on which it took place--with 
 Peter, and James, and John--on approaching the other nine, He found 
 them surrounded by a great multitude, and the scribes disputing or 
 discussing with them. No doubt these cavillers were twitting the 
 apostles of Jesus with their inability to cure the demoniac boy of whom 
 we are presently to hear, and insinuating doubts even of their Master's 
 ability to do it; while they, zealous for their Master's honor, would 
 no doubt refer to His past miracles in proof of the contrary.</P>

 No wonder, if this was the case, that they not only ran to Him, but

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:25">Mr 9:25</A>).

 In Matthew's report of the speech

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:15">Mt 17:15</A>),

 the father says "he is lunatic"; this being another and most 
 distressing effect of the possession.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr9_18"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>18. And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him; and he foameth, and
 gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away</B>--rather, "becomes withered,"
 "dried up," or "paralyzed"; as the same word is everywhere else rendered
 in the New Testament. Some additional particulars are given by Luke,
 and by our Evangelist below. "Lo," says he in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:39">Lu 9:39</A>,

 "a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him 
 that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly [or with difficulty] 
 departeth from him."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they
 could not</B>--Our Lord replies to the father by a severe rebuke to the
 disciples. As if wounded at the exposure before such a multitude, of
 the weakness of His disciples' faith, which doubtless He felt as a
 reflection on Himself, He puts them to the blush before all, but in
 language fitted only to raise expectation of what He Himself would do.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr9_19"> </A>

 Lu 9:41</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer 
 you?</B>--language implying that it was a shame to them to want the 
 faith necessary to perform this cure, and that it needed some patience 
 to put up with them. It is to us surprising that some interpreters, as 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT> and C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>, should 
 represent this rebuke as addressed, not to the disciples at all, but to 
 the scribes who disputed with them. Nor does it much, if at all, mend 
 the matter to view it as addressed to both, as most expositors seem to
 do. With
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>,
 D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ETTE</FONT>, and
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>EYER</FONT>, we regard it as
 addressed directly to the nine apostles who were unable to expel this
 evil spirit. And though, in ascribing this inability to their "want of
 faith" and the "perverted turn of mind" which they had drunk in with
 their early training, the rebuke would undoubtedly apply, with vastly
 greater force, to those who twitted the poor disciples with their
 inability, it would be to change the whole nature of the rebuke to
 suppose it addressed to those who had <I>no faith at all,</I> and were
 <I>wholly perverted.</I> It was because faith sufficient for curing this
 youth was to be expected of the disciples, and because they should by
 that time have got rid of the perversity in which they had been reared,
 that Jesus exposes them thus before the rest. And who does not see that
 this was fitted, more than anything else, to impress upon the
 by-standers the severe loftiness of the training He was giving to the
 Twelve, and the unsophisticated footing He was on with them?

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Bring him unto me</B>--The order to bring the patient to Him was instantly
 obeyed; when, lo! as if conscious of the presence of his Divine
 Tormentor, and expecting to be made to quit, the foul spirit rages and
 is furious, determined to die hard, doing all the mischief he can to
 this poor child while yet within his grasp.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr9_20"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>20. And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway
 the spirit tare him</B>--Just as the man with the legion of demons, "when
 he <I>saw</I> Jesus, ran and worshipped Him" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:6">Mr 5:6</A>),

 so this demon, <I>when he saw Him,</I> immediately "tare him." The
 feeling of terror and rage was the same in both cases.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming</B>--Still Jesus does
 nothing, but keeps conversing with the father about the case--partly to
 have its desperate features told out by him who knew them best, in the
 hearing of the spectators; partly to let its virulence have time to show
 itself; and partly to deepen the exercise of the father's soul, to draw
 out his faith, and thus to prepare both him and the by-standers for what
 He was to do.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr9_21"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>21. And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto
 him? And he said, Of a child,</B> &c.--Having told briefly the affecting
 features of the case, the poor father, half dispirited by the failure of
 the disciples and the aggravated virulence of the malady itself in
 presence of their Master, yet encouraged too by what he had heard of
 Christ, by the severe rebuke He had given to His disciples for not
 having faith enough to cure the boy, and by the dignity with which He
 had ordered him to be brought to Him--in this mixed state of mind, he
 closes his description of the case with these touching words:</P>

 <A NAME="Mr9_22"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>22. but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help
 us</B>--"us," says the father; for it was a sore family affliction.
 Compare the language of the Syroph&oelig;nician woman regarding her
 daughter, "Lord, help <I>me.</I>" Still nothing is done: the man is but
 <I>struggling into faith:</I> it must come a step farther. But he had to
 do with Him who breaks not the bruised reed, and who knew how to
 inspire what He demanded. The man had said to Him,
 "<I>If Thou canst do.</I>"</P>

 <A NAME="Mr9_23"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>23. Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe</B>--The man had 
 said, "If Thou canst do <I>anything.</I>" Jesus replies.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>all things are possible to him that believeth</B>--"My doing all depends
 on thy believing." To impress this still more, He redoubles upon the
 believing: "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that
 believeth." Thus the Lord helps the birth of faith in that struggling
 soul; and now, though with pain and sore travail, it comes to the birth,
 as T<FONT SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT>, borrowing from
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>, expresses it. Seeing the case
 stood still, waiting not upon the Lord's power but his own faith, the
 man becomes immediately conscious of conflicting principles, and rises
 into one of the noblest utterances on record.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr9_24"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>24. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with
 tears, Lord, I believe: help thou mine unbelief</B>--that is, "It is
 useless concealing from Thee, O Thou mysterious, mighty Healer, the
 unbelief that still struggles in this heart of mine; but that heart
 bears me witness that I do believe in Thee; and if distrust still
 remains, I disown it, I wrestle with it, I seek help from Thee against
 it." Two things are very remarkable here: First,
 <I>The felt and owned presence of unbelief,</I> which only the strength of
 the man's faith could have so revealed to his own consciousness.
 Second, <I>His appeal to Christ for help against his felt unbelief</I>--a
 feature in the case quite unparalleled, and showing, more than all
 protestations could have done, the insight he had attained into the
 existence of <I>a power in Christ more glorious them any he had besought for his poor child.</I> The work was done; and as the commotion and
 confusion in the crowd was now increasing, Jesus at once, as Lord of
 spirits, gives the word of command to the dumb and deaf spirit to be
 gone, never again to return to his victim.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr9_25"> </A>

 <A NAME="Mr9_26"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>26. And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him; and
 he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead</B>--The malignant,
 cruel spirit, now conscious that his time was come, gathers up his whole
 strength, with intent by a last stroke to kill his victim, and had
 nearly succeeded. But the Lord of life was there; the Healer of all
 maladies, the Friend of sinners, the Seed of the woman, "the Stronger
 than the strong man armed," was there. The very faith which Christ
 declared to be enough for everything being now found, it was not
 possible that the serpent should prevail. Fearfully is he permitted to
 bruise the <I>heel,</I> as in this case; but his own <I>head</I> shall go for
 it--his works shall be destroyed

 prayer and fasting</B>--that is, as nearly all good interpreters are
 agreed, "this kind of evil spirits cannot be expelled," or "so desperate
 a case of demoniacal possession cannot be cured, but by prayer and
 fasting." But since the Lord Himself says that His disciples could not
 fast while He was with them, perhaps this was designed, as
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> hints,
 for their after-guidance--unless we take it as but a definite way of
 expressing the general truth, that great and difficult duties require
 special preparation and self-denial. But the answer to their question,
 as given in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:20,21">Mt 17:20, 21</A>

 is fuller: "And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief. For 
 verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye 
 shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it 
 shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:20">Mt 17:20</A>).

 "Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:21">Mt 17:21</A>),

 that is, though nothing is impossible to faith, yet such a height of 
 faith as is requisite for such triumphs is not to be reached either in 
 a moment or without effort--either with God in prayer or with ourselves 
 in self-denying exercises. Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:43">Lu 9:43</A>)

 adds, "And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God"--"at the 
 majesty" or "mightiness of God," in this last miracle, in the 
 Transfiguration, &c.; or, at the <I>divine grandeur</I> of Christ 
 rising upon them daily.</P>

 with this, we gather, that
 as our Lord's reason for going through Galilee more privately than usual
 on this occasion was to reiterate to them the announcement which had so
 shocked them at the first mention of it, and thus familiarize them with
 it by little and little, so this was His reason for enjoining silence

 is in all the three Evangelists.

 <B>and they shall kill him</B>--that is, "Be not carried off your feet by
 all that grandeur of Mine which ye have lately witnessed, but bear in
 mind what I have already told you and now distinctly repeat, that that
 Sun in whose beams ye now rejoice is soon to set in midnight gloom."

 this we gather that after the painful communication He had made to
 them, the Redeemer had allowed them to travel so much of the way by
 themselves; partly, no doubt, that He might have privacy for Himself to
 dwell on what lay before Him, and partly that they might be induced to
 weigh together and prepare themselves for the terrible events which He
 had announced to them. But if so, how different was their occupation!</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:1">Mt 18:1</A>

 we should infer that the subject was introduced, not by our Lord, but 
 by the disciples themselves, who came and asked Jesus who should be 
 greatest.  Perhaps one or two of them first referred the matter to 
 Jesus, who put them off till they should all be assembled together at 
 Capernaum. He had all the while "perceived the thought of their heart"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:47">Lu 9:47</A>);

 but now that they were all together "in the house," He questions them 
 about it, and they are put to the blush, conscious of the <I>temper</I> 
 towards each other which it had kindled. This raised the whole question 
 afresh, and at this point our Evangelist takes it up. The subject was 
 suggested by the recent announcement of the Kingdom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:19-28">Mt 16:19-28</A>),

 must the heart be turned to God in general, and from earthly to 
 heavenly things, but in particular, except ye be converted from that 
 carnal ambition which still rankles within you, into that freedom from 
 all such feelings which ye see in this child, ye have neither part nor 
 lot in the kingdom at all; and he who in this feature has most of the 
 child, is highest there." Whosoever, therefore, shall "humble himself 
 as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven": 
 "for he that is [willing to be] least among you all, the same shall be

 foregoing context lies, we apprehend, in the emphatic words which our
 Lord had just uttered, "in My name." "Oh," interposes John--young, warm,
 but not sufficiently apprehending Christ's teaching in these
 matters--"that reminds me of something that we have just done, and we

 and the awfully vivid idea of an undying worm, everlastingly consuming

 <B>49. For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall
 be salted with salt</B>--A difficult verse, on which much has been
 written--some of it to little purpose. "Every one" probably means "Every
 follower of mine"; and the "fire" with which he "must be salted"
 probably means "a fiery trial" to season him. (Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:2">Mal 3:2</A>,

 &c.). The reference to salting the sacrifice is of course to that maxim 
 of the Levitical law, that every acceptable sacrifice must be sprinkled 
 with salt, to express symbolically its soundness, sweetness, 
 wholesomeness, acceptability. But as it had to be <I>roasted</I> first, 
 we have here the further idea of a salting with fire. In this case, 
 "every sacrifice," in the next clause, will mean, "Every one who would 
 be found an acceptable offering to God"; and thus the whole verse may 
 perhaps be paraphrased as follows: "Every disciple of Mine shall have a 
 fiery trial to undergo, and everyone who would be found an odor of a 
 sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God, must have 
 such a <I>salting,</I> like the Levitical sacrifices." Another, but, as 
 it seems to us, farfetched as well as harsh, interpretation--suggested 
 first, we believe, by M<FONT SIZE=-1>ICHAELIS</FONT>, and adopted by 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDER</FONT>--takes the "every sacrifice which must 
 be salted with fire" to mean those who are "cast into hell," and the 
 <I>preservative</I> effect of this salting to refer to the preservation 
 of the lost not only <I>in</I> but <I>by means of</I> the fire of hell. 
 Their reason for this is that the other interpretation changes the 
 meaning of the "fire," and the characters too, from the lost to the 
 saved, in these verses. But as our Lord confessedly ends His discourse 
 with the case of His own true disciples, the transition to them in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:48">Mr 9:48</A>

 is perfectly natural; whereas to apply the preservative salt of the
 sacrifice to the preserving quality of hell-fire, is equally contrary 
 to the symbolical sense of salt and the Scripture representations of 
 future torment. Our Lord has still in His eye the unseemly jarrings 
 which had arisen among the Twelve, the peril to themselves of allowing 
 any indulgence to such passions, and the severe self-sacrifice which 
 salvation would cost them.</P>

 We cannot be sure with which of the parties the movement originated;
 but as our Lord, even in Matthew's account, addresses Himself to James 
 and John, taking no account of the mother, it is likely the mother was 
 merely set on by them. The thought was doubtless suggested to her sons 
 by the recent promise to the Twelve of "thrones to sit on, when the Son 
 of man should sit on the throne of His glory"

 able to be baptized with his Master's baptism of blood

 while <I>John,</I> after going through all the persecutions to which 
 the infant Church was exposed from the Jews, and sharing in the 
 struggles and sufferings occasioned by the first triumphs of the Gospel 
 among the Gentiles, lived to be the victim, after all the rest had got 
 to glory, of a bitter persecution in the evening of his days, for the 
 word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. Yes, they were dear 
 believers and blessed men, in spite of this unworthy ambition, and 
 their Lord knew it; and perhaps the foresight of what they would have 
 to pass through, and the courageous testimony He would yet receive from 
 them, was the cause of that gentleness which we cannot but wonder at in 
 His reproof.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink
 of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be
 baptized</B>--No doubt this prediction, when their sufferings at length
 came upon them, cheered them with the assurance, not that they would sit
 on His right and left hand--for of that thought they would be heartily
 ashamed--but that "if they suffered with Him, they should be also
 glorified together."</P>

 Father" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:23">Mt 20:23</A>).

 The supplement which our translators have inserted is approved by some 
 good interpreters, and the proper sense of the word rendered "but" is 
 certainly in favor of it. But besides that it makes the statement too 
 elliptical--leaving too many words to be supplied--it seems to make our 
 Lord repudiate the right to assign to each of His people his place in 
 the kingdom of glory; a thing which He nowhere else does, but rather 
 the contrary. It is true that He says their place is "prepared for them 
 by His Father." But that is true of their admission to heaven at all; 
 and yet from His great white throne Jesus will Himself adjudicate the 
 kingdom, and authoritatively invite into it those on His right hand, 
 calling them the "blessed of His Father"; so little inconsistency is 
 there between the eternal choice of them by His Father, and that public 
 adjudication of them, not only to heaven in general, but each to his 
 own position in it, which all Scripture assigns to Christ. The true 
 rendering, then, of this clause, we take it, is this: "But to sit on My 
 right hand and on My left hand is not Mine to give, save to them for 
 whom it is prepared." When therefore He says, "It is not Mine to give," 
 the meaning is, "I cannot give it as a <I>favor</I> to whomsoever I 
 <I>please,</I> or on a principle of <I>favoritism;</I> it belongs 
 exclusively to those for whom it is prepared," &c. And if this be His 
 meaning, it will be seen how far our Lord is from disclaiming the right 
 to assign to each his proper place in His Kingdom; that on the 
 contrary, He expressly asserts it, merely announcing that the principle 
 of distribution is quite different from what these petitioners 
 supposed. Our Lord, it will be observed, does not <I>deny</I> the 
 petition of James and John, or say they shall <I>not</I> occupy the 
 place in His kingdom which they now improperly sought:--for aught we 
 know, <I>that may be their true place.</I> All we are sure of is, that 
 their asking it was displeasing to Him "to whom all judgment is 
 committed," and so was not fitted to gain their object, but just the 
 reverse. (See what is taught in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:8-11">Lu 14:8-11</A>).

 One at least of these brethren, as A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> 
 strikingly remarks, saw on the right and on the left hand of their 
 Lord, as He hung upon the tree, the crucified thieves; and bitter 
 indeed must have been the remembrance of this ambitious prayer at that 
 moment.</P>

 The expression "<I>began</I> to be," which is of frequent occurrence in 
 the Gospels, means that more passed than is expressed, and that we have 
 but the result. And can we blame the ten for the indignation which they 
 felt? Yet there was probably a spice of the old spirit of rivalry in 
 it, which in spite of our Lord's recent lengthened, diversified, and 
 most solemn warnings against it, had not ceased to stir in their

 many," that is, "In the kingdom about to be set up, this principle 
 shall have no place. All My servants shall there be equal; and the only 
 greatness known to it shall be the greatness of humility and

 these services of self-denying humility shall rise the highest and hold 
 the chiefest place in that kingdom; even as the Son of man, whose 
 abasement and self-sacrifice for others, transcending all, gives Him of

 had looked round about upon</B>--surveyed.

 <B>all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out into Bethany
 with the twelve</B>--Thus briefly does our Evangelist dispose of this His
 first day in Jerusalem, after the triumphal entry. Nor do the Third and
 Fourth Gospels give us more light. But from Matthew

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:10,11,14-16">Mt 21:10, 11, 14-16</A>)

 the week, this following day was Monday.

 <B>when they were come from Bethany</B>--"in the morning"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he was hungry</B>--How was that? Had he stolen forth from that dear roof
 at Bethany to the "mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer
 to God?" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:12">Lu 6:12</A>);

 not breaking His fast thereafter, but bending His steps straight for

 was day?"

 We know not, though one lingers upon and loves to trace out the every
 movement of that life of wonders. One thing, however we are sure of--it 
 was <I>real bodily hunger</I> which He now sought to allay by the fruit 
 of this fig tree, "if haply He might find any thing thereon"; not a 
 mere <I>scene</I> for the purpose of teaching a lesson, as some early 
 heretics maintained, and some still seem virtually to hold.</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:19">Mt 21:19</A>,

 it is "one fig tree," but the sense is the same as here, "a certain fig 
 tree," as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:19">Mt 8:19</A>,

 &c.). Bethphage, which adjoined Bethany, derives its name from its
 being a <I>fig region</I>--"House of figs."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>afar off having leaves</B>--and therefore promising fruit, which in the
 case of figs come before the leaves.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to
 it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet</B>--What
 the precise import of this explanation is, interpreters are not agreed.
 Perhaps all that is meant is, that as the proper fig season had not
 arrived, no fruit would have been expected even of this tree but for the
 leaves which it had, which were in this case prematurely and unnaturally
 developed.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr11_14"> </A>

 but sealed it up in its own barrenness.  See on

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>And his disciples heard it</B>--and marked the saying. This is introduced
 as a connecting link, to explain what was afterwards to be said on the
 subject, as the narrative has to proceed to the other transactions of
 this day.</P>

 <B>20. And in the morning</B>--of Tuesday, the third day of the week: He
 had slept, as during all this week, at Bethany.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>as they passed by</B>--going into Jerusalem again.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots</B>--no partial blight,
 leaving life in the root; but it was now dead, root and branch. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:19">Mt 21:19</A>

 it is said it withered away as soon as it was cursed. But the full 
 blight had not appeared probably at once; and in the dusk perhaps, as 
 they returned to Bethany, they had not observed it. The precision with 
 which Mark distinguishes the days is not observed by Matthew, intent 
 only on holding up the truths which the incident was designed to teach. 
 In Matthew the whole is represented as taking place at once, just as 
 the two stages of Jairus' daughter--dying and dead--are represented by 
 him as one. The only difference is between a more summary and a more
 detailed narrative, each of which only confirms the other.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr11_21"> </A>

 <B>21. And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him</B>--satisfied that
 a miracle so very peculiar--a miracle, not of <I>blessing,</I> as all His
 other miracles, but of <I>cursing</I>--could not have been wrought but with
 some higher reference, and fully expecting to hear something weighty on
 the subject.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away</B>--so
 connecting the two things as to show that he traced the death of the
 tree entirely to the curse of his Lord. Matthew 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:20">Mt 21:20</A>)

 gives this simply as a general exclamation of surprise by the disciples 
 "how soon" the blight had taken effect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>23. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this
 mountain, Be thou removed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he shall have whatsoever he saith</B>--Here
 is the lesson now. From the nature of the case supposed--that they might
 wish a mountain removed and cast into the sea, a thing far removed from
 anything which they could be thought actually to desire--it is plain
 that not physical but moral obstacles to the progress of His kingdom
 were in the Redeemer's view, and that what He designed to teach was the
 great lesson, that
 <I>no obstacle should be able to stand before a confiding faith in God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>24. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye
 pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them</B>--This verse

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+11:23">Mr 11:23</A>;

 which seems to show that it was designed for the special encouragement
 of <I>evangelistic</I> and <I>missionary</I> efforts, while this is a 
 directory for prevailing <I>prayer in general.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>25. And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against 
 any; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your 
 trespasses,</B> &c.--This is repeated from the Sermon on the Mount (see 
 on

 <A HREF="JFB40.htm#Mt6_12">Mt 6:12</A>);

 to remind them that if this was necessary to the acceptableness of
 <I>all</I> prayer, much more <I>when great things were to be asked and 
 confidently expected.</I></P>

 The time of this section appears to be still the third day (Tuesday) of
 Christ's last week. Matthew introduces the subject by saying

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:15">Mt 22:15</A>),

 "Then went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle Him 
 in His talk."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13. And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees</B>--"their disciples,"
 says Matthew 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:16">Mt 22:16</A>);

 probably young and zealous scholars in that hardening school.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and of the Herodians</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="JFB40.htm#Mt12_14">Mt 12:14</A>).
 
 In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:20">Lu 20:20</A>

 these willing tools are called "spies, which should feign themselves 
 just [righteous] men, that they might take hold of His words, that so 
 they might deliver Him unto the power and authority of the governor." 
 Their plan, then, was to entrap Him into some expression which might be 
 construed into disaffection to the Roman government; the Pharisees 
 themselves being notoriously discontented with the Roman yoke.</P>

 <I>Tribute to C&aelig;sar</I>

 <B>14. And when they were come, they say unto him, Master</B>--Teacher.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>we know that thou art true, and carest for no man; for thou regardest
 not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth</B>--By such
 flattery--though they said only the truth--they hoped to throw Him off
 His guard.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Is it lawful to give tribute to C&aelig;sar, or not?</B>--It was the 
 civil poll tax paid by all enrolled in the "census." See on

 <A HREF="JFB40.htm#Mt17_25">Mt 17:25</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr12_15"> </A>

 <B>15. Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their
 hypocrisy</B>--"their wickedness" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:18">Mt 22:18</A>);
 
 "their craftiness"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:23">Lu 20:23</A>).

 The malignity of their hearts took the form of craft, pretending what 
 they did not feel--an anxious desire to be guided aright in a matter 
 which to a scrupulous few might seem a question of some difficulty. 
 Seeing perfectly through this,

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>He said unto them, Why tempt ye me?</B>--"hypocrites!"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>bring me a penny that I may see it</B>--"the tribute money"

 for sedition itself to dispute it, and yet it dissolved the snare.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and to God the things that are God's</B>--How much is there in this
 profound but to them startling addition to the maxim, and how
 incomparable is the whole for fulness, brevity, clearness, weight!

 <B>27. He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living</B>--not
 "the God of dead but [the God] of living persons." The word in brackets
 is almost certainly an addition to the genuine text, and critical
 editors exclude it. "For all live unto Him" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:38">Lu 20:38</A>)

 --"in His view," or "in His estimation." This last statement--found 
 only in Luke--though adding nothing to the argument, is an important 
 additional illustration. It is true, indeed, that to God no human being 
 is dead or ever will be, but all mankind sustain an abiding conscious 
 relation to Him; but the "all" here means "those who shall be accounted 
 worthy to obtain that world." These sustain a gracious covenant 
 relation to God which cannot be dissolved. (Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:10,11">Ro 6:10, 11</A>).

 In this sense our Lord affirms that for Moses to call the Lord the 
 "G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>" of His patriarchal servants, if at that 
 moment they had no existence, would be unworthy of Him. He "would be 
 <I>ashamed</I> to be called their God, if He had not prepared for them 
 a city"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:16">Heb 11:16</A>).

 It was concluded by some of the early Fathers, from our Lord's resting 
 His proof of the Resurrection on such a passage as this, instead of 
 quoting some much clearer testimonies of the Old Testament, that the 
 Sadducees, to whom this was addressed, acknowledged the authority of no 
 part of the Old Testament but the Pentateuch; and this opinion has held 
 its ground even till now. But as there is no ground for it in the New 
 Testament, so J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> is silent upon it; merely 
 saying that they rejected the Pharisaic traditions. It was because the 
 Pentateuch was regarded by all classes as the fundamental source of the 
 Hebrew religion, and all the succeeding books of the Old Testament but 
 as developments of it, that our Lord would show that even there the 
 doctrine of the Resurrection was taught. And all the rather does He 
 select this passage, as being not a bare annunciation of the doctrine 
 in question, but as expressive of that glorious truth <I>out of which 
 the Resurrection springs.</I> "And when the multitude heard this" (says

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:23">Mt 22:23</A>),

 "they were astonished at His doctrine." "Then," adds

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:39,40">Lu 20:39, 40</A>,

 "certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well 
 said"--enjoying His victory over the Sadducees.  "And after that they 
 durst not ask Him any [question at all]"--neither party could; both 
 being for the time utterly foiled.</P>

 that is, teacher of the law.

 <B>came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he
 had answered them well, asked him</B>--manifestly in no bad spirit. When
 Matthew 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:35">Mt 22:35</A>)

 therefore says he came "tempting," or "trying him," as one of the 
 Pharisaic party who seemed to enjoy the defeat He had given to the 
 Sadducees, we may suppose that though somewhat priding himself upon his 
 insight into the law, and not indisposed to measure his knowledge with 
 One in whom he had not yet learned to believe, he was nevertheless an 
 honest-hearted, fair disputant.

 <B>Which is the first commandment of all?</B>--first in importance; the
 primary, leading commandment, the most fundamental one. This was a
 question which, with some others, divided the Jewish teachers into rival
 schools. Our Lord's answer is in a strain of respect very different from
 what He showed to cavillers--ever observing His own direction, "Give not
 that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before
 swine; lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend
 you"

 simply, "the first is"; and they are followed by M<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>EYER</FONT> and A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>. But though the 
 authority for the precise form of the received text is slender, a form 
 almost identical with it seems to have most weight of authority.  Our 
 Lord here gives His explicit sanction to the distinction between 
 commandments of a more <I>fundamental</I> and <I>primary</I> character, 
 and commandments of a more <I>dependent</I> and <I>subordinate</I> 
 nature; a distinction of which it is confidently asserted by a certain 
 class of critics that the Jews knew nothing, that our Lord and His 
 apostles nowhere lay down, and which has been invented by Christian 
 divines.  (Compare

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord</B>--This every devout Jew
 recited twice every day, and the Jews do it to this day; thus keeping up
 the great ancient national protest against the polytheisms and
 pantheisms of the heathen world: it is the great utterance of the
 national faith in One Living and Personal God--"O<FONT SIZE=-1>NE</FONT>
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EHOVAH</FONT>!"</P>

 <A NAME="Mr12_30"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>30. And thou shalt</B>--We have here the language of <I>law,</I> 
 expressive of God's <I>claims.</I> What then are we here bound down to 
 do? One word is made to express it. And what a word! Had the essence of 
 the divine law consisted in <I>deeds,</I> it could not possibly have 
 been expressed in a single word; for no one deed is comprehensive of 
 all others embraced in the law. But as it consists in <I>an affection 
 of the soul,</I> one word suffices to express it--but only one. 
 <I>Fear,</I> though due to God and enjoined by Him, is <I>limited</I> 
 in its sphere and <I>distant</I> in character. <I>Trust, hope,</I> and 
 the like, though essential features of a right state of heart towards 
 God, are called into action only by <I>personal necessity,</I> and so 
 are--in a good sense, it is true, but still are 
 properly--<I>selfish</I> affections; that is to say, they have respect 
 to <I>our own well-being.</I> But <FONT SIZE=-1>LOVE</FONT> is an 
 <I>all-inclusive</I> affection, embracing not only every other 
 affection proper to its object, but all that is proper to be 
 <I>done</I> to its object; for as love spontaneously seeks to please
 its object, so, in the case of men to God, it is the native well spring 
 of a voluntary obedience. It is, besides, the most <I>personal</I> of 
 all affections. One may fear an <I>event,</I> one may hope for an 
 <I>event,</I> one may rejoice in an <I>event;</I> but one can love only 
 a <I>Person.</I> It is the <I>tenderest,</I> the most <I>unselfish,</I> 
 the most <I>divine</I> of all affections. Such, then, is the affection 
 in which the essence of the divine law is declared to consist.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Thou shalt love</B>--We now come to the glorious Object of that demanded
 affection.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God</B>--that is, Jehovah, the 
 Self-Existent One, who has revealed Himself as the "I 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>M</FONT>," and there is <I>none else;</I> who, though by
 His name J<FONT SIZE=-1>EHOVAH</FONT> apparently at an unapproachable 
 distance from His finite creatures, yet bears to <I>Thee</I> a real and
 definite relationship, out of which arises <I>His claim</I> and <I>Thy
 duty</I>--of <FONT SIZE=-1>LOVE.</FONT> But with what are we to love
 Him? Four things are here specified.  First, "Thou shalt love the Lord 
 thy God"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>with thy heart</B>--This sometimes means "the whole inner man" (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:23">Pr 4:23</A>);

 but that cannot be meant here; for then the other three particulars 
 would be superfluous. Very often it means "our emotional nature"--the 
 seat of <I>feeling</I> as distinguished from our intellectual nature or 
 the seat of <I>thought,</I> commonly called the "mind" (as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:7">Php 4:7</A>).

 But neither can this be the sense of it here; for here the heart is 
 distinguished both from the "mind" and the "soul." The "heart," then, 
 must here mean the <I>sincerity</I> of both the thoughts and the 
 feelings; in other words, <I>uprightness</I> or 
 <I>true-heartedness,</I> as opposed to a <I>hypocritical</I> or 
 <I>divided</I> affection. But next, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God" 
 with thy soul. This is designed to command our emotional nature: Thou 
 shalt put <I>feeling</I> or <I>warmth</I> into thine affection. 
 Further, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>with thy mind</B>--This commands our intellectual nature: Thou shalt put
 <I>intelligence</I> into thine affection--in opposition to a blind
 devotion, or mere devoteeism. Lastly, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy
 God"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>with thy strength</B>--This commands our energies: Thou shalt put
 <I>intensity</I> into thine affection--"Do it with thy might" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:10">Ec 9:10</A>).

 Taking these four things together, the command of the Law is, "Thou 
 shalt love the Lord thy God <I>with all thy powers</I>--with a 
 <I>sincere,</I> a <I>fervid,</I> an <I>intelligent,</I> an 
 <I>energetic</I> love." But this is not all that the Law demands. God 
 will have all these qualities in their most perfect exercise. "Thou 
 shalt love the Lord thy God," says the Law, "with <I>all</I> thy 
 heart," or, with perfect sincerity; "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God 
 with <I>all</I> thy soul," or, with the utmost fervor; "Thou shalt love 
 the Lord thy God with <I>all</I> thy mind," or, in the fullest exercise 
 of an enlightened reason; and "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with 
 <I>all</I> thy strength," or, with the whole energy of our being! So 
 much for the First Commandment.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr12_31"> </A>

 <B>31. And the second is like</B>--"unto it" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:39">Mt 22:39</A>);

 as demanding the same affection, and only the extension of it, in its 
 proper measure, to the creatures of Him whom we thus love--our 
 <I>brethren</I> in the participation of the same nature, and 
 <I>neighbors,</I> as connected with us by ties that render each 
 dependent upon and necessary to the other.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself</B>--Now, as we are not to love
 ourselves supremely, this is virtually a command, in the first place,
 <I>not</I> to love our neighbor with all our heart and soul and mind and
 strength. And thus it is a condemnation of the idolatry of the
 creature. Our supreme and uttermost affection is to be reserved for God.
 But as <I>sincerely</I> as ourselves we are to love all mankind, and with
 <I>the same readiness to do and suffer for them</I> as we should reasonably
 desire them to show to us. The golden rule 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:12">Mt 7:12</A>)

 is here our best interpreter of the nature and extent of these claims.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>There is none other commandment greater than these</B>--or, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:40">Mt 22:40</A>,

 "On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets" (see on

 <A HREF="JFB40.htm#Mt5_17">Mt 5:17</A>). 

 It is as if He had said, "This is all Scripture in a nutshell; the 
 whole law of human duty in a portable, pocket form." Indeed, it is so 
 <I>simple</I> that a child may understand it, so <I>brief</I> that all 
 may remember it, so <I>comprehensive</I> as to embrace all possible 
 cases. And from its very nature it is <I>unchangeable.</I> It is 
 inconceivable that God should require from his rational creatures 
 anything <I>less,</I> or in substance anything <I>else,</I> under any 
 <I>dispensation,</I> in any <I>world,</I> at any <I>period</I> 
 throughout eternal duration. He cannot but claim this--all this--alike 
 in <I>heaven,</I> in <I>earth,</I> and in <I>hell!</I> And this 
 incomparable summary of the divine law belonged to the <I>Jewish 
 religion!</I> As it shines in its own self-evidencing splendor, so it 
 reveals its own true source. The religion from which the world has 
 received it could be none other than a <I>God-given religion!</I></P>

 the sovereign. The human and divine natures of Christ, and the

 Jesus had uttered all His mind against the Jewish ecclesiastics,
 exposing their character with withering plainness, and denouncing, in
 language of awful severity, the judgments of God against them for that
 unfaithfulness to their trust which was bringing ruin upon the nation.
 He had closed this His last public discourse 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:1-39">Mt 23:1-39</A>)

 by a passionate lamentation over Jerusalem, and a solemn farewell to 
 the temple. "And," says Matthew

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:1">Mt 24:1</A>),

 "Jesus went out and departed from the temple"--never more to re-enter 
 its precincts, or open His mouth in public teaching. <I>With this act 
 ended His public ministry.</I> As He withdrew, says O<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>, the gracious presence of God left the 
 sanctuary; and the temple, with all its service, and the whole 
 theocratic constitution, was given over to destruction. What 
 immediately followed is, as usual, most minutely and graphically
 described by our Evangelist.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto
 him</B>--The other Evangelists are less definite. "As some spake," says
 Luke 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:5">Lu 21:5</A>);
 
 "His disciples came to Him," says Matthew

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:2">Mt 24:2</A>).

 Doubtless it was the speech of one, the mouthpiece, likely, of others.

 <B>see what manner of stones and what buildings are here</B>--wondering
 probably, how so massive a pile could be overthrown, as seemed implied
 in our Lord's last words regarding it. J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, who gives a minute
 account of the wonderful structure, speaks of stones forty cubits long
 [<I>Wars of the Jews,</I> 5.5.1.] and says the pillars supporting the
 porches were twenty-five cubits high, all of one stone, and that of the
 whitest marble [<I>Wars of the Jews,</I> 5.5.2]. Six days' battering at the
 walls, during the siege, made no impression upon them
 [<I>Wars of the Jews,</I> 6.4.1]. Some of the under-building, yet
 remaining, and other works, are probably as old as the first temple.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr13_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 their fate."

 <B>one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down</B>--Titus ordered
 the whole city and temple to be demolished
 [J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, <I>Wars of the Jews,</I> 7.1.1]; Eleazar wished they had all
 died before seeing that holy city destroyed by enemies' hands, and
 before the temple was so profanely <I>dug up</I> [<I>Wars of the Jews,</I> 7.8.7].</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives, over against the temple</B>--On
 their way from Jerusalem to Bethany they would cross Mount Olivet; on
 its summit He seats Himself, over against the temple, having the city
 all spread out under His eye. How graphically is this set before us by
 our Evangelist!

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately</B>--The other
 Evangelists tell us merely that "the disciples" did so. But Mark not
 only says that it was four of them, but names them; and they were the
 first <I>quarternion</I> of the Twelve.</P>

 Thy coming, and of the end of the world?" They no doubt looked upon the
 date of all these things as one and the same, and their notions of the
 things themselves were as confused as of the times of them. Our Lord
 takes His own way of meeting their questions.</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:8">Lu 21:8</A>).

 The reference here seems not to be to pretended Messiahs, deceiving 
 those who rejected the claims of Jesus, of whom indeed there were 
 plenty--for our Lord is addressing His own genuine disciples--but to 
 persons pretending to be Jesus Himself, returned in glory to take 
 possession of His kingdom. This gives peculiar force to the words, "Go 
 ye not therefore after them."</P>

 God never sends judgment without previous warning; and there can be no 
 doubt that the Jews, already dispersed over most known countries, had 
 nearly all heard the Gospel "as a witness," before the end of the 
 Jewish state. The same principle was repeated and will repeat itself to

 adds this important intimation: "And because iniquity shall abound, the 
 love of many"--"of the many," or "of the most," that is, of the 
 generality of professed disciples--"shall wax cold." Sad illustrations

 "standing in the holy place."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>(let him that readeth understand)</B>--readeth that prophecy. That "the
 abomination of desolation" here alluded to was intended to point to the
 Roman ensigns, as the symbols of an idolatrous, and so unclean pagan
 power, may be gathered by comparing what Luke says in the corresponding
 verse 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:20">Lu 21:20</A>);

 and commentators are agreed on it. It is worthy of notice, as 
 confirming this interpretation, that in <U>1 Maccabees 1:54</U>--which,
 though aprocryphal <I>Scripture,</I> is authentic <I>history</I>--the
 expression of Daniel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:31,12:11">Da 11:31; 12:11</A>)

 Perea, being "prophetically directed"--perhaps by some prophetic

 thus they escaped the predicted calamities by which the nation was

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>19. For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the
 beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither
 shall be</B>--Such language is not unusual in the Old Testament with
 reference to tremendous calamities. But it is matter of literal fact
 that there was crowded into the period of the Jewish war an amount and
 complication of suffering perhaps unparalleled; as the narrative of
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, examined closely and arranged under different heads, would
 show.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr13_20"> </A>

 is, no human life.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath
 shortened the days</B>--But for this merciful "shortening," brought about
 by a remarkable concurrence of causes, the whole nation would have
 perished, in which there yet remained a remnant to be afterwards
 gathered out. This portion of the prophecy closes, in Luke, with the
 following vivid and important glance at the subsequent fortunes of the
 chosen people: "And they shall fall by the sword, and shall be led away
 captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
 Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:24">Lu 21:24</A>).

 The language as well as the idea of this remarkable statement is taken 
 from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:10,13">Da 8:10, 13</A>.

 What, then, is its import here? It implies, first, that a time is 
 coming when Jerusalem shall cease to be "trodden down of the Gentiles"; 
 which it was then by pagan, and since and till now is by Mohammedan 
 unbelievers: and next, it implies that the period when this treading 
 down of Jerusalem by the Gentiles is to cease will be when "the times 
 of the Gentiles are fulfilled" or "completed." But what does this mean? 
 We may gather the meaning of it from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1-36">Ro 11:1-36</A>

 in which the divine purposes and procedure towards the chosen people 
 from first to last are treated in detail. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:25">Ro 11:25</A>

 these words of our Lord are thus reproduced: "For I would not, 
 brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be 
 wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to 
 Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in." See the 
 
 <A HREF="JFB45.HTM#Ro11_25">exposition of that verse</A>,

 from which it will appear that "till the
 fulness of the Gentiles be come in"--or, in our Lord's phraseology, 
 "till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled"--does not mean "till the 
 general conversion of the world to Christ," but "till the Gentiles have 
 had their <I>full time</I> of that place in the Church which the Jews 
 had before them." After that period of <I>Gentilism,</I> as before of 
 <I>Judaism,</I> "Jerusalem" and Israel, no longer "trodden down by the 
 Gentiles," but "grafted into their own olive tree," shall constitute, 
 with the believing Gentiles, one Church of God, and fill the whole 
 earth. What a bright vista does this open up!</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:30">Mt 24:30</A>,

 this is given most fully: "And then shall appear the sign of the Son of 
 man in heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and 
 they shall see the Son of man," &c. That this language finds its 
 highest interpretation in the Second Personal Coming of Christ, is most 
 certain. But the question is, whether that be the primary sense of it 
 as it stands here? Now if the reader will turn to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13,14">Da 7:13, 14</A>,

 and connect with it the 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:4-14">preceding verses</A>,

 he will find, we think, the true key to our Lord's meaning here.  There
 the powers that oppressed the Church--symbolized by rapacious wild 
 beasts--are summoned to the bar of the Great God, who as the Ancient of 
 days seats Himself, with His assessors, on a burning Throne: thousand 
 thousands ministering to Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand 
 standing before Him. "The judgment is set, and the books are opened." 
 Who that is guided by the <I>mere words</I> would doubt that this is a 
 description of the Final Judgment? And yet nothing is clearer than that 
 it is <I>not,</I> but a description of a vast <I>temporal</I> judgment, 
 upon organized bodies of men, for their incurable hostility to the 
 kingdom of God upon earth.  Well, after the doom of these has been 
 pronounced and executed, and room thus prepared for the unobstructed 
 development of the kingdom of God over the earth, what follows? "I saw 
 in the night visions, and behold, one like <FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT> 
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>ON OF</FONT> M<FONT SIZE=-1>AN</FONT> came with the 
 clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they [the 
 angelic attendants] brought Him near before Him." For what purpose? To 
 receive investiture in the kingdom, which, as Messiah, of right 
 belonged to Him.  Accordingly, it is added, "And there was given Him 
 dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and 
 languages should serve Him: His dominion is an everlasting dominion, 
 which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be 
 destroyed." Comparing this with our Lord's words, He seems to us, by 
 "the Son of man [on which phrase, see on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh1_51">Joh 1:51</A>] 

 coming in the clouds with great power and glory," to mean, that when 
 judicial vengeance shall once have been executed upon Jerusalem, and 
 the ground thus cleared for the unobstructed establishment of His own 
 kingdom, His true regal claims and rights would be visibly and 
 gloriously asserted and manifested.  See on

 be understood of anything else than <I>the full and free establishment 
 of the kingdom of Christ on the destruction of Jerusalem.</I> But what 
 is that "sign of the Son of man in heaven?" Interpreters are not 
 agreed. But as before Christ came to destroy Jerusalem some appalling 
 portents were seen in the air, so before His Personal appearing it is 
 likely that something <I>analogous</I> will be witnessed, though of 
 what nature it would be vain to conjecture.</P>

 and the ministry of angels, employed in all the great operations of
 Providence, is here held forth as the agency by which the present 
 assembling of the elect is to be accomplished. L<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT> thus explains it: "When Jerusalem shall be 
 reduced to ashes, and that wicked nation cut off and rejected, then 
 shall the Son of man send His ministers with the trumpet of the Gospel, 
 and they shall gather His elect of the several nations, from the four 
 corners of heaven: so that God shall not want a Church, although that 
 ancient people of His be rejected and cast off: but that ancient Jewish 
 Church being destroyed, a new Church shall be called out of the 
 Gentiles." But though something like this appears to be the primary 
 sense of the verse, in relation to the destruction of Jerusalem, no one 
 can fail to see that the language swells beyond any gathering of a 
 human family into a Church upon earth, and forces the thoughts onward 
 to that gathering of the Church "at the last trump," to meet the Lord 
 in the air, which is to wind up the present scene. Still, this is not, 
 in our judgment, the <I>direct</I> subject of the prediction; for

 the following words precede these: "And when these things begin to come

 draweth nigh"--their redemption, in the first instance certainly, from 
 Jewish oppression

 entirely correspond. For either the whole was fulfilled in the 
 destruction accomplished by Titus, as many think; or, if we stretch it

 It will be observed that, in the foregoing prophecy, as our Lord 
 approaches the crisis of the day of vengeance on Jerusalem and 
 redemption for the Church--at which stage the analogy between that and 
 the day of final vengeance and redemption waxes more striking--His 
 language rises and swells beyond all temporal and partial vengeance, 
 beyond all earthly deliverances and enlargements, and ushers us 
 resistlessly into the scenes of the final day. Accordingly, in these 
 six concluding verses it is manifest that preparation for 
 "<FONT SIZE=-1>THAT DAY</FONT>" is what our Lord designs to
 inculcate.</P>

 <B>no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the
 Father</B>--This very remarkable statement regarding "the Son" is
 peculiar to Mark. Whether it means that the Son was
 <I>not at that time in possession of the knowledge</I> referred to, or
 simply that it was not
 <I>among the things which He had received to communicate</I>--has been
 matter of much controversy even among the firmest believers in the
 proper Divinity of Christ. In the latter sense it was taken by some of
 the most eminent of the ancient Fathers, and by L<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHER</FONT>,
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ELANCTHON</FONT>, and
 most of the older Lutherans; and it is so taken by B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>,

 the first announcement to them of the precise time: "And it came to 
 pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:1-25:46">Mt 24:1-25:46</A>,

 which He delivered to His disciples; His public ministry being now 
 closed: from His <I>prophetical</I> He is now passing into His 
 <I>priestly</I> office, although all along He Himself took our 
 infirmities and bare our sicknesses--"He said unto His disciples, Ye 
 know that after two days is [the feast of] the passover, and the Son of 
 man is betrayed to be crucified." The <I>first</I> and the <I>last</I> 
 steps of His final sufferings are brought together in this brief 
 announcement of all that was to take place. The <I>passover</I> was the 
 first and the chief of the three great annual festivals, commemorative 
 of the redemption of God's people from Egypt, through the sprinkling of 
 the blood of a lamb divinely appointed to be slain for that end; the 
 destroying angel, "when he saw the blood, <I>passing over</I>" the 
 Israelitish houses, on which that blood was seen, when he came to 
 destroy all the first-born in the land of Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:12,13">Ex 12:12, 13</A>)

 --bright typical foreshadowing of the great Sacrifice, and the 
 Redemption effected thereby. Accordingly, "by the determinate counsel 
 and foreknowledge of God, who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in 
 working," it was so ordered that precisely at the passover season, 
 "Christ our Passover should be sacrificed for us." On the day following 
 the passover commenced "the feast of unleavened bread," so called 
 because for seven days only unleavened bread was to be eaten

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:18-20">Ex 12:18-20</A>).

 We are further told by Matthew

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:3">Mt 26:3</A>)

 that the consultation was held in the palace of Caiaphas the high

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>lest there be an uproar of the people</B>--In consequence of the vast
 influx of strangers, embracing all the male population of the land who
 had reached a certain age, there were within the walls of Jerusalem at
 this festival some two million people; and in their excited state, the
 danger of tumult and bloodshed among "the people," who for the most part
 took Jesus for a prophet, was extreme. See J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>
 [<I>Antiquities,</I> 20.5.3]. What plan, if any, these ecclesiastics fixed
 upon for seizing our Lord, does not appear. But the proposal of Judas
 being at once and eagerly gone into, it is probable they were till then
 at some loss for a plan sufficiently quiet and yet effectual. So, just
 at the feast time shall it be done; the unexpected offer of Judas
 relieving them of their fears. Thus, as B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> remarks, did the divine
 counsel take effect.</P>

 The time of this part of the narrative is <I>four days before</I> what has
 just been related. Had it been part of the regular train of events which
 our Evangelist designed to record, he would probably have inserted it in
 its proper place, before the conspiracy of the Jewish authorities. But

 this scene as what probably gave immediate occasion to the awful deed.</P>

 "the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair: and the house was 
 filled with the odor of the ointment." The only use of this was to 
 refresh and exhilarate--a grateful compliment in the East, amid the 
 closeness of a heated atmosphere, with many guests at a feast. Such was 
 the form in which Mary's love to Christ, at so much cost to herself, 
 poured itself out.</P>

 "But when His disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying," &c. The

 from John

 "Then saith one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which 
 should betray Him." Doubtless the thought stirred first in his breast, 
 and issued from his base lips; and some of the rest, ignorant of his

 poor but because he was a thief, and had the bag"--the scrip or 
 treasure chest--"and bare what was put therein"--not "bare it off" by 
 theft, as some understand it. It is true that he did this; but the 
 expression means simply that he had charge of it and its contents, or 
 was treasurer to Jesus and the Twelve. What a remarkable arrangement 
 was this, by which an avaricious and dishonest person was not only 
 taken into the number of the Twelve, but entrusted with the custody of 
 their little property! The purposes which this served are obvious 
 enough; but it is further noticeable, that the remotest hint was never 
 given to the Eleven of his true character, nor did the disciples most 
 favored with the intimacy of Jesus ever suspect him, till a few minutes 
 before he voluntarily separated himself from their company--for

 Had we only the first three Gospels, we should have concluded that our
 Lord was led immediately to Caiaphas, and had before the Council. But as
 the Sanhedrim could hardly have been brought together at the dead hour
 of night--by which time our Lord was in the hands of the officers sent
 to take Him--and as it was only "as soon as it was day" that the Council
 met 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:66">Lu 22:66</A>),

 we should have had some difficulty in knowing what was done with Him 
 during those intervening hours. In the Fourth Gospel, however, all this 
 is cleared up, and a very important addition to our information is made

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:13,14,19-24">Joh 18:13, 14, 19-24</A>).

 Let us endeavor to trace the events in the true order of succession, 
 and in the detail supplied by a comparison of all the four streams of 
 text.</P>

 successful Annas, as E<FONT SIZE=-1>LLICOTT</FONT> remarks, was appointed high priest by
 Quirinus, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 12, and after holding the office for several years, was
 deposed by Valerius Gratius, Pilate's predecessor in the procuratorship
 of Judea [J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, <I>Antiquities,</I> 18.2.1, &c.]. He appears,
 however, to have possessed vast influence, having obtained the high
 priesthood, not only for his son Eleazar, and his son-in-law Caiaphas,
 but subsequently for four other sons, under the last of whom James, the
 brother of our Lord, was put to death [<I>Antiquities,</I> 20.9.1]. It is
 thus highly probable that, besides having the title of "high priest"
 merely as one who had filled the office, he to a great degree retained
 the powers he had formerly exercised, and came to be regarded
 practically as a kind of rightful high priest.</P>

 What passed between Annas and our Lord during this interval the beloved 
 disciple reserves till he has related the beginning of Peter's fall. To 
 this, then, as recorded by our own Evangelist, let us meanwhile 
 listen.</P>

 <I>Peter Obtains Access within the Quadrangle of the High Priest's
 Residence, and Warms Himself at the Fire</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:53,54">Mr 14:53, 54</A>).</P>

 <B>53. And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were
 assembled</B>--or rather, "there gathered together unto him."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes</B>--it was then a
 full and formal meeting of the Sanhedrim. Now, as the first three
 Evangelists place all Peter's denials of his Lord after this, we should
 naturally conclude that they took place
 <I>while our Lord stood before the Sanhedrim.</I> But besides that the
 natural impression is that the scene around the fire took place
 <I>overnight,</I> the <I>second crowing of the cock,</I> if we are to credit
 ancient writers, would occur about the beginning of the fourth watch, or
 between three and four in the morning. By that time, however, the
 Council had probably convened, being warned, perhaps, that they were to
 prepare for being called at any hour of the morning, should the Prisoner
 be successfully secured. If this be correct, it is fairly certain that
 only the <I>last</I> of Peter's three denials would take place while our
 Lord was under trial before the Sanhedrim. One thing more may require
 explanation. If our Lord had to be transferred from the residence of
 Annas to that of Caiaphas, one is apt to wonder that there is no mention
 of His being marched from the one to the other. But the building, in all
 likelihood, was one and the same; in which case He would merely have to
 be taken perhaps across the court, from one chamber to another.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr14_54"> </A>

 <B>the palace of the high priest</B>--"An oriental house," says
 R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>,
 "is usually built around a quadrangular interior court; into which there
 is a passage (sometimes arched) through the front part of the house,
 closed next the street by a heavy folding gate, with a smaller wicket
 for single persons, kept by a porter. The interior court, often paved or
 flagged, and open to the sky, is the <I>hall,</I> which our translators
 have rendered 'palace,' where the attendants made a fire; and the
 passage beneath the front of the house, from the street to this court,
 is the <I>porch.</I> The place where Jesus stood before the high priest
 may have been an open room, or place of audience on the ground floor, in
 the rear or on one side of the court; such rooms, open in front, being
 customary. It was close upon the court, for Jesus heard all that was
 going on around the fire, and turned and looked upon Peter

 <B>and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire</B>--The
 graphic details, here omitted, are supplied in the other Gospels.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B><I>for it was cold</I></B>--John alone of all the Evangelists mentions the
 <I>material,</I> and the <I>coldness</I> of the night, as W<FONT SIZE=-1>EBSTER</FONT> and
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT> remark. The elevated situation of Jerusalem, observes
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT>,
 renders it so cold about Easter as to make a watch fire at night
 indispensable.

 <B><I>And Peter stood with them and warmed himself</I></B>--"He went
 in," says Matthew

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:58">Mt 26:58</A>),

 "and sat with the servants <I>to see the end.</I>" These two minute
 statements throw an interesting light on each other.  His wishing to 
 "see the end," or issue of these proceedings, was what led him into the 
 palace, for he evidently feared the worst. But once in, the serpent 
 coil is drawn closer; it is a cold night, and why should not he take 
 advantage of the fire as well as others? Besides, in the talk of the 
 crowd about the all-engrossing topic he may pick up something which he 
 would like to hear. Poor Peter! But now, let us leave him warming 
 himself at the fire, and listening to the hum of talk about this 
 strange case by which the subordinate officials, passing to and fro and 
 crowding around the fire in this open court, would while away the time; 
 and, following what appears the order of the Evangelical Narrative, let 
 us turn to Peter's Lord.</P>

 altogether fitting in the remonstrance. He had addressed to the high

 <B><I>Now Annas had sent Him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest</I></B>--On the
 meaning of this verse there is much diversity of opinion; and according
 as we understand it will be the conclusion we come to, whether there
 was but <I>one hearing</I> of our Lord before Annas and Caiaphas together,
 or whether, according to the view we have given above, there were
 <I>two hearings</I>--a preliminary and informal one before Annas, and a
 formal and official one before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrim. If our
 translators have given the right sense of the verse, there was but one
 hearing before Caiaphas; and then

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:24">Joh 18:24</A>

 is to be read as a <I>parenthesis,</I> merely supplementing what was 
 said in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:13">Joh 18:13</A>.

 This is the view of C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>,

 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ETTE</FONT>,
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>EYER</FONT>,
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>UCKE</FONT>,
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT>. 
 But there are decided objections to this view. First: We cannot but
 think that the <I>natural</I> sense of the whole passage, embracing

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:13,14,19-24">Joh 18:13, 14, 19-24</A>,

 is that of a preliminary non-official hearing before "Annas first," the
 particulars of which are accordingly recorded; and then of a 
 transference of our Lord from Annas to Caiaphas. Second: On the other 
 view, it is not easy to see why the Evangelist should not have inserted

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:24">Joh 18:24</A>
 
 immediately after

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:13">Joh 18:13</A>;

 or rather, how he could well have done otherwise. As it stands, it is 
 not only quite out of its proper place, but comes in most perplexingly.  
 Whereas, if we take it as a simple statement of fact, that after Annas 
 had finished his interview with Jesus, as recorded in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:19-23">Joh 18:19-23</A>,

 he transferred Him to Caiaphas to be formally tried, all is clear and
 natural. Third: The pluperfect sense "<I>had</I> sent" is in the
 translation only; the sense of the original word being simply "sent."
 And though there are cases where the aorist here used has the sense of
 an English pluperfect, this sense is not to be put upon it unless it be
 obvious and indisputable. Here that is so far from being the case, that
 the pluperfect "had sent" is rather an unwarrantable
 <I>interpretation</I> than a simple <I>translation</I> of the word;
 informing the reader that, <I>according to the view of our
 translators,</I> our Lord "had been" sent to Caiaphas <I>before</I> the
 interview just recorded by the Evangelist; whereas, if we translate the
 verse literally--"Annas <I>sent</I> Him bound unto Caiaphas the high
 priest"--we get just the information we expect, that Annas, having
 merely "<I>precognosced</I>" the prisoner, hoping to draw something out
 of Him, "sent Him to Caiaphas" to be formally tried before the proper
 tribunal. This is the view of
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT> and
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT> among the Fathers; and of the moderns, of

 But let the reader observe, that though this is introduced by the
 Evangelist before any of the denials of Peter are recorded, we have
 given reasons for concluding that probably the <I>first two denials</I> took place while our Lord was with Annas, and the last only during the
 trial before the Sanhedrim.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>55. And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
 against Jesus to put him to death</B>--Matthew 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:59">Mt 26:59</A>)

 says they "sought <I>false</I> witness." They knew they could find 
 nothing valid; but having their Prisoner to bring before Pilate, they 
 behooved to <I>make a case.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and found none</B>--none that would suit their purpose, or make a decent
 ground of charge before Pilate.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr14_56"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>56. For many bare false witness against him</B>--From their debasing
 themselves to "<I>seek</I>" them, we are led to infer that they were
 <I>bribed</I> to bear false witness; though there are never wanting
 sycophants enough, ready to sell themselves for naught, if they may but
 get a smile from those above them: see a similar scene in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:11-14">Ac 6:11-14</A>.
 
 How is one reminded here of that complaint, "False witnesses did rise
 up: they laid to my charge things that I knew not" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:11">Ps 31:11</A>)!

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but their witness agreed not together</B>--If even <I>two</I> of them had
 been agreed, it would have been greedily enough laid hold of, as all
 that the law insisted upon even in capital cases 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:6">De 17:6</A>).

 But even in this they failed. One cannot but admire the providence 
 which secured this result; since, on the one hand, it seems astonishing 
 that those unscrupulous prosecutors and their ready tools should so 
 bungle a business in which they felt their whole interests bound up; 
 and, on the other hand, if they <I>had</I> succeeded in making even a 
 plausible case, the effect on the progress of the Gospel might for a 
 time have been injurious. But at the very time when His enemies were 
 saying, "God hath forsaken Him; persecute and take Him; for there is 
 none to deliver Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:11">Ps 71:11</A>),

 He whose Witness He was and whose work He was doing was keeping Him as 
 the apple of His eye, and while He was making the wrath of man to 
 praise Him, was restraining the remainder of that wrath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:10">Ps 76:10</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Mr14_57"> </A>

 <B>57. And there arose certain, and bare false witness against
 him</B>--Matthew

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:60">Mt 26:60</A>)

 is more precise here: "<I>At the last</I> came two false witnesses." As 
 no two had before agreed in anything, they felt it necessary to secure 
 a duplicate testimony to something, but they were long of succeeding. 
 And what was it, when at length it was brought forward?

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saying</B>--as follows:</P>

 <A NAME="Mr14_58"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>58. We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with 
 hands, and within three days I will build another made without 
 hands</B>--On this charge, observe, first, that eager as His enemies 
 were to find criminal matter against our Lord, they had to go back to 
 the outset of His ministry, His first visit to Jerusalem, more than 
 three years before this. In all that He said and did after that, though 
 ever increasing in boldness, they could find nothing. Next, that even 
 then, they fix only on one speech, of two or three words, which they 
 dared to adduce against Him. Further, they most manifestly pervert the 
 speech of our Lord. We say not this because in Mark's form of it, it
 differs from the report of the words given by the Fourth Evangelist

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:18-22">Joh 2:18-22</A>)

 --the only one of the Evangelists who reports it all, or mentions even 
 any visit paid by our Lord to Jerusalem before His last--but because 
 the one report bears truth, and the other falsehood, on its face. When 
 our Lord said on that occasion, "Destroy this temple, and in three days 
 I will raise it up," they <I>might,</I> for a moment, have understood 
 Him to refer to the temple out of whose courts He had swept the buyers 
 and sellers.  But <I>after</I> they had expressed their astonishment at 
 His words, in that sense of them, and reasoned upon the time it had 
 taken to rear the temple as it then stood, since <I>no answer</I> to 
 this appears to have been given by our Lord, it is hardly conceivable 
 that they should continue in the persuasion that this was really His 
 meaning. But finally, even if the more ignorant among them had done so, 
 it is next to certain that <I>the ecclesiastics,</I> who were <I>the 
 prosecutors</I> in this case, <I>did not believe that this was His 
 meaning.</I> For in less than three days after this they went to 
 Pilate, saying, "Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was 
 yet alive, <I>after three days I will rise again</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:63">Mt 27:63</A>).

 Now what utterance of Christ known to His enemies, <I>could</I> this 
 refer to, if not to this very saying about destroying and rearing up 
 the temple? And if so, it puts it beyond a doubt that by this time, at 
 least, they were perfectly aware that our Lord's words referred to 
 <I>His death by their hands and His resurrection by His own.</I> But 
 this is confirmed by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:59">Mr 14:59</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Mr14_59"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>59. But neither so did their witness agree together</B>--that is, not
 even as to so brief a speech, consisting of but a few words, was there
 such a concurrence in their mode of reporting it as to make out a decent
 case. In such a charge
 <I>everything depended on the very terms alleged to have been used.</I> For every one must see that a very slight turn, either way, given to
 such words, would make them either something like <I>indictable matter,</I> or else a <I>ridiculous ground for a criminal charge</I>--would either give
 them a colorable pretext for the charge of impiety which they were bent
 on making out, or else make the whole saying appear, on the worst view
 that could be taken of it, as merely some mystical or empty boast.</P>

 they had in vain tried to obtain from their false and contradictory

 <B>asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the
 Blessed?</B>--Why our Lord should have answered this question, when He was
 silent as to the former, we might not have quite seen, but for Matthew,
 who says 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:63">Mt 26:63</A>)

 that the high priest <I>put Him upon solemn oath,</I> saying, "I adjure 
 Thee by the living God, that Thou tell us whether Thou be the Christ, 
 the Son of God." Such an adjuration was understood to render an answer 
 legally necessary

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:64">Mt 26:64</A>),

 "Thou hast said [it]." In Luke, however

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:70">Lu 22:70</A>),

 the answer, "Ye say that I am," should be rendered--as D<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>E</FONT> W<FONT SIZE=-1>ETTE</FONT>, M<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>EYER</FONT>, E<FONT SIZE=-1>LLICOTT</FONT>, and the best 
 critics agree that the preposition requires--"Ye say [it], for I am 
 [so]." Some words, however, were spoken by our Lord before giving His 
 answer to this solemn question. These are recorded by Luke alone

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:67,68">Lu 22:67, 68</A>):

 "Art Thou the Christ [they asked]? tell us. And He said unto them, If I
 tell you, ye will not believe: and if I also ask [interrogate] "you, ye 
 will not answer Me, nor let Me go." This seems to have been uttered 
 before giving His direct answer, as a calm remonstrance and dignified 
 protest against the prejudgment of His case and the unfairness of their 
 mode of procedure. But now let us hear the rest of the answer, in which 
 the conscious majesty of Jesus breaks forth from behind the dark cloud 
 which overhung Him as He stood before the Council.  (Also see on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh18_28">Joh 18:28</A>.)

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and</B>--in that character.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and
 coming in the clouds of heaven</B>--In Matthew 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:64">Mt 26:64</A>)

 a slightly different but interesting turn is given to it by one word: 
 "Thou hast said [it]: nevertheless"--We prefer this sense of the word 
 to "besides," which some recent critics decide for--"I say unto you, 
 Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sit on the right hand of power, 
 and coming in the clouds of heaven." The word rendered "hereafter" 
 means, not "at some future time" (as to-day "hereafter" commonly does),
 but what the English word originally signified, "after here," "after 
 now," or "from this time." Accordingly, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:69">Lu 22:69</A>,

 the words used mean "from now." So that though the reference we have 
 given it to the day of His glorious Second Appearing is too obvious to 
 admit of doubt, He would, by using the expression, "From this time," 
 convey the important thought which He had before expressed, immediately 
 after the traitor left the supper table to do his dark work, 
 "<I>Now</I> is the Son of man glorified"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:31">Joh 13:31</A>).

 At this moment, and by this speech, did He "witness <I>the</I> good 
 confession" emphatically and properly, as the apostle says in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:13">1Ti 6:13</A>.

 Our translators render the words there, "Who <I>before</I> Pontius 
 Pilate witnessed"; referring it to the admission of His being a 
 <I>King,</I> in the presence of C&aelig;sar's own chief representative. 
 But it should be rendered, as L<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHER</FONT> renders it, 
 and as the best interpreters now understand it, "Who <I>under</I> 
 Pontius Pilate witnessed," &c. In this view of it, the apostle is 
 referring not to what our Lord confessed <I>before</I> Pilate--which, 
 though noble, was not of such primary importance--but to that sublime 
 confession which, under Pilate's administration, He witnessed before 
 the only competent tribunal on such occasions, the Supreme 
 Ecclesiastical Council of God's chosen nation, that He was <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>THE</FONT> M<FONT SIZE=-1>ESSIAH,</FONT> and <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>THE</FONT> S<FONT SIZE=-1>ON OF THE</FONT> B<FONT

 Ah! Well did He say prophetically, in that Messianic prediction which 
 we have often referred to, "I gave My back to the smiters, and My 
 cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not My face from shame 
 and spitting!"

 varied as were the <I>recorded</I> affronts put upon Him, they are but 
 a <I>small specimen</I> of what He endured on that dark occasion.</P>

 "<I>beneath</I>"--one of our Evangelist's graphic touches--is most
 important for the right understanding of what we may call the topography
 of the scene. We must take it in connection with Matthew's word

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:69">Mt 26:69</A>):

 "Now Peter sat <I>without</I> in the palace"--or quadrangular court, in
 the center of which the fire would be burning; and crowding around and 
 buzzing about it would be the menials and others who had been admitted 
 within the court. At the upper end of this court, probably, would be 
 the memorable chamber in which the trial was held--<I>open to the 
 court,</I> likely, and <I>not far from the fire</I> (as we gather from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:61">Lu 22:61</A>),

 but <I>on a higher level;</I> for (as our verse says) the court, with 
 Peter in it, was "beneath" it. The ascent to the Council chamber was 
 perhaps by a short flight of steps. If the reader will bear this 
 explanation in mind, he will find the intensely interesting details 
 which follow more intelligible.

 is here more graphic; "But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the 
 fire"--literally, "by the <I>light,</I>" which, shining full upon him, 
 revealed him to the girl--"and earnestly looked upon him"--or, "fixed 
 her gaze upon him." His demeanor and timidity, which must have

 "Art not thou also one of this man's disciples?" that is, thou as well 
 as "that other disciple," whom she knew to be one, but did not 
 challenge, perceiving that he was a privileged person. In Luke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:56">Lu 22:56</A>)

 it is given as a remark made by the maid to one of the 
 by-standers--"this man was also with Him." If so expressed in Peter's 
 hearing--drawing upon him the eyes of every one that heard it (as we 
 know it did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:70">Mt 26:70</A>),

 "the girl"; but this would not necessarily mean the same one as before,
 but might, and probably does, mean just the female who had charge of the
 door or gate near which Peter now was. Accordingly, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:71">Mt 26:71</A>,
 
 she is expressly called "another [maid]." But in Luke

 it is a <I>male</I> servant: "And after a little while [from the time 
 of the first denial] another"--that is, as the word signifies, "another 
 male" servant. But there is no real difficulty, as the challenge, 
 probably, after being made by one was reiterated by another. 
 Accordingly, in John

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:25">Joh 18:25</A>),

 it is, "<I>They</I> said therefore unto him, &c.--as if more than one

 <B>they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them:
 for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech agreeth thereto</B>--"bewrayeth
 [or 'discovereth'] thee" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:73">Mt 26:73</A>).

 In Luke 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:59">Lu 22:59</A>)

 it is, "Another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this [fellow] 
 also was with him: for he is a Galilean." The Galilean dialect had a 
 more <I>Syrian</I> cast than that of Judea. <I>If Peter had held his 
 peace,</I> this peculiarity had not been observed; but hoping, 
 probably, to put them off the scent by joining in the <I>fireside 
 talk,</I> he was thus discovered. The Fourth Gospel is particularly 
 interesting here: "One of the servants of the high priest, being his 
 kinsman [or kinsman to him] whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I 
 see thee in the garden with Him?"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:26">Joh 18:26</A>).

 No doubt his relationship to Malchus drew his attention to the man who 
 had smitten him, and this enabled him to identify Peter. "Sad 
 reprisals!" exclaims B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>. Poor Peter! Thou art 
 caught in thine own toils; but like a wild bull in a net, thou wilt 
 toss and rage, filling up the measure of thy terrible declension by one 
 more denial of thy Lord, and that the foulest of all.</P>

 Our Second Evangelist makes no mention of this look, but dwells on the 
 warning of his Lord about the double crowing of the cock, which would

 the weeping

 The most precious link, however, in the whole chain of circumstances in

 reported by Luke alone

 Saviour were perfectly different from the first; and the treason of
 Judas was but the consummation of the wretched man's resistance of the
 blaze of light in the midst of which he had lived for three years,
 while Peter's denial was but a momentary obscuration of the heavenly
 light and love to his Master which ruled his life. But the immediate
 cause of the blessed revulsion which made Peter "weep bitterly"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:75">Mt 26:75</A>)

 was, beyond all doubt, this heart-piercing "look" which his Lord gave 
 him. And remembering the Saviour's own words at the table, "Simon, 
 Simon, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; 
 <I>but I prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:31,32">Lu 22:31, 32</A>),

 may we not say that <I>this prayer fetched down all that there was in 
 that look</I> to pierce and break the heart of Peter, to keep it from 
 despair, to work in it "repentance unto salvation not to be repented 
 of," and at length, under other healing touches, to "restore his soul?"

 that they had purchased them immediately after the Crucifixion, on the

 before sunset, when the sabbath rest began; and that they had only 
 deferred using them to anoint the body till the sabbath rest should be

 <B>the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising
 of the sun</B>--not quite literally, but "at earliest dawn"; according to
 a way of speaking not uncommon, and occurring sometimes in the Old

 First day.</P>

 he is called "the angel of the Lord"; but here he is described as he
 appeared to the eye, in the bloom of a life that knows no decay. In
 Matthew he is represented as sitting on the stone <I>outside</I> the
 sepulchre; but since even there he says, "<I>Come,</I> see the place where
 the Lord lay" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:6">Mt 28:6</A>),

 them from without; only awaiting their arrival to accompany them into 
 the hallowed spot, and instruct them about it.

 being drawn up--as all the earliest tradition
 states--<I>under the eye of Peter,</I> or from materials chiefly furnished by
 him, there is something deeply affecting in the preservation of this
 little clause by Mark alone.

 appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven
 devils</B>--There is some difficulty here, and different ways of removing
 it have been adopted. She had gone with the other women to the sepulchre

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:1">Mr 16:1</A>),

 parting from them, perhaps, before their interview with the angel, and
 on finding Peter and John she had come with them back to the spot; and 
 it was at this second visit, it would seem, that Jesus appeared to this 
 Mary, as detailed in

 this closing verse a most important link of connection with the Acts of
 the Apostles, where He who directed all the movements of the infant
 Church is perpetually styled "T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT>

 promise for the rounding and building up of the Church,
