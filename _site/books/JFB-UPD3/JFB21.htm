 The Hebrew <I>title</I> is <I>Koheleth,</I> which the speaker in it
 applies to himself 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:12">Ec 1:12</A>),

 "I, <I>Koheleth,</I> was king over Israel." It means an 
 <I>Assembler</I> or <I>Convener of a meeting</I> and a <I>Preacher</I> 
 to such a meeting. The feminine form of the Hebrew noun, and its 
 construction once

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:27">Ec 7:27</A>)

 with a feminine verb, show that it not only signifies <I>Solomon,</I> 
 the Preacher to assemblies (in which case it is construed with the verb 
 or noun masculine), but also <I>Divine Wisdom</I> (feminine in 
 <I>Hebrew</I>) speaking by the mouth of the inspired king. In six cases 
 out of seven it is construed with the masculine. Solomon was endowed 
 with inspired wisdom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:5-14,6:11,12,9:1-9,11:9-11">1Ki 3:5-14;
 6:11, 12; 9:1-9; 11:9-11</A>),

 specially fitting him for the task. The Orientals delight in such
 meetings for grave discourse. Thus the Arabs formerly had an assembly 
 yearly, at Ocadh, for hearing and reciting poems. Compare "Masters of 
 assemblies" (see on

 <A HREF="#Ec12_11">Ec 12:11</A>,

 also

 <A HREF="#Ec12_9">Ec 12:9</A>).

 "The Preacher taught the people knowledge," probably <I>viva voce</I> 
 ("orally");

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:34,10:2,8,24,2Ch+9:1,7,23">1Ki 4:34; 10:2, 8, 24;
 2Ch 9:1, 7, 23</A>,

 plainly refer to a somewhat public divan met for literary discussion.
 So "spake," thrice repeated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:32,33">1Ki 4:32, 33</A>),

 refers not to <I>written</I> compositions, but to addresses
 <I>spoken</I> in assemblies convened for the purpose. The Holy Ghost, 
 no doubt, signifies also by the term that Solomon's doctrine is 
 intended for the "great congregation," the Church of all places and 
 ages

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:25,49:2-4">Ps 22:25; 49:2-4</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon was plainly <I>the author</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:12,16,2:15,12:9">Ec 1:12, 16; 2:15; 12:9</A>).

 That the Rabbins attribute it to Isaiah or Hezekiah is explicable by
 supposing that one or the other inserted it <I>in the canon.</I> The
 difference of its style, as compared with Proverbs and Song of Solomon,
 is due to the difference of subjects, and the different period of his
 life in which each was written; the Song, in the fervor of his first
 love to God; Proverbs, about the same time, or somewhat later; but
 Ecclesiastes in late old age, as the seal and testimony of repentance
 of his apostasy in the intervening period:

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:30,33">Ps 89:30, 33</A>

 proves his penitence. The substitution of the title <I>Koheleth</I> for
 Solomon (that is, <I>peace</I>), may imply that, having <I>troubled</I>
 Israel, meantime he forfeited his name of <I>peace</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:14,23">1Ki 11:14, 23</A>);

 but now, having repented, he wishes to be henceforth a <I>Preacher</I> 
 of righteousness. The alleged foreign expressions in the <I>Hebrew</I> 
 may have been easily imported, through the great intercourse there was 
 with other nations during his long reign. Moreover, supposed Chaldaisms 
 may be fragments preserved from the common tongue of which <I>Hebrew, 
 Syriac, Chaldee,</I> and <I>Arabic</I> were offshoots.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT>
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>COPE</FONT> of Ecclesiastes is to
 <I>show the vanity of all mere human pursuits, when made the chief end, as contrasted with the real blessedness of true wisdom,</I> that is,
 religion. The immortality of the soul is dwelt on incidentally, as
 subsidiary to the main scope. Moses' law took this truth for granted
 but drew its sanctions of rewards and punishments in accordance with
 the theocracy, which was under a special providence of God as the
 <I>temporal</I> King of Israel, from the <I>present life,</I> rather than the
 future. But after Israel chose an earthly king, God withdrew, in part,
 His extraordinary providence, so that under Solomon, temporal rewards
 did not invariably follow virtue, and punishments vice (compare
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:16,3:19,4:1,5:8,7:15,8:14,9:2,11">Ec 2:16;
 3:19; 4:1; 5:8; 7:15; 8:14; 9:2, 11</A>).

 Hence the need arises to show that these anomalies will be rectified
 hereafter, and this is the grand "conclusion," therefore, of the 
 "whole" book, that, seeing there is a coming judgment, and seeing that 
 present goods do not satisfy the soul, "man's whole duty is to fear God 
 and keep his commandments"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:13,14">Ec 12:13, 14</A>),

 and meanwhile, to use, in joyful and serene sobriety, and not abuse,
 the present life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:12,13">Ec 3:12, 13</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is objected that sensual epicurism seems to be inculcated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:12,13,22">Ec 3:12, 13, 22</A>,

 &c.); but it is a contented, thankful enjoyment of God's present gifts
 that is taught, as opposed to a murmuring, anxious, avaricious spirit, 
 as is proved by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:18">Ec 5:18</A>,

 compare with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:11-15">Ec 5:11-15</A>,

 not making them the <I>chief end</I> of life; not the joy of levity and
 folly; a misunderstanding which he guards against in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:2-6,11:9,12:1">Ec 7:2-6; 11:9; 12:1</A>.

 Again,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:16,9:2-10">Ec 7:16; 9:2-10</A>,

 might seem to teach fatalism and skepticism. But these are words put in
 the mouth of an objector; or rather, they were the language of Solomon 
 himself during his apostasy, finding an echo in the heart of every 
 sensualist, who <I>wishes</I> to be an unbeliever, and, who, therefore, 
 sees difficulties enough in the world around wherewith to prop up his 
 wilful unbelief. The answer is given

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:17,18,9:11,12,11:1,6,12:13">Ec 7:17,
 18; 9:11, 12; 11:1, 6; 12:13</A>).

 Even if these passages be taken as words of Solomon, they are to be
 understood as forbidding a self-made "righteousness," which tries to 
 constrain God to grant salvation to imaginary good works and external 
 strictness with which it wearies itself; also, that speculation which 
 tries to fathom all God's inscrutable counsels

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:17">Ec 8:17</A>),

 and that carefulness about the future forbidden in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25">Mt 6:25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HIEF</FONT>
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>OOD</FONT> is that the possession of that which makes us happy,
 is to be sought as the <I>end,</I> for its own sake; whereas, all other
 things are but <I>means</I> towards it. Philosophers, who made it the great
 subject of inquiry, restricted it to the present life, treating the
 eternal as unreal, and only useful to awe the multitude with. But
 Solomon shows the vanity of all human things (so-called philosophy
 included) to satisfy the soul, and that heavenly wisdom alone is the
 chief good. He had taught so when young 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:20,8:1">Pr 1:20; 8:1</A>);

 so also; in Song of Solomon, he had spiritualized the subject in an
 allegory; and now, after having long personally tried the manifold ways 
 in which the worldly seek to reach happiness, he gives the fruit of his 
 experience in old age.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is divided into two parts--
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:1-6:10">Ec 1:1-6:10</A>

 showing the vanity of earthly things;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+6:10-12:14">Ec 6:10-12:14</A>,

 the excellence of heavenly wisdom.  Deviations from strict logical
 methods occur in these divisions, but in the main they are observed. 
 The deviations make it the less stiff and artificial, and the more 
 suited to all capacities. It is in poetry; the hemistichal division is 
 mostly observed, but occasionally not so. The choice of epithets, 
 imagery, inverted order of words, ellipses, parallelism, or, in its 
 absence, similarity of diction, mark versification.</P>

 While the <I>earth</I> remains the same, the generations of <I>men</I>

 sun, wind, and rivers are ever shifting about, while the cycle in which

 inscrutable dealings with the "just" and with the "wicked" here

 to <I>the skull,</I> which, from the vital preciousness of its

 the brain. (2) <I>A fountain,</I> from which water is drawn by <I>a

 pitcher and wheel are broken, water can no more be drawn, so life

 the right ventricle of the heart; the "cistern," the left; the pitcher, 
 the veins; the wheel, the aorta, or great artery

 known or not to Solomon, <I>seems</I> to be implied in the language put 
 by the Holy Ghost into his mouth. This gloomy picture of old age 
 applies to those who have not "remembered their Creator in youth." They 
 have none of the consolations of God, which they might have obtained in 
 youth; it is now too late to seek them. A good old age is a blessing to 
 the godly
