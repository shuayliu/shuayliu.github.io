 P<FONT SIZE=-1>LACE OF</FONT> W<FONT SIZE=-1>RITING</FONT>.--Paul, in 
 the interval between his first and second imprisonment, after having 
 written First Timothy from Macedonia or Corinth 
 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT>] (if we are to adopt the opinion that First
 Timothy was written after his first imprisonment), returned to Ephesus, 
 as he intended, by way of <I>Troas,</I> where he left the books, &c.  
 (mentioned in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:13">2Ti 4:13</A>),

 with Carpus. From Ephesus he went to Crete for a short visit and
 returned, and then wrote to Titus. Next he went by Miletus to Corinth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:20">2Ti 4:20</A>),
 
 and thence to Nicopolis 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:12">Tit 3:12</A>),

 whence he proceeded to Rome. From his prison there he wrote the Second 
 Epistle to Timothy, shortly before his martyrdom. It is not certain 
 where Timothy was at this time. Some of the internal evidences favor 
 the view of his having been then at Ephesus; thus the salutation of 
 Priscilla and Aquila, who generally resided there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:19">2Ti 4:19</A>);

 also that of the household of Onesiphorus, who is stated in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:16-18">2Ti 1:16-18</A>

 to have ministered to Paul <I>at Ephesus,</I> a circumstance implying 
 his residence there. Also, the Hymen&aelig;us of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:17">2Ti 2:17</A>

 seems to be the same as the Hymen&aelig;us at Ephesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:20">1Ti 1:20</A>);

 and probably "Alexander the coppersmith"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:14">2Ti 4:14</A>)

 is the same as the Alexander joined with Hymen&aelig;us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:20">1Ti 1:20</A>),

 and possibly the same as the Alexander put forward by the Jews to clear 
 themselves, not to befriend Paul, at the riot in <I>Ephesus</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:33,34">Ac 19:33, 34</A>).

 The difficulty is, on this supposition, how to account for

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:12,20">2Ti 4:12, 20</A>:

 if Timothy was at Ephesus, why did he need to be told that <I>Paul had 
 sent Tychicus to Ephesus?</I> or that <I>Paul had left Trophimus, 
 himself an Ephesian</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:29">Ac 21:29</A>),

 <I>sick at Miletus,</I> which was only thirty miles from Ephesus?  
 However, see on

 <A HREF="#2Ti4_12">2Ti 4:12</A>;

 <A HREF="#2Ti4_20">2Ti 4:20</A>. 

 Troas lay on the road to Rome from either Ephesus or Pontus, so that

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:13">2Ti 4:13</A>

 will accord with the theory of either Ephesus or any other place in the 
 northwest of Asia Minor, being Timothy's place of sojourn at the time. 
 Probably, he had the general superintendence of the Pauline churches in 
 Asia Minor, in accordance with his mission combining the office of 
 <I>evangelist,</I> or <I>itinerant missionary,</I> with that of 
 <I>presiding overseer.</I> Ephesus was probably his headquarters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>IME OF</FONT> W<FONT SIZE=-1>RITING</FONT>.--(1) Paul's 
 first imprisonment, described in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:17-31">Ac 28:17-31</A>,

 was much milder than that in which he was when writing Second Timothy. 
 In the former, he had liberty to lodge in his own hired house, and to 
 receive all comers, guarded only by a single soldier; in the latter, he 
 was so closely confined that Onesiphorus with difficulty found him; he 
 was chained, his friends had forsaken him, and he had narrowly escaped 
 sentence of execution from the Roman emperor. Medieval legends 
 represent the Mamertine prison, or Tullianum, as the scene of his 
 incarceration with Peter. But this is irreconcilable with the fact of 
 Onesiphorus, Linus, Pudens, &c., having access to him. He was probably 
 under military custody, as in his former imprisonment, though of a 
 severer kind

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:16-18,2:9,4:6-8,16,17">2Ti 1:16-18; 2:9; 4:6-8, 16, 17</A>).

 (2) The visit to Troas

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:13">2Ti 4:13</A>)
 
 can hardly have been that mentioned in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:5-7">Ac 20:5-7</A>,

 the last before his first imprisonment; for, if it were, the interval 
 between that visit and the first imprisonment would be seven or eight 
 years, a period most unlikely for him to have allowed to pass without 
 sending for his cloak and parchments, when they might have been of 
 service to him in the interim. (3) Paul's leaving Trophimus sick at 
 Miletus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:20">2Ti 4:20</A>),

 could not have been on the occasion mentioned in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:15">Ac 20:15</A>;

 for, subsequent to that, Trophimus was with Paul in Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:29">Ac 21:29</A>).
 
 (4) The words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:20">2Ti 4:20</A>),

 "Erastus abode at Corinth," imply that Paul had shortly before been at 
 Corinth, where he left Erastus. But before his first imprisonment, Paul 
 had not been at Corinth for several years; and in the interval Timothy 
 had been with him, so that Timothy did not need at a later period to be 
 told about that visit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:2,4">Ac 20:2, 4</A>).

 For all these reasons the imprisonment, during which he wrote Second 
 Timothy, is shown to be his second imprisonment. Moreover,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:23,24">Heb 13:23, 24</A>,

 represents the writer (who was probably Paul) as <I>in Italy,</I> and 
 <I>at liberty.</I> So C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> R<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OME</FONT> [<I>First Epistle to the Corinthians,</I> 1.5], the 
 disciple of Paul, explicitly states, "In the east and west, Paul as a 
 preacher instructed <I>the whole world</I> (that is, the Roman empire) 
 in righteousness, and having gone to <I>the extremity of the west,</I> 
 and having borne witness before the rulers (of Rome), he so was removed 
 from the world." This plainly implies that he fulfilled his design

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:24-28">Ro 15:24-28</A>)

 of a missionary journey <I>into Spain.</I> The canon of the New 
 Testament, compiled about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 170 (called M<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>URATORI'S</FONT> <I>Canon</I>), also mentions "the journey of 
 Paul from Rome to Spain." See R<FONT SIZE=-1>OUTH</FONT> [<I>Sacred 
 Fragments,</I> vol. 4, p. 1-12].</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 His martyrdom is universally said to have occurred in Nero's reign 
 [E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>, <I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 2.22; 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>, <I>On Illustrious Men</I>]. Five years 
 thus seem to have elapsed between the first imprisonment, 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 63

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:17-31">Ac 28:17-31</A>),

 and his martyrdom, June <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 68, the last year of 
 Nero's reign. He was probably arrested by the magistrates in Nicopolis

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:12">Tit 3:12</A>)

 in Epirus, in the winter, on a double charge, first, of being one of 
 the Christians who had conspired, it was alleged by Nero's partisans, 
 to set fire to Rome, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 64; secondly, of 
 introducing a novel and unlawful religion. His friends all left him, 
 except Luke: Demas from "love of this present world": the others from 
 various causes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:10,11">2Ti 4:10, 11</A>).

 On the first charge he seems to have been acquitted. His liberation 
 from his first imprisonment took place in <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 63, 
 the year before the great fire at Rome, which Nero made the pretext for 
 his persecution of the Christians. Every cruelty was heaped on them; 
 some were crucified; some were arrayed in the skins of wild beasts and 
 hunted to death by dogs; some were wrapped in pitch-robes and set on 
 fire by night to illuminate the circus of the Vatican and gardens of 
 Nero, while that monster mixed among the spectators in the garb of a 
 charioteer. But now (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 67 or 68) some years had 
 elapsed since the first excitement which followed the fire. Hence, 
 Paul, being a Roman citizen, was treated in his trial with a greater 
 respect for the forms of the law, and hence was acquitted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:17">2Ti 4:17</A>)

 on the first charge of having instigated the Christians to their 
 supposed acts of incendiarism before his last departure from Rome. 
 Alexander the coppersmith seems to have been a witness against him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:14">2Ti 4:14</A>).

 Had he been condemned on the first charge, he would probably have been 
 burnt alive, as the preceding martyrs were, for <I>arson.</I> His judge 
 was the city Pr&aelig;fect.  C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> R<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OME</FONT> specifies that his trial was (not before the 
 emperor, but) "before the rulers." No advocate ventured to plead his 
 cause, no patron appeared for him, such as under ordinary circumstances 
 might have aided him; for instance, one of the powerful &AElig;milian 
 house, under which his family possibly enjoyed clientship

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:16,17">2Ti 4:16, 17</A>),

 whence he may have taken his name Paul. The place of trial was, 
 probably, one of the great basilicas in the Forum, two of which were 
 called the Pauline Basilicas, from L. &AElig;milius Paulus, who had 
 built one and restored the other. He was remanded for the second stage 
 of his trial. He did not expect this to come on until the following 
 "winter"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:21">2Ti 4:21</A>),

 whereas it took place about midsummer; if in Nero's reign, not later
 than June. In the interim Luke was his only constant companion; but one 
 friend from Asia, Onesiphorus, had diligently sought him and visited 
 him in prison, undeterred by the danger. Linus, too, the future bishop 
 of Rome, Pudens, the son of a senator, and Claudia, his bride, perhaps 
 the daughter of a British king (see on

 <A HREF="#2Ti4_21">2Ti 4:21</A>), 

 were among his visitors; and Tychicus, before he was sent by Paul to 
 Ephesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:12">2Ti 4:12</A>;

 perhaps bearing with him this Epistle).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 O<FONT SIZE=-1>BJECT OF THE EPISTLE</FONT>.--He was anxious to see his 
 disciple Timothy, before his death, and that Timothy should bring Mark 
 with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:4,4:9,11,21">2Ti 1:4; 4:9, 11, 21</A>).

 But feeling how uncertain it was whether Timothy should arrive in time,
 he felt it necessary, also, to give him by letter a last warning as to 
 the heresies, the germs of which were then being scattered in the 
 Churches. Hence he writes a series of exhortations to faithfulness, and 
 zeal for sound doctrine, and patience amidst trials: a charge which 
 Timothy seems to have needed, if we are to judge from the apostle's 
 earnestness in urging him to boldness in Christ's cause, as though Paul 
 thought he saw in him some signs of constitutional timidity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:2-8,4:1-5,1Ti+5:22,23">2Ti 2:2-8; 4:1-5;
 1Ti 5:22, 23</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 P<FONT SIZE=-1>AUL'S</FONT>
 D<FONT SIZE=-1>EATH</FONT>.--D<FONT SIZE=-1>IOYSIUS</FONT>, bishop of
 Corinth (quoted in E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical 
 History,</I> 2.25]) about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 170, is the 
 earliest authority for the tradition that Peter suffered martyrdom at 
 Rome "about the same time" as Paul, after having labored for some time 
 there. He calls Peter and Paul "the founders of the Corinthian and 
 Roman Churches." The Roman presbyter, C<FONT SIZE=-1>AIUS</FONT> (about 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 200), mentions the tradition that Peter 
 suffered martyrdom in the Vatican. But (1) Peter's work was <I>among 
 the Jews</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:9">Ga 2:9</A>),

 whereas Rome was a Gentile Church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:13">Ro 1:13</A>.
 
 Moreover, (2) the First Epistle of Peter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1,5:13">1Pe 1:1; 5:13</A>)

 represents him as laboring <I>in Babylon</I> in Mesopotamia. (3) The
 silence concerning Peter of Paul's Epistles written in Rome, negatives 
 the tradition of his having founded, or labored long at Rome; though it 
 is <I>possible</I> he may have endured martyrdom there. His martyrdom, 
 certainly, was not, as J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> says, "on the same 
 day" with that of Paul, else Paul would have mentioned Peter's being at 
 Rome in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:11">2Ti 4:11</A>.

 The legend says that Peter, through fear, was fleeing from Rome at 
 early dawn by the Appian Way, when he met our Lord, and falling at His 
 feet, asked, Lord, whither goest thou?  to which the Lord replied, I go 
 again to be crucified. The disciple returned penitent and ashamed, and 
 was martyred. The Church of <I>Domine quo vadis,</I> on the Appian Way, 
 commemorates the supposed fact. Paul, according to C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AIUS</FONT> (quoted in E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> 
 [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 2.25]), suffered martyrdom <I>on the 
 Ostian Way.</I> So also J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>, who gives the 
 date, the fourteenth year of Nero. It was common to send prisoners, 
 whose death might attract too much notice at Rome, to some distance 
 from the city, under a military escort, for execution; hence the 
 soldier's <I>sword,</I> not the executioner's <I>axe,</I> was the 
 instrument of his decapitation [O<FONT SIZE=-1>ROSIUS</FONT>, <I>The 
 Seven Books of History against the Pagans,</I> 7.7]. Paul appears, from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:12-30">Php 1:12-30</A>,

 to have had his partisans even in the palace, and certainly must have 
 exercised such an influence as would excite sympathy in his behalf, to 
 avoid which the execution was ordered outside the city. Compare T<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ACITUS</FONT> [<I>Histories,</I> 4.11]. The Basilica of St. 
 Paul, first built by Constantine, now stands outside Rome on the road 
 to Ostia: before the Reformation it was under the protection of the 
 kings of England, and the emblem of the order of the Garter is still to 
 be seen among its decorations. The traditional spot of the martyrdom is 
 the <I>Tre Fontane,</I> not far from the Basilica [C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ONYBEARE</FONT> and H<FONT SIZE=-1>OWSON</FONT>].</P>

 <B>1.</B> This Epistle is the last testament and swan-like death song of

 <B>according to the promise of life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in 
 Christ</B>--Paul's <I>apostleship</I> is <I>in order to carry into

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:1,2">Tit 1:1, 2</A>).

 This "promise of life in Christ" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:10,2Ti+2:8">2Ti 1:10;
 2Ti 2:8</A>) 

 was needed to nerve Timothy to fortitude amidst trials, and to boldness
 in undertaking the journey to Rome, which would be attended with much 
 risk

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:2,Tit+1:4">1Ti 1:2,
 and Tit 1:4</A>,

 written at an earlier period than this Epistle, the expression used is
 in the <I>Greek,</I> "my <I>genuine</I> son." A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> sees in the change of expression an intimation of 
 an altered tone as to Timothy, more of mere love, and less of 
 confidence, as though Paul saw m him a want of firmness, whence arose 
 the need of his <I>stirring up</I> afresh the faith and grace in Him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:6">2Ti 1:6</A>).

 But this seems to me not justified by the <I>Greek</I> word 
 <I>agapetos,</I> which implies the attachment of <I>reasoning</I> and 
 <I>choice,</I> on the ground of <I>merit</I> in the one "beloved," not

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:9">Ro 1:9</A>)

 <I>as did my forefathers.</I> He does not mean to put on the same 
 footing the Jewish and Christian service of God; but simply to assert 
 his own conscientious service of God as he had received it from his 
 <I>progenitors</I> (not Abraham, Isaac, &c., whom he calls "the 
 fathers," not "progenitors" as the <I>Greek</I> is here;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:5">Ro 9:5</A>).

 The memory of those who had gone before to whom he is about to be 
 gathered, is now, on the eve of death, pleasant to him; hence also, he 
 calls to mind the faith of the mother and grandmother of Timothy; as he 
 walks in the faith of his forefathers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:1,24:14,26:6,7,28:20">Ac 23:1; 24:14; 26:6, 7; 28:20</A>),

 so Timothy should persevere firmly in the faith of his parent and
 grandparent. Not only Paul, but the Jews who reject Christ, forsake the 
 faith of their forefathers, who looked for Christ; when they accept

 Timothy's constitutional <I>timidity</I> (see on

 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ISHOP</FONT> P<FONT SIZE=-1>EARSON</FONT> proves the 
 divine origination of Christianity from its success being inexplicable 
 on the supposition of its being of human origin. The nature of its 
 doctrine was no way likely to command success: (1) it condemns all 
 other religions, some established for ages; (2) it enjoins precepts 
 ungrateful to flesh and blood, the mortifying of the flesh, the love of 
 enemies, and the bearing of the cross; (3) it enforces these seemingly 
 unreasonable precepts by promises seemingly incredible; not good things 
 such as afford complacency to our senses, but such as cannot be 
 obtained till after this life, and presuppose what then seemed 
 impossible, the resurrection; (4) it predicts to its followers what 
 would seem sure to keep most of the world from embracing it,

 <B>16. All scripture</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "Every Scripture," that is, 
 Scripture in its every part. However, <I>English Version</I> is 
 sustained, though the <I>Greek</I> article be wanting, by the technical 
 use of the term "Scripture" being so well known as not to need the 
 article (compare <I>Greek,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:15,Eph+2:21">Eph 3:15; 2:21</A>).

 The <I>Greek</I> is never used of <I>writings</I> in general, but only 
 of the sacred Scriptures. The position of the two <I>Greek</I> 
 adjectives closely united by "and," forbids our taking the one as an 
 epithet, the other as predicated and translated as A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> and E<FONT SIZE=-1>LLICOTT</FONT>. "Every 
 Scripture given by inspiration of God is <I>also</I> profitable." 
 <I>Vulgate</I> and the best manuscripts, favor <I>English Version.</I> 
 Clearly the adjectives are so closely connected that as surely as one 
 is a predicate, the other must be so too. A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> 
 admits his translation to be harsh, though legitimate. It is better 
 with <I>English Version</I> to take it in a construction legitimate, 
 and at the same time <I>not harsh.</I> The <I>Greek,</I> 
 "God-inspired," is found nowhere else. Most of the New Testament books 
 were written when Paul wrote this his latest Epistle: so he includes in 
 the clause "All Scripture is God-inspired," not only the <I>Old 
 Testament,</I> in which alone Timothy was taught when a child

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:15">2Ti 3:15</A>),

 but the New Testament books according as they were recognized in the 
 churches which had men gifted with "discerning of spirits," and so able 
 to distinguish really inspired utterances, persons, and so their 
 writings from spurious. Paul means, "All Scripture is God-inspired 
 <I>and therefore</I> useful"; because <I>we</I> see no utility in any 
 words or portion of it, it does not follow it is not God-inspired. It 
 is <I>useful,</I> because <I>God-inspired;</I> not <I>God-inspired,</I> 
 because useful. One reason for the article not being before the 
 <I>Greek,</I> "Scripture," may be that, if it had, it <I>might</I> be 
 supposed that it limited the sense to the <I>hiera grammata,</I> "Holy 
 Scriptures"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:15">2Ti 3:15</A>)

 <I>of the Old Testament,</I> whereas here the assertion is more 
 general: "<I>all</I> Scripture" (compare <I>Greek,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:20">2Pe 1:20</A>).

 The translation, "all Scripture that is God-inspired is also useful," 
 would imply that there is some <I>Scripture</I> which is not 
 God-inspired. But this would exclude the appropriated sense of the word 
 "Scripture"; and who would need to be told that "all divine Scripture 
 is <I>useful</I> ('profitable')?"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:13">Heb 4:13</A>

 would, in A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT> view, have to be rendered, "All 
 naked things are <I>also</I> open to the eyes of Him," &c.: so also

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:4">1Ti 4:4</A>,

 which would be absurd [T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT>, <I>Remarks on 
 the Prophetic Visions of the Book of Daniel</I>]. Knapp well defines 
 inspiration, "An extraordinary divine agency upon teachers while giving 
 instruction, whether oral or written, by which they were taught how and 
 what they should speak or write" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:1,Ac+4:25,2Pe+1:21">2Sa 23:1;
 Ac 4:25; 
 2Pe 1:21</A>). 

 The <I>inspiration</I> gives the divine <I>sanction</I> to all the
 words of Scripture, though those words be the utterances of the 
 individual writer, and only in special cases <I>revealed</I> directly 
 by God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:13">1Co 2:13</A>).

 <I>Inspiration</I> is here predicated of the <I>writings,</I> "all 
 Scripture," not of the persons.  The question is not <I>how</I> God has 
 done it; it is as to the <I>word,</I> not the <I>men</I> who wrote it. 
 What we must believe is that He <I>has</I> done it, and that all the 
 sacred writings are every where inspired, though not all alike matter 
 of special <I>revelation:</I> and that even the very <I>words</I> are 
 stamped with divine sanction, as Jesus used them (for example in the 
 temptation and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:34,35">Joh 10:34, 35</A>),

 for deciding all questions of doctrine and practice. There are degrees 
 of <I>revelation</I> in Scripture, but not of <I>inspiration.</I> The 
 sacred writers did not even always know the full significancy of their 
 own God-inspired words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10,11,12">1Pe 1:10, 11, 12</A>).

 Verbal inspiration does not mean mechanical dictation, but all 
 "Scripture is (so) inspired by God," that everything in it, its 
 narratives, prophecies, citations, the whole--ideas, phrases, and 
 words--are such as He saw fit to be there. The <I>present condition</I> 
 of the text is no ground for concluding against the <I>original 
 text</I> being inspired, but is a reason why we should use all critical 
 diligence to restore the original inspired text. Again, inspiration may 
 be accompanied by revelation or not, but it is as much needed for 
 writing <I>known</I> doctrines or facts authoritatively, as for 
 communicating <I>new</I> truths [T<FONT SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT>]. The 
 omission here of the substantive verb is,' I think, designed to mark 
 that, not only the Scripture <I>then</I> existing, but what was 
 <I>still to be written till the canon should be completed,</I> is 
 included as <I>God-inspired.</I> The Old Testament law was the 
 schoolmaster to bring us to Christ; so it is appropriately said to be 
 "able to make <I>wise</I> unto salvation through faith in Jesus 
 Christ": the term <I>wisdom</I> being appropriated to a knowledge of 
 the relations between the Old and New Testaments, and opposed to the 
 pretended <I>wisdom</I> of the false teachers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:7,8">1Ti 1:7, 8</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>doctrine</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "teaching," that is,
 <I>teaching the ignorant dogmatic</I> truths which they cannot otherwise
 know. He so uses the Old Testament,

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>reproof</B>--"refutation," <I>convicting the erring</I> of their 
 error.  Including <I>polemical</I> divinity. As an example of this use 
 of the Old Testament, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:6,13,16">Ga 3:6, 13, 16</A>.

 "Doctrine and reproof" comprehend the <I>speculative</I> parts of 
 divinity. Next follow the <I>practical:</I> Scripture is profitable 
 for: (1) <I>correction</I> (<I>Greek,</I> "setting one right"; compare 
 an example,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:1-10">1Co 10:1-10</A>)

 and <I>instruction</I> (<I>Greek,</I> "disciplining," as a father does

 Thus the whole science of theology is complete in Scripture. Since Paul 
 is speaking of Scripture in general and in the notion of it, the only 
 <I>general</I> reason why, in order to <I>perfecting</I> the godly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:17">2Ti 3:17</A>),

 that it was intended to be the <I>complete and sufficient rule</I> in 
 all things touching perfection. See Article VI, <I>Common Prayer

 to come to him in the winter to Nicopolis (in Epirus), intending in the 
 spring to preach the Gospel in the adjoining province of Dalmatia. 
 Titus seems to have gone thither to carry out the apostle's intention, 
 the execution of which was interrupted by his arrest. Whether he went 
 of his own accord, as is likely, or was sent by Paul, which the 
 expression "is departed" hardly accords with, cannot be positively

 Timothy had subsequently occupied the same post in relation to Paul as
 Mark once held. Hence Paul, appropriately here, wipes out the past 
 censure by high praise of Mark and guards against Timothy's making 
 self-complacent comparisons between himself and Mark, as though he were 
 superior to the latter (compare

 Erastus, one of his usual companions

 possibly the same Erastus as in

 though how he could leave his official duties for missionary journeys 
 is not clear), stayed behind at Corinth, his native place, or usual 
 residence, of which city he was "chamberlain," or city steward and 
 treasurer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:23">Ro 16:23</A>);

 and Trophimus he left behind at Miletus sick. (On his former history, 
 see on

 This verse is irreconcilable with the imprisonment from which he writes 
 being the <I>first:</I> for he did not pass by Corinth or Miletus on 
 his way to Rome when about to be imprisoned for the first time. As 
 Miletus was near Ephesus, there is a presumption that Timothy was 
 <I>not</I> at Ephesus when Paul wrote, or he would not need to inform 
 Timothy of Trophimus lying sick in his immediate neighborhood. However, 
 Trophimus may not have been still at Miletus at the time when Paul 
 wrote, though he had left him there on his way to Rome. Prisca and 
 Aquila were most likely to be at <I>Ephesus</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:19">2Ti 4:19</A>),

 and he desires Timothy to <I>salute them:</I> so also Onesiphorus' 
 household

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:18">2Ti 1:18</A>).
 
 Paul had not the power of healing at will

 <B>Pudens .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Claudia</B>--afterwards husband and wife
 (according to M<FONT SIZE=-1>ARTIAL</FONT> [<I>Epigrams,</I> 4.13;
 11.54]), he a Roman knight, she a Briton, surnamed <I>Rufina.</I>
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>ACITUS</FONT> [<I>On Agriculture,</I> 14], mentions that
 territories in southeast Britain were given to a British king;
 Cogidunus, in reward for his fidelity to Rome, 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 52, while Claudius was emperor. In 1772 a
 marble was dug up at Chichester, mentioning Cogidunus with the surname 
 Claudius, added from his patron, the emperor's name; and <I>Pudens</I> 
 in connection with Cogidunus, doubtless his father-in-law. His daughter 
 would be Claudia, who seems to have been sent to Rome for education, as 
 a pledge of the father's fidelity. Here she was under the protection of 
 Pomponia, wife of Aulus Plautius, conqueror of Britain. Pomponia was 
 accused of <I>foreign superstitions,</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 57
 [T<FONT SIZE=-1>ACITUS</FONT>, <I>Annals,</I> 3.32], probably 
 <I>Christianity.</I> She probably was the instrument of converting 
 Claudia, who took the name <I>Rufina</I> from her, that being a 
 cognomen of the Pomponian gens (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:13">Ro 16:13</A>,

 <I>Rufus,</I> a Christian). Pudens in M<FONT SIZE=-1>ARTIAL</FONT> and 
 in the Chichester inscription, appears as a <I>pagan;</I> but perhaps 
 he or his friends concealed his Christianity through fear. Tradition
 represents <I>Timothy,</I> a son of Pudens, as taking part in
 converting the Britons.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Linus</B>--put third; therefore not at this time yet, as he was
 afterwards, <I>bishop.</I> His name being here inserted between Pudens 
 and Claudia, implies the two were not yet married. "Eubulus" is 
 identified by some with Aristobulus, who, with his converts, is said to 
 have been among the first evangelists of Britain. Paul himself, says 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT</FONT>, "visited <I>the farthest west</I> 
 [perhaps Britain, certainly <I>Spain</I>], and was martyred under the 
 rulers at Rome," who were Nero's vicegerents in his absence from the 
 city.</P>
