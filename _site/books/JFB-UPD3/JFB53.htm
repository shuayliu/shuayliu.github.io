 as part of Paul's Epistle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 D<FONT SIZE=-1>ESIGN</FONT>.--The accounts from Thessalonica, after the sending of the
 first Epistle, represented the faith and love of the Christians there
 as on the increase; and their constancy amidst persecutions unshaken.
 One error of doctrine, however, resulting in practical evil, had sprung
 up among them. The apostle's description of Christ's sudden second
 coming 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:13-18,5:2">1Th 4:13,
 &c., and 1Th 5:2</A>),

 and the <I>possibility</I> of its being at any time, led them to 
 believe it was <I>actually</I> at hand.  Some professed to know by "the 
 Spirit"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:2">2Th 2:2</A>)

 that it was so; and others alleged that Paul had said so when with 
 them. A letter, too, purporting to be from the apostle to that effect, 
 seems to have been circulated among them. (That

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:2">2Th 2:2</A>

 refers to such a spurious letter, rather than to Paul's first Epistle, 
 appears likely from the statement,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:17">2Th 3:17</A>,

 as to his autograph salutation being the mark whereby his genuine 
 letters might be known). Hence some neglected their daily business and 
 threw themselves on the charity of others, as if their sole duty was to 
 wait for the coming of the Lord. This error, therefore, needed 
 rectifying, and forms a leading topic of the second Epistle. He in it 
 tells them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:1-17">2Th 2:1-17</A>),

 that before the Lord shall come, there must first be a great 
 <I>apostasy,</I> and <I>the Man of Sin</I> must be revealed; and that 
 the Lord's sudden coming is no ground for neglecting daily business; 
 that to do so would only bring scandal on the Church, and was contrary 
 to his own practice among them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:7-9">2Th 3:7-9</A>),

 and that the faithful must withdraw themselves from such disorderly 
 professors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:6,10-15">2Th 3:6, 10-15</A>).

 Thus, there are <I>three</I> divisions of the Epistle: (1)

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:1-12">2Th 1:1-12</A>.

 Commendations of the Thessalonians' faith, love, and patience, amidst 
 persecutions. (2)

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:1-17">2Th 2:1-17</A>.

 The error as to the immediate coming of Christ corrected, and the 
 previous rise and downfall of the Man of Sin foretold. (3)

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:1-16">2Th 3:1-16</A>.

 Exhortations to orderly conduct in their whole walk, with prayers for 
 them to the God of peace, followed by his autograph salutation and 
 benediction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 D<FONT SIZE=-1>ATE OF WRITING</FONT>.--AS the Epistle is written in the joint names of
 Timothy and Silas, as well as his own, and as these were with him while
 at Corinth, and not with him for a long time subsequently to his having
 left that city (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:18,Ac+19:22">Ac 18:18,
 with Ac 19:22</A>;

 indeed, as to Silas, it is doubtful whether he was ever subsequently
 with Paul), it follows, the <I>place</I> of writing must have been 
 Corinth, and the <I>date,</I> during the one "year and six months" of 
 his stay there,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:11">Ac 18:11</A>

 (namely, beginning with the autumn of <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 52, and 
 ending with the spring of <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 54), say about six 
 months after his first Epistle, early in <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 
 53.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 S<FONT SIZE=-1>TYLE</FONT>.--The style is not different from that of 
 most of Paul's other writings, except in the prophetic portion of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:1-12">2Th 2:1-12</A>),

 which is distinguished from them in subject matter. As is usual in his 
 more solemn passages (for instance, in the denunciatory and prophetic 
 portions of his Epistles, for example, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:8,16,2Th+2:3">Col 2:8, 16,
 with 2Th 2:3</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24-28,2Th+2:8,9">1Co 15:24-28,
 with 2Th 2:8, 9</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:18,2Th+2:8,10">Ro 1:18,
 with 2Th 2:8, 10</A>),

 his diction here is more lofty, abrupt, and elliptical.  As the former 
 Epistle dwells mostly on the second Advent in its aspect of glory to 
 the sleeping and the living saints

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:1-5:28">1Th 4:1-5:28</A>),

 so this Epistle dwells mostly on it in its aspect of everlasting 
 destruction to the wicked and him who shall be the final consummation 
 of wickedness, the Man of Sin. So far was Paul from laboring under an 
 erroneous impression as to Christ's speedy coming, when he wrote his 
 first Epistle (which rationalists impute to him), that he had 
 distinctly told them, when he was with them, the same truths as to the 
 apostasy being about first to arise, which he now insists upon in this 
 second Epistle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:5">2Th 2:5</A>).

 Several points of coincidence occur between the two Epistles,
 confirming the genuineness of the latter. Thus, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:2,1Th+2:15,16">2Th 3:2,
 with 1Th 2:15, 16</A>;

 again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:9">2Th 2:9</A>,

 the Man of Sin "coming after the working of Satan," with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:18,3:5">1Th 2:18; 3:5</A>,

 where Satan's incipient work as the <I>hinderer</I> of the Gospel, and
 the <I>tempter,</I> appears; again, mild <I>warning</I> is enjoined,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:14">1Th 5:14</A>;

 but, in this second Epistle, when the evil had grown worse, stricter 
 discipline

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:6,14">2Th 3:6, 14</A>):
 
 "withdraw from" the "company" of such.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Paul probably visited Thessalonica on his way to Asia subsequently

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:4">Ac 20:4</A>),

 and took with him thence Aristarchus and Secundus: the former became 
 his "companion in travel" and shared with him his perils at Ephesus, 
 also those of his shipwreck, and was his "fellow prisoner" at Rome

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:2,Col+4:10,Phile+1:24">Ac 27:2;
 Col 4:10; 
 Phm 24</A>).

 According to tradition he became bishop of Apamea.</P>

 They had prayed for the Thessalonians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:12">1Th 3:12</A>)

 that they might "increase and abound in love"; their prayer having been 
 heard, it is a small but a bounden return for them to make, to thank 
 God for it. Thus, Paul and his fellow missionaries practice what they 
 preach

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:18">1Th 5:18</A>).
 
 In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:3">1Th 1:3</A>,

 their thanksgiving was for the Thessalonians' faith, love, and 
 patience"; here, for their <I>exceeding growth</I> in <I>faith,</I> and 
 for their <I>charity abounding.</I> "We are bound" expresses the duty 
 of thanksgiving from its subjective side as an inward conviction. "As 
 it is meet," from the <I>objective:</I> side as something answering to 
 the state of circumstances [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. Observe the 
 exact correspondence of the prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:12">1Th 3:12</A>,

 "The Lord make you to abound in love") and the answer, "The love of 
 every one of you all toward each other aboundeth" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:10">1Th 4:10</A>).

 <B>4. glory in you</B>--make our boast of you, literally, "in your case."
 "Ourselves" implies that not merely did they hear others speaking of the
 Thessalonians' faith, but they, the missionaries <I>themselves,</I> boasted
 of it. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:8">1Th 1:8</A>,

 wherein the apostle said, their faith was so well known in various 
 places, that he and his fellow missionaries had no need to speak of it; 
 but here he says, so abounding is their love, combined with faith and 
 patience, that he and his fellow missionaries <I>themselves,</I> make 
 it a matter of glorying in the various churches elsewhere (he was now 
 at Corinth in Achaia, and boasted there of the faith of the Macedonian 
 churches,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:15-17,2Co+8:1">2Co 10:15-17; 8:1</A>,

 at the same time giving the glory to the Lord), not only looking
 forward to glorying thereat at Christ's coming

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:19">1Th 2:19</A>),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:3">1Th 1:3</A>,

 ground of their patience;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:5,7">2Th 1:5, 7</A>

 state the object of their hope, namely, the kingdom for which they 
 suffer.

 <B>tribulations</B>--literally, "pressures." The Jews were the instigators
 of the populace and of the magistrates against Christians

 <A NAME="2Th1_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. Which</B>--Your <I>enduring</I> these tribulations is a "token of the
 righteous judgment of God," manifested in your being enabled to endure
 them, and in your adversaries thereby filling up the measure of their
 guilt. The judgment is even now begun, but its consummation will be at
 the Lord's coming. David 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:1-14">Ps 73:1-14</A>)

 and Jeremiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:1-4">Jer 12:1-4</A>)

 were perplexed at the wicked prospering and the godly suffering. But 
 Paul, by the light of the New Testament, makes this fact a matter of 
 consolation. It is a <I>proof</I> (so the <I>Greek</I>) of the future 
 judgment, which will set to rights the anomalies of the present state, 
 by rewarding the now suffering saint, and by punishing the persecutor.  
 And even now "the Judge of all the earth does right"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:25">Ge 18:25</A>);
 
 for the godly are in themselves sinful and need chastisement to amend
 them. What they suffer unjustly at the hands of cruel men they suffer
 justly at the hands of God; and they have their evil things here that
 they may escape condemnation with the world and have their good things
 hereafter

 Php 1:29</A>). 

 "Worthy" implies that, though men are justified by faith, they shall be
 judged "according to their works"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:12">Re 20:12</A>;

 namely, "seeing that it is (literally, '<I>if at least,</I>' '<I>if at 
 all events it is</I>') a <I>righteous</I> thing with (that is, in the 
 estimation of) God" (which, as we all feel, it certainly is). Our own

 The <I>Greek</I> is literally, "relaxation"; loosening of the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:28">Mt 11:28</A>,

 "He whose essence and inheritance is perdition"

 Doubtless "the apostasy" of <I>Romanism</I> (the abstract) is one of

 Paul implies, shall even be more applicable to the man of sin, who is 
 the New Testament actual Antichrist, as Antiochus was the Old Testament 
 typical Antichrist. The previous world kingdoms had each one 
 extraordinary person as its representative head and embodiment (thus 
 Babylon had Nebuchadnezzar,

 end; Medo-Persia had Cyrus; Greece had Alexander, and Antiochus 
 Epiphanes, the forerunner of Antichrist); so the fourth and last world 
 kingdom, under which we now live, shall have one final head, the 
 concentrated embodiment of all the <I>sin</I> and <I>lawless 
 iniquity</I> which have been in pagan and papal Rome. Rome's final

 so the degenerate Church (become an "harlot"), allying itself with the 
 godless world power (the "beast" of Revelation) against vital religion 
 (that is, the harlot sitting on the beast), shall be judged by that 
 world power which shall be finally embodied in Antichrist

 Re 17:16, 17</A>). 

 In this early Epistle, the apostate Jewish Church as the harlot, and
 pagan Rome as the beast, form the historical background on which Paul 
 draws his prophetic sketch of the apostasy. In the Pastoral Epistles, 
 which were later, this prophecy appears in connection with Gnosticism, 
 which had at that time infected the Church. The harlot (the apostate 
 Church) is first to be judged by the beast (the world power) and its 
 kings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:16">Re 17:16</A>);

 and afterwards the beasts and their allies (with the personal 
 Antichrist at their head, who seems to rise after the judgment on the 
 harlot, or apostate Church) shall be judged by the coming of Jesus 
 Himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:20">Re 19:20</A>).

 Anti-Christian tendencies produce different Antichrists: these separate 
 Antichrists shall hereafter find their consummation in an individual 
 exceeding them all in the intensity of his evil character [A<FONT

 necessarily <I>a child of death,</I> immediately after his

 <I>Idolatry of self, spiritual pride,</I> and <I>rebellion against

 and <I>dependence on God,</I> characterize Christianity. He not merely

 The Pope (for instance, Clement VI) has even commanded the angels to 
 admit into Paradise, without the alleged pains of purgatory, certain 
 souls. But still this is only a foreshadowing of the Antichrist, who

 God.

 Antichrist, Mohammed, Rome, Napoleon, and modern infidel secularism,

 The earliest Fathers unanimously looked for a personal Antichrist. Two
 objections exist to Romanism being regarded <I>the</I> Antichrist,
 though probably Romanism will leave its <I>culmination</I> in him: (1)
 So far is Romanism from <I>opposing all that is called God,</I> that
 adoration of gods and lords many (the Virgin Mary and saints) is a
 leading feature in it; (2) the papacy has existed for more than twelve
 centuries, and yet Christ is not come, whereas the prophecy regards the
 final Antichrist as short-lived, and soon going to perdition through
 the coming of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:8,11">Re 17:8, 11</A>).

 Gregory the Great declared against the patriarch of Constantinople,
 that whosoever should assume the title of "universal bishop" would be 
 "the forerunner of Antichrist." The papacy fulfilled this his 
 undesigned prophecy. The Pope has been called by his followers, "Our 
 Lord God the Pope"; and at his inauguration in St.  Peter's, seated in 
 his chair upon the high altar, which is treated as his footstool, he 
 has vividly foreshadowed him who "exalteth himself above all that is 
 called God." An objection fatal to interpreting <I>the temple of

 then to sole empire above the secular power. The historical fact from
 which Paul starts in his prediction was probably the emperor Claudius'
 expulsion of the Jews, the representative of the anti-Christian

 <I>Greek,</I> "traditions"). The <I>Greek</I> verb from which the noun
 comes, is used by Paul in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=11Co+11:23,15:3">1Co 11:23; 15:3</A>.

 From the <I>three</I> passages in which "tradition" is used in a good
 sense, Rome has argued for her accumulation of <I>uninspired</I> 
 traditions, virtually overriding God's Word, while put forward as of 
 co-ordinate authority with it. She forgets the <I>ten</I> passages

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:2,3,6,Mk+7:3,5,8,9,13,Ga+1:14,Col+2:8">Mt 15:2, 3, 6;
 Mr 7:3, 5, 8, 9, 13; 
 Ga 1:14; 
 Col 2:8</A>) 

 stigmatizing <I>man's uninspired</I> traditions. Not even the apostles'
 sayings were all inspired (for example, Peter's dissimulation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:11-14">Ga 2:11-14</A>),

 but only when they claimed to be so, as in their words afterwards 
 embodied in their canonical writings. Oral inspiration was necessary in 
 their case, until the canon of the written Word should be complete; 
 they proved their possession of inspiration by miracles wrought in 
 support of the new revelation, which revelation, moreover, accorded 
 with the existing Old Testament revelation; an additional test needed 
 besides miracles (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:1-6,Ac+17:11">De 13:1-6;
 Ac 17:11</A>). 

 When the canon was complete, the infallibility of the living men was
 transferred to the written Word, now the sole unerring guide, 
 interpreted by the Holy Spirit. Little else has come down to us by the 
 most <I>ancient</I> and <I>universal</I> tradition save this, the 
 all-sufficiency of Scripture for salvation. Therefore, by tradition, we 
 are constrained to cast off all tradition not contained in, or not 
 provable by, Scripture. The Fathers are valuable <I>witnesses to 
 historical facts,</I> which give force to the <I>intimations</I> of 
 Scripture: such as the Christian Lord's day, the baptism of infants, 
 and the genuineness of the canon of Scripture. Tradition (in the sense 
 of <I>human testimony</I>) cannot establish a <I>doctrine,</I> but can 
 <I>authenticate a fact,</I> such as the facts just mentioned. Inspired 
 tradition, in Paul's sense, is not a supplementary oral tradition 
 completing <I>our</I> written Word, but it is identical with the 
 written Word <I>now</I> complete; then the latter not being complete, 
 the tradition was necessarily in part oral, in part written, and 
 continued so until, the latter being complete before the death of St. 
 John, the last apostle, the former was no longer needed. Scripture is, 
 according to Paul, the complete and sufficient rule in all that 
 appertains to making "the man of God <I>perfect, throughly 
 furnished</I> unto <I>all</I> good works"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:16,17">2Ti 3:16, 17</A>).

 It is by leaving Paul's God-inspired tradition for human traditions 
 that Rome has become the forerunner and parent of the Antichrist. It is 
 striking that, from this very chapter denouncing Antichrist, she should
 draw an argument for her "traditions" by which she fosters 
 anti-Christianity. Because the apostles' oral word was as trustworthy 
 as their written word, it by no means follows that the oral word of 
 those <I>not apostles</I> is as trustworthy as the <I>written</I> word 
 of those who were apostles or inspired evangelists. No tradition of the 
 apostles except their written word can be <I>proved</I> genuine on 
 satisfactory evidence. We are no more bound to accept implicitly the 
 Fathers' interpretations of Scripture, because we accept the Scripture 
 canon on their testimony, than we are bound to accept the Jews' 
 interpretation of the Old Testament, because we accept the Old 
 Testament canon on their testimony.

 In both Epistles they state they maintained themselves by labor; but in
