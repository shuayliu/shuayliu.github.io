 J<FONT SIZE=-1>ONAH</FONT> was the son of Amittai, of Gath-hepher in Zebulun (called
 Gittah-hepher in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:10-13">Jos 19:10-13</A>),

 so that he belonged to the kingdom of the ten tribes, not to Judah. His 
 date is to be gathered from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:25-27">2Ki 14:25-27</A>,

 "He (Jeroboam II) restored the coast of Israel from the entering of 
 Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the Lord God 
 of Israel, which He spake by the hand of His servant Jonah, the son of 
 Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gath-hepher. For the Lord saw the 
 affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter: for there was not any 
 shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel. And the Lord said not 
 that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but He 
 saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash." Now as this 
 prophecy of Jonah was given at a time when Israel was at the lowest 
 point of depression, when "there was not any shut up or left," that is, 
 confined or left at large, none to act as a helper for Israel, it 
 cannot have been given in Jeroboam's reign, which was marked by 
 prosperity, for in it Syria was worsted in fulfilment of the prophecy, 
 and Israel raised to its former "greatness." It must have been, 
 therefore, in the early part of the reign of Joash, Jeroboam's father, 
 who had found Israel in subjection to Syria, but had raised it by 
 victories which were followed up so successfully by Jeroboam. Thus 
 Jonah was the earliest of the prophets, and close upon Elisha, who died 
 in Joash's reign, having just before his death given a token 
 prophetical of the thrice defeat of Syria

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:14-21">2Ki 13:14-21</A>).

 Hosea and Amos prophesied also in the reign of Jeroboam II, but towards 
 the closing part of his forty-one years' reign. The transactions in the 
 Book of Jonah probably occurred in the latter part of his life; if so, 
 the book is not much older than part of the writings of Hosea and Amos.  
 The use of the third person is no argument against Jonah himself being 
 the writer: for the sacred writers in mentioning themselves do so in 
 the third person (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:26">Joh 19:26</A>).

 Nor is the use of the past tense

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:3">Jon 3:3</A>,

 "Now Nineveh <I>was</I> an exceeding great city") a proof that
 Nineveh's greatness was past when the Book of Jonah was being written; 
 it is simply used to carry on the negative uniformly,--"the word of the 
 Lord <I>came</I> to Jonah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so Jonah <I>arose</I> 
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now Nineveh <I>was,</I>" &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:1,3:3">Jon 1:1; 3:3</A>).

 The mention of its <I>greatness</I> proves rather that the book was
 written at an early date, <I>before</I> the Israelites had that 
 intimate knowledge of it which they must have had soon afterwards 
 through frequent Assyrian inroads.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As early as J<FONT SIZE=-1>ULIAN</FONT> and P<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ORPHYRY</FONT>, pagans ridiculed the credulity of Christians in 
 believing the deliverance of Jonah by a fish. Some infidels have 
 derived it from the heathen fable of the deliverance of Andromeda from 
 a sea monster by Perseus [A<FONT SIZE=-1>POLLODORUS</FONT>, <I>The 
 Library,</I> 2.4,3]; or from that of Arion the musician thrown into the 
 sea by sailors, and carried safe to shore on a dolphin [H<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ERODOTUS</FONT>, <I>History,</I> 1.24]; or from that of 
 Hercules, who sprang into the jaws of a sea monster, and was three days 
 in its belly, when he undertook to save Hesione [D<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>IODORUS</FONT> S<FONT SIZE=-1>ICULUS</FONT>, <I>Historical 
 Library,</I> 4.42; H<FONT SIZE=-1>OMER</FONT>, <I>The Iliad,</I> 
 20.145; 21.442]. Probably the heathen fables are, vice versa, 
 corruptions of the sacred narrative, if there be any connection.  
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> states that near Joppa lay rocks, pointed 
 out as those to which Andromeda was bound when exposed to the sea 
 monster. This fable implies the likelihood of the story of Jonah having 
 passed through the Ph&oelig;nicians in a corrupted form to Greece. That 
 the account of Jonah is history, and not parable (as rationalists
 represent), appears from our Lord's reference to it, in which the 
 <I>personal existence, miraculous fate,</I> and <I>prophetical 
 office</I> of Jonah are explicitly asserted: "No sign shall be given 
 but the <I>sign</I> of <I>the prophet</I> Jonas: for, as Jonas was 
 three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of 
 man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:39,40">Mt 12:39, 40</A>).

 The Lord recognizes his being in the belly of the fish as a "sign," 
 that is, a real miracle, typical of a similar event in His own history; 
 and assumes the execution of the prophet's commission to Nineveh, "The 
 men of Nineveh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. repented at the preaching of Jonas; and 
 behold, a greater than Jonas is here"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:41">Mt 12:41</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It seemed strange to K<FONT SIZE=-1>IMCHI</FONT>, a Jew himself, that the Book of Jonah
 is among the Scriptures, as the only prophecy in it concerns Nineveh, a
 heathen city, and makes no mention of Israel, which is referred to by
 every other prophet. The reason seems to be: a tacit reproof of Israel
 is intended; a heathen people were ready to repent at the first
 preaching of the prophet, a stranger to them; but Israel, who boasted
 of being God's elect, repented not, though warned by their own prophets
 at all seasons. This was an anticipatory streak of light before the
 dawn of the full "light to lighten the Gentiles" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:32">Lu 2:32</A>).

 Jonah is himself a strange paradox: a prophet of God, and yet a runaway 
 from God: a man drowned, and yet alive: a preacher of repentance, yet 
 one that repines at repentance. Yet Jonah, saved from the jaws of death 
 himself on repentance, was the fittest to give a hope to Nineveh, 
 doomed though it was, of a merciful respite on its repentance. The 
 patience and pity of God stand in striking contrast with the 
 selfishness and hard-heartedness of man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Nineveh in particular was chosen to teach Israel these lessons, on
 account of its being capital of the then world kingdom, and because it
 was now beginning to make its power felt by Israel. Our Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:41">Mt 12:41</A>)

 makes Nineveh's repentance a reproof of the Jews' impenitence in His 
 day, just as Jonah provoked Israel to jealousy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:21">De 32:21</A>)

 by the same example. Jonah's mission to Nineveh implied that a heathen 
 city afforded as legitimate a field for the prophet's labors as Israel, 
 and with a more successful result (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:7">Am 9:7</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The book is prose narrative throughout, except the prayer of
 thanksgiving in the second chapter 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:1-9">Jon 2:1-9</A>).

 The Chald&aelig;isms in the original do not prove spuriousness, or a 
 later age, but were natural in the language of one living in Zebulun on 
 the borders of the north, whence <I>Aramaic</I> peculiarities would 
 readily arise; moreover, his message to Nineveh implies acquaintance 
 with Assyrian. Living as Jonah did in a part of Israel exposed to 
 Assyrian invasions, he probably stood in the same relation to Assyria 
 as Elijah and Elisha had stood to Syria. The purity of the language 
 implies the antiquity of the book, and the likelihood of its being 
 Jonah's own writing. Indeed, none but Jonah could have written or 
 dictated such peculiar details, known only to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The tradition that places the tomb of Jonah opposite to Mosul, and
 names it "Nebbi Junus" (that is, "prophet Jonah"), originated probably
 in the spot having been occupied by a Christian church or convent
 dedicated to him [L<FONT SIZE=-1>AYARD</FONT>]. A more ancient tradition of
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME'S</FONT> time
 placed the tomb in Jonah's native village of Gath-hepher.</P>

 <B>2. to Nineveh</B>--east of the Tigris, opposite the modern Mosul. The only
 case of a prophet being sent to the heathen. Jonah, however, is sent to
 Nineveh, not solely for Nineveh's good, but also to shame <I>Israel,</I> by
 the fact of a heathen city repenting at the first preaching of a single
 stranger, Jonah, whereas God's people will not repent, though preached
 to by their many national prophets, late and early. Nineveh means "the
 residence of Ninus," that is, Nimrod.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:11">Ge 10:11</A>,

 where the translation ought to be, "<I>He</I> (Nimrod) went forth
 <I>into Assyria</I> and builded Nineveh." Modern research into the 
 cuneiform inscriptions confirms the Scripture account that Babylon was 
 founded earlier than Nineveh, and that both cities were built by 
 descendants of Ham, encroaching on the territory assigned to Shem

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:2">Jon 4:2</A>:

 fear that after venturing on such a dangerous commission to so powerful 
 a heathen city, his prophetical threats should be set aside by God's 
 "repenting of the evil," just as God had so long spared Israel 
 notwithstanding so many provocations, and so he should seem a false 
 prophet. Besides, he may have felt it beneath him to discharge a 
 commission to a foreign idolatrous nation, whose destruction he desired 
 rather than their repentance. This is the only case of a prophet, 
 charged with a prophetical message, concealing it.

 Jonah thought in fleeing from the land of Israel, where Jehovah was 
 peculiarly present, that he should escape from Jehovah's 
 prophecy-inspiring influence. He probably knew the truth stated in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:7-10">Ps 139:7-10</A>,

 but virtually ignored it (compare

 Guilty Jonah's indifference to fear contrasts with the unoffending
 mariners' alarm. The original therefore is in the nominative absolute: 
 "But <I>as for Jonah,</I> he," &c. Compare spiritually,

 Primitive tradition and natural conscience led even the heathen to
 believe that one guilty man involves all his associates, though 
 innocent, in punishment. So C<FONT SIZE=-1>ICERO</FONT> [<I>The Nature 
 of the Gods,</I> 3.37] mentions that the mariners sailing with 
 Diagoras, an atheist, attributed a storm that overtook them to his 
 presence in the ship (compare H<FONT SIZE=-1>ORACE'S</FONT>

 "sea," and the "land." Jehovah is the one and only true God of all 
 alike. Jonah at last is awakened by the violent remedy from his 
 lethargy. Jonah was but the reflection of Israel's backsliding from 
 God, and so must bear the righteous punishment. The guilt of the
 minister is the result of that of the people, as in Moses' case

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:21">De 4:21</A>).

 Jonah also herein is a specimen of true repentance, which leads the

 In the case of the Antitype, Pontius Pilate washed his hands and

 the sailors innocent, Christ our sacrificial victim was innocent and 
 Pontius Pilate and nil of us men were guilty.  But by <I>imputation</I>

 Respiration in such a position could only be by miracle. The miraculous 
 interposition was not without a sufficient reason; it was calculated to 
 affect not only Jonah, but also Nineveh and Israel. The life of a 
 prophet was often marked by experiences which made him, through 
 sympathy, best suited for discharging the prophetical function to his 
 hearers and his people. The infinite resources of God in mercy as well 
 as judgment are prefigured in the devourer being transformed into 
 Jonah's preserver. Jonah's condition under punishment, shut out from 
 the outer world, was rendered as much as possible the emblem of death, 
 a present type to Nineveh and Israel, of the death in sin, as his 
 deliverance was of the spiritual resurrection on repentance; as also, a 
 future type of Jesus' literal death for sin, and resurrection by the 
 Spirit of God.

 Jonah was thus the fittest instrument for proclaiming judgment, and yet 
 hope of mercy on repentance to Nineveh, being himself a living 
 exemplification of both--judgment in his entombment in the fish, mercy 
 on repentance in his deliverance. Israel professing to obey, but not 
 obeying, and so doomed to exile in the same Nineveh, answers to the son 
 who said, "I go, sir, and went not." In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:30">Lu 11:30</A>

 it is said that Jonas was not only a sign to the men in Christ's time, 
 but also "unto the Ninevites." On the latter occasion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:1-4">Mt 16:1-4</A>)

 when the Pharisees and Sadducees tempted Him, asking a sign <I>from 
 heaven,</I> He answered, "No sign shall be given, but the sign of the 
 prophet Jonas,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:39">Mt 12:39</A>.

 Thus the sign had a <I>twofold</I> aspect, a direct bearing on the 
 Ninevites, an indirect bearing on the Jews in Christ's time. To the 
 Ninevites he was not merely a prophet, but himself a wonder in the 
 earth, as one who had tasted of death, and yet had not seen corruption, 
 but had now returned to witness among them for God. If the Ninevites 
 had indulged in a captious spirit, they never would have inquired and 
 so known Jonah's wonderful history; but being humbled by God's awful 
 message, they learned from Jonah himself that it was the previous 
 concealing in his bosom of the same message of their own doom that 
 caused him to be entombed as an outcast from the living.  Thus he was a 
 "sign" to them of wrath on the one hand, and, on the other, of mercy. 
 Guilty Jonah saved from the jaws of death gives a ray of hope to guilty 
 Nineveh. Thus God, who brings good from evil, made Jonah in his fall, 
 punishment, and restoration, a sign (an <I>embodied lesson</I> or 
 <I>living symbol</I>) through which the Ninevites were roused to hear 
 and repent, as they would not have been likely to do, had he gone on 
 the first commission before his living entombment and resurrection. To 
 do evil that good may come, is a policy which can only come from Satan; 
 but from evil already done to extract an instrument against the kingdom 
 of darkness, is a triumphant display of the grace and wisdom of God. To 
 the Pharisees in Christ's time, who, not content with the many signs 
 exhibited by Him, still demanded a sign <I>from heaven,</I> He gave a 
 sign in the opposite quarter, namely, Jonah, who came "out of the belly 
 of <I>hell</I>" (the unseen region). They looked for a Messiah 
 gloriously coming in the clouds of <I>heaven;</I> the Messiah, on the 
 contrary, is to pass through a like, though a deeper, humiliation than 
 Jonah; He is to lie "in the heart of <I>the earth.</I>" Jonah and his 
 Antitype alike appeared low and friendless among their hearers; both 
 victims to death for God's wrath against sin, both preaching 
 repentance. Repentance derives all its efficacy from the death of 
 Christ, just as Jonah's message derived its weight with the Ninevites 
 from his entombment. The Jews stumbled at Christ's death, the very fact 
 which ought to have led them to Him, as Jonah's entombment attracted 
 the Ninevites to his message. As Jonah's restoration gave hope of God's 
 placability to Nineveh, so Christ's resurrection assures us God is 
 fully reconciled to man by Christ's death. But Jonah's entombment only 
 had the effect of a <I>moral suasive;</I> Christ's death is an
 <I>efficacious instrument</I> of reconciliation between God and man 
 [F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>].

 <B>Nineveh was an exceeding great city</B>--literally, "great to God,"
 that is, before God. All greatness was in the Hebrew mind associated 
 with G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>; hence arose the idiom (compare "great 
 mountains," <I>Margin,</I> "mountains of God,"

 <B>three days' journey</B>--that is, about sixty miles, allowing about twenty
 miles for a day's journey. Jonah's statement is confirmed by heathen
 writers, who describe Nineveh as four hundred eighty stadia in
 circumference [D<FONT SIZE=-1>IODORUS</FONT>
 S<FONT SIZE=-1>ICULUS</FONT>, 2.3].
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ERODOTUS</FONT> defines a day's journey
 to be one hundred fifty stadia; so three days' journey will not be much
 below D<FONT SIZE=-1>IODORUS'</FONT> estimate. The parallelogram in Central Assyria covered
 with remains of buildings has Khorsabad northeast; Koyunjik and Nebbi
 Yunus near the Tigris, northwest; Nimroud, between the Tigris and the
 Zab, southwest; and Karamless, at a distance inward from the Zab,
 southeast. From Koyunjik to Nimroud is about eighteen miles; from
 Khorsabad to Karamless, the same; from Koyunjik to Khorsabad, thirteen
 or fourteen miles; from Nimroud to Karamless, fourteen miles. The length
 thus was greater than the breadth; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:4">Jon 3:4</A>,

 "a day's journey," which is confirmed by heathen writers and by modern 
 measurements. The walls were a hundred feet high, and broad enough to 
 allow three chariots abreast, and had moreover fifteen hundred lofty 
 towers. The space between, including large parks and arable ground, as 
 well as houses, was Nineveh in its full extent. The oldest palaces are 
 at Nimroud, which was probably the original site.  L<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>AYARD</FONT> latterly has thought that the name Nineveh 
 belonged originally to Koyunjik, rather than to Nimroud. Jonah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:11">Jon 4:11</A>)

 mentions the children as numbering one hundred twenty thousand, which 
 would give about a million to the whole population. Existing ruins show 
 that Nineveh acquired its greatest extent under the kings of the second 
 dynasty, that is, the kings mentioned in Scripture; it was then that 
 Jonah visited it, and the reports of its magnificence were carried to 
 the west [L<FONT SIZE=-1>AYARD</FONT>].</P>

 <B>4. a day's journey</B>--not going straight forward without stopping: for
 the city was but eighteen miles in length; but stopping in his progress
 from time to time to announce his message to the crowds gathering about
 him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown</B>--The commission, given
 indefinitely at his setting out, assumes now on his arrival a definite
 form, and that severer than before. It is no longer a cry against the
 sins of Nineveh, but an announcement of its ruin in forty days. This
 number is in Scripture associated often with humiliation. It was forty
 days that Moses, Elijah, and Christ fasted. Forty years elapsed from the
 beginning of Christ's ministry (the antitype of Jonah's) to the
 destruction of Jerusalem. The more definite form of the denunciation
 implies that Nineveh has now almost filled up the measure of her guilt.
 The change in the form which the Ninevites would hear from Jonah on
 anxious inquiry into his history, would alarm them the more, as implying
 the increasing nearness and certainty of their doom, and would at the
 same time reprove Jonah for his previous guilt in delaying to warn them.
 The very solitariness of the one message announced by the stranger thus
 suddenly appearing among them, would impress them with the more awe.
 Learning from him, that so far from lightly prophesying evil against
 them, he had shrunk from announcing a less severe denunciation, and
 therefore had been cast into the deep and only saved by miracle, they
 felt how imminent was their peril, threatened as they now were by a
 prophet whose fortunes were so closely bound up with theirs. In Noah's
 days one hundred twenty years of warning were given to men, yet they
 repented not till the flood came, and it was too late. But in the case
 of Nineveh, God granted a double mercy: first, that its people should
 repent immediately after threatening; second, that pardon should
 immediately follow their repentance.</P>

 Their acting on a vague possibility of God's mercy, without any special 
 ground of encouragement, is the more remarkable instance of faith, as 
 they had to break through long-rooted prejudices in giving up idols to 
 seek Jehovah at all. The only ground which their ready faith rested on, 
 was the fact of God sending one to warn them, instead of destroying 
 them at once; this suggested the thought of a possibility of pardon. 
 Hence they are cited by Christ as about to condemn in the judgment 
 those who, with much greater light and privileges, yet repent not

 <B>10. God repented of the evil</B>--When the message was sent to them, they
 were so ripe for judgment that a purpose of destruction to take effect
 in forty days was the only word God's righteous abhorrence of sin
 admitted of as to them. But when they repented, the position in which
 they stood towards God's righteousness was altered. So God's mode of
 dealing with them must alter accordingly, if God is not to be
 inconsistent with His own immutable character of dealing with men
 according to their works and state of heart, taking vengeance at last on
 the hardened impenitent, and delighting to show mercy on the penitent.
 Compare Abraham's reasoning,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:25,Eze+18:21-25,Jer+18:7-10">Ge 18:25;
 Eze 18:21-25; 
 Jer 18:7-10</A>.

 What was really a change <I>in them</I> and in God's corresponding
 dealings is, in condescension to human conceptions, represented as a 
 change in God (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:14">Ex 32:14</A>),

 who, in His essential righteousness and mercy, changeth not

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:19,1Sa+15:29,Mal+3:6,Jam+1:17">Nu 23:19;
 1Sa 15:29; 
 Mal 3:6; 
 Jas 1:17</A>). 

 The reason why the announcement of destruction was made absolute, and
 not dependent on Nineveh's continued impenitence, was that this form 
 was the only one calculated to rouse them; and at the same time it was 
 a <I>truthful</I> representation of God's purpose towards Nineveh under 
 its existing state, and of Nineveh's due. When that state ceased, a new 
 relation of Nineveh to God, not contemplated in the message, came in, 
 and room was made for the word to take effect, "the curse causeless 
 shall not come" [F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>]. Prophecy is not 
 merely for the sake of proving God's omniscience by the verification of 
 predictions of the future, but is mainly designed to vindicate God's 
 justice and mercy in dealing with the impenitent and penitent 
 respectively

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:22">Ro 11:22</A>).
 
 The Bible ever assigns the first place to the eternal principles of
 righteousness, rooted in the character of God, subordinating to them all
 divine arrangements. God's sparing Nineveh, when in the jaws of
 destruction, on the first dawn of repentance encourages the timid
 penitent, and shows beforehand that Israel's doom, soon after
 accomplished, is to be ascribed, not to unwillingness to forgive on
 God's part, but to their own obstinate impenitence.</P>

 <I>vexation,</I> rather than <I>anger</I>
 [F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>]. How sad the contrast between God's
 feeling on the repentance of Nineveh towards Him, and Jonah's feeling on
 the repentance of God towards Nineveh. Strange in one who was himself a
 monument of mercy on his repentance! We all, like him, need the lesson
 taught in the parable of the unforgiving, though forgiven, debtor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:23-35">Mt 18:23-35</A>).

 Jonah was grieved because Nineveh's preservation, after his 
 denunciation, made him seem a false prophet [C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>]. But it would make Jonah a demon, not a man, to 
 have preferred the destruction of six hundred thousand men rather than 
 that his prophecy should be set aside through God's mercy triumphing 
 over judgment. And God in that case would have severely chastised, 
 whereas he only expostulates mildly with him, and by a mode of dealing, 
 at once gentle and condescending, tries to show him his error. 
 Moreover, Jonah himself, in apologizing for his vexation, does not 
 mention <I>the failure of his prediction</I> as the cause: but solely 
 the thought of God's <I>slowness to anger.</I> This was what led him to 
 flee to Tarshish at his first commission; not the likelihood 
 <I>then</I> of his prediction being falsified; for in fact his 
 commission then was not to foretell Nineveh's downfall, but simply to 
 "cry against" Nineveh's "wickedness" as having "come up before God." 
 Jonah could hardly have been so vexed for the letter of his prediction 
 failing, when the end of his commission had virtually been gained in 
 leading Nineveh to repentance. This then cannot have been regarded by 
 Jonah as the <I>ultimate</I> end of his commission. If Nineveh had been 
 the prominent object with him, he would have rejoiced at the result of 
 his mission. But Israel was the prominent aim of Jonah, as a prophet of 
 the elect people. Probably then he regarded the destruction of Nineveh 
 as fitted to be an example of God's judgment at last suspending His 
 long forbearance so as to startle Israel from its desperate degeneracy, 
 heightened by its new prosperity under Jeroboam II at that very time, 
 in a way that all other means had failed to do. Jonah, despairing of 
 anything effectual being done for God in Israel, unless there were 
 first given a striking example of severity, thought when he proclaimed 
 the downfall of Nineveh in forty days, that now at last God is about to 
 give such an example; so when this means of awakening Israel was set 
 aside by God's mercy on Nineveh's repentance, he was bitterly 
 disappointed, not from pride or mercilessness, but from hopelessness as 
 to anything being possible for the reformation of Israel, now that his 
 cherished hope is baffled. But G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD'S</FONT> plan was to 
 teach Israel, by the example of Nineveh, how inexcusable is their own 
 impenitence, and how inevitable their ruin if they persevere. Repenting 
 Nineveh has proved herself more worthy of God's favor than apostate 
 Israel; the children of the covenant have not only fallen down to, but 
 actually below, the level of a heathen people; Israel, therefore, must 
 go down, and the heathen rise above her. Jonah did not know the 
 important lessons of hope to the penitent, and condemnation to those 
 amidst outward privileges impenitent, which Nineveh's preservation on 
 repentance was to have for aftertimes, and to all ages. He could not 
 foresee that Messiah Himself was thus to apply that history. A lesson 
 to us that if we <I>could</I> in any particular alter the plan of 
 Providence, it would not be for the better, but for the worse [F<FONT

 station, he lodged in the booth. As a stranger, he did not know the

 standpoint he knew that chastening judgments often followed, as in
 David's case

 <B>10, 11.</B> The main lesson of the book. If Jonah so pities a plant which
 cost him no toil to rear, and which is so short lived and valueless,
 much more must Jehovah pity those hundreds of thousands of immortal men
 and women in great Nineveh whom He has made with such a display of
 creative power, especially when many of them repent, and seeing that, if
 all in it were destroyed, "more than six score thousand" of
 <I>unoffending</I> children, besides "much cattle," would be involved in
 the common destruction: Compare the same argument drawn from God's
 justice and mercy in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:23-33">Ge 18:23-33</A>.

 A similar illustration from the insignificance of a plant, which 
 "to-day is and to-morrow is cast into the oven," and which,
 nevertheless, is clothed by God with surpassing beauty, is given by 
 Christ to prove that God will care for the infinitely more precious 
 bodies and souls of men who are to live for ever

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:28-30">Mt 6:28-30</A>).

 One soul is of more value than the whole world; surely, then, one soul 
 is of more value than many gourds. The point of comparison spiritually 
 is the <I>need</I> which Jonah, for the time being, had of the foliage 
 of the gourd. However he might dispense with it at other times, now it 
 was necessary for his comfort, and almost for his life. So now that 
 Nineveh, as a city, fears God and turns to Him, God's cause needs it, 
 and would suffer by its overthrow, just as Jonah's material well-being 
 suffered by the withering of the gourd. If there were any hope of 
 Israel's being awakened by Nineveh's destruction to fulfil her high 
 destination of being a light to surrounding heathenism, then there 
 would not have been the same need to God's cause of Nineveh's 
 preservation, (though there would have always been need of saving the 
 penitent). But as Israel, after judgments, now with returning 
 prosperity turns back to apostasy, the means <I>needed</I> to vindicate 
 God's cause, and provoke Israel, if possible, to jealousy, is the 
 example of the great capital of heathendom suddenly repenting at the 
 first warning, and consequently being spared. Thus Israel would see the 
 kingdom of heaven transplanted from its ancient seat to another which 
 would willingly yield its spiritual fruits. The tidings which Jonah 
 brought back to his countrymen of Nineveh's repentance and rescue, 
 would, if believingly understood, be far more fitted than the news of 
 its overthrow to recall Israel to the service of God. Israel failed to 
 learn the lesson, and so was cast out of her land. But even this was 
 not an unmitigated evil.  Jonah was a type, as of Christ, so also of 
 Israel. Jonah, though an outcast, was highly honored of God in Nineveh; 
 so Israel's outcast condition would prove no impediment to her serving 
 God's cause still, if only she was faithful to God. Ezekiel and Daniel 
 were so at Babylon; and the Jews, scattered in all lands as witnesses 
 for the one true God, pioneered the way for Christianity, so that it 
 spread with a rapidity which otherwise was not likely to have attended 
 it [F<FONT SIZE=-1>AIRBAIRN</FONT>].</P>

 close of the book is more strikingly suggestive than if the thought had
 been followed out in detail.</P>
