 <B>2-5. Then Solomon spake unto all Israel</B>--The heads, or leading
 officers, who are afterwards specified, were summoned to attend their
 sovereign in a solemn religious procession. The date of this occurrence
 was the second year of Solomon's reign, and the high place at Gibeon
 was chosen for the performance of the sacred rites, because the
 tabernacle and all the ancient furniture connected with the national
 worship were deposited there. Zadok was the officiating high priest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:39">1Ch 16:39</A>).

 David had made for it at Jerusalem

 But the brazen altar, "before the tabernacle of the Lord," on which the
 burnt offerings were appointed by the law to be made, was at Gibeon.
 And although David had been led by extraordinary events and tokens of
 the divine presence to sacrifice on the threshing-floor of Araunah,
 Solomon considered it his duty to present his offerings on the legally
 appointed spot "before the tabernacle," and on the time-honored altar
 prepared by the skill of Bezaleel in the wilderness

 <B>14. Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen</B>--His passion for horses
 was greater than that of any Israelitish monarch before or after him.
 His stud comprised fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand
 horses. This was a prohibited indulgence, whether as an instrument of
 luxury or power. But it was not merely for his own use that he imported
 the horses of Egypt. The immense equestrian establishment he erected
 was not for show merely, but also for profit. The Egyptian breed of
 horses was highly valued; and being as fine as the Arabian, but larger
 and more powerful, they were well fitted for being yoked in chariots.
 These were light but compact and solid vehicles, without springs. From
 the price stated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:17">2Ch 1:17</A>)

 as given for a chariot and a horse, it appears that the chariot cost 
 four times the value of a horse. A horse brought a 150 shekels, which, 
 estimating the shekels at 2<I>s.</I> 3<I>d.</I> or 2<I>s.</I>
 6<I>d.</I>, amount to &pound;17 2<I>s.</I> or &pound;18 15<I>s.</I>,
 while a chariot brought 600 shekels, equal to &pound;68
 9<I>s.</I> or &pound;75; and as an Egyptian chariot was usually drawn
 by two horses, a chariot and pair would cost &pound;112 sterling.  As
 the Syrians, who were fond of the Egyptian breed of horses, could
 import them into their own country only through Judea, Solomon early
 perceived the commercial advantages to be derived from this trade, and
 established a monopoly. His factors or agents purchased them in the
 markets or fairs of Egypt and brought them to the "chariot cities," the
 depots and stables he had erected on the frontiers of his kingdom, such
 as Bethmarcaboth, "the house of chariots," and Hazarsusah, "the village
 of horses"

 this narrative, while the palace--here and in other parts of this
 book--is only incidentally noticed. The duty of building the temple was
 reserved for Solomon before his birth. As soon as he became king, he
 addressed himself to the work, and the historian, in proceeding to give
 an account of the edifice, begins with relating the preliminary
 arrangements.</P>

 <B>3-6. Solomon sent to Huram</B>--The correspondence was probably conducted
 on both sides in writing 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:11">2Ch 2:11</A>;

 also see on

 <A HREF="JFB11.htm#1Ki5_8">1Ki 5:8</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>As thou didst deal with David my father</B>--This would seem decisive of
 the question whether the Huram then reigning in Tyre was David's friend
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB11.htm#1Ki5_1">1Ki 5:1-6</A>).

 In opening the business, Solomon grounded his request for Tyrian aid on 
 two reasons: 1. The temple he proposed to build must be a solid and 
 permanent building because the worship was to be continued in 
 perpetuity; and therefore the building materials must be of the most 
 durable quality. 2. It must be a magnificent structure because it was 
 to be dedicated to the God who was greater than all gods; and, 
 therefore, as it might seem a presumptuous idea to erect an edifice for 
 a Being "whom the heaven and the heaven of heavens do not contain," it 
 was explained that Solomon's object was not to build a house for Him to 
 dwell in, but a temple in which His worshippers might offer sacrifices 
 to His honor. No language could be more humble and appropriate than 
 this. The pious strain of sentiment was such as became a king of 
 Israel.</P>

 <B>7. Send me now therefore a man cunning to work</B>--Masons and carpenters
 were not asked for. Those whom David had obtained 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+14:1">1Ch 14:1</A>)

 were probably still remaining in Jerusalem, and had instructed others. 
 But he required a master of works; a person capable, like Bezaleel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:31">Ex 35:31</A>),

 of superintending and directing every department; for, as the division 
 of labor was at that time little known or observed, an overseer had to 
 be possessed of very versatile talents and experience.  The things 
 specified, in which he was to be skilled, relate not to the building, 
 but the furniture of the temple. Iron, which could not be obtained in 
 the wilderness when the tabernacle was built, was now, through 
 intercourse with the coast, plentiful and much used. The cloths 
 intended for curtains were, from the crimson or scarlet-red and 
 hyacinth colors named, evidently those stuffs, for the manufacture and 
 dyeing of which the Tyrians were so famous. "The graving," probably, 
 included embroidery of figures like cherubim in needlework, as well as 
 wood carving of pomegranates and other ornaments.</P>

 <A NAME="2Ch2_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8. Send me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cedar trees,</B> &c.--The cedar and 
 cypress were valued as being both rare and durable; the algum or almug 
 trees (likewise a foreign wood), though not found on Lebanon, are 
 mentioned as being procured through Huram (see on

 <A HREF="JFB11.htm#1Ki10_11">1Ki 10:11</A>).</P>

 frequent meal with the laboring people in the East (compare
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:11">1Ki 5:11</A>).

 There is no discrepancy between that passage and this.  The yearly 
 supplies of wine and oil, mentioned in the former, were intended for 
 Huram's court in return for the cedars sent him; while the articles of 
 meat and drink specified here were for the workmen on Lebanon.</P>

 <B>1. Mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David</B>--These words 
 seem to intimate that the region where the temple was built was
 <I>previously</I> known by the name of Moriah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:2">Ge 22:2</A>),

 and do not afford sufficient evidence for affirming, as has been done
 [S<FONT SIZE=-1>TANLEY</FONT>], that the name was <I>first</I> given to 
 the mount, <I>in consequence</I> of the vision seen by David. Mount
 Moriah was one summit of a range of hills which went under the general 
 name of Zion. The platform of the temple is now, and has long been, 
 occupied by the haram, or sacred enclosure, within which stand the 
 three mosques of Omar (the smallest), of El Aksa, which in early times 
 was a Christian church, and of Kubbet el Sakhara, "The dome of the 
 rock," so called from a huge block of limestone rock in the center of 
 the floor, which, it is supposed, formed the elevated threshing-floor 
 of Araunah, and on which the great brazen altar stood.  The site of the 
 temple, then, is so far established for an almost universal belief is 
 entertained in the authenticity of the tradition regarding the rock El 
 Sakhara; and it has also been conclusively proved that the area of the 
 temple was identical on its western, eastern, and southern sides with 
 the present enclosure of the haram [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>].  
 "That the temple was situated <I>somewhere</I> within the oblong 
 enclosure on Mount Moriah, all topographers are agreed, although there 
 is not the slightest vestige of the sacred fane now remaining; and the 
 greatest diversity of sentiment prevails as to its exact position 
 within that large area, whether in the center of the haram, or in its 
 southwest corner" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ARCLAY</FONT>]. Moreover, the full 
 extent of the temple area is a problem that remains to be solved, for 
 the platform of Mount Moriah being too narrow for the extensive 
 buildings and courts attached to the sacred edifice, Solomon resorted 
 to artificial means of enlarging and levelling it, by erecting vaults, 
 which, as J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> states, rested on immense 
 earthen mounds raised from the slope of the hill. It should be borne in 
 mind at the outset that the grandeur of the temple did not consist in 
 its colossal structure so much as in its internal splendor, and the 
 vast courts and buildings attached to it. It was not intended for the 
 reception of a worshipping assembly, for the people always stood in the 
 outer courts of the sanctuary.</P>

 <B>3. these <I>are the things wherein</I> Solomon was instructed for the
 building of the house of God</B>--by the written plan and specifications
 given him by his father. The measurements are reckoned by cubits,
 "after the first measure," that is, the old Mosaic standard. But there
 is great difference of opinion about this, some making the cubit
 eighteen, others twenty-one inches. The temple, which embodied in more
 solid and durable materials the ground-form of the tabernacle (only
 being twice as large), was a rectangular building, seventy cubits long
 from east to west, and twenty cubits wide from north to south.</P>

 portico would thus be from thirty to thirty-five feet long, and from
 fifteen to seventeen and a half feet broad.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the height was an hundred and twenty cubits</B>--This, taking the cubit at
 eighteen inches, would be one hundred eighty feet; at twenty-one
 inches, two hundred ten feet; so that the porch would rise in the form
 of a tower, or two pyramidal towers, whose united height was one
 hundred twenty cubits, and each of them about ninety or one hundred
 five feet high [S<FONT SIZE=-1>TIEGLITZ</FONT>].

 after all, that these were stones with veins of different colors for
 decorating the walls. This was an ancient and thoroughly Oriental kind
 of embellishment. There was an under pavement of marble, which was
 covered with planks of fir. The whole interior was lined with boards,
 richly decorated with carved work, clusters of foliage and flowers,
 among which the pomegranate and lotus (or water-lily) were conspicuous;
 and overlaid, excepting the floor, with gold, either by gilding or in

 in this passage no less than three thousand are stated. It has been 
 suggested that there is here a statement not merely of the quantity of 
 water which the basin held, but that also which was necessary to work 
 it, to keep it flowing as a fountain; that which was required to fill 
 both it and its accompaniments. In support of this view, it may be 
 remarked that different words are employed: the one in

 such as this, a full choir was required, and their station was taken

 occupied the central place, the family of Asaph stood on his right, and
 that of Jeduthun on his left; the place allotted to the vocal
 department was a space between the court of Israel and the altar in the
 east end of the priests' court.

 the ritual. The number of trumpets used in the divine service could not
 be less than two

 and their greatest number never exceeded the precedent set at the 
 dedication of the temple. The station where the priests were sounding 
 with trumpets was apart from that of the other musicians; for while the 
 Levite singers occupied an orchestra east of the altar, the priests 
 stood at the marble table on the southwest of the altar. There both of 
 them stood with their faces to the altar. The manner of blowing the 
 trumpets was, first, by a long plain blast, then by one with breakings 
 and quaverings, and then by a long plain blast again [B<FONT

 suggested by the remarkable incident recorded at the close of the last
 chapter: the phenomenon of a densely opaque and uniformly shaped cloud,
 descending in a slow and majestic manner and filling the whole area of
 the temple. He regarded it himself, and directed the people also to
 regard it, as an undoubted sign and welcome pledge of the divine
 presence and acceptance of the building reared to His honor and
 worship. He referred not to any particular declaration of God, but to
 the cloud having been all along in the national history of Israel the
 recognized symbol of the divine presence

 <B>13. Solomon had made a brazen scaffold</B>--a sort of platform. But the
 <I>Hebrew</I> term rendered "scaffold," being the same as that used to
 designate the basin, suggests the idea that this throne might bear some
 resemblance, in form or structure, to those lavers in the temple, being
 a sort of round and elevated pulpit, placed in the middle of the court,
 and in front of the altar of burnt offering.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees</B>--After ascending the
 brazen scaffold, he assumed those two attitudes in succession, and with
 different objects in view. He stood while he addressed and blessed the
 surrounding multitude 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+6:3-11">2Ch 6:3-11</A>).

 Afterwards he knelt down and stretched out his hands towards heaven, 
 with his face probably turned towards the altar, while he gave 
 utterance to the beautiful and impressive prayer which is recorded in 
 the remainder of this chapter.  It is deserving of notice that there 
 was no seat in this pulpit--for the king either stood or knelt all the 
 time he was in it. It is not improbable that it was surmounted by a 
 canopy, or covered by a veil, to screen the royal speaker from the rays 
 of the sun.</P>

 <B>18-21. how much less this house which I have built! Have respect
 therefore to the prayer of thy servant</B>--No person who entertains just
 and exalted views of the spiritual nature of the Divine Being will
 suppose that he can raise a temple for the habitation of Deity, as a
 man builds a house for himself. Nearly as improper and inadmissible is
 the idea that a temple can contribute to enhance the glory of God, as a
 monument may be raised in honor of a great man. Solomon described the
 true and proper use of the temple, when he entreated that the Lord
 would "hearken unto the supplications of His servant and His people
 Israel, which they should make towards this place." In short, the grand
 purpose for which the temple was erected was precisely the same as that
 contemplated by churches--to afford the opportunity and means of public
 and social worship, according to the ritual of the Mosaic
 dispensation--to supplicate the divine mercy and favor--to render
 thanks for past instances of goodness, and offer petitions for future
 blessings (see on

 <A HREF="JFB11.htm#1Ki8_22">1Ki 8:22</A>). 

 This religious design of the temple--the <FONT SIZE=-1>ONE</FONT> 
 temple in the world--is in fact its standpoint of absorbing 
 interest.</P>

 <B>22. If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to
 make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house,</B>
 &c.--In cases where the testimony of witnesses could not be obtained
 and there was no way of settling a difference or dispute between two
 people but by accepting the oath of the accused, the practice had
 gradually crept in and had acquired the force of consuetudinary law,
 for the party to be brought before the altar, where his oath was taken
 with all due solemnity, together with the imprecation of a curse to
 fall upon himself if his disavowal should be found untrue. There is an
 allusion to such a practice in this passage.</P>

 was through means of it the mighty miracles were wrought and the

 The duty, of course, devolved chiefly on the priests, and hence in
 proceeding to describe their several departments of work, the historian
 says, generally, "the priests waited on their offices." While great
 numbers would be occupied with the preparation and offering of the
 victims, others sounded with their trumpets, and the different bands of
 the Levites praised the Lord with vocal and instrumental music, by

 <A HREF="JFB11.htm#1Ki9_1">1Ki 9:1-9</A>).
 
 The dedication of the temple must have been an occasion of intense
 national interest to Solomon and his subjects. Nor was the interest
 merely temporary or local. The record of it is read and thought of with
 an interest that is undiminished by the lapse of time. The fact that
 this was the only temple of all nations in which the <I>true God</I> was
 worshipped imparts a moral grandeur to the scene and prepares the mind
 for the sublime prayer that was offered at the dedication. The pure
 theism of that prayer--its acknowledgment of the unity of God as well
 as of His moral perfections in providence and grace, came from the same
 divine source as the miraculous fire. They indicated sentiments and
 feelings of exalted and spiritual devotion, which sprang not from the
 unaided mind of man, but from the fountain of revelation. The reality
 of the divine presence was attested by the miracle, and that miracle
 stamped the seal of truth upon the theology of the temple-worship.</P>

 Solomon was provoked against it, we are not informed, but he sent an 
 armed force which reduced it.  He made himself master also of Tadmor, 
 the famous Palmyra in the same region. Various other cities along the 
 frontiers of his extended dominions he repaired and fitted up, either 
 to serve as store-places for the furtherance of his commercial 
 enterprises, or to secure his kingdom from foreign invasion (see on

 allow her to occupy it, because he felt that she being a heathen
 proselyte, and having brought from her own country an establishment of
 heathen maid-servants, there would have been an impropriety in her
 being domiciled in a mansion which was or had been hallowed by the

 Solomon, determined to cultivate the arts of peace,
 was sagacious enough to perceive that his kingdom could become great and
 glorious only by encouraging a spirit of commercial enterprise among his
 subjects; and, accordingly, with that in mind he made a contract with
 Huram for ships and seamen to instruct his people in navigation.</P>

 <A HREF="JFB11.htm#1Ki10_1">1Ki 10:1-13</A>).

 It is said that among the things in Jerusalem which drew forth the
 admiration of Solomon's royal visitor was "his ascent by which he went
 up into the house of the Lord." This was the arched viaduct that 
 crossed the valley from Mount Zion to the opposite hill. In the 
 commentary on the passage quoted above, allusion was made to the recent 
 discovery of its remains. Here we give a full account of what, for 
 boldness of conceptions for structure and magnificence, was one of the 
 greatest wonders in Jerusalem. "During our first visit to the southwest 
 corner of the area of the mosque, we observed several of the large 
 stones jutting out from the western wall, which at first seemed to be 
 the effect of a bursting of the wall from some mighty shock or 
 earthquake. We paid little regard to this at the moment; but on 
 mentioning the fact not long after to a circle of our friends, the 
 remark was incidentally dropped that the stones had the appearance of 
 having once belonged to a large arch. At this remark, a train of 
 thought flashed across my mind, which I hardly dared to follow out 
 until I had again repaired to the spot, in order to satisfy myself with 
 my own eyes as to the truth or falsehood of the suggestion. I found it 
 even so. The courses of these immense stones occupy their original 
 position; their external surface is hewn to a regular curve; and, being 
 fitted one upon another, they form the commencement or foot of an 
 immense arch which once sprung out from this western wall in a 
 direction towards Mount Zion, across the Tyrop&oelig;on valley. This 
 arch could only have belonged to the bridge, which, according to J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, led from this part of the temple to the Xystus 
 (covered colonnade) on Zion; and it proves incontestably the antiquity 
 of that portion from which it springs" [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>].  
 The distance from this point to the steep rock of Zion R<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT> calculates to be about three hundred and fifty 
 feet, the probable length of this ancient viaduct. Another writer adds, 
 that "the arch of this bridge, if its curve be calculated with an 
 approximation to the truth, would measure <I>sixty</I> feet, and must 
 have been one of five sustaining the viaduct (allowing for the 
 abutments on either side), and that the piers supporting the center 
 arch of this bridge must have been of great altitude--not less,
 perhaps, than one hundred and thirty feet. The whole structure, when 
 seen from the southern extremity of the Tyrop&oelig;on, must have had an
 aspect of grandeur, especially as connected with the lofty and 
 sumptuous edifices of the temple, and of Zion to the right and to the 
 left" [I<FONT SIZE=-1>SAAC</FONT> T<FONT SIZE=-1>AYLOR'S</FONT> E<FONT

 horses occupying the same number of stalls. Supposing that ten were put 
 together in one part, this would make forty thousand. According to this 
 theory of explanation, the historian in Kings refers to horses [see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:26">1Ki 10:26</A>];

 while the historian in Chronicles speaks of the stalls in which they
 were kept.  But more recent critics reject this mode of solving the 
 difficulty, and, regarding the four thousand stalls as in keeping with 
 the general magnificence of Solomon's establishments, are agreed in 
 considering the text in Kings as corrupt, through the error of some 
 copyist.</P>

 Solomon undoubtedly carried the Hebrew kingdom to its highest pitch of 
 worldly glory. His completion of the grand work, the centralizing of 
 the national worship at Jerusalem, whither the natives went up three 
 times a year, has given his name a prominent place in the history of 
 the ancient church. But his reign had a disastrous influence upon "the 
 peculiar people," and the example of his deplorable idolatries, the 
 connections he formed with foreign princes, the commercial speculations 
 he entered into, and the luxuries introduced into the land, seem in a 
 great measure to have altered and deteriorated the Jewish 
 character.</P>

 northern tribes, intended it as a punishment of the house of David for
 Solomon's apostasy. That event demonstrates the immediate
 superintendence of His providence over the revolutions of kingdoms; and
 thus it affords an instance, similar to many other striking instances
 that are found in Scripture, of divine predictions, uttered long

 the natural course of events.</P>

 Of the fifteen cities named, Aijalon, now Yalo, and Zorah, now Surah, 
 between Jerusalem and Jabneh [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>], lay 
 within the province of Benjamin. Gath, though a Philistine city, had 
 been subject to Solomon. And Etham, which was on the border of Simeon, 
 now incorporated with the kingdom of Israel, was fortified to repel 
 danger from that quarter. These fortresses Rehoboam placed under able 
 commanders and stocked them with provisions and military stores, 
 sufficient, if necessary, to stand a siege. In the crippled state of 
 his kingdom, he seems to have been afraid lest it might be made the 
 prey of some powerful neighbors.</P>

 of the true religion is the best support and safeguard of any nation;
 and as it was peculiarly the grand source of the strength and
 prosperity of the Hebrew monarchy, the great numbers of good and pious
 people who sought an asylum within the territories of Judah contributed
 greatly to consolidate the throne of Rehoboam. The cause of so
 extensive an emigration from the kingdom of Israel was the deep and
 daring policy of Jeroboam, who set himself to break the national unity
 by entirely abolishing, within his dominions, the religious
 institutions of Judaism. He dreaded an eventual reunion of the tribes
 if the people continued to repair thrice a year to worship in Jerusalem
 as they were obliged by law to do. Accordingly, on pretense that the
 distance of that city was too great for multitudes of his subjects, he
 fixed upon two more convenient places, where he established a new mode
 of worshipping God under gross and prohibited symbols

 circumstance of twenty-eight sons of the king being made governors of

 dissatisfaction. But Eastern monarchs ensure peace and tranquillity to
 their kingdom by bestowing government offices on their sons and
 grandsons. They obtain an independent provision, and being kept apart,
 are not likely to cabal in their father's lifetime. Rehoboam acted
 thus, and his sagacity will appear still greater if the wives he
 desired for them belonged to the cities where each son was located.
 These connections would bind them more closely to their respective
 places. In the modern countries of the East, particularly Persia and
 Turkey, younger princes were, till very lately, shut up in the harem
 during their father's lifetime; and, to prevent competition, they were
 blinded or killed when their brother ascended the throne. In the former
 country the old practice of dispersing them through the country as
 Rehoboam did, has been again revived.</P>

 <A HREF="#2Ch11_17">2Ch 11:17</A>).

 During the first three years of his reign his royal influence was 
 exerted in the encouragement of the true religion. Security and ease 
 led to religious decline, which, in the fourth year, ended in open 
 apostasy. The example of the court was speedily followed by his 
 subjects, for "all Israel was with him," that is, the people in his own 
 kingdom. The very next year, the fifth of his reign, punishment was 
 inflicted by the invasion of Shishak.</P>

 <B>2. Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem</B>--He was the first
 king of the twenty-second or Bubastic Dynasty. What was the immediate
 cause of this invasion? Whether it was in resentment for some
 provocation from the king of Judah, or in pursuance of ambitious views
 of conquest, is not said. But the invading army was a vast horde, for
 Shishak brought along with his native Egyptians an immense number of
 foreign auxiliaries.</P>

 <B>and the Ethiopians</B>--from the regions south of Egypt. By the
 overwhelming force of numbers, they took the fortresses of Judah which
 had been recently put in a state of defense, and marched to lay siege
 to the capital. While Shishak and his army was before Jerusalem, the
 prophet Shemaiah addressed Rehoboam and the princes, tracing this
 calamity to the national apostasy and threatening them with utter
 destruction in consequence of having forsaken God

 commissioned to announce that the phial of divine judgment would not be
 fully poured out on them--that the entire overthrow of the kingdom of
 Judah would not take place at that time, nor through the agency of
 Shishak; and yet, although it should enjoy a respite from total
 subversion, [Judah] should become a tributary province of Egypt in
 order that the people might learn how much lighter and better is the
 service of God than that of idolatrous foreign despots.</P>

 They seem to have been borne, like maces, by the guards of the palace, 
 when they attended the king to the temple or on other public 
 processions. Those splendid insignia having been plundered by the 
 Egyptian conqueror, others were made of inferior metal and kept in the 
 guard room of the palace, to be ready for use; as, notwithstanding the 
 tarnished glory of the court, the old state etiquette was kept up on 
 public and solemn occasions. An account of this conquest of Judah, with 
 the name of "king of Judah" in the cartouche of the principal captive, 
 according to the interpreters, is carved and written in hieroglyphics 
 on the walls of the great palace of Karnak, where it may be seen at the 
 present day. This sculpture is about twenty-seven hundred years old, 
 and is of peculiar interest as a striking testimony from Egypt to the 
 truth of Scripture history.</P>

 invaded. Rehoboam's government acquired new life and vigor by the 
 general revival of true religion, and his reign continued many years

 from his youthful ambition to recover the full hereditary dominion of 
 his ancestors. No prophet now forbade a war with Israel

 smallness of the two kingdoms. It must be borne in mind, however, that
 Oriental armies are mere mobs--vast numbers accompanying the camp in
 hope of plunder, so that the gross numbers described as going upon an
 Asiatic expedition are often far from denoting the exact number of
 fighting men. But in accounting for the large number of soldiers
 enlisted in the respective armies of Abijah and Jeroboam, there is no
 need of resorting to this mode of explanation; for we know by the
 census of David the immense number of the population that was capable
 of bearing arms

 territory and was encamped on an eminence near Beth-el 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:22">Jos 18:22</A>).
 
 Jeroboam's army lay at the foot of the hill, and as a pitched battle
 was expected, Abijah, according to the singular usage of ancient times,
 harangued the enemy. The speakers in such circumstances, while always
 extolling their own merits, poured out torrents of invective and
 virulent abuse upon the adversary. So did Abijah. He dwelt on the
 divine right of the house of David to the throne; and sinking all
 reference to the heaven-condemned offenses of Solomon and the divine
 appointment of Jeroboam, as well as the divine sanction of the
 separation, he upbraided Jeroboam as a usurper, and his subjects as
 rebels, who took advantage of the youth and inexperience of Rehoboam.
 Then contrasting the religious state of the two kingdoms, he drew a
 black picture of the impious innovations and gross idolatry introduced
 by Jeroboam, with his expulsion and impoverishment 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:14">2Ch 11:14</A>)

 of the Levites. He dwelt with reasonable pride on the pure and regular 
 observance of the ancient institutions of Moses in his own dominion

 <B>13-17. But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind 
 them</B>--The oration of Abijah, however animating an effect it might 
 have produced on his own troops, was unheeded by the party to whom it 
 was addressed; for while he was wasting time in useless words, Jeroboam 
 had ordered a detachment of his men to move quietly round the base of 
 the hill, so that when Abijah stopped speaking, he and his followers 
 found themselves surprised in the rear, while the main body of the 
 Israelitish forces remained in front. A panic might have ensued, had 
 not the leaders "cried unto the Lord," and the priests "sounded with 
 the trumpets"--the pledge of victory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:9,31:6">Nu 10:9; 31:6</A>).

 Reassured by the well-known signal, the men of Judah responded with a
 war shout, which, echoed by the whole army, was followed by an 
 impetuous rush against the foe. The shock was resistless. The ranks of 
 the Israelites were broken, for "God smote Jeroboam and all Israel." 
 They took to flight, and the merciless slaughter that ensued can be 
 accounted for only by tracing it to the rancorous passions enkindled by 
 a civil war.</P>

 subjugation of the ten tribes, contenting himself with the recovery of
 a few border towns, which, though lying within Judah or Benjamin, had
 been alienated to the new or northern kingdom. Among these was Beth-el,

 been allowed a free passage through Egypt. Zerah must, therefore, have
 been chief of the Cushites, or Ethiopians of Arabia, as they were
 evidently a nomad horde who had a settlement of tents and cattle in the
 neighborhood of Gerar.

 employed to carry couriers upon them might have procured that number of

 flour and water, as is their invariable custom, might have fought with
 Asa without eating a loaf of Zerah's bread or drinking a pint of his

 encounter the formidable host of marauders at his southern frontier.

 routed the enemy, and succeeded in obtaining, as the reward of his
 victory, a rich booty in treasure and cattle from the tents of this
 pastoral horde.</P>

 interesting mission. He went to meet Asa, as he was returning from his
 victorious pursuit of the Ethiopians, and the congratulatory address

 <B>3-6. Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God,</B>
 &c.--Some think that Azariah was referring to the sad and disastrous
 condition to which superstition and idolatry had brought the
 neighboring kingdom of Israel. His words should rather be taken in a
 wider sense, for it seems manifest that the prophet had his eye upon
 many periods in the national history, when the people were in the state
 described--a state of spiritual destitution and ignorance--and
 exhibited its natural result as widespread anarchy, mutual dissension
 among the tribes, and general suffering

 These calamities God permitted to befall them as the punishment of
 their apostasy. Azariah's object in these remarks was to establish the
 truth of his counsel

 threatening, in case of neglecting it by describing the uniform course
 of the divine procedure towards Israel, as shown in all periods of
 their history. Then after this appeal to national experience, he
 concluded with an earnest exhortation to the king to prosecute the work
 of reformation so well begun

 <B>8. when Asa heard .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the prophecy of Oded the prophet</B>--The insertion
 of these words, "of Oded the prophet," is generally regarded as a
 corruption of the text. "The sole remedy is to erase them. They are,
 probably, the remains of a note, which crept in from the margin into
 the text" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTHEAU</FONT>].

 his royal authority and influence to extirpate every vestige of
 idolatry from the land.

 in some splendid repairs or embellishments, which made it look like a
 new dedication, or in a reconstruction of a temporary altar, like that
 of Solomon

 reformation, and with this in view he waited for a general assembly of
 the people.

 <B>and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh</B>--The population
 of Asa's kingdom had been vastly increased by the continued influx of
 strangers, who, prompted by motives either of interest or of piety,
 sought in his dominions that security and freedom which they could not
 enjoy amid the complicated troubles which distracted Israel.

 <B>and out of Simeon</B>--Although a portion of that tribe, located within the
 territory of Judah, were already subjects of the southern kingdom, the

 idolatry punishable with death

 <B>1-6. In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha

 years before this date

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:33">1Ki 15:33</A>),

 and the best biblical critics are agreed in considering this date to be
 calculated from the separation of the kingdoms, and coincident with the 
 sixteenth year of Asa's reign. This mode of reckoning was, in all 
 likelihood, generally followed in the book of the kings of Judah and 
 Israel, the public annals of the time

 <B>Baasha .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. built Ramah</B>--that is, fortified it. The blessing of God
 which manifestly rested at this time on the kingdom of Judah, the
 signal victory of Asa, the freedom and purity of religious worship, and
 the fame of the late national covenant, were regarded with great
 interest throughout Israel, and attracted a constantly increasing
 number of emigrants to Judah. Baasha, alarmed at this movement,
 determined to stem the tide; and as the high road to and from Jerusalem
 passed by Ramah, he made that frontier town, about six miles north of
 Asa's capital, a military station, where the vigilance of his sentinels
 would effectually prevent all passage across the boundary of the
 kingdom (see on

 <B>7-10. Hanani the seer came to Asa .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and said</B>--His object was to
 show the king his error in forming his recent league with Ben-hadad.
 The prophet represented the appropriation of the temple treasures to
 purchase the services of the Syrian mercenaries, as indicating a
 distrust in God most blameable with the king's experience. He added,
 that in consequence of this want of faith, Asa had lost the opportunity
 of gaining a victory over the united forces of Baasha and Ben-hadad,
 more splendid than that obtained over the Ethiopians. Such a victory,
 by destroying their armies, would have deprived them of all power to
 molest him in the future; whereas by his foolish and worldly policy, so
 unworthy of God's vicegerent, to misapply the temple treasures and
 corrupt the fidelity of an ally of the king of Israel, he had tempted
 the cupidity of the one, and increased the hostility of the other, and
 rendered himself liable to renewed troubles 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:32">1Ki 15:32</A>).

 This rebuke was pungent and, from its truth and justness, ought to have 
 penetrated and afflicted the heart of such a man as Asa. But his pride 
 was offended at the freedom taken by the honest reprover of royalty, 
 and in a burst of passionate resentment, he ordered Hanani to be thrown 
 into prison.</P>

 <B>yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the
 physicians</B>--most probably Egyptian physicians, who were anciently
 in high repute at foreign courts, and who pretended to expel diseases
 by charms, incantations, and mystic arts. Asa's fault consisted in his
 trusting to such physicians, while he neglected to supplicate the aid
 and blessing of God. The best and holiest men have been betrayed for a
 time into sins, but through repentance have risen again; and as Asa is
 pronounced a good man

 a tribute of respect and gratitude for his pious character and
 patriotic government. But whether "the bed" means a state couch on
 which he lay exposed to public view, the odoriferous perfumes being
 designed to neutralize the offensive smell of the corpse, or whether it
 refers to an embalmment, in which aromatic spices were always used in
 great profusion, it is impossible to say.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>they made a very great burning for him</B>--according to some, for
 consuming the spices. According to others, it was a magnificent pile
 for the cremation of the corpse--a usage which was at that time, and
 long after, prevalent among the Hebrews, and the omission of which in
 the case of royal personages was reckoned a great indignity

 on the priests. But extraordinary commissioners were appointed,
 probably to ascertain whether the work had been done or neglected. This
 deputation of five princes, assisted by two priests and nine Levites,
 was to make a circuit of the towns in Judah. It is the first practical
 measure we read of as being adopted by any of the kings for the
 religious instruction of the people. Time and unbroken opportunities
 were afforded for carrying out fully this excellent plan of home
 education, for the kingdom enjoyed internal tranquillity as well as
 freedom for foreign wars. It is conformable to the pious style of the
 sacred historian to trace this profound peace to the "fear of the Lord

 <B>1-4. Jehoshaphat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. returned to his house in
 peace</B>--(See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:16">2Ch 18:16</A>).

 Not long after he had resumed the ordinary functions of royalty in 
 Jerusalem, he was one day disturbed by an unexpected and ominous visit 
 from a prophet of the Lord

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:2">2Ch 19:2</A>].
 
 This was Jehu, of whose father we read in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:7">2Ch 16:7</A>.

 He himself had been called to discharge the prophetic office in Israel. 
 But probably for his bold rebuke to Baasha

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:1">1Ki 16:1</A>),

 he had been driven by that arbitrary monarch within the territory of 
 Judah, where we now find him with the privileged license of his order, 
 taking the same religious supervision of Jehoshaphat's proceedings as 
 he had formerly done of Baasha's. At the interview here described, he 
 condemned, in the strongest terms, the king of Judah's imprudent and 
 incongruous league with Ahab--God's open enemy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:2">1Ki 22:2</A>)

 --as an unholy alliance that would be conducive neither to the honor 
 and comfort of his house nor to the best interests of his kingdom. He 
 apprised Jehoshaphat that, on account of that grave offense, "wrath was 
 upon him from before the Lord," a judgment that was inflicted soon 
 after (see on

 <A HREF="#2Ch20_1">2Ch 20:1-37</A>).

 The prophet's rebuke, however, was administered in a mingled strain of
 severity and mildness; for he interposed "a nevertheless"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:3">2Ch 19:3</A>),
 
 which implied that the threatened storm would be averted, in token of
 the divine approval of his public efforts for the promotion of the true
 religion, as well as of the sincere piety of his personal character and
 life.</P>

 perhaps with new powers and a larger staff of assistants to overtake 
 every part of the land. The complement of teachers required for that 
 purpose would be easily obtained because the whole tribe of Levites was 
 now concentrated within the kingdom of Judah.</P>

 fragmentary kingdom of Judah. He fixed local courts in each of the
 fortified cities, these being the provincial capitals of every district

 inferior courts. It consisted of two divisions: the first of which had
 jurisdiction in ecclesiastical matters; the second, in civil, fiscal,
 and criminal cases. According to others, the two divisions of the
 supreme court adjudicated: the one according to the law contained in
 the sacred books; the other according to the law of custom and equity.
 As in Eastern countries at the present day, the written and unwritten

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. from beyond the sea on this side Syria</B>--Instead of "Syria," some
 versions read "Edom," and many able critics prefer this reading, both
 because the nomad tribes here mentioned were far from Syria, and
 because express mention is made of Mount Seir, that is, Edom. The
 meaning then is: this confederate horde was composed of the different
 tribes that inhabited the far distant regions bordering on the northern
 and eastern coasts of the Red Sea. Their progress was apparently by the
 southern point of the Dead Sea, as far as En-gedi, which, more
 anciently, was called Hazezon-tamar 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:7">Ge 14:7</A>).

 This is the uniform route taken by the Arabs in their marauding 
 expeditions at the present day; and in coming round the southern end of 
 the Dead Sea, they can penetrate along the low-lying Ghor far north, 
 without letting their movements be known to the tribes and villages 
 west of the mountain chain [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>].  Thus, 
 anciently, the invading horde in Jehoshaphat's time had marched as far 
 north as En-gedi, before intelligence of their advance was conveyed to 
 the court. En-gedi is recognized in the modern Ainjidy and is situated 
 at a point of the western shore, nearly equidistant from both 
 extremities of the lake [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>].</P>

 host of invaders, Jehoshaphat felt his only refuge was at the horns of
 the altar. He resolved to employ the aid of his God, and, in conformity
 with this resolution, he summoned all his subjects to observe a solemn
 fast at the sanctuary. It was customary with the Hebrew kings to
 proclaim fasts in perilous circumstances, either in a city, a district,
 or throughout the entire kingdom, according to the greatness of the
 emergency. On this occasion, it was a universal fast, which extended to
 infants

 this was done by angels in human form, whose sudden appearance diffused
 an uncontrollable panic. Others entertain the more probable opinion
 that, in the camp of this vast horde, composed of different tribes,
 jealousies and animosities had sprung up, which led to widespread
 dissensions and fierce feuds, in which they drew the sword against each
 other. The consequence was, that as the mutual strife commenced when
 the Hebrew procession set out from Jerusalem, the work of destruction
 was completed before Jehoshaphat and his people arrived at the
 battlefield. Thus easy is it for God to make the wrath of man to praise
 Him, to confound the counsels of His enemies and employ their own
 passions in defeating the machinations they have devised for the
 overthrow of His Church and people.</P>

 that they had not to fight at all, but rather to take possession of an
 immense booty, the collection of which occupied three days. On the
 fourth they set out on their return to Jerusalem in the same order and
 joyful mood as they came. The place where they mustered previous to
 departure was, from their public thanksgiving service, called, "The
 Valley of Berachah" ("benediction"), now Wady Bereikut.</P>

 the Isthmus of Suez, and to sail to the west of Europe from one of the
 ports of Palestine on the Mediterranean. Eliezer, a prophet, denounced
 this unholy alliance, and foretold, as divine judgment, the total wreck
 of the whole fleet. The consequence was, that although Jehoshaphat
 broke off--in obedience to the divine will--his league with Ahaziah,
 he formed a new scheme of a merchant fleet, and Ahaziah wished to be
 admitted a partner

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:49">1Ki 22:49</A>].

 The destination of this new fleet was to Ophir, because the Israelitish 
 seaports were not accessible to him for the Tartessus trade; but the 
 ships, when just off the docks, were wrecked in the rocky creek of 
 Ezion-geber.</P>

 <B>1-4. Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Jehoram

 them are in our version named Azariah; but in the Hebrew they appear 
 considerably different, the one being spelt "Azariah," and the other 
 "Azariahu." Though Jehoshaphat had made his family arrangements with
 prudent precaution, and while he divided the functions of royalty in 
 his lifetime (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:16">2Ki 8:16</A>),

 as well as fixed the succession to the throne in his oldest son, he
 appointed each of the others to the government of a fenced city, thus 
 providing them with an honorable independence. But this good intentions 
 were frustrated; for no sooner did Jehoram find himself in the sole 
 possession of sovereign power than, from jealousy, or on account of 
 their connections, he murdered all his brothers, together with some 
 leading influential persons who, he suspected, were attached to their 
 interest, or would avenge their deaths. Similar tragedies have been 
 sadly frequent in Eastern courts, where the heir of the crown looks 
 upon his brothers as his most formidable enemies, and is therefore 
 tempted to secure his power by their death.</P>

 all the military establishments of his father; but being renewed

 On this account, as well as for his unnatural cruelties, divine 
 vengeance was denounced against him, which was soon after executed 
 exactly as the prophet had foretold. A series of overwhelming 
 calamities befell this wicked king; for in addition to the revolts 
 already mentioned, two neighboring tribes (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:11">2Ch 17:11</A>)

 made hostile incursions on the southern and western portions of his 
 kingdom. His country was ravaged, his capital taken, his palace 
 plundered, his wives carried off, and all his children slain except the 
 youngest. He himself was seized with an incurable dysentery, which, 
 after subjecting him to the most painful suffering for the unusual 
 period of two years, carried him off, a monument of the divine 
 judgment. To complete his degradation, his death was unlamented, his 
 burial unhonored by his subjects. This custom, similar to what obtained 
 in Egypt, seems to have crept in among the Hebrews, of giving funeral 
 honors to their kings, or withholding them, according to the good or 
 bad characters of their reign.</P>

 forty-second year of the kingdom of his mother's family [L<FONT

 The two accounts are easily reconciled. "Ahaziah fled first to the
 garden house and escaped to Samaria; but was here, where he had hid 
 himself, taken by Jehu's men who pursued him, brought to Jehu, who was 
 still near or in Jezreel, and at his command slain at the hill Gur, 
 beside Ibleam, in his chariot; that is, mortally wounded with an arrow, 
 so that he, again fleeing, expired at Megiddo" [K<FONT

 of Judah's attendants, who conveyed it to Jerusalem, and out of respect 
 to his grandfather Jehoshaphat's memory, gave him an honorable 
 interment in the tombs of the kings.

 Maddened by the massacre of the royal family of Ahab, she resolved that 
 the royal house of David should have the same fate. Knowing the 
 commission which Jehu had received to extirpate the whole of Ahab's 
 posterity, she expected that he would extend his sword to her. 
 Anticipating his movements, she resolved, as her only defense and 
 security, to usurp the throne and destroy "the seed royal," both 
 because they were hostile to the Ph&oelig;nician worship of Baal, which she
 was determined to uphold, and because, if one of the young princes 
 became king, his mother would supersede Athaliah in the dignity of 
 queen mother.</P>

 and this view they support on the ground that "gave him" being 
 supplemented, the text properly runs thus, "put upon him the crown and 
 testimony." At the same time, it seems equally pertinent to take "the 
 testimony" in the usual acceptation of that term; and, accordingly,

 one had escaped her murderous hands, she might not deem it expedient to
 institute any enquiries; but the very idea would keep her constantly in
 a state of jealous suspicion and irritation. In that state of mind, the

 <B>15, 16. Jehoiada waxed old .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and died</B>--His life, protracted to
 unusual longevity and spent in the service of his country, deserved
 some tribute of public gratitude, and this was rendered in the
 posthumous honors that were bestowed on him. Among the Hebrews,
 intramural interment was prohibited in every city but Jerusalem, and
 there the exception was made only to the royal family and persons of
 eminent merit, on whom the distinction was conferred of being buried in
 the city of David, among the kings, as in the case of Jehoiada.</P>

 <B>17-22. Now came the princes of Judah, and make obeisance to the
 king</B>--Hitherto, while Joash occupied the throne, his uncle had held
 the reins of sovereign power, and by his excellent counsels had
 directed the young king to such measures as were calculated to promote
 both the civil and religious interests of the country. The fervent
 piety, practical wisdom, and inflexible firmness of that sage
 counsellor exerted immense influence over all classes. But now that the
 helm of the state-ship was no longer steered by the sound head and firm
 hand of the venerable high priest, the real merits of Joash's
 administration appear; and for want of good and enlightened principle,
 as well as, perhaps, of natural energy of character, he allowed himself
 to be borne onward in a course which soon wrecked the vessel upon
 hidden rocks.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the king hearkened unto them,</B> &c.--They were secretly attached
 to idolatry, and their elevated rank affords sad proof how extensively 
 and deeply the nation had become corrupted during the reigns of 
 Jehoram, Ahaziah, and Athaliah. With strong professions of allegiance 
 they humbly requested that they might not be subjected to the continued 
 necessity of frequent and expensive journeys to Jerusalem, but allowed 
 the privilege their fathers had enjoyed of worshipping God in high 
 places at home. They framed their petition in this plausible and least 
 offensive manner, well knowing that, if excused attendance at the 
 temple, they might--without risk of discovery or disturbance--indulge 
 their tastes in the observance of any private rites they pleased. The 
 weak-minded king granted their petition; and the consequence was, that 
 when they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers, they soon 
 "served groves and idols."</P>

 <B>18. wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem</B>--The particular mention of
 Jerusalem as involved in the sin implies that the neglect of the temple
 and the consequent idolatry received not only the king's toleration,
 but his sanction; and it naturally occurs to ask how, at his mature
 age, such a total abandonment of a place with which all his early
 recollections were associated can be accounted for. It has been
 suggested that what he had witnessed of the conduct of many of the
 priests in the careless performance of the worship, and especially
 their unwillingness to collect the money, as well as apply a portion of
 their revenues for the repairs of the temple, had alienated and
 disgusted him [L<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments
 of the Lord, that ye cannot prosper,</B> &c.--His near relationship to the
 king might have created a feeling of delicacy and reluctance to
 interfere; but at length he, too, was prompted by an irresistible
 impulse to protest against the prevailing impiety. The bold freedom and
 energy of [Zechariah's] remonstrance, as well as his denunciation of
 the national calamities that would certainly follow, were most
 unpalatable to the king; while they so roused the fierce passions of
 the multitude that a band of miscreants, at the secret instigation of
 Joash, stoned him to death. This deed of violence involved complicated
 criminality on the part of the king. It was a horrid outrage on a
 prophet of the Lord--base ingratitude to a family who had preserved his
 life--atrocious treatment of a true Hebrew patriot--an illegal and
 unrighteous exercise of his power and authority as a king.</P>

 present of gold

 <B>5. Amaziah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. made captains,</B>
 &c.--As all who were capable of
 bearing arms were liable to serve, it was quite natural in making up
 the muster-roll to class them according to their respective families
 and to appoint the officers of each corps from the same quarter; so
 that all the soldiers who formed a regiment were brothers, relatives,
 friends. Thus the Hebrew troops were closely linked together, and had
 strong inducements to keep steady in their ranks.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>found them three hundred thousand choice men</B>--This was only a fourth
 part of Jehoshaphat's army 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:14-19">2Ch 17:14-19</A>),

 showing how sadly the kingdom of Judah had, in the space of eighty-two 
 years, been reduced in population by foreign wars, no less than by 
 internal corruptions. But the full amount of Amaziah's troops may not 
 be here stated.</P>

 <A NAME="2Ch25_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>6. He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour 
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for an hundred talents of silver</B>--This sum was paid 
 into the treasury of Jehoahaz--not given as bounty to the mercenaries 
 who were obliged to serve at the sovereign's call; their remuneration 
 consisting only in the booty they might obtain. It was about 
 &pound;50,000 sterling, being 10<I>s.</I> per man, including 
 officers--a very paltry pay, compared with the bounty given for a 
 soldier in this country. But it must be remembered that in ancient 
 times campaigns were short and the hazards of the service comparatively 
 small.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>7, 8. there came a man of God</B>--sent to dissuade Amaziah from the course
 he was following, on the ground that "the Lord is not with Israel." This
 statement was perfectly intelligible to the king. But the historian,
 writing long after, thought it might require explanation, and therefore
 added the comment, "with all the children of Ephraim." Idolatry had long
 been the prevailing religion in that kingdom, and Ephraim its
 headquarters. As to the other part of the prophet's advice 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:8">2Ch 25:8</A>),

 considerable obscurity hangs over it, as the text stands; and hence 
 some able critics have suggested the insertion of "not" in the middle 
 clause, so that the verse will be thus: "But if thou wilt go [alone], 
 do, be strong for the battle; God shall <I>not</I> make thee fall 
 before the enemy."</P>

 anger was greatly kindled against Judah</B>--Amaziah, who knew his
 position as the Lord's viceroy, complied with the prophet's counsel,
 and, consenting to forfeit the purchase money of the Israelitish
 soldiers, discharged them. Exasperated at this treatment, they resolved
 to indemnify themselves for the loss of their expected booty, and so on
 their return home they plundered all the towns in their way, committing
 great havoc both of life and property without any stoppage, as the king
 of Judah and his army had set out on their expedition

 The arms of Amaziah, in reward for his obedience to the divine will,
 were crowned with victory--ten thousand of the Edomites were slain on
 the field, and as many taken prisoners, who were put to death by
 precipitation "from the top of the rock" 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:12">2Ch 25:12</A>].

 This rock might be situated in the neighborhood of the battlefield, but 
 more probably it formed one of the high craggy cliffs of Selah (Petra), 
 the capital of the Edomites, whither Amaziah marched directly from the 
 Valley of Salt, and which he captured

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:7">2Ki 14:7</A>).

 The savage cruelty dealt out to them was either in retaliation for 
 similar barbarities inflicted on the Hebrews, or to strike terror into 
 so rebellious a people for the future. The mode of execution, by 
 dashing against stones

 Edomites worshipped the sun under different forms and with various
 rites. But burning incense upon altars was a principal act of worship,
 and this was the very thing Amaziah is described as having with strange
 infatuation performed. Whether he had been captivated with the beauty
 of the images, or hoped by honoring the gods to disarm their spite at
 him for his conquest and harsh treatment of their votaries, his conduct
 in establishing these objects of religious homage in Jerusalem was
 foolish, ignorant, and highly offensive to God, who commissioned a
 prophet to rebuke him for his apostasy, and threaten him with the
 calamity that soon after befell him.</P>

 previous to the war with Edom. But victory had elated and blinded him.</P>

 These were all cut down on the field by Zichri, an Israelitish warrior,
 or as some think, ordered to be put to death after the battle. A vast 
 number of captives also fell into the power of the conquerors; and an 
 equal division of war prisoners being made between the allies, they 
 were sent off under a military escort to the respective capitals of 
 Syria and Israel

 went out, as the escort was approaching, to prevent the disgraceful
 outrage of introducing such prisoners into the city. The officers of
 the squadron were, of course, not to blame; they were simply doing
 their military duty in conducting those prisoners of war to their
 destination. But Oded clearly showed that the Israelitish army had
 gained the victory--not by the superiority of their arms, but in
 consequence of the divine judgment against Judah. He forcibly exposed
 the enormity of the offense of keeping "their brethren" as slaves got
 in war. He protested earnestly against adding this great offense of
 unnatural and sinful cruelty

 the effect of his spirited remonstrance and the opposing tide of

 Under their kindly superintendence, the prisoners were not only 
 released, but out of the spoils were comfortably relieved with food and 
 clothing, and conveyed as far as Jericho on their way back to their own

 commencement of this resolution at the beginning of his reign attests
 his sincere piety. It also proves the strength of his conviction that
 righteousness exalteth a nation; for, instead of waiting till his
 throne was consolidated, he devised measures of national reformation at
 the beginning of his reign and vigorously faced all the difficulties
 which, in such a course, he had to encounter, after the people's habits
 had so long been moulded to idolatry. His intentions were first

 temple, the priest brought all the sweepings out to the porch, where
 they were received by the Levites and thrown into the brook Kedron.
 This took eight days more. At the end of this period they repaired to
 the palace and announced that not only had the whole of the sacred
 edifice, within and without, undergone a thorough purification, but all
 the vessels which the late king had taken away and applied to a common
 use in his palace, had been restored, "and sanctified."</P>

 <B>20-30. Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of
 the city</B>--His anxiety to enter upon the expiatory service with all
 possible despatch, now that the temple had been properly prepared for
 it, prevented his summoning all the representatives of Israel. The
 requisite number of victims having been provided, and the officers of
 the temple having sanctified themselves according to the directions of
 the law, the priests were appointed to offer sacrifices of atonement
 successively, for "the kingdom," that is, for the sins of the king and
 his predecessors; for "the sanctuary," that is, for the sins of the
 priests themselves and for the desecration of the temple; "and for
 Judah," that is, for the people who, by their voluntary consent, were
 involved in the guilt of the national apostasy. Animals of the kinds
 used in sacrifice were offered by sevens, that number indicating
 completeness. The Levites were ordered to praise God with musical
 instruments, which, although not originally used in the tabernacle, had
 been enlisted in the service of divine worship by David on the advice
 of the prophets Gad and Nathan, as well calculated to animate the
 devotions of the people. At the close of the special services of the
 occasion, namely, the offering of atonement sacrifices, the king and
 all civic rulers who were present joined in the worship. A grand anthem
 was sung 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:30">2Ch 29:30</A>)

 by the choir, consisting of some of the psalms of David and Asaph, and 
 a great number of thank offerings, praise offerings, and freewill burnt 
 offerings were presented at the invitation of the king.</P>

 the sacrifice of the expiation offerings, anew consecrated to the
 service of God and qualified to resume the functions of their sacred
 office

 <B>34-36. the priests were too few, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wherefore their brethren the
 Levites did help them</B>--The skins of beasts intended as peace offerings
 might be taken off by the officers, because, in such cases, the carcass
 was not wholly laid upon the altar; but animals meant for burnt
 offerings which were wholly consumed by fire could be flayed by the
 priests alone, not even the Levites being allowed to touch them, except
 in cases of unavoidable necessity 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:11">2Ch 35:11</A>).

 The duty being assigned by the law to the priests

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:6">Le 1:6</A>),

 was construed by consuetudinary practice as an exclusion of all others 
 not connected with the Aaronic family.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than
 the priests</B>--that is, displayed greater alacrity than the priests. This
 service was hastened by the irrepressible solicitude of the king.
 Whether it was that many of the priests, being absent in the country,
 had not arrived in time--whether from the long interruption of the
 public duties, some of them had relaxed in their wonted attentions to
 personal cleanliness, and had many preparations to make--or whether
 from some having participated in the idolatrous services introduced by
 Ahaz, they were backward in repairing to the temple--a reflection does
 seem to be cast upon their order as dilatory and not universally ready
 for duty (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:15">2Ch 30:15</A>).

 Thus was the newly consecrated temple reopened to the no small joy of 
 the pious king and all the people.</P>

 <B>1-5. Hezekiah sent to all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Judah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to come to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 Jerusalem, to keep the passover</B>--This great religious festival had
 not been regularly observed by the Hebrews in their national capacity
 for a long time because of the division of the kingdom and the many
 disorders that had followed that unhappy event. Hezekiah longed
 extremely to see its observance revived; and the expression of his
 wishes having received a hearty response from the princes and chief men
 of his own kingdom, the preparatory steps were taken for a renewed
 celebration of the national solemnity.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh</B>--The names of these leading
 tribes are used for the whole kingdom of Israel. It was judged impossible,
 however, that the temple, the priests, and people could be all duly
 sanctified at the usual time appointed for the anniversary, namely, the
 fourteenth day of the first month (Nisan). Therefore it was resolved,
 instead of postponing the feast till another year, to observe it on the
 fourteenth day of the second month; a liberty which, being in certain
 circumstances 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:6-13">Nu 9:6-13</A>)

 granted to individuals, might, it was believed, be allowed to all the 
 people. Hezekiah's proclamation was, of course, authoritative in his 
 own kingdom, but it could not have been made and circulated in all the 
 towns and villages of the neighboring kingdom without the concurrence, 
 or at least the permission, of the Israelitish sovereign. Hoshea, the 
 reigning king, is described as, though evil in some respects, yet more 
 favorably disposed to religious liberty than any of his predecessors 
 since the separation of the kingdom. This is thought to be the meaning 
 of the mitigating clause in his character

 Each, well mounted, had a certain number of miles to traverse. Having 
 performed his course, he was relieved by another, who had to scour an 
 equal extent of ground; so that, as the government messengers were 
 despatched in all directions, public edicts were speedily diffused 
 throughout the country. The proclamation of Hezekiah was followed by a 
 verbal address from himself, piously urging the duty, and setting forth 
 the advantages, of a return to the pure faith and institutions which 
 God had delivered to their ancestors through Moses.

 <B>10-12. the posts passed from city to city</B>--It is not surprising that
 after so long a discontinuance of the sacred festival, this attempt to
 revive it should, in some quarters, have excited ridicule and
 opposition. Accordingly, among the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and
 Zebulun, Hezekiah's messengers met with open insults and ill usage.
 Many, however, in these very districts, as well as throughout the
 kingdom of the ten tribes, generally complied with the invitation;
 while, in the kingdom of Judah, there was one unanimous feeling of high
 expectation and pious delight. The concourse that repaired to Jerusalem
 on the occasion was very great, and the occasion was ever after
 regarded as one of the greatest passovers that had ever been
 celebrated.</P>

 Levites slaughtered the paschal victims
 (see on

 <A HREF="#2Ch35_5">2Ch 35:5</A>)

 <B>1. all Israel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. present went out to the cities of Judah</B>--The
 solemnities of this paschal season left a deep and salutary impression
 on the minds of the assembled worshippers; attachment to the ancient
 institutions of their country was extensively revived; ardor in the
 service of God animated every bosom; and under the impulse of the
 devout feelings inspired by the occasion, they took measures at the
 close of the passover for extirpating idolatrous statues and altars out
 of every city, as at the beginning of the festival they had done in
 Jerusalem.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Judah and Benjamin</B>--denote the southern kingdom.

 <B>Ephraim also and Manasseh</B>--refer to the northern kingdom. This
 unsparing demolition of the monuments of idolatry would receive all
 encouragement from the king and public authorities of the former; and
 the force of the popular movement was sufficient to effect the same
 results among the tribes of Israel, whatever opposition the power of
 Hoshea or the invectives of some profane brethren might have made.
 Thus the reign of idolatry being completely overthrown and the pure
 worship of God re-established throughout the land, the people returned
 every one to his own home, in the confident expectation that, through
 the divine blessing, they would enjoy a happy future of national peace
 and prosperity.</P>

 <B>2-5. Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests,</B> &c.--The king now
 turned his attention to provide for the orderly performance of the
 temple-worship--arranging the priests and Levites in their courses,
 assigning to every one his proper place and functions--and issuing
 edicts for the regular payment of those dues from which the revenues of
 the sanctuary were derived. To set a proper example to his subjects, his
 own proportion was announced in the first instance, for to the king it
 belonged, out of his privy purse, to defray the expenses of the altar,
 both stated and occasional 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+28:3,4,9,11,19">Nu 28:3, 4, 9, 11, 19</A>);

 and in making this contribution from his own means, Hezekiah followed 
 the course which David and Solomon had taken before him (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+8:14,1Ki+9:25">2Ch 8:14;
 1Ki 9:25</A>).
 
 Afterwards he reappointed the people's dues to the temple; and from its
 being necessary to issue a royal mandate in reference to this matter, it
 appears that the sacred tribute had been either totally neglected, or
 (as the idolatrous princes were known to appropriate it to their own
 purposes) the people had in many cases refused or evaded the duty. But
 with the improved state of public feeling, Hezekiah's commandment was
 readily obeyed, and contributions of first-fruits and tithes were poured
 in with great liberality from all parts of Judah, as well as from
 Israel. The first-fruits, even of some articles of produce that were
 unfit for sacrifice 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+2:11">Le 2:11</A>),

 such as honey (<I>Margin,</I> "dates"), were appropriated to the

 the middle of the second month. Some time would elapse before the
 king's order reached all parts of the kingdom. The wheat harvest
 occurred in the third month, so that the sheaves of that grain, being
 presented before any other, formed "the foundation," an under-layer in
 the corn stores of the temple. The first-fruits of their land produce
 which were successively sent in all the summer till the close of the
 fruit and vintage season, that is, the seventh month, continued to
 raise heap upon heap.</P>

 had been allowed through neglect to fall into decay, were to be
 repaired, or additional ones built. Private individuals brought their
 own first-fruits to the temple; but the tithes were levied by the
 Levites, who kept a faithful account of them in their several places of
 abode and transmitted the allotted proportion to the priests. Officers
 were appointed to distribute equal rations to all in the cities of the
 priests who, from age or other reasons, could not repair to the temple.
 With the exception of children under three years of age--an exception
 made probably from their being considered too young to receive solid
 food--lists were kept of the number and age of every male; of priests
 according to their fathers' house, and Levites from twenty years (see

 Determined to recover the independence of his country, Hezekiah had 
 decided to refuse to pay the tribute which his father had bound himself 
 to pay to Assyria.

 <B>Sennacherib .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced

 and Lachish had fallen; the siege of Libnah had commenced, when the 
 king of Judah, doubting his ability to resist, sent to acknowledge his 
 fault, and offer terms of submission by paying the tribute. The 
 commencement of this Assyrian war was disastrous to Hezekiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:13">2Ki 18:13</A>).

 against Jerusalem</B>--An account of the means taken to fortify Jerusalem
 against the threatened siege is given only in this passage. The
 polluting or filling up of wells, and the altering of the course of
 rivers, is an old practice that still obtains in the wars of the East.
 Hezekiah's plan was to cover the fountain heads, so that they might not
 be discovered by the enemy, and to carry the water by subterranean
 channels or pipes into the city--a plan which, while it would secure a
 constant supply to the inhabitants, would distress the besiegers, as
 the country all around Jerusalem was very destitute of water.</P>

 <B>4. So there was gathered much people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who stopped all the
 fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land</B>--"Where
 these various fountains were, we have now no positive means of
 ascertaining; though En-rogel, and the spring now called the Virgin's
 Fount, may well be numbered among them. J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT> mentions the existence
 of various fountains without the city, but does not mention any of them
 in this connection but Siloam. 'The brook,' however, is located with
 sufficient precision to enable us to trace it very definitely. We are
 told that it 'ran through the midst of the land.' Now a stream running
 through either the Kedron or Hinnom Valley, could, in no proper sense,
 be said to run <I>through the midst of the land,</I> but one flowing
 through the true Gihon valley, and separating Akra and Zion from
 Bezetha, Moriah, and Ophel, as a stream once, doubtless, did, could,
 with peculiar propriety, be said to run through the midst of the land
 on which the [Holy] City was built. And that this is the correct
 meaning of the phrase is not only apparent from the force of
 circumstances, but is positively so declared in the Septuagint, where,
 moreover, it is called a 'river,' which, at least, implies a much
 larger stream than the Kedron, and comports well with the marginal
 reading, where it is said to overflow through the midst of the land.
 Previous to the interference of man, there was, no doubt, a very
 copious stream that gushed forth in the upper portion of that shallow,
 basin-like concavity north of Damascus Gate, which is unquestionably
 the upper extremity of the Gihon valley, and pursuing its meandering
 course through this valley, entered the Tyrop&oelig;on at its great southern
 curve, down which it flowed into the valley of the Kedron"

 Particular notice is here taken of the aqueduct, as among the greatest 
 of Hezekiah's works.  "In exploring the subterranean channel conveying 
 the water from Virgin's Fount to Siloam, I discovered a similar channel 
 entering from the north, a few yards from its commencement; and on 
 tracing it up near the Mugrabin gate, where it became so choked with 
 rubbish that it could be traversed no farther, I there found it turn to 
 the <I>west</I> in the direction of the south end of the cleft, or 
 saddle, of Zion, and if this channel was not constructed for the 
 purpose of conveying the waters of Hezekiah's aqueduct, I am unable to 
 suggest any purpose to which it could have been applied. Perhaps the 
 reason why it was not brought down on the Zion side, was that Zion was 
 already well-watered in its lower portion by the Great Pool, 'the lower 
 pool of Gihon.' And accordingly W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILLIAMS</FONT> [<I>Holy 
 City</I>] renders this passage, 'He stopped the upper outflow of the 
 waters of Gihon, and led them down westward to the city'" [B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ARCLAY</FONT>, <I>City of the Great King</I>]. The construction 
 of this aqueduct required not only masonic but engineering skill; for 
 the passage was bored through a continuous mass of rock. Hezekiah's 
 pool or reservoir made to receive the water within the northwest part 
 of the city still remains. It is an oblong quadrangular tank, two 
 hundred forty feet in length, from one hundred forty-four to one 
 hundred fifty in breadth, but, from recent excavations, appears to have 
 extended somewhat farther towards the north.</P>

 and a letter of congratulation on his recovery, in which particular 
 enquiries were made about the miracle of the sun's retrocession--a 
 natural phenomenon that could not fail to excite great interest and 
 curiosity at Babylon, where astronomy was so much studied. At the same 
 time, there is reason to believe that they proposed a defensive league 
 against the Assyrians.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>God left him, to try him,</B> &c.--Hezekiah's offense was not so much in
 the display of his military stores and treasures, as in not giving to
 God the glory both of the miracle and of his recovery, and thus leading
 those heathen ambassadors to know Him.</P>

 <B>11. the captains of the host of the king of Assyria</B>--This king 
 was Esar-haddon. After having devoted the first years of his reign to 
 the consolidation of his government at home, he turned his attention to 
 repair the loss of the tributary provinces west of the Euphrates,
 which, on the disaster and death of Sennacherib, had taken the
 opportunity of shaking off the Assyrian yoke. Having overrun Palestine
 and removed the remnant that were left in the kingdom of Israel, he
 despatched his generals, the chief of whom was Tartan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+20:1">Isa 20:1</A>),

 with a portion of his army for the reduction of Judah also. In a
 successful attack upon Jerusalem, they took multitudes of captives, and 
 got a great prize, including the king himself, among the prisoners.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>took Manasseh among the thorns</B>--This may mean, as is commonly supposed,
 that he had hid himself among a thicket of briers and brambles. We know
 that the Hebrews sometimes took refuge from their enemies in thickets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:6">1Sa 13:6</A>).

 But, instead of the <I>Hebrew, Bacochim,</I> "among the thorns", some 
 versions read <I>Bechayim,</I> "among the living", and so the passage 
 would be "took him alive."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon</B>--The <I>Hebrew</I> word rendered "fetters" denotes properly two chains of brass. The
 humiliating state in which Manasseh appeared before the Assyrian
 monarch may be judged of by a picture on a tablet in the Khorsabad
 palace, representing prisoners led bound into the king's presence. "The
 captives represented appear to be inhabitants of Palestine. Behind the
 prisoners stand four persons with inscriptions on the lower part of
 their tunics; the first two are bearded, and seem to be accusers; the
 remaining two are nearly defaced; but behind the last appears the
 eunuch, whose office it seems to be to usher into the presence of the
 king those who are permitted to appear before him. He is followed by
 another person of the same race as those under punishment; his hands
 are manacled, and on his ankles are strong rings fastened together by a
 heavy bar" [<I>Nineveh and Its Palaces</I>]. No name is given, and, therefore,
 no conclusion can be drawn that the figure represents Manasseh. But the
 people appear to be Hebrews, and this pictorial scene will enable us to
 imagine the manner in which the royal captive from Judah was received
 in the court of Babylon. Esar-haddon had established his residence
 there; for though from the many revolts that followed the death of his
 father, he succeeded at first only to the throne of Assyria, yet having
 some time previous to his conquest of Judah, recovered possession of
 Babylon, this enterprising king had united under his sway the two
 empires of Babylon and Chaldea and transferred the seat of his
 government to Babylon.</P>

 <A NAME="2Ch33_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>12, 13. when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord his God</B>--In
 the solitude of exile or imprisonment, Manasseh had leisure for
 reflection. The calamities forced upon him a review of his past life,
 under a conviction that the miseries of his dethronement and captive
 condition were owing to his awful and unprecedented apostasy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+33:7">2Ch 33:7</A>)

 from the God of his fathers. He humbled himself, repented, and prayed 
 for an opportunity of bringing forth the fruits of repentance. His 
 prayer was heard; for his conqueror not only released him, but, after 
 two years' exile, restored him, with honor and the full exercise of 
 royal power, to a tributary and dependent kingdom. Some political 
 motive, doubtless, prompted the Assyrian king to restore Manasseh, and 
 that was most probably to have the kingdom of Judah as a barrier 
 between Egypt and his Assyrian dominions. But God overruled this 
 measure for higher purposes. Manasseh now showed himself, by the 
 influence of sanctified affliction, a new and better man. He made a 
 complete reversal of his former policy, by not only destroying all the 
 idolatrous statues and altars he had formerly erected in Jerusalem, but 
 displaying the most ardent zeal in restoring and encouraging the 
 worship of God.</P>

 position of the fish gate, shows that the valley of Gihon could be no
 other than that leading northwest of Damascus gate, and gently
 descending southward, uniting with the Tyrop&oelig;on at the northeast
 corner of Mount Zion, where the latter turns at right angles and runs
 towards Siloam. The wall thus built by Manasseh on the west side of the
 valley of Gihon, would extend from the vicinity of the northeast corner
 of the wall of Zion in a northerly direction, until it crossed over the
 valley to form a junction with the outer wall at the trench of Antonia,
 precisely in the quarter where the temple would be most easily

 <B>3. in the eighth year of his reign</B>--This was the sixteenth year of his
 age, and, as the kings of Judah were considered minors till they had
 completed their thirteenth year, it was three years after he had
 attained majority. He had very early manifested the piety and excellent
 dispositions of his character. In the twelfth year of his reign, but the
 twentieth of his age, he began to take a lively interest in the
 purgation of his kingdom from all the monuments of idolatry which, in
 his father's short reign, had been erected. At a later period, his
 increasing zeal for securing the purity of divine worship led him to
 superintend the work of demolition in various parts of his dominion. The
 course of the narrative in this passage is somewhat different from that
 followed in the Book of Kings. For the historian, having made allusion
 to the early manifestation of Josiah's zeal, goes on with a full detail
 of all the measures this good king adopted for the extirpation of
 idolatry; whereas the author of the Book of Kings sets out with the
 cleansing of the temple, immediately previous to the celebration of the
 passover, and embraces that occasion to give a general description of
 Josiah's policy for freeing the land from idolatrous pollution. The
 exact chronological order is not followed either in Kings or Chronicles.
 But it is clearly recorded in both that the abolition of idolatry began
 in the twelfth and was completed in the eighteenth year of Josiah's
 reign. Notwithstanding Josiah's undoubted sincerity and zeal and the
 people's apparent compliance with the king's orders, he could not
 extinguish a strongly rooted attachment to idolatries introduced in the
 early part of Manasseh's reign. This latent predilection appears
 unmistakably developed in the subsequent reigns, and the divine decree
 for the removal of Judah, as well as Israel, into captivity was
 irrevocably passed.</P>

 will stand thus: "And so did [namely, break the altars and burn the
 bones of priests] he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and
 Simeon, even unto Naphtali, in their deserted suburbs." The reader is
 apt to be surprised on finding that Josiah, whose hereditary
 possessions were confined to the kingdom of Judah, exercised as much
 authority among the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, Simeon, and others as
 far as Naphtali, as he did within his own dominion. Therefore, it is
 necessary to observe that, after the destruction of Samaria by
 Shalmaneser, the remnant that continued on the mountains of Israel
 maintained a close intercourse with Judah, and looked to the sovereigns
 of that kingdom as their natural protectors. Those kings acquired great
 influence over them, which Josiah exercised in removing every vestige
 of idolatry from the land. He could not have done this without the
 acquiescence of the people in the propriety of this proceeding,
 conscious that this was conformable to their ancient laws and
 institutions. The Assyrian kings, who were now masters of the country,
 might have been displeased at the liberties Josiah took beyond his own
 territories. But either they were not informed of his doings, or they
 did not trouble themselves about his religious proceedings, relating,
 as they would think, to the god of the land, especially as he did not
 attempt to seize upon any place or to disturb the allegiance of the
 people [C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALMET</FONT>].</P>

 <B>1-3. Moreover Josiah kept a
 passover</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="JFB12.htm#2Ki23_21">2Ki 23:21</A>).

 The first nine verses give an account of the preparations made for the 
 celebration of the solemn feast

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:1-9">2Ch 35:1-9</A>].

 The day appointed by the law was kept on this occasion (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:2,13">2Ch 30:2, 13</A>).

 The priests were ranged in their courses and exhorted to be ready for 
 their duties in the manner that legal purity required (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:5">2Ch 29:5</A>).

 The Levites, the ministers or instructors of the people in all matters 
 pertaining to the divine worship, were commanded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:3">2Ch 35:3</A>)

 to "put the holy ark in the house which Solomon did build." Their duty 
 was to transport the ark from place to place according to 
 circumstances. Some think that it had been ignominiously put away from 
 the sanctuary by order of some idolatrous king, probably Manasseh, who 
 set a carved image in the house of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+33:7">2Ch 33:7</A>),

 or Amon; while others are of opinion that it had been temporarily 
 removed by Josiah himself into some adjoining chamber, during the 
 repairs on the temple. In replacing it, the Levites had evidently 
 carried it upon their shoulders, deeming that still to be the duty 
 which the law imposed on them. But Josiah reminded them of the change 
 of circumstances. As the service of God was now performed in a fixed 
 and permanent temple, they were not required to be bearers of the ark 
 any longer; and, being released from the service, they should address 
 themselves with the greater alacrity to the discharge of other 
 functions.</P>

 their families in groups or companies of several households at a time.
 When the first company entered the court (which consisted commonly of
 as many as it could well hold), the gates were shut and the offering
 was made. The Levites stood in rows from the slaughtering places to the
 altar, and handed the blood and fat from one to another of the
 officiating priests

 But multitudes of the people, especially those from Israel, having been 
 reduced to poverty through the Assyrian devastations, were to be 
 provided with the means of commemorating the passover. Therefore, the 
 king enjoined the Levites that when the paschal lambs were brought to 
 them to be killed

 <B>10, 11. So the service was prepared,</B> &c.--All the necessary
 preparations having been completed, and the appointed time having
 arrived for the passover, the solemnity was celebrated. One remarkable
 feature in the account is the prominent part that was taken by the
 Levites in the preparation of the sacrifices; namely, the killing and
 stripping of the skins, which were properly the peculiar duties of the
 priests; but as those functionaries were not able to overtake the
 extraordinary amount of work and the Levites had been duly sanctified
 for the service, they were enlisted for the time in this priestly
 employment. At the passover in Hezekiah's time, the Levites officiated
 in the same departments of duty, the reason assigned for that deviation
 from the established rule being the unprepared state of many of the
 people 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:17">2Ch 30:17</A>).

 But on this occasion the whole people had been duly sanctified, and 
 therefore the exceptional enlistment of the Levites' services must have 
 been rendered unavoidably necessary from the multitudes engaged in 
 celebrating the passover.</P>

 <B>12. they removed the burnt offerings</B>--Some of the small cattle being
 designed for burnt offerings were put apart by themselves, that they
 might not be intermingled with the paschal lambs, which were carefully
 selected according to certain rules, and intended to be sacramentally
 eaten; and the manner in which those burnt offerings were presented
 seems to have been the following: "All the subdivisions of the
 different fathers' houses came one after another to the altar in solemn
 procession to bring to the priests the portions which had been cut off,
 and the priests laid these pieces upon the fire of the altar of burnt
 offering."</P>

 <B>13. they roasted the passover with fire according to the
 ordinance</B>--(See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:7-9">Ex 12:7-9</A>).

 This mode of preparation was prescribed by the law exclusively for the 
 paschal lamb; the other offerings and thank offerings were cooked in 
 pots, kettles, and pans

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:14">1Sa 2:14</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>divided them speedily among the people</B>--The haste was either owing to
 the multiplicity of the priests' business, or because the heat and
 flavor of the viands would have been otherwise diminished. Hence it
 appears that the meal consisted not of the paschal lambs alone, but of
 the meat of the thank offerings--for part of the flesh fell to the
 portion of the offerer, who, being in this instance, the king and the
 princes, were by them made over to the people, who were recommended to
 eat them the day they were offered, though not absolutely forbidden to
 do so on the next

 refreshments for themselves.</P>

 <B>15. And the singers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;., were in their place</B>--While the priests and
 people were so much engaged, the choir was not idle. They had to sing
 certain Psalms, namely, the hundred thirteenth to the hundred
 eighteenth inclusive, once, twice, and even a third time, during the
 continuance of each company of offerers. As they could not leave their
 posts, for the singing was resumed as every fresh company entered, the
 Levites prepared for them also; for the various bands relieved each
 other in turn, and while the general choir was doing duty, a portion of
 the tuneful brethren, relieved for a time, partook of the viands that
 were brought them.</P>

 <B>18. there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of
 Samuel</B>--One feature by which this passover was distinguished was the
 liberality of Josiah. But what distinguished it above all preceding
 solemnities was, not the imposing grandeur of the ceremonies, nor the
 immensity of the assembled concourse of worshippers; for these, with
 the exception of a few from the kingdom of Israel, were confined to two
 tribes; but it was the ardent devotion of the king and people, the
 disregard of purely traditional customs, and the unusually strict
 adherence, even in the smallest minuti&aelig;, to the forms of observance
 prescribed in the book of the law, the discovery of an original copy of
 which had produced so great a sensation. Instead of "from the days of
 Samuel," the author of the Book of Kings says, "from the days of the
 judges who judged Israel" 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:22">2Ki 23:22</A>].

 The meaning is the same in both passages, for Samuel concluded the era 
 of the judges.

 <B>all Judah and Israel that were present</B>--The great majority of the
 people of the northern kingdom were in exile, but some of the remaining
 inhabitants performed the journey to Jerusalem on this occasion. 37,600
 paschal lambs and kids were used, which 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:7">2Ch 35:7</A>],

 at ten to a company, would make 376,000 persons attending the 
 feast.</P>

 that Josiah sent Shaphan to Hilkiah in the eighth month of that year." 
 If this statement rests upon an historical basis, all the events 
 narrated here (at

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+34:8-35:19">2Ch 34:8-35:19</A>)

 should then have a proof that the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign was 
 reckoned from the autumn (compare

 <B>20. After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple</B>--He most
 probably calculated that the restoration of the divine worship, with
 the revival of vital religion in the land, would lead, according to
 God's promise and the uniform experience of the Hebrew people, to a
 period of settled peace and increased prosperity. His hopes were
 disappointed. The bright interval of tranquillity that followed his
 re-establishment of the true religion was brief. But it must be
 observed that this interruption did not proceed from any unfaithfulness
 in the divine promise, but from the state into which the kingdom of
 Judah had brought itself by the national apostasy, which was drawing
 down upon it the long threatened but long deferred judgments of God.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by
 Euphrates</B>--Necho, son of Psammetichus, succeeded to the throne of
 Egypt in the twentieth year of Josiah. He was a bold and enterprising
 king, who entered with all his heart into the struggle which the two
 great powers of Egypt and Assyria had long carried on for the political
 ascendency. Each, jealous of the aggressive movements of its rival, was
 desirous to maintain Palestine as a frontier barrier. After the
 overthrow of Israel, the kingdom of Judah became in that respect doubly
 important. Although the king and people had a strong bias for alliance
 with Egypt, yet from the time of Manasseh it had become a vassal of
 Assyria. Josiah, true to his political no less than his religious
 engagements, thought himself bound to support the interests of his
 Assyrian liege lord. Hence, when "Necho king of Egypt came up to fight
 Carchemish, Josiah went out against him." Carchemish, on the eastern
 side of the Euphrates, was the key of Assyria on the west, and in going
 thither the king of Egypt would transport his troops by sea along the
 coast of Palestine, northwards. Josiah, as a faithful vassal, resolved
 to oppose Necho's march across the northern parts of that country. They
 met in the "valley of Megiddo," that is, the valley or plain of
 Esdraelon. The Egyptian king had come either by water or through the
 plains of Philistia, keeping constantly along the coast, round the
 northwest corner of Carmel, and so to the great plain of Megiddo. This
 was not only his direct way to the Euphrates, but the only route fit
 for his chariots, while thereby also he left Judah and Jerusalem quite
 to his right. In this valley, however, the Egyptian army had
 necessarily to strike across the country, and it was on that occasion
 that Josiah could most conveniently intercept his passage. To avoid the
 difficulty of passing the river Kishon, Necho kept to the south of it,
 and must, therefore, have come past Megiddo. Josiah, in following with
 his chariots and horsemen from Jerusalem, had to march northwards along
 the highway through Samaria by Kefr-Kud (the ancient Caper-Cotia) to
 Megiddo [V<FONT SIZE=-1>AN</FONT>

 <B>21, 22. But he sent ambassadors .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What have I to do with thee, thou
 king of Judah?</B>--Not wishing to spend time, or strength in vain, Necho
 informed the king of Judah that he had no intention of molesting the
 Jews; that his expedition was directed solely against his old Assyrian
 enemy; and that he had undertaken it by an express commission from God.
 Commentators are not agreed whether it was really a divine commission
 given him through Jeremiah, or whether he merely used the name of God
 as an authority that Josiah would not refuse to obey. As he could not
 know the truth of Necho's declaration, Josiah did not sin in opposing
 him; or, if he sinned at all, it was a sin of ignorance. The engagement
 took place. Josiah was mortally wounded

 not reached us; but it seems to have been long preserved among his
 countrymen and chanted on certain public occasions by the professional
 singers, who probably got the dirges they sang from a collection of
 funeral odes composed on the death of good and great men of the nation.
 The spot in the valley of Megiddo where the battle was fought was near
 the town of Hadad-rimmon; hence the lamentation for the death of Josiah
 was called "the lamentation of Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddo,"
 which was so great and so long continued, that the lamentation of Hadad
 passed afterwards into a proverbial phrase to express any great and
 extraordinary sorrow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:30">2Ki 23:30</A>)

 to have received at Jerusalem the royal anointing--a ceremony not
 usually deemed necessary, in circumstances of regular and undisputed 
 succession. But, in the case of Jehoahaz, it seems to have been 
 resorted to in order to impart greater validity to the act of popular 
 election; and, it may be, to render it less likely to be disturbed by 
 Necho, who, like all Egyptians, would associate the idea of sanctity 
 with the regal anointing. He was the youngest son of Josiah, but the 
 popular favorite, probably on account of his martial spirit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:3">Eze 19:3</A>)

 and determined opposition to the aggressive views of Egypt. At his 
 accession the land was free from idolatry; but this prince, instead of 
 following the footsteps of his excellent father, adopted the criminal 
 policy of his apostatizing predecessors.  Through his influence, 
 directly or indirectly used, idolatry rapidly increased (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:32">2Ki 23:32</A>).</P>

 <B>2. he reigned three months in Jerusalem</B>--His possession of sovereign
 power was of but very brief duration; for Necho determined to follow up
 the advantage he had gained in Judah; and, deeming it expedient to have
 a king of his own nomination on the throne of that country, he deposed
 the popularly elected monarch and placed his brother Eliakim or
 Jehoiakim on the throne, whom he anticipated to be a mere obsequious
 vassal. The course of events seems to have been this: on receiving
 intelligence after the battle of the accession of Jehoahaz to the
 throne, and perhaps also in consequence of the complaint which Eliakim
 brought before him in regard to this matter, Necho set out with a part
 of his forces to Jerusalem, while the remainder of his troops pursued
 their way at leisure towards Riblah, laid a tribute on the country,
 raised Eliakim (Jehoiakim) as his vassal to the throne, and on his
 departure brought Jehoahaz captive with him to Riblah. The old
 expositors mostly assumed that Necho, after the battle of Megiddo,
 marched directly against Carchemish, and then on his return came to
 Jerusalem. The improbability, indeed the impossibility, of his doing so
 appears from this: Carchemish was from four hundred to five hundred
 miles from Megiddo, so that within "three months" an army could not
 possibly make its way thither, conquer the fenced city of Carchemish,
 and then march back a still greater distance to Jerusalem, and take
 that city [K<FONT SIZE=-1>EIL</FONT>].</P>

 <B>5. Jehoiakim .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did that which was evil in the sight of the
 Lord</B>--He followed the course of his idolatrous predecessors; and
 the people, to a great extent, disinclined to the reforming policy of
 his father, eagerly availed themselves of the vicious license which his
 lax administration restored. His character is portrayed with a masterly
 hand in the prophecy of Jeremiah 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:13-19">Jer 22:13-19</A>).

 As the deputy of the king of Egypt, he departed further than his 
 predecessor from the principles of Josiah's government; and, in trying 
 to meet the insatiable cupidity of his master by grinding exactions 
 from his subjects, he recklessly plunged into all evil.</P>

 <B>6. Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</B>--This refers
 to the first expedition of Nebuchadnezzar against Palestine, in the
 lifetime of his father Nabopolassar, who, being old and infirm, adopted
 his son as joint sovereign and despatched him, with the command of his
 army, against the Egyptian invaders of his empire. Nebuchadnezzar
 defeated them at Carchemish, drove them out of Asia, and reduced all
 the provinces west of the Euphrates to obedience--among the rest the
 kingdom of Jehoiakim, who became a vassal of the Assyrian empire

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:1">2Ki 24:1</A>).

 Jehoiakim at the end of three years threw off the yoke, being probably 
 instigated to revolt by the solicitations of the king of Egypt, who 
 planned a new expedition against Carchemish. But he was completely 
 vanquished by the Babylonian king, who stripped him of all his 
 possessions between the Euphrates and the Nile

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:7">2Ki 24:7</A>).
 
 Then marching against the Egyptian's ally in Judah, he took Jerusalem,
 carried away a portion of the sacred vessels of the temple, perhaps in
 lieu of the unpaid tribute, and deposited them in the temple of his
 god, Belus, at Babylon 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:2,5:2">Da 1:2; 5:2</A>).

 Though Jehoiakim had been taken prisoner (and it was designed at first
 to transport him in chains to Babylon), he was allowed to remain in his 
 tributary kingdom. But having given not long after some new offense, 
 Jerusalem was besieged by a host of Assyrian dependents. In a sally 
 against them Jehoiakim was killed (see on

 against Jerusalem, captured the city, and sent Jehoiachin in chains to 
 Babylon, removing at the same time all the nobles and most skilful 
 artisans, and pillaging all the remaining treasures both of the temple

 so that his revolt by joining in a league with Pharaoh-hophra, king of 
 Egypt, involved the crime of perjury. His own pride and obdurate 
 impiety, the incurable idolatry of the nation, and their reckless 
 disregard of prophetic warnings, brought down on his already sadly 
 reduced kingdom the long threatened judgments of God.  Nebuchadnezzar, 
 the executioner of the divine vengeance, commenced a third siege of 
 Jerusalem, which, after holding out for a year and a half, was taken in 
 the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah. It resulted in the burning 
 of the temple, with, most probably, the ark, and in the overthrow of 
 the kingdom of Judah (see on
