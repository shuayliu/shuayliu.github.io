 The Gnostic M<FONT SIZE=-1>ARCION</FONT> alone rejected these 
 Epistles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>HERESIES OPPOSED</FONT> in them form the transition
 stage from Judaism, in its ascetic form, to Gnosticism, as subsequently 
 developed. The references to Judaism and legalism are clear

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:7,4:3,Tit+1:10,14,3:9">1Ti 1:7; 4:3;
 Tit 1:10, 14; 3:9</A>).

 Traces of beginning Gnosticism are also unequivocal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:4">1Ti 1:4</A>).

 The Gnostic theory of a twofold principle from the beginning, evil as
 well as good, appears in germ in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:3">1Ti 4:3</A>,
 
 &c. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:20">1Ti 6:20</A>

 the term <I>Gnosis</I> ("science") itself occurs. Another Gnostic 
 error, namely, that "the resurrection is past," is alluded to in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:17,18">2Ti 2:17, 18</A>.

 The Judaism herein opposed is not that of the earlier Epistles, which 
 upheld the law and tried to join it with faith in Christ for 
 justification. It first passed into that phase of it which appears in 
 the Epistle to the Colossians, whereby will-worship and angel-worship 
 were superadded to Judaizing opinions. Then a further stage of the same 
 evil appears in the Epistle to the Philippians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:2,18,19">Php 3:2, 18, 19</A>),

 whereby <I>immoral practice</I> accompanied false doctrine as to the 
 resurrection (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:18,1Co+15:12,32,33">2Ti 2:18,
 with 1Co 15:12, 32, 33</A>).

 This descent from legality to superstition, and from superstition to
 godlessness, appears more matured in the references to it in these 
 Pastoral Epistles. The false teachers now know not the true use of 
 <I>the law</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:7,8">1Ti 1:7, 8</A>),

 and further, have <I>put away good conscience</I> as well as <I>the 
 faith</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:19,4:2">1Ti 1:19; 4:2</A>);

 <I>speak lies in hypocrisy,</I> are <I>corrupt in mind,</I> and regard
 <I>godliness as a means of earthly gain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:5">1Ti 6:5</A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:11">Tit 1:11</A>);

 <I>overthrow the faith</I> by heresies <I>eating as a canker, 
 saying</I> the <I>resurrection is past</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:17,18">2Ti 2:17, 18</A>),

 <I>leading captive silly women, ever learning yet never knowing the 
 truth, reprobate as Jannes and Jambres</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:6,8">2Ti 3:6, 8</A>),

 <I>defiled, unbelieving, professing to know God, but in works denying 
 Him, abominable, disobedient, reprobate</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:15,16">Tit 1:15, 16</A>).

 This description accords with that in the Catholic Epistles of St. John 
 and St. Peter, and, in the Epistle to the Hebrews. This fact proves the 
 later date of these Pastoral Epistles as compared with Paul's earlier 
 Epistles. The Judaism reprobated herein is not that of an earlier date, 
 so scrupulous as to the law; it was now tending to immortality of 
 practice. On the other hand, the Gnosticism opposed in these Epistles 
 is not the <I>anti-Judaic</I> Gnosticism of a later date, which arose 
 as a consequence of the overthrow of Judaism by the destruction of 
 Jerusalem and the temple, but it was the intermediate phase between 
 Judaism and Gnosticism, in which the Oriental and Greek elements of the 
 latter were in a kind of amalgam with Judaism, just prior to the 
 overthrow of Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>DIRECTIONS AS TO CHURCH GOVERNORS</FONT> and 
 ministers, "bishop-elders, and deacons," are such as were natural for 
 the apostle, in prospect of his own approaching removal, to give to 
 Timothy, the president of the Church at Ephesus, and to Titus, holding 
 the same office in Crete, for securing the due administration of the 
 Church when he should be no more, and at a time when heresies were 
 rapidly springing up. Compare his similar anxiety in his address to the
 Ephesian elders

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:21-30">Ac 20:21-30</A>).

 The Presbyterate (elders; <I>priest</I> is a contraction from 
 presbyter) and Diaconate had existed from the earliest times in the 
 Church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:3,11:30,14:23">Ac 6:3; 11:30; 14:23</A>).

 Timothy and Titus, as superintendents or overseers (so <I>bishop</I>
 subsequently meant), were to exercise the same power in ordaining 
 elders <I>at Ephesus</I> which the apostle had exercised in his 
 <I>general</I> supervision of all the Gentile churches.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>PECULIARITIES OF MODES OF THOUGHT AND EXPRESSION</FONT>, are such as
 the <I>difference of subject and circumstances of those addressed</I> and
 <I>those spoken of</I> in these Epistles, as compared with the other
 Epistles, would lead us to expect. Some of these peculiar phrases occur
 also in Galatians, in which, as in the Pastoral Epistles, he, with his
 characteristic fervor, attacks the false teachers. Compare

 Tit 2:14</A>,

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>IME AND PLACE OF WRITING</FONT>.--The First Epistle to
 Timothy was written not long after Paul had left Ephesus for Macedon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:3">1Ti 1:3</A>).

 Now, as Timothy was in Macedon with Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:1">2Co 1:1</A>)

 on the occasion of Paul's having passed from Ephesus into that country, 
 as recorded,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:22,20:1">Ac 19:22; 20:1</A>,

 whereas the First Epistle to Timothy contemplates a longer stay of 
 Timothy in Ephesus, M<FONT SIZE=-1>OSHEIM</FONT> supposes that Paul was 
 nine <I>months</I> of the "three years" stay mostly at Ephesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:31">Ac 20:31</A>)

 in Macedonia, and elsewhere (perhaps Crete), (the mention of only 
 "three months" and "two years,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:8,10">Ac 19:8, 10</A>,

 favors this, the remaining nine months being spent elsewhere); and that 
 during these nine months Timothy, in Paul's absence, superintended the 
 Church of Ephesus. It is not likely that Ephesus and the neighboring 
 churches should have been left long without church officers and church 
 organization, rules respecting which are giver in this Epistle. 
 Moreover, Timothy was still "a youth"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:12">1Ti 4:12</A>),

 which he could hardly be called <I>after</I> Paul's first imprisonment, 
 when he must have been at least thirty-four years of age. Lastly, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:25">Ac 20:25</A>,

 Paul asserts his <I>knowledge</I> that <I>the Ephesians should not all 
 see his face again,</I> so that

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:3">1Ti 1:3</A>
 
 will thus refer to his sojourn at Ephesus, recorded in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:10">Ac 19:10</A>,

 whence he passed into Macedonia. But the difficulty is to account for 
 the false teachers having sprung up almost immediately (according to 
 this theory) after the foundation of the Church. However, his visit
 recorded in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:1-41">Ac 19:1-41</A>

 was not his first visit. The beginning of the Church at Ephesus was
 probably made at his visit a year before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:19-21">Ac 18:19-21</A>).

 Apollos, Aquila and Priscilla, carried on the work

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:24-26">Ac 18:24-26</A>).

 Thus, as to the sudden growth of false teachers, there was time enough 
 for their springing up, especially considering that the first converts 
 at Ephesus were under Apollos' imperfect Christian teachings at first, 
 imbued as he was likely to be with the tenets of P<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>HILO</FONT> of Alexandria, Apollos' native town, combined with 
 John the Baptist's Old Testament teachings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:24-26">Ac 18:24-26</A>).

 Besides Ephesus, from its position in Asia, its notorious 
 voluptuousness and sorcery

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:18,19">Ac 19:18, 19</A>),

 and its lewd worship of Diana (answering to the Ph&oelig;nician 
 Ashtoreth), was likely from the first to tinge Christianity in some of 
 its converts with Oriental speculations and Asiatic licentiousness of 
 practices. Thus the phenomenon of the phase of error presented in this 
 Epistle, being <I>intermediate between Judaism and later Gnosticism</I> 
 (see above), would be such as might occur at an early period in the 
 <I>Ephesian</I> Church, as well as later, when we know it had open 
 "apostles" of error

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:2,6">Re 2:2, 6</A>),

 and Nicolaitans infamous in practice. As to the close connection 
 between this First Epistle and the Second Epistle (which must have been 
 written at the close of Paul's life), on which A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> relies for his theory of making the First Epistle 
 also written at the close of Paul's life, the similarity of 
 circumstances, the person addressed being one and the same, and either 
 in Ephesus at the time, or at least connected with Ephesus as its 
 church overseer, and having heretics to contend with of the same stamp 
 as in the First Epistle, would account for the connection. There is not 
 so great identity of tone as to compel us to adopt the theory that some 
 years <I>could not</I> have elapsed between the two Epistles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 However, all these arguments against the later date may be answered.
 This First Epistle may refer not to the <I>first</I> organization of the
 Church under its bishops, or elders and deacons, but to the
 <I>moral qualifications</I> laid down at a later period for those officers
 when scandals rendered such directions needful. Indeed, the object for
 which he left Timothy at Ephesus he states 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:3">1Ti 1:3</A>)

 to be, not to organize the Church for the first time, but to restrain 
 the false teachers. The directions as to the choice of fit elders and 
 deacons refer to the filling up of vacancies, not to their first 
 appointment. The fact of there existing an institution for Church
 widows implies an established organization. As to Timothy's "youth," it 
 may be spoken of <I>comparatively young</I> compared with Paul, now 
 "the aged"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:9">Phm 9</A>),

 and with some of the Ephesian elders, senior to Timothy <I>their
 overseer.</I> As to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:25">Ac 20:25</A>,

 we know not but that "all" of the elders of Ephesus called to Miletus 
 "never saw Paul's face" afterwards, as he "knew" (doubtless by 
 inspiration) would be the case, which obviates the need of A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT> lax view, that Paul was wrong in this his 
 positive inspired anticipation (for such it was, not a mere boding 
 surmise as to the future). Thus he probably visited Ephesus again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:3,2Ti+1:18,4:20">1Ti 1:3;
 2Ti 1:18; 4:20</A>, 

 he would hardly have been <I>at Miletum,</I> so near Ephesus, without
 visiting Ephesus) after his first imprisonment in Rome, though all the 
 Ephesian elders whom he had addressed formerly at Miletus did not again 
 see him. The general similarity of subject and style, and of the 
 <I>state of the</I> Church between the two Epistles, favors the view 
 that they were near one another in date. Also, against the theory of 
 the early date is the difficulty of defining, when, during Paul's two 
 or three years' stay at Ephesus, we can insert an absence of Paul from 
 Ephesus long enough for the requirements of the case, which imply a 
 lengthened stay and superintendence of Timothy at Ephesus (see, 
 however,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:14">1Ti 3:14</A>,

 on the other side) after having been "left" by Paul there. Timothy did 
 not stay there when Paul left Ephesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:22,20:1,2Co+1:1">Ac 19:22; 20:1;
 2Co 1:1</A>). 
 
 In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:14">1Ti 3:14</A>,

 Paul says, "I write, hoping to come unto thee <I>shortly,</I>" but on 
 the earlier occasion of his passing from Ephesus to Macedon he had no 
 such expectation, but had planned to spend the summer in Macedon, and 
 the winter in Corinth,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:6">1Co 16:6</A>).

 The expression "<I>Till</I> I come"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:13">1Ti 4:13</A>),

 implies that Timothy was not to leave his post till Paul should arrive; 
 this and the former objection, however, do not hold good against M<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OSHEIM'S</FONT> theory. Moreover, Paul in his farewell address 
 to the Ephesian elders <I>prophetically anticipates</I> the rise of 
 false teachers <I>hereafter</I> of their own selves; therefore this 
 First Epistle, which speaks of their <I>actual</I> presence at Ephesus, 
 would naturally seem to be not prior, but subsequent, to the address, 
 that is, will belong to the later date assigned. In the Epistle to the 
 Ephesians no notice is taken of the Judaeo-Gnostic errors, which would 
 have been noticed had they been really in existence; however, they are 
 alluded to in the contemporaneous sister Epistle to Colossians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:1-23">Col 2:1-23</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Whatever doubt must always remain as to the date of the First
 Epistle, there can be hardly any as to that of the Second Epistle. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:13">2Ti 4:13</A>,

 Paul directs Timothy to bring the books and cloak which the apostle had 
 left at Troas. Assuming that the visit to Troas referred to is the one 
 mentioned in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:5-7">Ac 20:5-7</A>,

 it will follow that the cloak and parchments lay for about seven years 
 at Troas, that being the time that elapsed between the visit and Paul's 
 first imprisonment at Rome: a very unlikely supposition, that he should 
 have left either unused for so long. Again, when, during his first 
 Roman imprisonment, he wrote to the Colossians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:14">Col 4:14</A>)
 
 and Philemon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:24">Phm 24</A>),
 
 Demas was with him; but when he was writing

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:10">2Ti 4:10</A>,

 Demas had forsaken him from love of this world, and gone to
 Thessalonica. Again, when he wrote to the Ephesians, Colossians, 
 Philippians, and Philemon, he had good hopes of a speedy liberation; 
 but here in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:6-8">2Ti 4:6-8</A>,

 he anticipates immediate death, having been at least once already tried

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:16">2Ti 4:16</A>).

 Again, he is in this Epistle represented as in closer confinement than 
 he was when writing those former Epistles in his first imprisonment 
 (even in the Philippians, which represent him in greater uncertainty as 
 to his life, he cherished the hope of soon being delivered,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:24,2Ti+1:16-18,2:9,4:6-8,16">Php 2:24;
 2Ti 1:16-18; 2:9; 4:6-8, 16</A>).

 Again 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:20">2Ti 4:20</A>),

 he speaks of having left Trophimus sick at Miletum. This could not have 
 been on the occasion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:15">Ac 20:15</A>.

 For Trophimus was with Paul at Jerusalem shortly afterwards

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:29">Ac 21:29</A>).

 Besides, he would thus be made to speak of an event six or seven years 
 after its occurrence, as a recent event: moreover, Timothy was, on that 
 occasion of the apostle being at Miletum, with Paul, and therefore 
 needed not to be informed of Trophimus' sickness there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:4-17">Ac 20:4-17</A>).
 
 Also, the statement

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:20">2Ti 4:20</A>),

 "Erastus abode at Corinth," implies that Paul had shortly before been 
 at Corinth, and left Erastus there; but Paul had not been at Corinth 
 for several years before his first imprisonment, and in the interval 
 Timothy had been with him, so that he did not need to write 
 subsequently about that visit. He must therefore have been liberated 
 after his first imprisonment (indeed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:23,24">Heb 13:23, 24</A>,

 expressly proves that the writer was in <I>Italy</I> and <I>at 
 liberty</I>), and resumed his apostolic journeyings, and been 
 imprisoned at Rome again, whence shortly before his death he wrote 
 Second Timothy.</P>

 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Chronicles,</I> Anno 2083] (beginning 
 October, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 67), says, "Nero, to his other 
 crimes, added the persecution of Christians: under him the apostles 
 Peter and Paul consummated their martyrdom at Rome." So J<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> [<I>On Illustrious Men</I>], "In the fourteenth 
 year of Nero, Paul was beheaded at Rome for Christ's sake, on the same 
 day as Peter, and was buried on the Ostian Road, in the thirty-seventh 
 year after the death of our Lord." A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> 
 reasonably conjectures the Pastoral Epistles were written near this 
 date. The interval was possibly filled up (so C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT 
 OF</FONT> R<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT> states that Paul preached as far as 
 "to the extremity of the west") by a journey to Spain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:24,28">Ro 15:24, 28</A>),

 according to his own original intention. M<FONT
 SIZE=-1>URATORI'S</FONT> <I>Fragment on the Canon of Scripture</I> 
 (about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 170) also alleges Paul's journey into 
 Spain. So E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>, C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT>, and J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT>. Be that as 
 it may, he seems shortly before his second imprisonment to have visited 
 Ephesus, where a new body of elders governed the Church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:25">Ac 20:25</A>),

 say in the latter end of <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 66, or beginning of 
 67. Supposing him thirty at his conversion, he would now be upwards of
 sixty, and older in constitution than in years, through continual 
 hardship. Even four years before he called himself "Paul the aged"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:9">Phm 9</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 From Ephesus he went into Macedonia 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:3">1Ti 1:3</A>).

 He may have written the First Epistle to Timothy from that country. But 
 his use of "went," not "came," in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:3">1Ti 1:3</A>,

 "When I went into Macedonia," implies he was not there when writing. 
 Wherever he was, he writes uncertain how long he may be detained from 
 coming to Timothy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:14,15">1Ti 3:14, 15</A>).

 B<FONT SIZE=-1>IRKS</FONT> shows the probability that he wrote from 
 Corinth, between which city and Ephesus the communication was rapid and 
 easy. His course, as on both former occasions, was from Macedon to 
 Corinth. He finds a coincidence between

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:11-14,1Co+14:34">1Ti 2:11-14,
 and 1Co 14:34</A>,

 and 1Co 9:8-10</A>,

 as to the maintenance of ministers, on the same principle as the Mosaic
 law, that the ox should not be muzzled that treadeth out the corn; and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:19,20,2Co+13:1-4">1Ti 5:19, 20,
 and 2Co 13:1-4</A>,

 as to charges against elders. It would be natural for the apostle <I>in
 the very place where these directions had been enforced,</I> to 
 reproduce them in his letter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The date of the Epistle to Titus must depend on that assigned to
 First Timothy, with which it is connected in subject, phraseology, and
 tone. There is no difficulty in the Epistle to Titus,
 <I>viewed by itself,</I> in assigning it to the earlier date, namely,
 before Paul's first imprisonment. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:18,19">Ac 18:18, 19</A>,

 Paul, in journeying from Corinth to Palestine, for some cause or other 
 landed at Ephesus. Now we find

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:13">Tit 3:13</A>)

 that Apollos in going from Ephesus to Corinth was to touch <I>at 
 Crete</I> (which seems to coincide with Apollos' journey from Ephesus 
 to Corinth, recorded in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:24,27,19:1">Ac 18:24, 27; 19:1</A>);

 therefore it is not unlikely that Paul may have taken Crete similarly
 on his way between Corinth and Ephesus; or, perhaps been driven out of 
 his course to it in one of his three shipwrecks spoken of in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:25,26">2Co 11:25, 26</A>;

 this will account for his taking Ephesus on his way from Corinth to 
 Palestine, though out of his regular course. At Ephesus Paul may have 
 written the Epistle to Titus [H<FONT SIZE=-1>UG</FONT>]; there he 
 probably met Apollos and gave the Epistle to Titus to his charge, 
 before his departure for Corinth by way of Crete, and before the 
 apostle's departure for Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:19-21,24">Ac 18:19-21, 24</A>).

 Moreover, on Paul's way back from Jerusalem and Antioch, he travelled 
 some time in Upper Asia

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:1">Ac 19:1</A>);

 and it was then, probably, that his intention to "winter at Nicopolis" 
 was realized, there being a town of that name between Antioch and 
 Tarsus, lying on Paul's route to Galatia

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:12">Tit 3:12</A>).

 Thus, First Timothy will, in this theory, be placed two and a half 
 years later

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:1">Ac 20:1</A>;
 
 compare

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT> argument for classing the Epistle to 
 Titus with First Timothy, as written after Paul's first Roman 
 imprisonment, stands or falls with his argument for assigning First 
 Timothy to that date. Indeed, H<FONT SIZE=-1>UG'S</FONT>
 unobjectionable argument for the earlier date of the Epistle to Titus, 
 favors the early date assigned to First Timothy, which is so much akin
 to it, if other arguments be not thought to counterbalance this. The
 Church of Crete had been just founded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:5">Tit 1:5</A>),

 and yet the same heresies are censured in it as in Ephesus, which shows 
 that no argument, such as A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> alleges against 
 the earlier date of First Timothy, can be drawn from them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:10,11,15,16,3:9,11">Tit 1:10, 11, 15, 16; 3:9, 11</A>).

 But vice versa, if, as seems likely from the arguments adduced, the
 First Epistle to Timothy be assigned to the later date, the Epistle to
 Titus must, from similarity of style, belong to the same period. 

 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> traces Paul's last journey <I>before his
 second imprisonment</I> thus: To Crete

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:5">Tit 1:5</A>),
 
 Miletus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:20">2Ti 4:20</A>),

 Colosse (fulfilling his intention,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:22">Phm 22</A>),

 Ephesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:3,2Ti+1:18">1Ti 1:3;
 2Ti 1:18</A>), 

 from which neighborhood he wrote the Epistle to Titus; Troas,
 Macedonia, Corinth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:20">2Ti 4:20</A>),
 
 Nicopolis

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:12">Tit 3:12</A>)

 <I>in Epirus,</I> where he had intended to winter; a place in which, as 
 being a Roman colony, he would be free from tumultuary violence, and 
 yet would be more open to a direct attack from foes in the metropolis, 
 Rome. Being known in Rome as the leader of the Christians, he was 
 probably [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>] arrested as implicated in 
 causing the fire in <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 64, attributed by Nero to 
 the Christians, and was sent to Rome by the Duumvirs of Nicopolis. 
 There he was imprisoned as a common malefactor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:9">2Ti 2:9</A>);

 his Asiatic friends deserted him, except Onesiphorus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:16">2Ti 1:16</A>).

 Demas, Crescens, and Titus, left him. Tychicus he had sent to Ephesus. 
 Luke alone remained with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:10-12">2Ti 4:10-12</A>).

 Under the circumstances he writes the Second Epistle to Timothy, most 
 likely while Timothy was at Ephesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:17">2Ti 2:17</A>;
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:20,2Ti+4:13">1Ti 1:20;
 2Ti 4:13</A>),

 begging him to come to him before winter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:21">2Ti 4:21</A>),

 and anticipating his own execution soon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:6">2Ti 4:6</A>).

 Tychicus was perhaps the bearer of the Second Epistle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:12">2Ti 4:12</A>).

 His defense was not made before the emperor, for the latter was then in 
 Greece

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:16,17">2Ti 4:16, 17</A>).

 Tradition represents that he died by the sword, which accords with the 
 fact that his Roman citizenship would exempt him from torture; probably 
 late in <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 67 or <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 68, 
 the last year of Nero.</P>

 <I>Timothy</I> is first mentioned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:1">Ac 16:1</A>,

 as dwelling in Lystra (not Derbe, compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:4">Ac 20:4</A>).
 
 His mother was a Jewess named Eunice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:5">2Ti 1:5</A>);

 his father, "a Greek" (that is, a Gentile). As Timothy is mentioned as 
 "a disciple" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:1">Ac 16:1</A>,

 he must have been converted before, and this by Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:2">1Ti 1:2</A>),

 probably at his former visit to Lystra

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:6">Ac 14:6</A>);

 at the same time, probably, that his Scripture-loving mother, Eunice, 
 and grandmother, Lois, were converted to Christ from Judaism

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:14,15">2Ti 3:14, 15</A>).

 Not only the good report given as to him by the brethren of Lystra, but 
 also his origin, partly Jewish, partly Gentile, adapted him specially 
 for being Paul's assistant in missionary work, laboring as the apostle 
 did in each place, firstly among the Jews, and then among the Gentiles. 
 In order to obviate Jewish prejudices, he first circumcised him. He 
 seems to have accompanied Paul in his tour through Macedonia; but when 
 the apostle went forward to Athens, Timothy and Silas remained in 
 Berea. Having been sent back by Paul to visit the Thessalonian Church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:2">1Th 3:2</A>),
 
 he brought his report of it to the apostle at Corinth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:6">1Th 3:6</A>).

 Hence we find his name joined with Paul's in the addresses of both the 
 Epistles to Thessalonians, which were written at Corinth. We again find 
 him "ministering to" Paul during the lengthened stay at Ephesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:22">Ac 19:22</A>).

 Thence he was sent before Paul into Macedonia and to Corinth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:17,16:10">1Co 4:17; 16:10</A>).

 He was with Paul when he wrote the Second Epistle to Corinthians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:1">2Co 1:1</A>);

 and the following winter in Corinth, when Paul sent from thence his 
 Epistle to the Romans

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:21">Ro 16:21</A>).

 On Paul's return to Asia through Macedonia, he went forward and waited 
 for the apostle at Troas

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:3-5">Ac 20:3-5</A>).

 Next we find him with Paul during his imprisonment at Rome, when the 
 apostle wrote the Epistles to Colossians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:1">Col 1:1</A>),
 
 Philemon
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:1">Phm 1</A>),

 and Philippians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:1">Php 1:1</A>).

 He was imprisoned and set at liberty about the same time as the writer 
 of the Hebrews

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:23">Heb 13:23</A>).

 In the Pastoral Epistles, we find him mentioned as left by the apostle 
 at Ephesus to superintend the Church there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:3">1Ti 1:3</A>).

 The last notice of him is in the request which Paul makes to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:21">2Ti 4:21</A>)

 to "come before winter," that is about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 67 
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT>
 [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.42], reports that he was first bishop 
 of Ephesus; and [NICOPHORUS, <I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.11], 
 represents that he died by martyrdom. If then, St. John, as tradition 
 represents, resided and died in that city, it must have been <I>at a 
 later period.</I> Paul himself ordained or consecrated him with laying 
 on of his own hands, and those of the presbytery, in accordance with 
 prophetic intimations given respecting him by those possessing the 
 prophetic gift

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:18,4:14">1Ti 1:18; 4:14</A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:6">2Ti 1:6</A>).

 His self-denying character is shown by his leaving home at once to
 accompany the apostle, and submitting to circumcision for the Gospel's 
 sake; and also by his abstemiousness (noted in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:23">1Ti 5:23</A>)

 notwithstanding his bodily infirmities, which would have warranted a 
 more generous diet. Timidity and a want of self-confidence and boldness 
 in dealing with the difficulties of his position, seem to have been a 
 defect in his otherwise beautiful character as a Christian minister

 The <FONT SIZE=-1>DESIGN</FONT> of the First Epistle was: (1) to direct

 doctrine than that of the Gospel

 (2) to give him instructions as to the orderly conducting of worship,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:1-6:2">1Ti 2:1-6:2</A>);

 (3) to warn against covetousness, a sin prevalent at Ephesus, and to 
 urge to good works

 If the earlier date be assigned to First Timothy, it will fall not long 
 after, or before (according as the Epistle to the Galatians was written 
 at Ephesus or at Corinth) the writing of the Epistle to the Galatians, 
 which also would account for some similarity of style. "Mercy" is grace 
 of a more tender kind, exercised towards the <I>miserable,</I> the 
 experience of which in one's own case especially fits for the Gospel 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>MINISTRY</FONT>. Compare as to Paul himself

 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. He did not use "mercy" as to the
 churches, because "mercy" in all its fulness already existed towards 
 them; but in the case of an individual minister, fresh measures of it 
 were continually needed. "Grace" has reference to the <I>sins</I> of 
 men; "mercy" to their <I>misery.</I> God extends His <I>grace</I> to

 <B>Jesus Christ</B>--The oldest manuscripts read the order, "Christ Jesus."
 In the Pastoral Epistles "Christ" is often put before "Jesus," to give
 prominence to the fact that the <I>Messianic</I> promises of the Old
 Testament, well known to Timothy

 <I>locum tenens</I> for the apostle, and so was temporary. Thus, the office
 of superintending overseer, needed for a time at Ephesus or Crete, in
 the absence of the presiding apostle, subsequently became a permanent
 institution on the removal, by death, of the apostles who heretofore
 superintended the churches. The first title of these overseers seems to
 have been "angels"

 (see

 <A HREF="#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>), 

 this Epistle was written subsequently to Paul's first imprisonment, the 
 apparent discrepancy between his prophecy and the event may be 
 reconciled by considering that the terms of the former were not that 
 <I>he</I> should never visit <I>Ephesus</I> again (which this verse 
 implies he did), but that <I>they all</I> should "see his face no

 Judaizers here alluded to, while maintaining the perpetual obligation of
 the Mosaic law, joined with it a theosophic ascetic tendency, pretending
 to see in it mysteries deeper than others could see. The
 <I>seeds, not the full-grown</I> Gnosticism of the post-apostolic age, then
 existed. This formed the transition stage between Judaism and
 Gnosticism. "Endless" refers to the tedious unprofitableness of their
 lengthy genealogies (compare

 <B>15. be saved in childbearing</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "in (literally,

 <I>Through,</I> or <I>by,</I> is often so used to express not <I>the 
 means of</I> her salvation, but <I>the circumstances</I> 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>AMIDST</FONT> <I>which</I> it has place. Thus

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:15">1Co 3:15</A>,

 "He .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be saved: yet so as by (literally, 
 '<I>through,</I>' that is, amidst) fire": in spite of the fiery ordeal 
 which he has necessarily to pass <I>through,</I> he shall be saved. So 
 here, "<I>In spite of</I> the trial of childbearing which she passes 
 <I>through</I> (as her portion of the curse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:16">Ge 3:16</A>,

 'in sorrow shalt thou <I>bring forth children</I>'), she shall be 
 saved." Moreover, I think it is <I>implied</I> indirectly that the very 
 curse will be turned into a condition favorable to her salvation, by 
 her faithfully performing her part in doing and suffering what God has 
 assigned to her, namely, <I>child-bearing</I> and home duties, 
 <I>her</I> sphere, as distinguished from public teaching, which is not 
 hers, but <I>man's</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:11,12">1Ti 2:11, 12</A>).

 In this home sphere, not ordinarily in one of active duty for advancing 
 the kingdom of God, which contradicts the position assigned to her by 
 God, she will be saved on the same terms as all others, namely, by 
 living faith. Some think that there is a reference to the Incarnation 
 "through <FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT> child-bearing" (<I>Greek</I>), the 
 bearing of the child Jesus. Doubtless this is the ground of women's 
 <I>child-bearing</I> in general becoming to them a blessing, instead of 
 a curse; just as in the original prophecy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15,16">Ge 3:15, 16</A>)

 the promise of "the Seed of the woman" (the Saviour) stands in closest 
 connection with the woman's being doomed to "sorrow" in "bringing forth 
 children," her very <I>child-bearing,</I> though <I>in sorrow,</I> 
 being the function assigned to her by God whereby the Saviour was born. 
 This may be an ulterior reference of the Holy Spirit in this verse; but 
 the primary reference required by the context is the one above given. 
 "She shall be saved ([though] with childbearing)," that is, though 
 suffering her part of the primeval curse in childbearing; just as a man 
 shall be saved, though having to bear his part, namely, the sweat of 
 the brow.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>if they,</B> &c.--"if <I>the women</I> (plural, taken out of 'the woman,'

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:14">1Ti 2:14</A>,

 Mental receptivity and activity in family life were recognized in 
 Christianity as the destiny of woman. One reason alleged here by Paul, 
 is the greater danger of self-deception in the weaker sex, and the 
 spread of errors arising from it, especially in a class of addresses in

 <B>husband of one wife</B>--confuting the celibacy of Rome's 
 priesthood. Though the Jews practiced polygamy, yet as he is writing
 as to a Gentile Church, and as polygamy was never allowed among even 
 laymen in the Church, the ancient interpretation that the prohibition 
 here is against polygamy in a candidate bishop is not correct. It must, 
 therefore, mean that, though laymen might lawfully marry again,
 candidates for the episcopate or presbytery were better to have been
 married only <I>once.</I> As in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:9">1Ti 5:9</A>,

 "wife of one man," implies a woman married but once; so "husband of one
 wife" here must mean the same. The feeling which prevailed among the 
 Gentiles, as well as the Jews (compare as to Anna,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:36,37">Lu 2:36, 37</A>),

 against a second marriage would, on the ground of expediency and 
 conciliation in matters indifferent and not involving compromise of 
 principle, account for Paul's prohibition here in the case of one in so 
 prominent a sphere as a bishop or a deacon. Hence the stress that is 
 laid in the context on <I>the repute</I> in which the candidate for 
 orders is held among those over whom he is to preside

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:16">Tit 1:16</A>).

 The Council of Laodicea and the apostolic canons discountenanced second 
 marriages, especially in the case of candidates for ordination. Of 
 course second marriage being <I>lawful,</I> the undesirableness of it 
 holds good only under special circumstances. It is implied here also, 
 that he who has a wife and virtuous family, is to be preferred to a 
 bachelor; for he who is himself bound to discharge the domestic duties 
 mentioned here, is likely to be more attractive to those who have 
 similar ties, for he teaches them not only by precept, but also by 
 example

 <B>8.</B> The <I>deacons</I> were chosen by the voice of the people.
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>YPRIAN</FONT>
 [<I>Epistle,</I> 2.5] says that good bishops never departed from the old
 custom of consulting the people. The deacons answer to the <I>chazzan</I> of
 the synagogue: the attendant <I>ministers,</I> or subordinate coadjutors of
 the presbyter (as Timothy himself was to Paul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:6,Phile+1:13">1Ti 4:6;
 Phm 13</A>;
 
 and John Mark,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:5">Ac 13:5</A>).

 Their duty was to read the Scriptures in the Church, to instruct the 
 catechumens in Christian truths, to assist the presbyters at the 
 sacraments, to receive oblations, and to preach and instruct. As the 
 "chazzan" covered and uncovered the ark in the synagogue, containing 
 the law, so the deacon in the ancient Church put the covering on the 
 communion table. (See C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT> [19], 
 <I>Homily</I> on Acts; T<FONT SIZE=-1>HEOPHYLACT</FONT> on Luke 19; and 
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ALSAMAN</FONT> on <I>Canon</I> 22, <I>Council of 
 Laodicea</I>). The appointing of "the seven" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:1-7">Ac 6:1-7</A>

 is perhaps not meant to describe the <I>first</I> appointment of the 
 deacons of the Church. At least the <I>chazzan</I> previously suggested 
 the similar order of deacons.

 <B>double-tongued</B>--literally, "of double speech"; saying one thing 
 to this person, and another to that person

 that deacons would have with the members of the Church might prove a
 temptation to such a fault. Others explain it, "Saying one thing,
 thinking another"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:19,Ga+2:13">Pr 20:19;

 overseers. Moreover, if the wives of the deacons were meant, there seems
 no reason for the omission of "their" (not in the <I>Greek</I>). Also the
 <I>Greek</I> for "even so" (the same as for "likewise,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:8">1Ti 3:8</A>,

 and "in like manner,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:9">1Ti 2:9</A>),

 denotes a transition to another class of persons. Further, there were 
 doubtless deaconesses at Ephesus, such as Ph&oelig;be was at Cenchrea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:1">Ro 16:1</A>,

 "servant," <I>Greek,</I> "deaconess"), yet no mention is made of them 
 in this Epistle if not here; whereas, supposing them to be meant here, 
 the third chapter embraces in due proportion all the persons in the 
 service of the Church. Naturally after specifying the qualifications of 
 the deacon, Paul passes to those of the kindred office, the deaconess. 
 "Grave" occurs in the case of both. "Not slanderers" here, answers to 
 "not double-tongued" in the deacons; so "not false accusers"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:3">Tit 2:3</A>).

 "Sober" here answers to "not given to much wine," in the case of the 
 deacons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:8">1Ti 3:8</A>).

 Thus it appears he requires the same qualifications in female deacons 
 as in deacons, only with such modifications as the difference of sex

 In the case of the deacons, as in that of the bishops, he mentions the 
 first condition of receiving office, rather than the special 
 qualifications for its discharge. The practical side of Christianity is 
 the one most dwelt on in the Pastoral Epistles, in opposition to the 
 heretical teachers; moreover, as the miraculous gifts began to be 
 withdrawn, the safest criterion of efficiency would be the previous 
 moral character of the candidate, the disposition and talent for the 
 office being presupposed. So in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:3">Ac 6:3</A>,

 a similar criterion was applied, "Look ye out among you seven men <I>of
 honest report.</I>" Less stress is laid on personal dignity in the case 
 of the deacon than in that of the bishop (compare <I>Notes,</I> see on

 Understood by many as "a higher step," that is, promotion to the higher 
 office of presbyter. But ambition of rising seems hardly the motive to 
 faithfulness which the apostle would urge; besides, it would require 
 the comparative, "a <I>better</I> degree." Then the <I>past</I> aorist 
 participle, "they that used the office of deacon well," implies that 
 the <I>present</I> verb, "<I>are acquiring</I> to themselves boldness," 
 is the result of the completed action of using the diaconate well. 
 Also, Paul would not probably hold out to every deacon the prospect of 
 promotion to the presbytery in reward of his service. The idea of
 moving upwards in Church offices was as yet unknown (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:7,1Co+12:4-11">Ro 12:7,

 Moreover, there seems little connection between reference to a higher 
 Church rank and the words "great boldness." Therefore, what those who 
 have faithfully discharged the diaconate acquire for themselves is "a 
 good standing-place" [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>] (a well-grounded

 <I>the Church,</I> not of "the mystery of godliness" (an interpretation 
 not started till the sixteenth century; so 
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>); for after two weighty predicates, "pillar
 and ground," and these substantives, the third, a much weaker one, and
 that an adjective, "confessedly," or "without controversy great," would
 not come. "Pillar" is so used metaphorically of the three apostles on
 whom principally the Jewish Christian Church depended

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:9">Ga 2:9</A>;

 The Church is "the pillar of the truth," as the continued existence 
 (historically) of the truth rests on it; for it supports and preserves 
 the word of truth. He who is of the truth belongs by the very fact to 
 the Church. Christ is the alone ground of the truth in the highest 
 sense

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:11">1Co 3:11</A>).

 Re 21:14</A>). 

 The Church rests on the truth as it is in Christ; not the truth on the
 Church. But the truth <I>as it is in itself</I> is to be distinguished 
 from the truth <I>as it is acknowledged in the world.</I> In the former 
 sense it needs no <I>pillar,</I> but supports itself; in the latter 
 sense, it needs the Church as its pillar, that is, its supporter and 
 preserver [B<FONT SIZE=-1>AUMGARTEN</FONT>]. The importance of 
 Timothy's commission is set forth by reminding him of the excellence of 
 "the house" in which he serves; and this in opposition to the coming 
 heresies which Paul presciently forewarns him of immediately after

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:1">1Ti 4:1</A>).

 The Church is to be the stay of the truth and its conserver for the 
 world, and God's instrument for securing its continuance on earth, in 
 opposition to those heresies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:18,28:20">Mt 16:18; 28:20</A>).

 The apostle does not recognize a Church which has not the truth, or has
 it only in part. Rome falsely claims the promise for herself. But it is 
 not historical descent that constitutes a Church, but this only, to 
 those heresies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:18,28:20">Mt 16:18; 28:20</A>).

 no objection that, having called the Church before "the house of God," 
 he now calls it the "pillar"; for the literal word "Church" immediately 
 precedes the new metaphors: so the <I>Church,</I> or congregation of

 The apostle now proceeds to unfold this confessedly great mystery in 
 its details. It is not unlikely that some formula of confession or hymn 
 existed in the Church and was generally accepted, to which Paul alludes 
 in the words "<I>confessedly</I> great is the mystery," &c. (to wit), 
 "He who was manifested," &c. Such hymns were then used (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:19,Col+3:16">Eph 5:19;
 Col 3:16</A>).

 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 5.28].
 The short unconnected sentences with the words similarly arranged, and 
 the number of syllables almost equal, and the ideas antithetically 
 related, are characteristics of a Christian hymn. The clauses stand in 
 parallelism; each two are connected as a pair, and form an antithesis 
 turning on the opposition of heaven to earth; the order of this 
 antithesis is reversed in each new pair of clauses: <I>flesh</I> and 
 <I>spirit, angels</I> and <I>Gentiles, world</I> and <I>glory;</I> and 
 there is a correspondence between the first and the last clause: 
 "manifested in the flesh, received up into glory" [W<FONT

 the apostle mentions only <I>his own</I> laying on of hands. But there 
 his aim is to remind Timothy specially of the part he himself took in 
 imparting to him the gift. Here he mentions the fact, quite consistent
 with the other, that the neighboring presbyters took part in the 
 ordination or consecration, he, however, taking the foremost part. 
 Paul, though having the general oversight of the elders everywhere, was 
 an elder himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:1,2Jo+1:1">1Pe 5:1;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:66,Ac+22:5">Lu 22:66;

 apostles, elders, and a president

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:16">Ac 15:16</A>).

 As the president of the synagogue was of the same order as his 
 presbyters, so the bishop was of the same order as his presbyters. At 
 the ordination of the president of the synagogue there were always 
 three presbyters present to lay on hands, so the early Church canons 
 required three bishops to be present at the consecration of a bishop. 
 As the president of the synagogue, so the bishop of the Church alone 
 could ordain, he acting as the representative, and in the name of the 
 whole presbytery [V<FONT SIZE=-1>ITRINGA</FONT>]. So, in the Anglican 
 Church, the bishop ordains, the presbyters or priests present joining 
 with him in laying on hands.</P>

 other studies, fashionable to-day, out of fashion to-morrow; this study
 alone is never obsolete, and when made the all-engrossing aim sanctifies
 all other studies. The exercise of the ministry threatens the spirit of
 the ministry, unless it be sustained within. The minister must be first

 In performing faithfully his duty to others, the minister is promoting
 his own salvation. Indeed he cannot "give heed unto the teaching" of 
 others, unless he be at the same time "giving heed unto himself."</P>

 to <I>providing Church sustenance</I> for them. For the restriction to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:11">1Ti 5:11</A>

 <I>rebuke them that sin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:20">1Ti 5:20</A>).

 <B>23. no longer</B>--as a habit. This injunction to drink wine 
 occasionally is a modification of the preceding "keep thyself pure."
 The presbyter and deacon were enjoined to be "not given to wine"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:3,8">1Ti 3:3, 8</A>).

 Timothy seems to have had a tendency to undue ascetical strictness on
 this point (compare <I>Note,</I> see on

 <A HREF="#1Ti4_8">1Ti 4:8</A>;

 compare the Nazarene vow,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:1-4">Nu 6:1-4</A>;
 
 John the Baptist,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:15,Ro+14">Lu 1:15;
 Ro 14</A>).

 Paul therefore modifies the preceding words, "keep thyself pure," 
 virtually saying, "Not that I mean to enjoin that kind of purity which 
 consists in asceticism, nay, <I>be no longer a water-drinker,</I>" that 
 is, no longer drink <I>only</I> water, but <I>use a little wine,</I> as 
 much as is needed for thy health. So E<FONT SIZE=-1>LLICOTT</FONT> and 
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>IESINGER</FONT>. A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> thus:
 Timothy was of a feeble frame (see on

 <A HREF="JFB46.htm#1Co16_10">1Co 16:10, 11</A>),

 and prone to timidity in his duties as overseer where vigorous action
 was needed; hence Paul exhorts him to take all proper means to raise 
 his bodily condition above these infirmities. God hereby commands 
 believers to use all due means for preserving health, and condemns by 
 anticipation the human traditions which among various sects have denied 
 the use of wine to the faithful.</P>

 <B>24.</B> Two kinds of sins are specified: those <I>palpably
 manifest</I> (so the <I>Greek</I> for "open <I>beforehand</I>" ought to 
 be translated; so in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:14">Heb 7:14</A>,

 it is translated "evident"; literally, "<I>before</I>" <I>the eyes,</I>
 that is, notorious), further explained as "going before to judgment"; 
 and those which follow after the men ("some men they, that is, their 
 sins, follow after"), namely, not going beforehand, loudly accusing, 
 but hidden till they come to the judgment: so

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:25">1Ti 5:25</A>,

 <I>the good works</I> are of two classes: those <I>palpably 
 manifest</I> (translate so, instead of "manifest beforehand") and 
 "those that are otherwise," that is, not <I>palpably manifest.</I> Both 
 alike "cannot be hid"; the former class in the case of bad and good are 
 <I>manifest</I> already; the latter class in the case of both are not 
 manifest now, but shall be so at <I>the final judgment.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>going before to judgment</B>--as heralds; crying sins which accuse
 their perpetrator. The connection seems to me this: He had enjoined 
 Timothy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:20">1Ti 5:20</A>,

 "Rebuke <I>them that sin</I> before all": and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:22">1Ti 5:22</A>,

 "Neither be partaker of other men's sins," by ordaining ungodly men; 
 having then by a digression at the clause, "keep thyself pure," guarded 
 against an ascetical error of Timothy in fancying purity consisted in 
 asceticism, and having exhorted him to use wine for strengthening him 
 in his work, he returns to the subject of his being vigorous as an 
 overseer in <I>rebuking sin,</I> whether in presbyters or people, and 
 in avoiding participation in men's sins by ordaining ungodly 
 candidates. He says, therefore, there are two classes of <I>sins,</I> 
 as there are two classes of <I>good works:</I> those palpably 
 <I>manifest,</I> and those not so; the former are those on which thou 
 shouldest act decidedly at once when called on, whether to rebuke in 
 general, or to ordain ministers in particular; as to the latter, the 
 final <I>judgment</I> alone can decide; however hidden now they "cannot 
 be hid" then. This could only be said of <I>the final judgment</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:5">1Co 4:5</A>;

 therefore, A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT> reference of this verse to 
 <I>Timothy's judgment</I> in choosing elders must be wrong); all 
 judgments before then are fallible. Thus he implies that Timothy can 
 only be responsible if he connive at <I>manifest,</I> or evident sins; 
 not that those <I>that are otherwise</I> shall escape judgment at last: 
 just as in the case of <I>good works,</I> he can only be responsible 
 for taking into account in his judgments those which are patent to all, 
 not those secret good works which nevertheless will not remain hidden 
 at the final judgment.</P>

 slaves <I>under the yoke</I> of heathen, and
 <I>those that have believing masters</I> (he does not use the phrase
 "under the yoke" in the latter case, for service under believers is not
 a <I>yoke</I>). Connect the following words thus, "Let them
 (the slaves) not, because they
 (the masters) are brethren

 despise them (the masters)."

 faithful (that is, believers) and beloved who receive (in the mutual 
 <I>interchange</I> of relative duties between master and servant; so 
 the <I>Greek</I>) the benefit" (<I>English Version</I> violates
 <I>Greek</I> grammar). This latter clause is parallel to, "because
 they are brethren"; which proves that "they" refers to the
 <I>masters,</I> not the <I>servants,</I> as T<FONT

 If the common sense of the <I>Greek</I> verb be urged, the sense must

 gain</I> which <I>piety,</I> whose accompaniment is <I>contentment,</I> 
 secures to the soul. W<FONT SIZE=-1>IESINGER</FONT> remarks that Paul 
 observed in Timothy a tendency to indolence and shrinking from the 
 conflict, whence he felt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:11">1Ti 6:11</A>)

 that Timothy needed cautioning against such temptation; compare also 
 the second Epistle. Not merely <I>contentment</I> is great gain (a 
 sentiment of the heathen C<FONT SIZE=-1>ICERO</FONT> [<I>Paradox</I> 
 6], "the greatest and surest riches"), but "piety with contentment"; 
 for piety not only feels no need of what it has not, but also has that 
 which exalts it above what it has not [W<FONT SIZE=-1>IESINGER</FONT>].

 But the adjective

 "content"; literally, "having a <I>sufficiency in one's self</I>" 
 independent of others. "The Lord always supplies His people with what 
 is necessary for them. True happiness lies in piety, but this 
 <I>sufficiency</I> [supplied by God, with which moreover His people are

 private usurpation, but of public tradition; a matter brought to thee, 
 not put forth by thee, in which thou oughtest to be not an enlarger, 
 but a guardian; not an originator, but a disciple; not leading, but 
 following. 'Keep,' saith he, 'the deposit,'; preserve intact and 
 inviolate the talent of the catholic faith. What has been entrusted to 
 thee, let that same remain with thee; let that same be handed down by 
 thee. Gold thou hast received, gold return. I should be sorry thou 
 shouldest substitute aught else. I should be sorry that for gold thou 
 shouldest substitute lead impudently, or brass fraudulently. I do not 
 want the mere appearance of gold, but its actual reality. Not that 
 there is to be no progress in religion in Christ's Church. Let there be 
 so by all means, and the greatest progress; but then let it be real 
 progress, not a change of the faith. Let the intelligence of the whole 
 Church and its individual members increase exceedingly, provided it be 
 only in its own kind, the doctrine being still the same. Let the 
 religion of the soul resemble the growth of the body,which, though it 
 develops its several parts in the progress of years, yet remains the 
 same as it was essentially" [V<FONT SIZE=-1>INCENTIUS</FONT> L<FONT

 themselves pre-eminently the gift

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:8,18,23">Col 2:8, 18, 23</A>).

 Hence arose the creeds of the Church, called <I>symbols,</I> that is, 
 in <I>Greek,</I> "watchwords," or a test whereby the orthodox might 
 distinguish one another in opposition to the heretical. Perhaps here,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:20,2Ti+1:13,14">1Ti 6:20,
 and 2Ti 1:13, 14</A>,

 imply the existence of some such brief formula of doctrine then 
 existing in the Church; if so, we see a good reason for its not being 
 written in Scripture, which is designed not to give dogmatic 
 formularies, but to be the fountain whence all such formularies are to 
 be drawn according to the exigencies of the several churches and ages. 
 Probably thus a portion of the so-called apostle's creed may have had 
 their sanction, and been preserved solely by tradition on this account. 
 "The creed, handed down from the apostles, is not written on paper and 
 with ink, but on fleshy tables of the heart" 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> [<I>Against John of Jerusalem,</I> 9].
 Thus, in the creed, contrary to the "oppositions" (the germs of which 
 probably existed in the Church in Paul's latter days) whereby the aeons 
 were <I>set off</I> in pairs, God is stated to be "the Father 
 Almighty," or <I>all-governing</I> "maker of heaven and earth" [B<FONT
