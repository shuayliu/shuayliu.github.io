 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHORSHIP</FONT>.--P<FONT SIZE=-1>OLYCARP</FONT>, the 
 disciple of John [<I>Epistle to the Philippians,</I> 7], quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:3">1Jo 4:3</A>.

 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.39] 
 says of P<FONT SIZE=-1>APIAS</FONT>, a hearer of John, and a friend of 
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>OLYCARP</FONT>, "He used testimonies from the First 
 Epistle of John." I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT>, according to 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 5.8], 
 often quoted this Epistle. So in his work <I>Against Heresies</I> 
 [3.15; 5, 8] he quotes from John by name,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:18">1Jo 2:18</A>,

 &c.; and in [3.16,7], he quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:1-3,5:1,2Jo+1:7,8">1Jo 4:1-3; 5:1,

 M<FONT SIZE=-1>URATORI'S</FONT> <I>Fragment on the Canon of 
 Scripture</I> states, "There are two of John (the Gospel and Epistle?) 
 esteemed Catholic," and quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:3">1Jo 1:3</A>.

 The <I>Peschito Syriac</I> contains it. O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT> (in 
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 6.25]) 
 speaks of the First Epistle as genuine, and "probably the second and 
 third, though all do not recognize the latter two"; on the Gospel of 
 John, [<I>Commentary on John,</I> 13.2], he quotes

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:5">1Jo 1:5</A>.

 D<FONT SIZE=-1>IONYSIUS OF</FONT> A<FONT SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT>, 
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN'S</FONT> scholar, cites the words of this Epistle 
 as those of the Evangelist John.  E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> 
 [<I>Ecclesiastical History,</I> 3.24], says, John's first Epistle and 
 Gospel are <I>acknowledged without question</I> by those of the present 
 day, as well as by the ancients. So also J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> 
 [<I>On Illustrious Men</I>]. The opposition of C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OSMAS</FONT> I<FONT SIZE=-1>NDICOPLEUSTES</FONT>, in the sixth 
 century, and that of M<FONT SIZE=-1>ARCION</FONT> because our Epistle 
 was inconsistent with his views, are of no weight against such 
 irrefragable testimony.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The internal evidence is equally strong. Neither the Gospel, nor this 
 Epistle, can be pronounced an imitation; yet both, in style and modes 
 of thought, are evidently of the same mind. The <I>individual</I> 
 notices are not so numerous or obvious as in Paul's writings, as was to 
 be expected in a <I>Catholic</I> Epistle; but such as there are accord 
 with John's position. He implies his apostleship, and perhaps alludes 
 to his Gospel, and the affectionate tie which bound him as an 
 <I>aged</I> pastor to his spiritual "children"; and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:18,19,4:1-3">1Jo 2:18, 19; 4:1-3</A>,

 he alludes to the false teachers as known to his readers; and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:21">1Jo 5:21</A>

 he warns them against the idols of the surrounding world. It is no 
 objection against its authenticity that the doctrine of the 
 <I>Word,</I> or divine second Person, existing from everlasting, and in 
 due time made flesh, appears in it, as also in the Gospel, as opposed 
 to the heresy of the Docet&aelig; <I>in the second century,</I> who 
 denied that our Lord <I>is come in the flesh,</I> and maintained He 
 came only in outward <I>semblance;</I> for the same doctrine appears in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:15-18,1Ti+3:16,Heb+1:1-3">Col 1:15-18;
 1Ti 3:16; 
 Heb 1:1-3</A>; 

 and the germs of Docetism, though not fully developed till the second
 century, were in existence in the first. The Spirit, presciently 
 through John, puts the Church beforehand on its guard against the 
 coming heresy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>O WHOM ADDRESSED</FONT>.--A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT> 
 [<I>The Question of the Gospels,</I> 2.39], says this Epistle was 
 written to the <I>Parthians.</I> B<FONT SIZE=-1>EDE</FONT>, in a 
 prologue to the seven Catholic Epistles, says that 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>THANASIUS</FONT> attests the same.  By the
 <I>Parthians</I> may be meant the Christians living beyond the 
 Euphrates in the Parthian territory, outside the Roman empire, "the 
 Church at Babylon elected together with (you)," the churches in the 
 Ephesian region, the quarter to which Peter addressed his Epistles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:12">1Pe 5:12</A>).

 As Peter addressed the flock which John subsequently tended (and in
 which Paul had formerly ministered), so John, Peter's close companion 
 after the ascension, addresses the flock among whom Peter had been when 
 he wrote. Thus "the elect lady"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:1">2Jo 1</A>)

 answers "to the Church elected together"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:13">1Pe 5:13</A>).
 
 See further confirmation of this view in

 <A HREF="JFB63.htm#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>

 to Second John. It is not necessarily an objection to this view that 
 John never is known to have personally ministered in the Parthian 
 territory. For neither did Peter personally minister to the churches in 
 Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, Bithynia, though he wrote his 
 Epistles to them. Moreover, in John's prolonged life, we cannot 
 dogmatically assert that he did not visit the Parthian Christians, 
 after Peter had ceased to minister to them, on the mere ground of 
 absence of extant testimony to that effect. This is as probable a view 
 as A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD'S</FONT>, that in the passage of A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT>, "to the Parthians," is to be altered by 
 conjectural emendation; and that the Epistle is addressed to the 
 churches at and around Ephesus, on the ground of the fatherly tone of 
 affectionate address in it, implying his personal ministry among his 
 readers. But his position, as probably the only surviving apostle, 
 accords very well with his addressing, in a Catholic Epistle, a cycle 
 of churches which he may not have specially ministered to in person, 
 with affectionate fatherly counsel, by virtue of his general apostolic 
 superintendence of all the churches.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>IME AND PLACE OF WRITING</FONT>.--This Epistle seems to 
 have been written subsequently to his Gospel as it assumes the reader's 
 acquaintance with the Gospel facts and Christ's speeches, and also with 
 the special aspect of the incarnate Word, as God <I>manifest in the
 flesh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:16">1Ti 3:16</A>),

 set forth more fully in his Gospel. The tone of address, as a father 
 addressing his "<I>little children</I>" (the continually recurring 
 term,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1,12,13,18,28,3:7,18,4:4,5:21">1Jo 2:1, 12, 13, 18, 28;
 3:7, 18; 4:4; 5:21</A>), 

 accords with the view that this Epistle was written in John's old age,
 perhaps about <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 90.  In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:18">1Jo 2:18</A>,

 "it is the last time," probably does not refer to any particular event 
 (as the destruction of Jerusalem, which was now many years past) but 
 refers to the nearness of the Lord's coming as proved by the rise of 
 <I>Antichristian teachers,</I> the mark of <I>the last time.</I> It was 
 the Spirit's purpose to keep the Church always expecting Christ as 
 ready to come at any moment. The whole Christian age is <I>the last 
 time</I> in the sense that no other dispensation is to arise till 
 Christ comes. Compare "these last days,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:2">Heb 1:2</A>.

 Ephesus may be conjectured to be the <I>place</I> whence it was 
 written. The controversial allusion to the germs of Gnostic heresy 
 accord with Asia Minor being the place, and the last part of the 
 apostolic age the <I>time,</I> of writing this Epistle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ONTENTS</FONT>.--The leading subject of the whole is,
 <I>fellowship with the Father</I> and <I>the Son</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:3">1Jo 1:3</A>).

 Two principal divisions may be noted: (1)

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:5-2:28">1Jo 1:5-2:28</A>:

 the theme of this portion is stated at the outset, "<I>God is light, 
 and in Him is no darkness at all</I>"; consequently, in order to have 
 fellowship with Him, we must <I>walk in light</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:7">1Jo 1:7</A>);

 connected with which in the <I>confession</I> and subsequent 
 <I>forgiveness of our sins</I> through <I>Christ's propitiation</I> and 
 <I>advocacy,</I> without which forgiveness there could be no light or 
 fellowship with God: a farther step in thus walking in the light is, 
 positively <I>keeping God's commandments,</I> the sum of which is 
 <I>love,</I> as opposed to <I>hatred,</I> the acme of disobedience to 
 God's word: negatively, he exhorts them according to their several 
 stages of spiritual growth, <I>children, fathers, young men,</I> in 
 consonance with their privileges as <I>forgiven, knowing the 
 Father,</I> and <I>having overcome the wicked one, not to love the 
 world,</I> which is incompatible with the indwelling <I>of the love of 
 the Father,</I> and to be on their guard against the 
 <I>Antichristian</I> teachers already in the world, who were not of the 
 Church, but of the world, against whom the true defense is, that his 
 believing readers who have the <I>anointing</I> of God, should 
 <I>continue to abide in the Son and in the Father.</I> (2) The second 
 division

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:29-5:5">1Jo 2:29-5:5</A>)

 discusses the theme with which it opens, <I>He is righteous;</I> 
 consequently (as in the first division), "<I>every one that doeth 
 righteousness is born of Him.</I>" <I>Sonship</I> in us involves our 
 purifying ourselves as He is pure, even as we <I>hope to see, and 
 therefore to be made like our Lord when He shall appear;</I> in this 
 second, as in the first division, both a positive and a negative side 
 are presented of "doing righteousness as He is righteous," involving a 
 contrast between the children of God and the children of the devil. 
 <I>Hatred</I> marks the latter; <I>love,</I> the former: this love 
 gives assurance of acceptance with God for ourselves and our prayers, 
 accompanied as they are

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:23">1Jo 3:23</A>)

 with obedience to His great commandment, to "believe on Jesus, and love 
 one another"; the seal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:24">1Jo 3:24</A>)

 of His dwelling in us and assuring our hearts, is the Spirit which He 
 hath given us. In contrast to this (as in the first division), he warns 
 against false spirits, the notes of which are, <I>denial of Christ,</I> 
 and <I>adherence to the world. Sonship,</I> or birth of God, is then 
 more fully described: its essential feature is unslavish, free <I>love 
 to God, because God first loved us,</I> and <I>gave His Son to die for 
 us,</I> and consequent <I>love to the brethren,</I> grounded on their 
 being sons of God also like ourselves, and so <I>victory over the 
 world;</I> this victory being gained only by the man who <I>believes in 
 Jesus as the Son of God.</I> (3) <I>The conclusion</I> establishes this 
 last central truth, on which rests our fellowship with God, <I>Christ's 
 having come by the water</I> of baptism, <I>the blood</I> of atonement, 
 and <I>the witnessing Spirit,</I> which <I>is truth.</I> As in the 
 opening he rested this cardinal truth on the apostles' witness of the 
 eye, the ear, and the touch, so now at the close he rests it on 
 <I>God's witness,</I> which is accepted by the believer, in contrast 
 with the unbeliever, who <I>makes God a liar.</I> Then follows his 
 closing statement of his <I>reason for writing</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:13">1Jo 5:13</A>;

 compare the corresponding

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:4">1Jo 1:4</A>,

 at the beginning), namely, that <I>believers in Christ the Son of God 
 may know that they have</I> (now already) <I>eternal life</I> (the 
 source of "joy,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:4">1Jo 1:4</A>;

 compare similarly his object in writing the Gospel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:31">Joh 20:31</A>),

 and so have confidence as to their prayers being answered 
 (corresponding to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:22">1Jo 3:22</A>

 in the second part); for instance, their intercessions for a <I>sinning 
 brother</I> (unless his sin be a <I>sin unto death</I>). He closes with 
 a brief summing up of the instruction of the Epistle, the high dignity, 
 sanctity, and safety from evil of the children of God in contrast to 
 the sinful world, and a warning against <I>idolatry,</I> literal and 
 spiritual: "Keep yourselves from idols."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though the Epistle is not directly polemical, the <I>occasion</I> which 
 suggested his writing was probably the rise of Antichristian teachers; 
 and, <I>because</I> he knew the spiritual character of the several 
 classes whom he addresses, <I>children, youths, fathers,</I> he feels 
 it necessary to write to confirm them in the faith and joyful 
 fellowship of the Father and Son, and to assure them of the reality of 
 the things they believe, that so they may have the full privileges of 
 believing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 S<FONT SIZE=-1>TYLE</FONT>.--His peculiarity is fondness for aphorism 
 and repetition. His tendency to repeat his own phrase, arises partly 
 from the affectionate, hortatory character of the Epistle; partly, 
 also, from its Hebraistic forms abounding in parallel clauses, as 
 distinguished from the Grecian and more logical style of Paul; also, 
 from his childlike simplicity of spirit, which, full of his one grand 
 theme, repeats, and dwells on it with fond delight and enthusiasm. 
 Moreover as A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> well says, the appearance of 
 uniformity is often produced by want of deep enough exegesis to 
 discover the real differences in passages which seem to express the 
 same. Contemplative, rather than argumentative, he dwells more on the 
 general, than on the particular, on the inner, than on the outer, 
 Christian life. Certain fundamental truths he recurs to again and 
 again, at one time enlarging on, and applying them, at another time 
 repeating them in their condensed simplicity. The thoughts do not march 
 onward by successive steps, as in the logical style of Paul, but rather 
 in circle drawn round one central thought which he reiterates, ever 
 reverting to it, and viewing it, now under its positive, now under its 
 negative, aspect. Many terms which in the Gospel are given as Christ's, 
 in the Epistle appear as the favorite expressions of John, naturally 
 adopted from the Lord. Thus the contrasted terms, "flesh" and "spirit," 
 "light" and "darkness," "life" and "death," "abide in Him": fellowship 
 with the Father and Son, and with one another," is a favorite phrase 
 also, not found in the Gospel, but in Acts and Paul's Epistles. In him 
 appears the harmonious union of opposites, adapting him for his high 
 functions in the kingdom of God, contemplative repose of character, and 
 at the same time ardent zeal, combined with burning, all-absorbing 
 love: less adapted for active outward work, such as Paul's, than for 
 spiritual service. He handles Christian verities not as abstract 
 dogmas, but as living realities, personally enjoyed in fellowship with 
 God in Christ, and with the brethren. Simple, and at the same time 
 profound, his writing is in consonance with his spirit, unrhetorical 
 and undialectic, gentle, consolatory, and loving: the reflection of the 
 Spirit of Him on whose breast he lay at the last supper, and whose 
 beloved disciple he was. E<FONT SIZE=-1>WALD</FONT> in A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, speaking of the "unruffled and heavenly repose" 
 which characterizes this Epistle, says, "It appears to be the tone, not 
 so much of a father talking with his beloved children, as of a 
 glorified saint addressing mankind from a higher world. Never in any 
 writing has the doctrine of heavenly love--a love working in stillness, 
 ever unwearied, never exhausted--so thoroughly approved itself as in 
 this Epistle."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OHN'S PLACE IN THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</FONT>.--As 
 Peter founded and Paul propagated, so John completed the spiritual 
 building. As the Old Testament puts prominently forward the <I>fear of 
 God,</I> so John, the last writer of the New Testament, gives 
 prominence to the <I>love of God.</I> Yet, as the Old Testament is not 
 all limited to presenting the fear of God, but sets forth also His 
 <I>love,</I> so John, as a representative of the New Testament, while 
 breathing so continually the spirit of love, gives also the plainest 
 and most awful warnings against sin, in accordance with his original 
 character as Boanerges, "son of thunder." His mother was Salome, mother
 of the sons of Zebedee, probably sister to Jesus' mother (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:25">Joh 19:25</A>,

 "His mother's sister," with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:56,Mk+15:40">Mt 27:56;
 Mr 15:40</A>), 

 so that he was cousin to our Lord; to his mother, under God, he may
 have owed his first serious impressions. Expecting as she did the 
 Messianic kingdom in glory, as appears from her petition

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:20-23">Mt 20:20-23</A>),

 she doubtless tried to fill his young and ardent mind with the same 
 hope. N<FONT SIZE=-1>EANDER</FONT> distinguishes three leading 
 tendencies in the development of the Christian doctrine, the Pauline, 
 the Jacobean (between which the Petrine forms an intermediate link), 
 and the Johannean. John, in common with James, was less disposed to the 
 intellectual and dialectic cast of thought which distinguishes Paul. He 
 had not, like the apostle of the Gentiles, been brought to faith and 
 peace through severe conflict; but, like James, had reached his 
 Christian individuality through a quiet development: James, however, 
 had passed through a moulding in Judaism previously, which, under the 
 Spirit, caused him to present Christian truth in connection with the 
 law, in so far as the latter in its spirit, though not letter, is 
 permanent, and not abolished, but established under the Gospel. But 
 John, from the first, had drawn his whole spiritual development from 
 the personal view of Christ, the model man, and from intercourse with 
 Him. Hence, in his writings, everything turns on one simple contrast: 
 divine <I>life</I> in communion with Christ; death in separation from 
 Him, as appears from his characteristic phrases, "<I>life, light, 
 truth; death, darkness, lie.</I>" "As James and Peter mark the gradual 
 transition from spiritualized Judaism to the independent development of 
 Christianity, and as Paul represents the independent development of 
 Christianity in opposition to the Jewish standpoint, so the 
 contemplative element of John reconciles the two, and forms the closing 
 point in the training of the apostolic Church" [N<FONT

 To wish <I>joy</I> to the reader was the ancient customary address. The 
 sentence begun in

 <I>handling,</I> than even <I>seeing.</I> "<I>Have</I> heard

 <I>still abiding</I> with us; but in <I>Greek</I> (not as <I>English 
 Version</I> "have," but simply) "looked upon" (not perfect tense, as of 
 a <I>continuing</I> thing, but aorist, <I>past</I> time) while Christ 
 the incarnate Word was still with us. "Seen," namely, His glory, as 
 revealed in the Transfiguration and in His miracles; and His passion 
 and death in a real body of flesh and blood.  "Looked upon" as a 
 wondrous spectacle steadfastly, deeply, contemplatively; so the 
 <I>Greek.</I> Appropriate to John's contemplative character.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>hands .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. handled</B>--Thomas and the other disciples on 
 distinct occasions after the resurrection. John himself had leaned on 
 Jesus' breast at the last supper. Contrast the wisest of the heathen 
 <I>feeling after</I> (the same <I>Greek</I> as here; <I>groping 
 after</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>WITH THE HANDS</FONT>") <I>if haply they might 
 find God</I> (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:27">Ac 17:27</A>).

 This proves against Socinians he is here speaking of the <I>personal 
 incarnate Word,</I> not of Christ's <I>teaching</I> from the beginning 
 of His official life.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of</B>--"concerning"; following "heard." "Heard" is the verb most

 <I>heard concerning the Word of life,</I> that is, (Christ) <I>the 
 Word</I> who is <I>the life.</I> "Heard," namely, from Christ Himself, 
 including all Christ's teachings about Himself. Therefore he puts "of," 
 or "concerning," before "the word of life," which is inapplicable to 
 any of the verbs except "heard"; also "heard" is the only one of the 
 verbs which he resumes at

 who have not seen, <I>may</I> have the <I>fellowship</I> with us which 
 we who have seen enjoy; what that fellowship consists in he proceeds to 
 state, "Our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son." Faith 
 realizes what we have not seen as spiritually visible; not till by 
 faith we too have seen, do we know all the excellency of the true 
 Solomon. He Himself is ours; He in us and we in Him. We are "partakers 
 of the divine nature." We know God only by having fellowship with Him; 
 He may thus be <I>known,</I> but not <I>comprehended.</I> The 
 repetition of "with" before the "Son," distinguishes the 
 <I>persons,</I> while the <I>fellowship</I> or <I>communion</I> with 
 both <I>Father</I> and <I>Son,</I> implies their unity. It is not added 
 "and with the Holy Ghost"; for it is <I>by</I> the Holy Ghost or Spirit 
 of the Father and Son in us, that we are enabled to have <I>fellowship 
 with the Father and Son</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:24">1Jo 3:24</A>).

 Believers enjoy the fellowship <FONT SIZE=-1>OF</FONT>, but not <FONT

 eye-witnesses) and "your." <I>We</I> write thus that <I>your joy</I> 
 may be full. Other oldest manuscripts and versions read "<FONT

 by</I> bringing you also into fellowship with the Father and Son.

 "your" may be from himself. So

 "your" in oldest manuscripts. The authority of manuscripts and versions
 on both sides here is almost evenly balanced. Christ Himself is the

 <B>My little children</B>--The diminutive expresses the tender 
 affection of an aged pastor and spiritual father. <I>My own dear 
 children,</I> that is, sons and daughters (see on

 <A HREF="#1Jo2_12">1Jo 2:12</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>these things</B>--

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:6-10">1Jo 1:6-10</A>).

 My purpose in writing what I have just written is not that you should 
 abuse them as giving a license to sin but, on the contrary, "in order 
 that ye may not sin at all" (the <I>Greek</I> aorist, implying the 
 absence not only of the habit, but of <I>single acts</I> of sin [A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]). In order to "walk in the light"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:5,7">1Jo 1:5, 7</A>),
 
 the first step is <I>confession of sin</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:9">1Jo 1:9</A>),
 
 the next 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1">1Jo 2:1</A>)

 is that we should <I>forsake all sin.</I> The divine purpose has for 
 its aim, either to prevent the commission of, or to destroy sin [B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>And,</B> &c.--connected with the former; <I>Furthermore,</I> "if any 
 man sin," let him, while loathing and condemning it, not fear to go at 
 once to God, the Judge, confessing it, for "we have an Advocate with 
 Him." He is speaking of a <FONT SIZE=-1>BELIEVER'S</FONT> 
 <I>occasional</I> sins of infirmity through Satan's fraud and malice. 
 The use of "we" immediately afterwards implies that <I>we all</I> are 
 <I>liable</I> to this, though not necessarily constrained to sin.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>we have an advocate</B>--Advocacy is God's family blessing; other 
 blessings He grants to good and bad alike, but justification, 
 sanctification, continued intercession, and peace, He grants to His 
 children alone.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>advocate</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "<I>paraclete,</I>" the same term as is 
 applied to the Holy Ghost, as the "other Comforter"; showing the unity 
 of the Second and Third Persons of the Trinity. Christ is the 
 Intercessor <I>for us</I> above; and, in His absence, here below the 
 Holy Ghost is the other Intercessor <I>in us.</I> Christ's 
 <I>advocacy</I> is inseparable from the Holy Spirit's <I>comfort</I> 
 and working in us, as the spirit of intercessory prayer.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>righteous</B>--As our "advocate," Christ is not a mere suppliant 
 petitioner. He pleads for us on the ground of <I>justice,</I> or 
 <I>righteousness,</I> as well as mercy. Though He can say nothing good 
 <I>of</I> us, He can say much <I>for</I> us. It is His 
 <I>righteousness,</I> or obedience to the law, and endurance of its 
 full penalty for us, on which He grounds His claim for our acquittal. 
 The sense therefore is, "in that He is <I>righteous</I>"; in contrast 
 to our <I>sin</I> ("if any man <I>sin</I>").  The Father, by raising 
 Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right, has once for all 
 accepted Christ's claim for us. Therefore the accuser's charges against 
 God's children are vain. "The righteousness of Christ stands on our 
 side; for God's righteousness is, in Jesus Christ, ours" [L<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>UTHER</FONT>].</P>

 <B>2. And he</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "And <I>Himself.</I>" He is our 
 all-prevailing Advocate, because He is <I>Himself</I> "the 
 propitiation"; <I>abstract,</I> as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:30">1Co 1:30</A>:

 He is to us <I>all that is needed for propitiation</I> "in behalf of 
 our sins"; <I>the propitiatory sacrifice,</I> provided by the Father's 
 love, removing the estrangement, and appeasing the righteous wrath, on 
 God's part, against the sinner. "There is no incongruity that a father 
 should be <I>offended</I> with that son whom he loveth, and at that 
 time offended with him when he <I>loveth</I> him" [B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ISHOP</FONT> P<FONT SIZE=-1>EARSON</FONT>].  The only other 
 place in the New Testament where <I>Greek</I> "propitiation" occurs, is

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:10">1Jo 4:10</A>;

 it answers in the <I>Septuagint</I> to <I>Hebrew,</I> "<I>caphar,</I>" 
 to <I>effect an atonement</I> or <I>reconciliation</I> with God; and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:29">Eze 44:29</A>,

 to the <I>sin offering.</I> In 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:25">Ro 3:25</A>,

 <I>Greek,</I> it is "propitiatory," that is, the mercy seat, or lid of 
 the ark whereon God, represented by the Shekinah glory above it, met 
 His people, represented by the high priest who sprinkled the blood of 
 the sacrifice on it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 limited to <I>believers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1,1Jo+1:7">1Jo 2:1;
 1Jo 1:7</A>):

 His <I>propitiation</I> extends as widely as <I>sin</I> extends: see on

 <A HREF="JFB61.htm#2Pe2_1">2Pe 2:1</A>, 

 "denying the Lord that <I>bought them.</I>" "The whole world" cannot be 
 restricted to the <I>believing</I> portion of the world (compare

 and "the whole world,"

 Tokens whereby to discern grace are frequently given in this Epistle. 
 The Gnostics, by the Spirit's prescient forewarning, are refuted, who 
 boasted of <I>knowledge,</I> but set aside <I>obedience.</I> "Know 
 Him," namely, as "the righteous"

 our "Advocate and Intercessor."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>keep</B>--John's favorite word, instead of "do," literally, "watch," 
 "guard," and "keep safe" as a precious thing; observing so as to keep.  
 So Christ Himself. Not faultless conformity, but hearty acceptance of, 
 and willing subjection to, God's whole revealed will, is meant.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>commandments</B>--<I>injunctions</I> of faith, love, and obedience. 
 John never uses "the law" to express the rule of Christian obedience: 
 he uses it as the Mosaic law.</P>

 or asserting the merely opposite alternative to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:4">1Jo 2:4</A>,

 but expanding the "know Him" of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:3">1Jo 2:3</A>,

 into "in Him, verily (not as a matter of vain boasting) is the love of 
 (that is towards) God perfected," and "we are in Him." <I>Love</I> here 
 answers to <I>knowledge</I> in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:3">1Jo 2:3</A>.

 In proportion as we love God, in that same proportion we <I>know</I> 
 Him, and vice versa, until our <I>love and knowledge</I> shall attain 
 their full maturity of perfection.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>his word</B>--<I>His word</I> is one (see on

 <A HREF="#1Jo1_5">1Jo 1:5</A>), 

 and comprises His "<I>commandments,</I>" which are many

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:3">1Jo 2:3</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>hereby</B>--in our progressing towards this ideal of perfected love 
 and obedience. There is a gradation:

 "<I>know</I> Him";

 "we <I>are</I> in Him";

 <B>He that saith .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ought</B>--so that his deeds may be 
 consistent with his words.

 being full of Him (compare

 "Even as He walked" when on earth, especially in respect to 
 <I>love.</I> John delights in referring to Christ as the model man, 
 with the words, "Even as He," &c. "It is not Christ's walking on the 
 sea, but His ordinary walk, that we are called on to imitate" [L<FONT

 <B>no new commandment</B>--namely, <I>love,</I> the main principle of 
 walking <I>as Christ walked</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:6">1Jo 2:6</A>),

 and that commandment, of which one exemplification is presently given,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:9,10">1Jo 2:9, 10</A>,
 
 <I>the love of brethren.</I>

 Gospel word preached.</P>

 <A NAME="1Jo2_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8. a new commandment</B>--It was "old," in that <I>Christians</I> as 
 such had heard it <I>from the first;</I> but "new" (<I>Greek,</I> 
 "<I>kaine,</I>" not "<I>nea</I>": <I>new and different</I> from the 
 <I>old</I> legal precept) in that it was first <I>clearly</I> 
 promulgated with Christianity; though the inner <I>spirit</I> of the 
 law was <I>love</I> even to enemies, yet it was enveloped in some 
 bitter precepts which caused it to be temporarily almost unrecognized, 
 till the Gospel came. Christianity first put <I>love to brethren</I> on 
 the <I>new</I> and highest <FONT SIZE=-1>MOTIVE</FONT>, instinctive 
 love to Him who first loved us, constraining us to love all, even 
 enemies, thereby walking in the steps of Him who loved us when enemies. 
 So Jesus calls it "new,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:34,35">Joh 13:34, 35</A>,

 "Love one another <I>as I have loved you</I>" (the new motive);

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:12">Joh 15:12</A>.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which thing is true in him and in you</B>--"<I>In Christ</I> all 
 things are always true, and were so from the beginning; but <I>in 
 Christ and in us</I> conjointly <I>the commandment</I> [the love of 
 brethren] <I>is then true</I> when we acknowledge the truth which is 
 <I>in Him,</I> and have the same flourishing <I>in us</I>" [B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>].  A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> explains, "Which 
 thing (<I>the fact that the commandment is a new one</I>) is true in 
 Him and in you because the darkness is <I>passing away,</I> and the 
 true light is now shining; that is, the commandment <I>is a new 
 one,</I> and this is true both in the case of Christ and in the case of 
 you; because <I>in you</I> the darkness is passing away, and <I>in 
 Him</I> the true light is shining; therefore, on both accounts, the 
 command is a <I>new one:</I> new as regards you, because you are newly 
 come from darkness into light; new as regards Him, because He uttered 
 it when He came into the world to lighten every man, and began that 
 shining which even now continues." I prefer, as B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>, to explain, The <I>new commandment</I> finds its 
 <I>truth</I> in its practical <I>realization</I> in the walk of 
 Christians in union with Christ. Compare the use of "verily,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:5">1Jo 2:5</A>.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:42">Joh 4:42</A>,
 
 "indeed"; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:55">Joh 6:55</A>.

 The repetition of "in" before "you," "in Him and in you," not "in Him 
 and you" implies that the love commandment finds its realization 
 <I>separately:</I> first it did so "<I>in Him,</I>" and then it does so 
 "in us," in so far as we now "also walk even as He walked"; and yet it 
 finds its realization also <I>conjointly,</I> by the two being united 
 in one sentence, even as it is by virtue of the love commandment having 
 been first fulfilled <I>in Him,</I> that it is also now fulfilled <I>in 
 us,</I> through His Spirit in us: compare a similar case,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:17">Joh 20:17</A>,

 "<I>My Father</I> and <I>your</I> Father"; by virtue of His being 
 "<I>My</I> Father," He is also <I>your</I> Father.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:17">1Jo 2:17</A>,

 "is passing away." It shall not be wholly "past" until "the Sun of

 <I>already,</I> though but partially until the day bursts forth.</P>

 <B>9-11.</B> There is no mean between <I>light and darkness, love</I>

 exercised.

 <B>none occasion of stumbling</B>--In contrast to, "He that hateth his 
 brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not

 <B>13, 14.</B> All three classes are first addressed in the present. "I 
 write"; then in the past (aorist) tense, "I wrote" (not "I have 
 written"; moreover, in the oldest manuscripts and versions, in the end 
 of

 it is past, "I wrote," not as <I>English Version,</I> "I write"). Two 
 classes, "fathers" and "young men," are addressed with the same words 
 each time (except that the address to the <I>young men</I> has an 
 addition expressing the source and means of their victory); but the 
 "little sons" and "little children" are differently addressed.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>have known</B>--and do know: so the <I>Greek</I> perfect means. The 
 "I wrote" refers not to a former Epistle, but to this Epistle. It was 
 an idiom to put the <I>past</I> tense, regarding the time from the 
 <I>reader's</I> point of view; when he should receive the Epistle the 
 writing would be <I>past.</I> When he uses "I write," he speaks from 
 <I>his own</I> point of view.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>him <I>that is</I> from the beginning</B>--Christ: "that which was 
 from the beginning."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>overcome</B>--The <I>fathers,</I> appropriately to their age, are 
 characterized by <I>knowledge.</I> The <I>young men,</I> appropriately 
 to theirs, by <I>activity in conflict.</I> The <I>fathers,</I> too, 
 have <I>conquered;</I> but now their active service is past, and they 
 and <I>the children</I> alike are characterized by <I>knowing</I> (the 
 <I>fathers</I> know <I>Christ,</I> "Him that was from the beginning"; 
 <I>the children</I> know the Father). The first thing that the 
 <I>little children</I> realize is that God is their <I>Father;</I> 
 answering in the parallel clause to "little sons .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. your 
 sins are forgiven you for His name's sake," the universal first 
 privilege of <I>all</I> those really-dear <I>sons</I> of God.  Thus 
 this latter clause includes <I>all,</I> whereas the former clause 
 refers to those more especially who are in the <I>first</I> stage of 
 spiritual life, "little children." Of course, these can only know 
 <I>the Father</I> as theirs through <I>the Son</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27">Mt 11:27</A>).

 It is beautiful to see how the <I>fathers</I> are characterized as 
 reverting back to the first great truths of spiritual childhood, and 
 the sum and ripest fruit of advanced experience, the <I>knowledge of 
 Him that was from the beginning</I> (twice repeated,

 of</I> natural <I>weakness,</I> hence enabled to <I>overcome</I> "the 
 strong man armed" through Him that is "stronger." Faith is the victory 
 that overcomes the world. This term "overcome" is peculiarly John's, 
 adopted from his loved Lord. It occurs sixteen times in the Apocalypse, 
 six times in the First Epistle, only thrice in the rest of the New 
 Testament. In order to overcome the world on the ground, and in the 
 strength, of the blood of the Saviour, we must be willing, like Christ, 
 to part with whatever of the world belongs to us: whence immediately 
 after "ye have overcome the wicked one (the prince of the world)," it 
 is added, "Love not the world, neither the things .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in 
 the world."

 destroy this "prince of the world." Believers achieve the first grand 
 conquest over him when they pass from darkness to light, but afterwards 
 they need to maintain a continual <I>keeping</I> of themselves from his 
 assaults, looking to God by whom alone they are <I>kept</I> safe. 
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> thinks John refers specially to the 
 remarkable constancy exhibited by youths in Domitian's persecution. 
 Also to the young man whom John, after his return from Patmos, led with 
 gentle, loving persuasion to repentance. This youth had been commended 
 to the overseers of the Church by John, in one of his tours of 
 superintendency, as a promising disciple; he had been, therefore, 
 carefully watched up to baptism. But afterwards relying too much on 
 baptismal grace, he joined evil associates, and fell from step to step 
 down, till he became a captain of robbers. When John, some years after, 
 revisited that Church and heard of the youth's sad fall, he hastened to 
 the retreat of the robbers, suffered himself to be seized and taken 
 into the captain's presence. The youth, stung by conscience and the 
 remembrance of former years, fled away from the venerable apostle. Full 
 of love the aged father ran after him, called on him to take courage, 
 and announced to him forgiveness of his sins in the name of Christ. The 
 youth was recovered to the paths of Christianity, and was the means of 
 inducing many of his bad associates to repent and believe [C<FONT

 state as <I>fallen from God.</I> "God loved [with the love of

 world, and yet have also "the love of the Father in" us.

 <B>neither</B>--<I>Greek,</I> "nor yet." A man might deny in general 
 that he <I>loved the world,</I> while keenly following some one of

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>lust of the flesh</B>--that is, the lust which has its seat and 
 source in our lower animal nature. Satan tried this temptation the 
 first on Christ:

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:3">Lu 4:3</A>,

 "Command this stone that it be made <I>bread.</I>" Youth is especially 
 liable to fleshly lusts.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>lust of the eyes</B>--the avenue through which outward things of the 
 world, riches, pomp, and beauty, inflame us. Satan tried this 
 temptation on Christ when he showed Him the kingdoms of the world in a 
 moment. By the lust of the eyes David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:2">2Sa 11:2</A>)
 
 and Achan fell

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>pride of life</B>--literally, "arrogant assumption": vainglorious 
 display.  <I>Pride</I> was Satan's sin whereby he fell and forms the 
 link between the two foes of man, the <I>world</I> (answering to "the 
 lust of the eyes") and the <I>devil</I> (as "the lust of the flesh" is 
 the third foe). Satan tried this temptation on Christ in setting Him on 
 the temple pinnacle that, in spiritual <I>pride</I> and 
 <I>presumption,</I> on the ground of His Father's care, He should cast 
 Himself down. The same three foes appear in the three classes of soil 
 on which the divine seed falls: the wayside hearers, the <I>devil;</I> 
 the thorns, <I>the world;</I> the rocky undersoil, <I>the flesh</I>

 The world's awful <I>antitrinity,</I> the "lust of the flesh, the lust
 of the eyes, and the pride of life," similarly is presented in Satan's 
 temptation of Eve: "When she saw that the tree was good for 
 <I>food,</I> pleasant to the <I>eyes,</I> and a tree to be desired to 
 make one <I>wise,</I>"

 literally, "<I>instead</I> of Christ"; or an <I>adversary</I> of 
 Christ, literally, "<I>against</I> Christ." As John never uses 
 <I>pseudo-Christ,</I> or "false Christ," for <I>Antichrist,</I> it is 
 plain he means an <I>adversary of Christ,</I> claiming to himself what 
 belongs to Christ, and wishing to substitute himself for Christ as the 
 supreme object of worship. He <I>denies the Son,</I> not merely, like 
 the pope, acts in the name of the Son,

 then, as now, in evil men and evil teachings and writings; but still 
 "<FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT> Antichrist" means a hostile <I>person,</I> 
 even as "<FONT SIZE=-1>THE</FONT> Christ" is a personal Saviour. As 
 "cometh" is used of Christ, <I>so</I> here of Antichrist, the 
 embodiment in his own person of all the Antichristian features and 
 spirit of those "many Antichrists" which have been, and are, his 
 forerunners. John uses the singular of him. No other New Testament 
 writer uses the term. He probably answers to "the little horn having

 are in the Father and in the Son; without it a man is none of Christ. 
 The material unguent of costliest ingredients, poured on the head of 
 priests and kings, typified this spiritual unguent, derived from 
 Christ, the Head, to us, His members. We can have no share in Him as 
 <I>Jesus,</I> except we become truly <I>Christians,</I> and so be in

 <B>sin is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. transgression of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

 the article to both, implies that they are convertible terms. The 
 <I>Greek</I> "sin" (<I>hamartia</I>) is literally, "a missing of the 
 mark." God's will being that mark to be ever aimed at.  "By the law is

 cleansing blood, without application to which the life of God could not 
 be maintained. He sinneth not so long as he abideth in Christ.

 All sin as such is at variance with the notion of one regenerated. Not 
 that "whosoever is betrayed into sins has never seen nor known God"; 
 but <I>in so far</I> as sin exists, <I>in that degree</I> the spiritual 
 intuition and knowledge of God do not exist in him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>neither</B>--"not even." To <I>see</I> spiritually is a further step

 John does not, however, say, "born of the devil." as he does "born of

 "because he <I>was</I> born of God" (the <I>Greek</I> is perfect tense, 
 which is <I>present</I> in meaning, not aorist); it is not said, 
 Because a man was once for all born of God he never afterwards can sin; 
 but, Because he is born of God, the seed abiding now in Him, he cannot 
 sin; so long as it energetically abides, sin can have no place. Compare

 Joseph, "How <FONT SIZE=-1>CAN</FONT> I do this great wickedness and 
 sin against God?" The principle within me is at utter variance with it. 
 The regenerate life is incompatible with sin, and gives the believer a 
 hatred for sin in every shape, and an unceasing desire to resist it. 
 "The child of God in this conflict receives indeed wounds daily, but 
 never throws away his arms or makes peace with his deadly foe" [L<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>UTHER</FONT>]. The exceptional sins into which the regenerate 
 are surprised, are owing to the new life principle being for a time 
 suffered to lie dormant, and to the sword of the Spirit not being drawn 
 instantly. Sin is ever active, but no longer reigns. The <I>normal</I> 
 direction of the believer's energies is against sin; the law of God 
 after the inward man is the <I>ruling</I> principle of his true self 
 though the old nature, not yet <I>fully</I> deadened, rebels and sins.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:19">1Jo 3:19</A>,
 
 as well as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:20">1Jo 3:20</A>),

 as knowing <I>that God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all 
 things.</I> But thus the same <I>Greek</I> is translated "because" in 
 the beginning, and "(we know) <I>that</I>" in the middle of the verse, 
 and if the verse were consolatory, it probably would have been, 
 "Because <FONT SIZE=-1>EVEN</FONT> if our heart condemn us," &c. 
 Therefore translate, "<I>Because</I> (rendering the reason why it has 
 been stated in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:19">1Jo 3:19</A>

 to be so important to 'assure our hearts before Him') if our heart 
 condemn (<I>Greek,</I> '<I>know</I> [aught] <I>against</I> us'; 
 answering by contrast to 'we shall <I>know</I> that we are of the 
 truth') us (it is) <I>because</I> God is greater than our heart and 
 knoweth all things." If our heart judges us unfavorably, we may be sure 
 that He, knowing more than our heart knows, judges us more unfavorably 
 still [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. A similar ellipsis ("it is") 
 occurs in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:27,2Co+1:6,8:23">1Co 14:27;
 2Co 1:6; 8:23</A>. 

 The condemning testimony of our conscience is not alone, but is the 
 echo of the voice of Him who is greater and knoweth all things. Our 
 hypocrisy in <I>loving by word and tongue,</I> not in <I>deed and 
 truth,</I> does not escape even our conscience, though weak and knowing 
 but little, how much less God who knows all things! Still the 
 consolatory view may be the right one. For the <I>Greek</I> for "we 
 shall <I>assure</I> our hearts" (see on

 <A HREF="#1Jo3_19">1Jo 3:19</A>),

 is <I>gain over, persuade</I> so as to be stilled, implying that there 
 was a previous state of <I>self-condemnation by the heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:20">1Jo 3:20</A>),

 which, however, is <I>got over</I> by the consolatory thought, "God is 
 greater than my heart" which condemns me, and "knows all things" 
 (<I>Greek</I> "<I>ginoskei,</I>" "<I>knows,</I>" not 
 "<I>kataginoskei,</I>" "<I>condemns</I>"), and therefore knows my 
 <I>love</I> and desire to serve Him, and knows my <I>frame</I> so as to 
 pity my weakness of faith. This <I>gaining over</I> the heart to peace 
 is not so advanced a stage as the <I>having</I> CONFIDENCE <I>towards 
 God</I> which flows from a <I>heart condemning us not.</I> The first 
 "because" thus applies to the two alternate cases,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:20,21">1Jo 3:20, 21</A>

 (giving the ground of saying, that <I>having love we shall gain 
 over,</I> or <I>assure our minds before Him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:19">1Jo 3:19</A>);

 the second "because" applies to the first alternate alone, namely, "if 
 our heart condemn us." When he reaches the second alternate,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:21">1Jo 3:21</A>,

 he states it independently of the former "because" which had connected 
 it with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:19">1Jo 3:19</A>,

 inasmuch as <FONT SIZE=-1>CONFIDENCE</FONT> <I>toward God</I> is a 
 farther stage than <I>persuading our hearts,</I> though always preceded 
 by it.</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:20,21">1Jo 3:20, 21</A>,

 The two results of our being able to "assure our hearts before Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:19">1Jo 3:19</A>),

 and of "our heart condemning us not" (of insincerity as to <I>the 
 truth</I> in general, and as to <FONT SIZE=-1>LOVE</FONT> in 
 particular) are, (1) confidence toward God; (2) a sure answer to our 
 prayers. John does not mean that all whose hearts do not condemn them, 
 are therefore safe before God; for some have their conscience seared, 
 others are ignorant of the truth, and it is not only <I>sincerity,</I> 
 but <I>sincerity in the truth</I> which can save men. Christians are 
 those meant here: knowing Christ's precepts and testing themselves by 
 them.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>consciousness of love to God</I> manifested in a hearty keeping of 
 His commandments. When we have this inwardly and outwardly confirmed 
 <I>love to God,</I> we can <I>know</I> assuredly that we truly <I>love

 He came: so "<I>in,</I>" the element <I>in</I> which He came. "The"

 baptism by descending on Him, and throughout His ministry by enabling 
 Him to speak and do what man never before or since has spoken or, done; 
 and "it is the Spirit that beareth witness" of Christ, now permanently 
 in the Church: both in the inspired New Testament Scriptures, and in

 any form</I> which support the words, "in heaven, the Father, the Word, 
 and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one; and there are three that 
 bear witness in earth," are the <I>Montfortianus</I> of Dublin, copied 
 evidently from the <I>modern Latin Vulgate;</I> the <I>Ravianus,</I> 
 copied from the <I>Complutensian Polyglot;</I> a manuscript at Naples, 
 with the words added in the <I>Margin</I> by a recent hand; 
 <I>Ottobonianus,</I> 298, of the fifteenth century, the <I>Greek</I> of 
 which is a mere translation of the accompanying <I>Latin.</I> All the 
 old versions omit the words. The oldest manuscripts of the 
 <I>Vulgate</I> omit them: the earliest <I>Vulgate</I> manuscript which 
 has them being <I>Wizanburgensis,</I> 99, of the eighth century. A 
 scholium quoted in <I>Matth&aelig;i,</I> shows that the words did not 
 arise from fraud; for in the words, in all <I>Greek</I> manuscripts 
 "there are <I>three</I> that bear record," as the Scholiast notices, 
 the word "three" is <I>masculine,</I> because the three things (<I>the 
 Spirit, the water,</I> and <I>the blood</I>) are <FONT SIZE=-1>SYMBOLS 
 OF THE</FONT> T<FONT SIZE=-1>RINITY.</FONT> To this C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>YPRIAN</FONT>, 196, also refers, "Of the <I>Father, Son</I> and 
 <I>Holy Spirit,</I> it is written, '<I>And these</I> three are one' (a 
 unity)." There must be some mystical truth implied in using 
 "<I>three</I>" (<I>Greek</I>) in the <I>masculine,</I> though the 
 antecedents, "Spirit, water, and blood," are <I>neuter.</I> That <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>THE</FONT> T<FONT SIZE=-1>RINITY</FONT> was the truth meant is 
 a natural inference: the triad specified pointing to a still Higher 
 Trinity; as is plain also from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:9">1Jo 5:9</A>,

 "the witness of G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>," referring to the 
 <I>Trinity</I> alluded to in the Spirit, water, and blood. It was 
 therefore first written as a <I>marginal</I> comment to complete the 
 sense of the <I>text,</I> and then, as early at least as the eighth 
 century, was introduced into the text of the <I>Latin Vulgate.</I> The 
 testimony, however, could only be borne <I>on earth</I> to men, not in 
 <I>heaven.</I> The marginal comment, therefore, that inserted "in 
 heaven," was inappropriate. It is <I>on earth</I> that the context 
 evidently requires the witness of the three, <I>the Spirit, the 
 water,</I> and <I>the blood,</I> to be borne: mystically setting forth 
 the divine <I>triune</I> witnesses, the Father, the Spirit, and the 
 Son.  L<FONT SIZE=-1>UECKE</FONT> notices as internal evidence against 
 the words, John never uses "the Father" and "the Word" as correlates, 
 but, like other New Testament writers, associates "the Son" with "the 
 Father," and always refers "the Word" to "God" as its correlate, not 
 "the Father." Vigilius, at the end of the fifth century, is the first 
 who quotes the disputed words as in the text; but no <I>Greek</I> 
 manuscript earlier than the fifteenth is extant with them. The 
 <I>term</I> "Trinity" occurs first in the third century in T<FONT

 cross, pleaded only for those who <FONT SIZE=-1>KNEW NOT</FONT> <I>what 
 they were doing</I> in crucifying Him, not for those wilfully resisting 
 grace and knowledge. If we <I>pray for</I> the impenitent, it must be 
 with humble reference of the matter to God's will, not with the 
 intercessory <I>request</I> which we should offer for <I>a brother</I> 
 when erring.</P>

 <B>he that is begotten</B>--<I>Greek</I> aorist, "has been (once for 
 all in <I>past</I> time) begotten of God"; in the beginning of the 
 verse it is perfect. "Is begotten," or "born," as a <I>continuing</I> 
 state.

 <B>keepeth himself</B>--The <I>Vulgate</I> translates, "The having been 
 begotten of God keepeth <FONT SIZE=-1>HIM</FONT>" (so one of the oldest 
 manuscripts reads): so A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>.  Literally, "He 
 having been begotten of God (nominative pendent), <I>it</I> (the divine 
 generation implied in the nominative) keepeth him." So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:9">1Jo 3:9</A>,

 "His seed remaineth in him." Still, in <I>English Version</I> reading, 
 God's working by His Spirit inwardly, and man's working under the power 
 of that Spirit as a responsible agent, is what often occurs elsewhere. 
 That <I>God</I> must <I>keep</I> us, if we are to <I>keep ourselves</I> 
 from evil, is certain. Compare

 especially with this verse.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that wicked one toucheth him not</B>--so as to hurt him. In so far 
 as he realizes his regeneration-life, the prince of this world <I>hath 
 nothing in him</I> to fasten his deadly temptations on, as in Christ's 
 own case. His divine regeneration has severed once for all his 
 connection with the prince of this world.</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:21">1Jo 5:21</A>).

 Jesus, by virtue of His oneness with God, is also "He that is true"

 <B>This is the true God</B>--"<I>This</I> Jesus Christ (the last-named 
 Person) is the true God" (identifying Him thus with the Father in His 
 attribute, "the only true God,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:3">Joh 17:3</A>,

 <B>and eternal life</B>--predicated of the Son of God; 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> wrongly says, He was <I>the life,</I> but
 not <I>eternal life.</I> The Father is indeed <I>eternal life</I> as 
 its source, but the Son also is that <I>eternal life manifested,</I> as 
 the very passage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:2">1Jo 1:2</A>)

 which A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> quotes, proves against him. Compare

 Plainly it is as the <I>Mediator of</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>ETERNAL 
 LIFE</FONT> <I>to us</I> that Christ is here contemplated. The 
 <I>Greek</I> is, "The true God and eternal life is this" Jesus Christ, 
 that is, In believing in Him we believe in the true God, and have 
 eternal life. The Son is called "He that is <FONT SIZE=-1>TRUE</FONT>,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:7">Re 3:7</A>,

 as here. This naturally prepares the way for warning against 
 <I>false</I> gods

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:21">1Jo 5:21</A>).

 Jesus Christ is the only "express image of God's person" which is 
 sanctioned, the only true visible manifestation of God. All other 
 representations of God are forbidden as <I>idols.</I> Thus the Epistle 
 closes as it began

 <B>from idols</B>--Christians were then everywhere surrounded by 
 <I>idolaters,</I> with whom it was impossible to avoid intercourse. 
 Hence the need of being on their guard against any even indirect 
 compromise or act of communion with idolatry. Some at Pergamos, in the 
 region whence John wrote, fell into the snare of eating things 
 sacrificed to idols.  The moment we cease to abide "in Him that is true 
 (by abiding) in Jesus Christ," we become part of "the world that lieth 
 in the wicked one," given up to <I>spiritual,</I> if not in all places 
 <I>literal, idolatry</I>
