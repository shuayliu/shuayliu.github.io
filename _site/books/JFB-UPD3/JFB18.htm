 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OB A</FONT>
 R<FONT SIZE=-1>EAL</FONT>
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>ERSON.</FONT>--It has been supposed by some that the book of
 Job is an allegory, not a real narrative, on account of the artificial
 character of many of its statements. Thus the sacred numbers, <I>three</I> and <I>seven,</I> often occur. He had <I>seven</I> thousand sheep, <I>seven</I>
 sons, both before and after his trials; his <I>three</I> friends sit down
 with him <I>seven</I> days and <I>seven</I> nights; both before and after his
 trials he had <I>three</I> daughters. So also the number and form of the
 speeches of the several speakers seem to be artificial. The name of
 Job, too, is derived from an Arabic word signifying <I>repentance.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:14">Eze 14:14</A>
 
 (compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:16,20">Eze 14:16, 20</A>)

 speaks of "Job" in conjunction with "Noah and Daniel," real persons.
 St. James

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:11">Jas 5:11</A>)

 also refers to Job as an example of "patience," which he would not have
 been likely to do had Job been only a fictitious person. Also the names 
 of persons and places are specified with a particularity not to be 
 looked for in an allegory. As to the exact <I>doubling</I> of his 
 possessions after his restoration, no doubt the <I>round</I> number is 
 given for the exact number, as the latter approached near the former; 
 this is often done in undoubtedly <I>historical</I> books.  As to the 
 studied number and form of the speeches, it seems likely that the 
 arguments were <I>substantially</I> those which appear in the book, but 
 that <I>the studied and poetic form</I> was given by Job himself, 
 guided by the Holy Spirit. He lived one hundred and forty years after 
 his trials, and nothing would be more natural than that he should, at 
 his leisure, mould into a perfect form the arguments used in the 
 momentous debate, for the instruction of the Church in all ages. 
 Probably, too, the debate itself occupied several sittings; and the 
 number of speeches assigned to each was arranged by preconcerted 
 agreement, and each was allowed the interval of a day or more to 
 prepare carefully his speech and replies; this will account for the 
 speakers bringing forward their arguments in regular series, no one 
 speaking out of his turn. As to the name Job--<I>repentance</I> 
 (supposing the derivation correct)--it was common in old times to give 
 a name from circumstances which occurred at an advanced period of life, 
 and this is no argument against the reality of the person.</P>

 L<FONT SIZE=-1>IVED.</FONT>--"Uz," according to G<FONT SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT>, means a light, sandy
 soil, and was in the north of Arabia-Deserta, between Palestine and
 the Euphrates, called by P<FONT SIZE=-1>TOLEMY</FONT> (<I>Geography,</I> 19) <I>Ausitai</I> or
 <I>Aisitai.</I> In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:23,22:21,36:28,1Ch+1:17,42">Ge 10:23; 22:21; 36:28;
 and 1Ch 1:17, 42</A>, 
 
 it is the name of a man. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:20,La+4:21,Job+1:1">Jer 25:20;
 La 4:21;
 and Job 1:1</A>,

 it is a country. Uz, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:21">Ge 22:21</A>,

 is said to be the son of Nahor, brother of Abraham--a different person
 from the one mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:23">Ge 10:23</A>),

 a grandson of Shem. The probability is that the country took its name 
 from the latter of the two; for this one was the son of Aram, from whom 
 the Arameans take their name, and these dwelt in Mesopotamia, between 
 the rivers Euphrates and Tigris. Compare as to the dwelling of the sons
 of Shem in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:30">Ge 10:30</A>,

 "a mount <I>of the East,</I>" answering to "men <I>of the East</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:3">Job 1:3</A>).

 R<FONT SIZE=-1>AWLINSON</FONT>, in his deciphering of the Assyrian
 inscriptions, states that "Uz is the prevailing name of the country at
 the mouth of the Euphrates." It is probable that Eliphaz the Temanite
 and the Sabeans dwelt in that quarter; and we know that the Chaldeans 
 resided there, and not near Idumea, which some identify with Uz. The 
 tornado from "the wilderness"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:19">Job 1:19</A>)

 agrees with the view of it being Arabia-Deserta. Job

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:3">Job 1:3</A>)

 is called "the greatest of the men of the East"; but Idumea was not 
 east, but south of Palestine: therefore in Scripture language, the 
 phrase cannot apply to that country, but probably refers to the north 
 of Arabia-Deserta, between Palestine, Idumea, and the Euphrates. So the 
 Arabs still show in the Houran a place called Uz as the residence of 
 Job.</P>

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT>
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>GE</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>HEN</FONT>
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OB</FONT>
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>IVED.</FONT>--E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> fixes it two ages before Moses,
 that is, about the time of Isaac: eighteen hundred years before Christ,
 and six hundred after the Deluge. Agreeing with this are the following
 considerations: 1. Job's length of life is patriarchal, two hundred
 years. 2. He alludes only to the earliest form of idolatry, namely,
 the worship of the sun, moon, and heavenly hosts (called <I>Saba,</I> whence
 arises the title "Lord of <I>Sabaoth,</I>" as opposed to Sabeanism)

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:26-28">Job 31:26-28</A>).

 3. The number of oxen and rams sacrificed, <I>seven,</I> as in the case
 of Balaam. God would not have sanctioned this <I>after</I> the giving 
 of the Mosaic law, though He might graciously accommodate Himself to 
 existing customs <I>before</I> the law. 4. The language of Job is 
 Hebrew, interspersed occasionally with Syriac and Arabic expressions, 
 implying a time when all the Shemitic tribes spoke one common tongue 
 and had not branched into different dialects, Hebrew, Syriac, and 
 Arabic. 5. He speaks of the most ancient kind of writing, namely, 
 sculpture. Riches also are reckoned by cattle. The Hebrew word, 
 translated "a piece of money," ought rather be rendered "a lamb." 6.  
 There is no allusion to the exodus from Egypt and to the miracles that 
 accompanied it; nor to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (P<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ATRICK</FONT>, however, thinks there is); though there is to 
 the Flood

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:17">Job 22:17</A>);
 
 and these events, happening in Job's vicinity, would have been striking
 illustrations of the argument for God's interposition in destroying the
 wicked and vindicating the righteous, had Job and his friends known of
 them. Nor is there any <I>undoubted</I> reference to the Jewish law, ritual,
 and priesthood. 7. The religion of Job is that which prevailed among
 the patriarchs previous to the law; sacrifices performed by the head of
 the family; no officiating priesthood, temple, or consecrated altar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>RITER</FONT>.--All the foregoing facts accord with Job himself having
 been the author. The style of thought, imagery, and manners, are such
 as we should look for in the work of an Arabian emir. There is
 precisely that degree of knowledge of primitive tradition (see
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:33">Job 31:33</A>,

 as to Adam) which was universally spread abroad in the days of Noah and 
 Abraham, and which was subsequently embodied in the early chapters of 
 Genesis. Job, in his speeches, shows that he was much more competent to 
 compose the work than Elihu, to whom L<FONT SIZE=-1>IGHTFOOT</FONT> 
 attributes it. The style forbids its being attributed to Moses, to whom 
 its composition is by some attributed, "whilst he was among the 
 Midianites, about 1520 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>" But the fact, that 
 it, though not a Jewish book, appears among the Hebrew sacred writings, 
 makes it likely that it came to the knowledge of Moses during the forty 
 years which he passed in parts of Arabia, chiefly near Horeb; and that 
 he, by divine guidance, introduced it as a sacred writing to the 
 Israelites, to whom, in their affliction, the patience and restoration 
 of Job were calculated to be a lesson of especial utility. That it is 
 inspired appears from the fact that Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:19">1Co 3:19</A>)
 
 quotes it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:13">Job 5:13</A>)
 
 with the formula, "It is written." Our Savior, too

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:28">Mt 24:28</A>),

 plainly refers to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:30">Job 29:30</A>.
 
 Compare also

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:10,1Pe+5:6,Job+22:29">Jas 4:10
 and 1Pe 5:6
 with Job 22:29</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:34,35,Job+15:8">Ro 11:34, 35
 with Job 15:8</A>.

 It is probably the oldest book in the world. It stands among the
 Hagiographa in the threefold division of Scripture into the Law, the 
 Prophets, and the Hagiographa ("Psalms,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:44">Lu 24:44</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 D<FONT SIZE=-1>ESIGN OF THE</FONT>
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>OOK.</FONT>--It is a public debate in poetic form on an
 important question concerning the divine government; moreover the
 prologue and epilogue, which are in prose, shed the interest of a
 living history over the debate, which would otherwise be but a contest
 of abstract reasonings. To each speaker of the three friends <I>three</I> speeches are assigned. Job having no one to stand by him is allowed to
 reply to each speech of each of the three. Eliphaz, as the oldest,
 leads the way. Zophar, at his <I>third</I> turn, failed to speak, thus
 virtually owning himself overcome 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:1-23">Job 27:1-23</A>).

 Therefore Job continued his reply, which forms <I>three</I> speeches

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:1-14,27:1-23,28:1-28,29:1-31:40">Job 26:1-14;
 27:1-23; 28:1-28; 29:1-31:40</A>).

 Elihu

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:1-37:24">Job 32:1-37:24</A>)

 is allowed <I>four</I> speeches. Jehovah makes <I>three</I> addresses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:1-41:34">Job 38:1-41:34</A>).

 Thus, throughout there is a tripartite division.  The whole is divided 
 into <I>three</I> parts--the prologue, poem proper, and epilogue. The 
 <I>poem,</I> into three--(1) The dispute of Job and his three friends; 
 (2) The address of Elihu; (3) The address of God. There are 
 <I>three</I> series in the controversy, and in the same order. The 
 epilogue

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:1-17">Job 42:1-17</A>)

 also is threefold; Job's justification, reconciliation with his 
 friends, restoration. The speakers also in their successive speeches 
 <I>regularly advance from less to greater vehemence.</I> With all this 
 artificial composition, everything seems easy and natural.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The question to be solved, as exemplified in the case of Job, is,
 Why are the righteous afflicted consistently with God's justice? The
 doctrine of retribution after death, no doubt, is the great solution of
 the difficulty. And to it Job plainly refers in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:14,19:25">Job 14:14,
 and Job 19:25</A>.

 The objection to this, that the explicitness of the language on the 
 resurrection in Job is inconsistent with the obscurity on the subject 
 in the early books of the Old Testament, is answered by the fact that 
 Job enjoyed the divine vision

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:1,42:5">Job 38:1; 42:5</A>),

 and therefore, <I>by inspiration,</I> foretold these truths. Next, the
 revelations made outside of Israel being few needed to be the more 
 explicit; thus Balaam's prophecy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:17">Nu 24:17</A>)

 was clear enough to lead the wise men <I>of the East</I> by the star

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:2">Mt 2:2</A>);

 and in the age before the written law, it was the more needful for God 
 not to leave Himself without witness of the truth. Still Job evidently 
 did not fully realize the significance designed by the Spirit in his 
 own words (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11,12">1Pe 1:11, 12</A>).

 The doctrine, though existing, was not <I>plainly</I> revealed or at 
 least understood. Hence he does not <I>mainly</I> refer to this 
 solution. Yes, and <I>even now,</I> we need something <I>in 
 addition</I> to this solution. David, who firmly believed in a future 
 retribution

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:10,17:15">Ps 16:10; 17:15</A>),

 still felt the difficulty not <I>entirely</I> solved thereby

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:1-18">Ps 83:1-18</A>).

 The solution is not in Job's or in his three friends' speeches. It
 must, therefore, be in Elihu's. God will hold a final judgment, no 
 doubt, to clear up all that seems dark in His present dealings; but He 
 also <I>now</I> providentially and morally governs the world <I>and all 
 the events of human life.</I> Even the comparatively righteous are not 
 without sin which needs to be corrected. The justice and love of God 
 administer the altogether deserved and merciful correction. Affliction 
 to the godly is thus mercy and justice in disguise. The afflicted 
 believer on repentance sees this. "<I>Via crucis, via salutis</I>" 
 ["The way of the cross, the way of deliverance"]. Though afflicted, the 
 godly are happier <I>even now</I> than the ungodly, and when affliction 
 has attained its end, it is removed by the Lord. In the Old Testament 
 the consolations are more temporal and outward; in the New Testament, 
 more spiritual; but in neither to the entire exclusion of the other. 
 "Prosperity," says B<FONT SIZE=-1>ACON</FONT>, "is the blessing of the 
 Old Testament; adversity that of the New Testament, which is the mark 
 of God's more especial favor. Yet even in the Old Testament, if you 
 listen to David's harp, you shall hear as many hearse-like airs as 
 carols; and the pencil of the Holy Ghost has labored more in describing 
 the afflictions of Job than the felicities of Solomon. Prosperity is 
 not without many fears and distastes; and adversity is not without 
 comforts and hopes." This solution of Elihu is seconded by the 
 addresses of God, in which it is shown God <I>must</I> be just (because 
 He <I>is</I> God), as Elihu had shown <I>how</I> God can be just, and 
 yet the righteous be afflicted. It is also acquiesced in by Job, who 
 makes no reply. God reprimands the "three" friends, but not Elihu.  
 Job's general course is approved; he is directed to intercede for his 
 friends, and is restored to double his former prosperity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 P<FONT SIZE=-1>OETRY.</FONT>--In all countries poetry is the earliest form of composition
 as being best retained in the memory. In the East especially it was
 customary for sentiments to be preserved in a terse, proverbial, and
 poetic form (called <I>maschal</I>). Hebrew poetry is not constituted by
 the rhythm or meter, but in a form peculiar to itself: 1. In an
 alphabetical arrangement somewhat like our acrostic. For instance,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:1-22">La 1:1-22</A>.

 2. The same verse repeated at intervals; as in
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:1-11,107:1-43">Ps 42:1-11; 107:1-43</A>.

 3. Rhythm of gradation. <I>Psalms of degrees,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:1-134:3">Ps 120:1-134:3</A>,

 in which the expression of the previous verse is resumed and carried
 forward in the next

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+121:1-8">Ps 121:1-8</A>).

 4. The chief characteristic of Hebrew poetry is <I>parallelism,</I> or
 the correspondence of the same ideas in the parallel clauses. The 
 earliest instance is Enoch's prophecy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>),
 
 and Lamech's parody of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:23">Ge 4:23</A>).

 Three kinds occur: (1) The synonymous parallelism, in which the second
 is a repetition of the first, with or without increase of force

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:27,Isa+15:1">Ps 22:27;
 Isa 15:1</A>); 
 
 sometimes with double parallelism

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:15">Isa 1:15</A>).

 (2) The antithetic, in which the idea of the second clause is the
 converse of that in the first

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:1">Pr 10:1</A>).

 (3) The synthetic, where there is a correspondence between different
 propositions, noun answering to noun, verb to verb, member to member, 
 the sentiment, moreover, being not merely echoed, or put in contrast, 
 but enforced by accessory ideas

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:3-9">Job 3:3-9</A>).
 
 Also <I>alternate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:19">Isa 51:19</A>).

 "Desolation and destruction, famine and sword," that is, desolation by 
 famine, and destruction by the sword. <I>Introverted;</I> where the
 fourth answers to the first, and the third to the second

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:6">Mt 7:6</A>).

 Parallelism thus often affords a key to the interpretation. For fuller 
 information, see L<FONT SIZE=-1>OWTH</FONT> (<I>Introduction to
 Isaiah,</I> and <I>Lecture on Hebrew Poetry</I>) and H<FONT
 SIZE=-1>ERDER</FONT> (<I>Spirit of Hebrew Poetry,</I> translated by
 Marsh). The simpler and less artificial forms of parallelism prevail in 
 Job--a mark of its early age.</P>

 <B>1. Uz</B>--north of Arabia-Deserta, lying towards the Euphrates. It
 was in this neighborhood, and not in that of Idumea, that the Chaldeans
 and Sabeans who plundered him dwell. The Arabs divide their country
 into the north, called Sham, or "the left"; and the south, called

 their left, and the south on their right. Arabia-Deserta was on the

 <B>Job</B>--The name comes from an <I>Arabic</I> word meaning "to 
 return," namely, to God, "to repent," referring to his end [E<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ICHORN</FONT>]; or rather from a <I>Hebrew</I> word signifying 
 one to whom enmity was shown, "greatly tried" [G<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT>]. Significant names were often given among the 
 Hebrews, from some event of later life (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:2">Ge 4:2</A>,

 Abel--a "feeder" of sheep). So the emir of Uz was by general consent
 called Job, on account of his "trials." The only other person so called 
 was a son of Issachar

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:13">Ge 46:13</A>).

 Houses and lands are not mentioned among the emir's wealth, as nomadic
 tribes dwell in movable tents and live chiefly by pasture, the right to 
 the soil not being appropriated by individuals.  The "five hundred yoke 
 of oxen" imply, however, that Job tilled the soil. He seems also to 
 have had a dwelling in a town, in which respect he differed from the 
 patriarchs. Camels are well called "ships of the desert," especially 
 valuable for caravans, as being able to lay in a store of water that 
 suffices them for days, and to sustain life on a very few thistles or 
 thorns.

 Jesus also began devotions early

 The holocaust, or burnt offering, in patriarchal times, was offered
 (literally, "caused to ascend," referring to the smoke ascending to 
 heaven) by each father of a family officiating as priest in behalf of 
 his household.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>cursed God</B>--The same <I>Hebrew</I> word means to "curse," and to 
 "bless"; G<FONT SIZE=-1>ESENIUS</FONT> says, the original sense is to 
 "kneel," and thus it came to mean bending the knee in order to invoke 
 either a blessing or a curse.  Cursing is a perversion of blessing, as 
 all sin is of goodness. Sin is a degeneracy, not a generation. It is 
 not, however, likely that Job should fear the possibility of his sons 
 <I>cursing</I> God. The sense "bid farewell to," derived from the
 <I>blessing</I> customary at parting, seems sufficient

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:10">Ge 47:10</A>).

 <B>the Lord</B>--<I>Hebrew,</I> J<FONT SIZE=-1>EHOVAH</FONT>, the self-existing God, faithful to
 His promises. God says 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:3">Ex 6:3</A>)

 that He was not known to the patriarchs by this name. But, as the name
 occurs previously in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:7-9">Ge 2:7-9</A>,
 
 &c., what must be meant is, not until the time of delivering Israel by
 Moses was He known peculiarly and publicly in the <I>character</I> 
 which the name means; namely, "making things to be," fulfilling the 
 promises made to their forefathers. This name, therefore, here, is no 
 objection against the antiquity of the Book of Job.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Satan</B>--The tradition was widely spread that <I>he</I> had been the agent
 in Adam's temptation. Hence his name is given without comment. The
 feeling with which he looks on Job is similar to that with which he
 looked on Adam in Paradise: emboldened by his success in the case of
 one not yet fallen, he is confident that the piety of Job, one of a
 fallen race, will not stand the test. He had fallen himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:19,15:15,Jude+1:6">Job 4:19; 15:15;
 Jude 6</A>). 

 In the Book of Job, Satan is first designated by <I>name:</I> "Satan," 
 <I>Hebrew,</I> "one who lies in wait"; an "adversary" in a court of 
 justice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:1,Ps+109:6,Zec+3:1">1Ch 21:1;
 Ps 109:6; 
 Zec 3:1</A>);
 
 "accuser"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:10">Re 12:10</A>).

 He has the law of God on his side by man's sin, and against man. But
 Jesus Christ has fulfilled the law for us; justice is once more on
 man's side against Satan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:21">Isa 42:21</A>);

 and so Jesus Christ can plead as our Advocate against the adversary.
 "Devil" is the <I>Greek</I> name--the "slanderer," or "accuser." He is
 subject to God, who uses his ministry for chastising man. In
 <I>Arabic,</I> Satan is often applied to a serpent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:1">Ge 3:1</A>).

 He is called prince of this world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:31">Joh 12:31</A>);

 the god of this world

 Satan seems to have had some peculiar connection with this earth.
 Perhaps he was formerly its ruler under God. Man succeeded to the vice 
 royalty

 Man then lost it and Satan became prince of this world. The Son of man

 --the representative man, regains the forfeited inheritance

 are mere <I>outward and exchangeable goods,</I> but he will give up all
 things, even his religion, in order to save his life, if you touch his
 bones and flesh. "Skin" and "life" are in antithesis
 [U<FONT SIZE=-1>MBREIT</FONT>]. The
 martyrs prove Satan's sneer false. R<FONT SIZE=-1>OSENMULLER</FONT> explains it not so
 well. A man willingly gives up <I>another's</I> skin (life) for <I>his own</I> skin (life). So Job might bear the loss of his children, &c., with
 equanimity, so long as he remained unhurt himself; but when touched in
 his own person, he would renounce God. Thus the first "skin" means the
 <I>other's</I> skin, that is, body; the second "skin," <I>one's own,</I> as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:8">Job 3:8</A>

 to the hired mourners of the dead

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:17">Jer 9:17</A>).

 But the <I>Hebrew</I> for "mourning" elsewhere always denotes an 
 animal, whether it be the crocodile or some huge serpent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:1">Isa 27:1</A>),

 such as is meant by "leviathan." Therefore, the expression, "cursers of 
 day," refers to magicians, who were believed to be able by charms to 
 make a day one of evil omen.  (So Balaam,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:5">Nu 22:5</A>).
 
 This accords with U<FONT SIZE=-1>MBREIT'S</FONT> view 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:7">Job 3:7</A>);
 
 or to the Ethiopians and Atlantes, who "used to curse the sun at his
 rising for burning up them and their country"

 Job does not say they had the power they claimed; but, supposing they 
 had, may they curse the day. S<FONT SIZE=-1>CHUTTENS</FONT> renders it 
 by supplying words as follows:--Let those that are ready <I>for 
 anything, call it</I> (the day) the raiser up of leviathan, that is, of

 by this variety of terms: obliquely, Job, his wife, and children, may 
 be hinted at by the lion, lioness, and whelps. The one verb, "are 
 broken," does not suit both subjects; therefore, supply "the roaring of 
 the bellowing lion <I>is silenced.</I>" The strong lion dies of want at

 Job means, "What is man that thou shouldst make him [of so much

 trials? Job ought rather to have reasoned from God's condescending so 
 far to notice man as to try him, that there must be a wise and loving 
 purpose in trial. David uses the same words, in their right 
 application, to express wonder that God should do so much as He does 
 for insignificant man. Christians who know God manifest in the man 
 Christ Jesus may use them still more.</P>

 the stormy period of the year. He is Nimrod (the exceedingly impious

 would disprove the imputation of guilt cast on him because of the 
 sufferings of his present body. That this truth is not further dwelt on 
 by Job, or noticed by his friends, only shows that it was <I>with 
 him</I> a bright passing glimpse of <I>Old Testament</I> hope, rather
 than the steady light of <I>Gospel assurance; with us</I> this passage

 represented perfectly on the temple of Osiris at Phil&aelig;; and the

 Job, by the Spirit, often utters truths which solve the difficulty

 he would have seen the solution furnished by his own words. This

 not? God's righteous government, however, needs to be vindicated as to 
 <I>this</I> life also, and therefore the Holy Ghost has caused the

 it is applied to the Canaanite giants; perhaps in derision, to express
 their <I>weakness,</I> in spite of their gigantic size, as compared with
 Jehovah [U<FONT SIZE=-1>MBREIT</FONT>];
 or, as the imagination of the living magnifies
 apparitions, the term originally was applied to <I>ghosts,</I> and then to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:9">Isa 14:9</A>).

 But the Masoretic text joins it to "under the waters." Thus the place 
 of the dead will be represented as "under the waters"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:4,5">Ps 18:4, 5</A>);

 M<FONT SIZE=-1>AGEE</FONT> well translates thus: "The souls of the dead 
 tremble; (the places) under the waters, and their inhabitants." Thus 
 the Masoretic connection is retained; and at the same time the parallel 
 clauses are evenly balanced. "The inhabitants of the places under the 
 waters" are those in Gehenna, the lower of the two parts into which 
 Sheol, according to the Jews, is divided; they answer to "destruction," 
 that is, the place of the wicked in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:6">Job 26:6</A>,

 or "ask as a loan to be returned," implying Sheol is but a

 <A HREF="#Job24_22">Job 24:22-25</A>).

 They therefore seem to be Job's statement, not so much of his own
 sentiments, as of what Zophar would have said had he spoken when his
 turn came (end of the twenty-sixth chapter). So Job stated the friends'
 opinion

 The objection is, why, if so, does not Job answer Zophar's opinion, as
 stated by himself? The fact is, it is probable that Job tacitly, by 
 giving, in the twenty-eighth chapter, only a general answer, implies, 
 that in spite of the wicked <I>often</I> dying, as he said, in 
 prosperity, he does not mean to deny that the wicked are <I>in the 
 main</I> dealt with according to right, and that God herein vindicates 
 His moral government <I>even here.</I> Job therefore states Zophar's 
 argument more strongly than Zophar would have done. But by comparing

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:13,Job+20:29">Job 27:13
 with Job 20:29</A>

 ("portion," "heritage"), it will be seen, it is Zophar's argument,
 rather than his own, that Job states. Granting it to be true, implies
 Job, you ought not to use it as an argument to criminate <I>me.</I> For

 In the twenty-seventh chapter Job had tacitly admitted that the
 statement of the friends was often true, that God vindicated His
 justice by punishing the wicked here; but still the affliction of the
 godly remained unexplained. Man has, by skill, brought the precious
 metals from their concealment. But the Divine Wisdom, which governs
 human affairs, he cannot similarly discover

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:12">Job 28:12</A>,

 <B>in</B>--rather, "<I>with</I> my nest"; as the second clause refers to long

 long as to die with them: proverbial for long life. Job did realize his
 hope

 But the <I>Septuagint</I> and <I>Vulgate,</I> and Jewish interpreters,
 favor the translation, "the ph&oelig;nix bird." "Nest" in the parallel
 clause supports the reference to a bird. "Sand" for <I>multitude,</I> 
 applies to men, rather than to <I>years.</I> The myth was, that the 
 ph&oelig;nix sprang from a nest of myrrh, made by his father before death,
 and that he then came from Arabia (Job's country) to Heliopolis (the 
 city of the Sun) in Egypt, once in every five hundred years, and there 
 burnt his father [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ERODOTUS</FONT>, 2:73].  Modern 
 research has shown that this was the Egyptian mode of representing 
 hieroglyphically a particular chronological era or cycle. The death and 
 revival every five hundred years, and the reference to <I>the sun,</I> 
 implies such a grand cycle commencing afresh from the same point in 
 relation to the sun from which the previous one started. Job probably 
 refers to this.</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:8,10">Ge 3:8, 10</A>,

 of Adam <I>hiding</I> himself from God. Job elsewhere alludes to the 
 flood. So he might easily know of the fall, through the two links which 
 connect Adam and Abraham (about Job's time), namely, Methuselah and 
 Shem. Adam is representative of fallen man's propensity to concealment

 It was <I>from God</I> that Job did not "hide his iniquity in his 
 bosom," as on the contrary it was from God that "Adam" hid in his 
 lurking-place. This disproves the translation, "as men"; for it is 
 <I>from their fellow men</I> that "men" are chiefly anxious to hide 
 their real character as guilty.  M<FONT SIZE=-1>AGEE</FONT>, to make

 Job had acknowledged sin; but the general <I>spirit</I> of his words
 was to maintain himself to be "clean," and to charge God with 
 injustice. He went too far on the opposite side in opposing the 
 friends' false charge of hypocrisy. Even the godly, though willing to 
 confess themselves sinners in <I>general,</I> often dislike sin in 
 particular to be brought as a charge against them. Affliction is 
 therefore needed to bring them to feel that sin <I>in them</I> deserves 
 even worse than they suffer and that God does them no injustice. Then 
 at last humbled under God they find, <I>affliction is for their real

 and Job 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:33">Job 9:33</A>)

 had wished for such a "daysman" or umpire between him and God. The

 "man's upright course towards God"

 Elihu on the contrary maintains God's, and that man's true uprightness
 lies in submission to God. "One among a thousand" is a man rarely to be
 found. So Jesus Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:10">So 5:10</A>).

 This is the wonderful work of the Holy Ghost, that persons and events

 "That thou sayest (to thyself, as if a distinct person) What advantage 
 is it (thy integrity) to thee? What profit have I (by integrity) more 
 than (I should have) by my sin?" that is, more than if I had sinned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:9">Job 34:9</A>).

 Job had said that the wicked, who use <I>these very words,</I> do not 
 suffer for it

 themselves that they benefit by righteousness, or hurt by sin.

 <B>behold the clouds, which are higher than thou</B>--spoken with irony.
 Not only are they higher than thou, but thou canst not even reach them
 clearly with the eye. Yet these are not as high as God's seat. God is
 therefore too exalted to be dependent on man. Therefore He has no
 inducement to injustice in His dealings with man. When He afflicts, it
 must be from a different motive; namely, the good of the sufferer.</P>

 Elihu states in Job's words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job24:12,30:20">Job 24. 12; 30. 20</A>)

 the difficulty; the "cries" of "the oppressed" not being heard might
 lead man to think that wrongs are not punished by Him.</P>

 <A NAME="Job35_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10-13.</B> But the reason is that the innocent sufferers often do not
 humbly seek God for succor; so to their "pride" is to be laid the blame
 of their ruin; also because 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:13-16">Job 35:13-16</A>)

 they, as Job, instead of waiting God's time in pious trust, are prone 
 to despair of His justice, when it is not immediately visible

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:19-26">Job 33:19-26</A>).

 If the sufferer would apply to God with a humbled, penitent spirit, He 
 would hear.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Where,</B> &c.--

 Rather, "in calamity."</P>

 <A NAME="Job35_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>11.</B> Man's spirit, which distinguishes him from the brute, is the
 strongest proof of God's beneficence; by the use of it we may
 understand that God is the Almighty helper of all sufferers who humbly
 seek Him; and that they err who do not so seek Him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>fowls</B>--(see on

 <A HREF="#Job28_21">Job 28:21</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="Job35_12"> </A>

 They cry proudly <I>against</I> God, rather than humbly <I>to</I> God. 
 So, as the design of affliction is to humble the sufferer, there can be 
 no answer until "pride" gives place to humble, penitent prayer

 which applies in some degree to Job's cries; still more to those of the 
 wicked

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:25-27">Job 19:25-27</A>;

 which passage cannot consistently with Elihu's assertion here be 
 interpreted of "seeing" <I>a temporal</I> "redeemer"),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:7,9:11,23:3,8,9">Job 7:7; 9:11; 23:3, 8, 9</A>;

 <B>1, 2.</B> Elihu maintains that afflictions are to the godly disciplinary,
 in order to lead them to attain a higher moral worth, and that the
 reason for their continuance is not, as the friends asserted, on
 account of the sufferer's extraordinary guilt, but because the
 discipline has not yet attained its object, namely, to lend him to
 humble himself penitently before God 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:13,Jer+5:3">Isa 9:13;

 This is Elihu's <I>fourth</I> speech. He thus exceeds the ternary
 number of the others. Hence his formula of politeness

 A man, in enquiring into God's ways, should at the outset

 understanding," whereby He searches out the most minute things, so as
 to give to each his right. Elihu confirms his exhortation

 <B>15-24.</B> God shows that if Job cannot bring under control the lower
 animals (of which he selects the two most striking, behemoth on land,
 leviathan in the water), much less is he capable of governing the
 world.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>behemoth</B>--The description in part agrees with the hippopotamus, in
 part with the elephant, but exactly in all details with neither. It is
 rather a poetical personification of the great <I>Pachydermata,</I> or
 <I>Herbivora</I> (so "he eateth grass"), the idea of the hippopotamus being
 predominant. In

 (the twisting animal),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:1">Job 41:1</A>,

 is a generalized term for cetacea, pythons, saurians of the neighboring 
 seas and rivers, including the crocodile, which is the most prominent, 
 and is often associated with the river horse by old writers. "Behemoth" 
 seems to be the Egyptian <I>Pehemout,</I> "water-ox," Hebraized,
