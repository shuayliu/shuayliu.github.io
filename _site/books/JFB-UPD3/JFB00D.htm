 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 
 The prophetic <I>gift</I> existed long before the prophetic <I>office</I> was
 instituted. Thus Enoch had the former 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>);
 
 so Abraham is called <I>a prophet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:7">Ge 20:7</A>)
 
 as are also the patriarchs
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:15">Ps 105:15</A>).

 The office was first instituted under the Mosaic economy; but even then 
 the <I>gift</I> was not always connected with the office; for example, 
 Daniel was endowed largely with the gift, but was never called to the
 office, as living in a heathen court where he could not have exercised
 it. So David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:35,27:35">Mt 13:35; 27:35</A>).

 Hence the writings of both are classed with the Hagiographa, not with 
 the prophets. Moreover, though the office ceased with the close of the 
 Old Testament dispensation, the gift continued, and was among the 
 leading charisms of the New Testament Church. "Prophet" (in 
 <I>Hebrew,</I> from a root, "to gush out like a fountain") meant one 
 acting as spokesman for another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:1">Ex 7:1</A>);

 so, one speaking authoritatively for God as <I>interpreter</I> of His 
 will. "Seer" was the more ancient term

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:9">1Sa 9:9</A>),

 implying that he spake by a divine communication <I>presented either to 
 his senses or his mind:</I> as "prophet" indicated his <I>authority</I> 
 as speaking for God.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ was the only fountain of prophecy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11,Re+19:10">1Pe 1:11;
 Re 19:10</A>;

 also 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:7">Ac 16:7</A>,

 the oldest reading, "the Spirit <I>of Jesus</I>"), and declared God's 
 will to men by His Holy Spirit acting on the minds of the prophets.  
 Thus the history of the Church is the history of God's revelations of 
 Himself in His Son to man. The three divisions of this history, the 
 Patriarchal, the Mosaic, and the Christian dispensations, are 
 characterized each by a distinct mode of God's manifestations--that is, 
 by a distinct form of the prophetic gift. (1) The <I>theophanic</I> 
 mode characterizes the Patriarchal dispensation: God revealing Himself 
 in <I>visible appearances,</I> or <I>theophanies.</I> (2) The 
 <I>theopneustic</I> mode, the Mosaic: God revealing Himself through 
 <I>God-inspired men.</I> (3) The <I>theologic</I> mode, the Christian: 
 God revealing Himself, not merely at intervals as before, but
 permanently by <I>inspired writings</I> ("the oracles of God,"

 <A  HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:11">1Pe 4:11</A>).</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the <I>first</I> or patriarchal age, men work no miracles, unlike 
 all other primeval histories, which abound in miracles wrought by men: 
 a proof of genuineness. All the miracles are wrought by God without 
 man's intervention; and the divine communications are usually by direct
 utterance, whence the prophetic gift is rare, as God in this
 dispensation only exceptionally employs the prophetic agency of men in
 it: only in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:7">Ge 20:7</A>,

 is the term "prophet" found. In the <I>second</I> or Mosaic 
 dispensation, God withdraws Himself more from direct communication with 
 man and manifests Himself through human instruments.  Instead of 
 working miracles <I>directly,</I> Moses, Joshua, &c., are His agents.  
 So in His communications He speaks not directly, but through Moses and 
 his successors. The theocracy needed a new form of prophetic gift: 
 <I>God-inspired</I> (<I>theopneustic</I>) <I>men</I> must speak and act 
 for God, the Head of the theocracy, as His administrators; the 
 prophetic <I>gift</I> is therefore now connected with the prophetic 
 <I>office.</I> These prophets accordingly are <I>acting,</I> not 
 <I>writing,</I> prophets. The latter did not arise till the later ages 
 of this second dispensation. Moses <I>acted</I> as a legislator; 
 Joshua, the Judges, and Samuel as executive prophets; David and Solomon 
 as devotional prophets. Even in the case of the writing prophets of the 
 latter half of the Mosaic dispensation, their <I>primary</I> duty was 
 to speak and act. Their writing had reference more to the use of the 
 New Testament dispensation than to their own

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:12">1Pe 1:12</A>).

 So that even in their case the characteristic of the Mosaic 
 dispensation was <I>theopneustic,</I> rather than <I>theologic.</I> The 
 <I>third,</I> or Christian dispensation, is <I>theologic,</I> that is, 
 a revelation of God by inspired <I>writings.</I> Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:11,2Pe+1:16-21">1Pe 4:11;
 2Pe 1:16-21</A>,

 where he contrasts "the old time" when "holy men <I>spake</I> by the 
 Holy Ghost" with our time when we have the "sure word of prophecy"; or, 
 as it may be translated, "the word of prophecy confirmed [to us]." Thus 
 God now reveals His will, not by direct <I>theophanies,</I> as in the 
 first dispensation; not by <I>inspired men,</I> as in the second; but 
 by the written <I>word</I> which <I>liveth</I> and <I>abideth</I> for 
 ever (as opposed to the desultory manifestations of God, and the
 noncontinuance in life of the prophets, under the two former
 dispensations respectively,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:23,2Pe+3:2,16">1Pe 1:23;
 2Pe 3:2, 16</A>).

 The next form shall be the return of the theophanic manifestations on 
 earth, in a more perfect and abiding form than in the first age

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:3">Re 21:3</A>).</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The history of the prophetic office under the Mosaic dispensation falls 
 into three divisions. (1) The first ends with the age of Samuel and has 
 no regular succession of prophets, these not being needed while <I>God 
 Himself</I> ruled the people without an hereditary executive. (2) The 
 second period extends from Samuel to Uzziah, 800 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, and is the age of prophets of action. Samuel
 combined in himself the three elements of the theocracy, being a judge, 
 a priest, and a prophet. The creation of a human king rendered the 
 formal office of prophet more necessary as a counterpoise to it. Hence 
 the age of the kings is the age of the prophets. But at this stage they 
 were prophets of action, rather than of writing. Towards the close of 
 this second period, the devotional and Messianic prophecies of David 
 and Solomon prepared the way for the third period (from 800 <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> to 400 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>), which began 
 under Uzziah, and which was the age of written prophecy. (3) In this 
 third period the prophets turn from the present to the future, and so 
 the Messianic element grows more distinct. Thus in these three shorter 
 periods the grand characteristics of the three great dispensations 
 reappear. The first is <I>theophanic;</I> the second, 
 <I>theopneustic;</I> and the third, <I>theologic.</I> Just as the great 
 organic laws of the world reappear in smaller departments, the law of 
 the tree developing itself in miniature forms in the structure of the 
 leaf, and the curve of the planet's orbit reappearing in the line 
 traced by the projected cannon ball [M<FONT SIZE=-1>OORE</FONT>].</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 
 Samuel probably enacted rules giving a permanent form to the
 prophetic order; at least in his time the first mention occurs of
 "schools of the prophets." These were all near each other, and in
 Benjamin, namely, in Beth-el, Gilgal, Ramah, and Jericho. Had the
 prophet been a mere foreteller of events, such schools would have been
 useless. But he was also God's representative to ensure the due
 execution of the Mosaic ritual in its purity; hence arose the need of
 schools wherein to study that divinely ordained institution. God mostly
 chose His prophets from those thus educated, though not exclusively, as
 the cases of Amos 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:14">Am 7:14</A>)
 
 and Elisha 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:19">1Ki 19:19</A>)

 prove. The fact that the humblest might be called to the prophetic 
 office <I>acted</I> as a check to the hereditary kingly power and a
 stimulus to seeking the qualifications needed for so exalted an office. 
 The Messianic Psalms towards the close of this second period form the 
 transition between the prophets of <I>action</I> and the prophets of 
 <I>word,</I> the men who were busy only with the present, and the men 
 who looked out from the present into the glorious future.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The third period, that from Uzziah to Malachi, includes three classes 
 of prophets: (1) Those of the ten tribes; (2) Those of the Gentiles; 
 (3) Those of Judah. In the first class were Hosea and Amos.  Few of the 
 <I>writing</I> prophets belonged to Israel. They naturally gathered 
 about the seat of the theocracy in Judah. Hence those of the ten tribes 
 were mostly prophets of action. Under the second class fall Jonah, 
 Nahum, and Obadiah, who were witnesses for God's authority over the 
 Gentile world, as others witnessed for the same in the theocracy.  The 
 third class, those of Judah, have a wider scope and a more hopeful, 
 joyous tone. They fall into five divisions: (1) <I>Those dwelling in 
 Judah at the highest point of its greatness</I> during its separate 
 state; namely, the century between Uzziah and Hezekiah, 800-700 <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, Isaiah, Joel, and Micah. (2) The declining period 
 of Judah, from Manasseh to Zedekiah, for example, Zephaniah and 
 Habakkuk. (3) <I>The captivity:</I> Jeremiah. (4) <I>The exile,</I> 
 when the future was all that the eye could rest on with hope; for 
 example, Ezekiel and Daniel, who are chiefly prophets of the future. 
 (5) <I>The restoration:</I> to which period belong the three last 
 writing prophets of the Old Testament, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. 
 John the Baptist long subsequently belonged to the same dispensation,
 but he wrote nothing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:9-11">Mt 11:9-11</A>);

 like Elijah, he was a prophet of action and preaching, preparing the 
 way for the prophets of <I>word,</I> as John did for the Incarnate 
 Word.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To understand the spirit of each prophet's teaching, his historical 
 position and the circumstances of the time must be considered. The 
 captivity was designed to eradicate the Jews' tendency to idolatry and 
 to restore the theocratic spirit which recognized God as the only 
 ruler, and the Mosaic institutions as His established law, for a time 
 until Messiah should come. Hence the prophets of the restoration are 
 best illustrated by comparison with the histories of Ezra and Nehemiah,
 contemporaries of Malachi.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Of the three prophets of the restoration, two, Haggai and Zechariah, 
 are at the beginning of the period, and the remaining one, Malachi, is 
 at the close. The exile was not one complete deportation of the people, 
 but a series of deportations extending over a century and a half. So 
 the restoration was not accomplished at once, but in successive returns 
 extending over a century. Hence arises the different tone of Haggai and 
 Zechariah at its beginning, and of Malachi at its close. The first 
 return took place in the first year of Cyrus, 536 <FONT
 SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>; 42,360 persons returned under Shesh-bazzar or
 Zerubbabel and Joshua

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:64">Ezr 2:64</A>).

 They built an altar and laid the foundations of the temple. They were
 interrupted by the misrepresentations of the Samaritans, and the work
 was suspended for fourteen years. The death of Smerdis gave an
 opportunity of renewing the work, seventy years after the destruction
 of the first temple. This was the time when Haggai and Zechariah arose,
 the former to incite to the immediate rebuilding of the temple and
 restoration of the Mosaic ritual, the latter to aid in the work and to
 unfold the grand future of the theocracy as an incentive to present
 labor. The impossibility of observing the Mosaic ritual in the exile
 generated an anti-theocratic indifference to it in the young who were
 strangers to the Jerusalem worship, from which the nation had been
 debarred for upwards of half a century. Moreover, the gorgeous pomp of
 Babylon tended to make them undervalue the humble rites of Jehovah's
 worship at that time. Hence there was need of a Haggai and a Zechariah
 to correct these feelings by unfolding the true glory of the theocratic
 institutions.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 
 The next great epoch was the return of Ezra, 458 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, eighty years
 after the first expedition under Zerubbabel. Thirteen years later, 445
 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>, Nehemiah came to aid Ezra in the good work. It was now that
 Malachi arose to second these works, three-fourths of a century after
 Haggai and Zechariah. As their work was that of <I>restorers,</I> his was
 that of a <I>reformer.</I> The estates of many had become mortgaged, and
 depression of circumstances had led many into a skeptical spirit as to
 the service of God. They not only neglected the temple of worship, but
 took heathen wives, to the wrong of their Jewish wives and the dishonor
 of God. Therefore, besides the reformation of <I>civil</I> abuses and the
 rebuilding of the wall, effected through Nehemiah's exertions, a
 <I>religious</I> reformer was needed such as was Ezra, who reformed the
 ecclesiastical abuses, established synagogues, where regular
 instruction in the law could be received, restored the Sabbath, and the
 Passover, and the dignity of the priesthood, and generated a reverence
 for the written law, which afterwards became a superstition. Malachi
 aided in this good work by giving it his prophetical authority. How
 thoroughly the work was effected is proved by the utter change in the
 national character. Once always prone to idolatry, ever since the
 captivity they have abhorred it. Once loving kingly rule, now contrary
 to the ordinary course of history, they became submissive to priestly
 rule. Once negligent of the written Word, now they regarded it with
 reverence sometimes bordering on superstition. Once fond of foreign
 alliances, henceforth they shrank with abhorrence from all foreigners.
 Once fond of agriculture, now they became a trading people. From being
 pliable before, they now became intensely bigoted and nationally
 intolerant. Thus the restoration from Babylon moulded the national
 character more than any event since the exodus from Egypt.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the distinction between Judah and the ten tribes of Israel 
 disappears. So in the New Testament the <I>twelve</I> tribes are
 mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:7,Jam+1:1">Ac 26:7;
 Jas 1:1</A>).

 The theocratic feeling generated at the restoration drew all of the 
 elect nation round the seat of the theocracy, the metropolis of the 
 true religion, Jerusalem. Malachi tended to promote this feeling; thus 
 his prophecy, though addressed to the people of Jerusalem, is called 
 "the word of the Lord to <I>Israel</I>"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:1">Mal 1:1</A>].</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The long silence of prophets from Malachi to the times of Messiah was 
 calculated to awaken in the Jewish mind the more earnest desire for Him 
 who was to exceed infinitely in word and deed all the prophets, His 
 forerunners. The three prophets of the restoration being the last of
 the Old Testament, are especially distinct in pointing to Him who, as 
 the great subject of the New Testament, was to fulfil all the Old 
 Testament.</P>
