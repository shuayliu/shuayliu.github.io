 The Pentateuch, the name by which the first five books of the Bible are
 designated, is derived from two Greek words, <I>pente,</I> "five," and
 <I>teuchos,</I> a "volume," thus signifying the fivefold volume.
 Originally these books formed one continuous work, as in the Hebrew
 manuscripts they are still connected in one unbroken roll. At what time
 they were divided into five portions, each having a separate title, is
 not known, but it is certain that the distinction dates at or before
 the time of the <I>Septuagint</I> translation. The names they bear in
 our English version are borrowed from the <I>Septuagint,</I> and they
 were applied by those Greek translators as descriptive of the principal 
 subjects--the leading contents of the respective books. In the later 
 Scriptures they are frequently comprehended under the general 
 designation, <I>The Law, The Book of the Law,</I> since, to give a 
 detailed account of the preparations for, and the delivery of, the 
 divine code, with all the civil and sacred institutions that were 
 peculiar to the ancient economy, is the object to which they are 
 exclusively devoted. They have always been placed at the beginning of 
 the Bible, not only on account of their priority in point of time, but 
 as forming an appropriate and indispensable introduction to the rest of 
 the sacred books. The numerous and oft-recurring references made in the 
 later Scriptures to the events, the ritual, and the doctrines of the 
 ancient Church would have not only lost much of their point and 
 significance, but have been absolutely unintelligible without the 
 information which these five books contain.  They constitute the 
 groundwork or basis on which the whole fabric of revelation rests, and 
 a knowledge of the authority and importance that is thus attached to 
 them will sufficiently account for the determined assaults that 
 infidels have made on these books, as well as for the zeal and 
 earnestness which the friends of the truth have displayed in their 
 defense.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Mosaic origin of the Pentateuch is established by the concurring
 voices both of Jewish and Christian tradition; and their unanimous
 testimony is supported by the internal character and statements of the 
 work itself. That Moses did keep a written record of the important 
 transactions relative to the Israelites is attested by his own express 
 affirmation. For in relating the victory over the Amalekites, which he 
 was commanded by divine authority to record, the language employed, 
 "write this for a memorial in a book" [<I>Hebrew,</I> the book],

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:14">Ex 17:14</A>),

 shows that that narrative was to form part of a register already in 
 progress, and various circumstances combine to prove that this register 
 was a continuous history of the special goodness and care of divine 
 providence in the choice, protection, and guidance of the Hebrew 
 nation. First, there are the repeated assertions of Moses himself that 
 the events which checkered the experience of that people were written
 down as they occurred (see

 Nu 33:2</A>).

 Secondly, there are the testimonies borne in various parts of the later 
 historical books to the Pentateuch as a work well known, and familiar 
 to all the people (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:8,8:34,23:6,24:26,1Ki+2:3">Jos 1:8; 8:34; 23:6; 24:26;
 1Ki 2:3</A>, &c.)

 Thirdly, frequent references are made in the works of the prophets to
 the facts recorded in the books of Moses

 Fourthly, the testimony of Christ and the Apostles is repeatedly borne
 to the books of Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:7,Lu+16:29,24:27,Joh+1:17,7:19,Ac+3:22,28:23,Ro+10:5">Mt 19:7; 
 Lu 16:29; 24:27; 
 Joh 1:17; 7:19; 
 Ac 3:22; 28:23; 
 Ro 10:5</A>).

 Indeed the references are so numerous, and the testimonies so 
 distinctly borne to the existence of the Mosaic books throughout the 
 whole history of the Jewish nation, and the unity of character, design, 
 and style pervading these books is so clearly perceptible, 
 notwithstanding the rationalistic assertions of their forming a series 
 of separate and unconnected fragments, that it may with all safety be 
 said, there is immensely stronger and more varied evidence in proof of 
 their being the authorship of Moses than of any of the Greek or Roman 
 classics being the productions of the authors whose names they bear. 
 But admitting that the Pentateuch was written by Moses, an important 
 question arises, as to whether the books which compose it have reached 
 us in an authentic form; whether they exist genuine and entire as they 
 came from the hands of their author. In answer to this question, it 
 might be sufficient to state that, in the public and periodical 
 rehearsals of the law in the solemn religious assemblies of the people, 
 implying the existence of numerous copies, provision was made for 
 preserving the integrity of "The Book of the Law." But besides this, 
 two remarkable facts, the one of which occurred before and the other 
 after the captivity, afford conclusive evidence of the genuineness and 
 authenticity of the Pentateuch. The first is the discovery in the reign 
 of Josiah of the autograph copy which was deposited by Moses in the ark 
 of the testimony, and the second is the schism of the Samaritans, who 
 erected a temple on Mount Gerizim, and who, appealing to the Mosaic law 
 as the standard of their faith and worship equally with the Jews, 
 watched with jealous care over every circumstance that could affect the 
 purity of the Mosaic record. There is the strongest reason, then, for 
 believing that the Pentateuch, as it exists now, is substantially the 
 same as it came from the hands of Moses. The appearance of a later 
 hand, it is true, is traceable in the narrative of the death of Moses 
 at the close of Deuteronomy, and some few interpolations, such as 
 inserting the altered names of places, may have been made by Ezra, who 
 revised and corrected the version of the ancient Scriptures. But, 
 substantially, the Pentateuch is the genuine work of Moses, and many, 
 who once impugned its claims to that character, and looked upon it as 
 the production of a later age, have found themselves compelled, after a 
 full and unprejudiced investigation of the subject, to proclaim their 
 conviction that its authenticity is to be fully relied on.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The genuineness and authenticity of the Pentateuch being admitted, the 
 inspiration and canonical authority of the work follow as a necessary 
 consequence. The admission of Moses to the privilege of frequent and 
 direct communion with God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+25:22,33:3,Nu+7:89,9:8">Ex 25:22; 33:3;
 Nu 7:89; 9:8</A>);

 his repeated and solemn declarations that he spoke and wrote by command 
 of God; the submissive reverence that was paid to the authority of his
 precepts by all classes of the Jewish people, including the king
 himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:18,27:3">De 17:18; 27:3</A>);

 and the acknowledgment of the divine mission of Moses by the writers of 
 the New Testament, all prove the inspired character and authority of
 his books. The Pentateuch possessed the strongest claims on the
 attention of the Jewish people, as forming the standard of their faith, 
 the rule of their obedience, the record of their whole civil and 
 religious polity. But it is interesting and important to all mankind, 
 inasmuch as besides revealing the origin and early development of the 
 divine plan of grace, it is the source of all authentic knowledge, 
 giving the true philosophy, history, geography, and chronology of the 
 ancient world. Finally, the Pentateuch "is indispensable to the whole 
 revelation contained in the Bible; for Genesis being the legitimate 
 preface to the law; the law being the natural introduction to the Old 
 Testament; and the whole a prelude to the gospel revelation, it could 
 not have been omitted. What the four Gospels are in the New, the five 
 books of Moses are in the Old Testament."</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ENESIS,</FONT> the book of the origin or production of
 all things, consists of two parts: the first, comprehended in the first
 through eleventh chapters, gives a general history; the second,
 contained in the subsequent chapters, gives a special history. The two
 parts are essentially connected; the one, which sets out with an
 account of the descent of the human race from a single pair, the
 introduction of sin into the world, and the announcement of the scheme
 of divine mercy for repairing the ruins of the fall, was necessary to 
 pave the way for relating the other, namely, the call of Abraham, and 
 the selection of his posterity for carrying out the gracious purpose of 
 God. An evident unity of method, therefore, pervades this book, and the 
 information contained in it was of the greatest importance to the 
 Hebrew people, as without it they could not have understood the 
 frequent references made in their law to the purposes and promises of 
 God regarding themselves.  The arguments that have been already adduced 
 as establishing the Mosaic origin of the Pentateuch prove of course 
 that Moses was the author of Genesis. The few passages on which the 
 rationalists grounded their assertions that it was the composition of a 
 later age have been successfully shown to warrant no such conclusion; 
 the use of Egyptian words and the minute acquaintance with Egyptian 
 life and manners, displayed in the history of Joseph, harmonize with 
 the education of Moses, and whether he received his information by 
 immediate revelation, from tradition, or from written documents, it 
 comes to us as the authentic work of an author who wrote as he was 
 inspired by the Holy Ghost

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 E<FONT SIZE=-1>XODUS,</FONT> a "going forth," derives its name from its
 being occupied principally with a relation of the departure of the
 Israelites from Egypt, and the incidents that immediately preceded as 
 well as followed that memorable migration. Its authorship by Moses is 
 distinctly asserted by himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:4">Ex 24:4</A>),
 
 as well as by our Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:26,Lu+20:37">Mr 12:26;
 Lu 20:37</A>).

 Besides, the thorough knowledge it exhibits of the institutions and
 usages of the ancient Egyptians and the minute geographical details of
 the journey to Sinai, establish in the clearest manner the authenticity
 of this book.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 L<FONT SIZE=-1>EVITICUS.</FONT> So called from its treating of the laws 
 relating to the ritual, the services, and sacrifices of the Jewish
 religion, the superintendence of which was entrusted to the Levitical
 priesthood. It is chiefly, however, the duties of the priests, "the
 sons of Aaron," which this book describes; and its claim to be the work 
 of Moses is established by the following passages:--

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:16,Ne+8:14,Jer+7:22-23,Eze+20:11,Mt+8:4,Lu+2:22,Joh+8:5">2Ch 30:16; 
 Ne 8:14;

 Eze 20:11</A>

 Lu 2:22; 
 Joh 8:5; 
 Ro 10:4; 13:9; 
 2Co 6:16; 
 Ga 3:12; 
 1Pe 1:16</A>.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 N<FONT SIZE=-1>UMBERS.</FONT> This book is so called because it
 contains an account of the enumeration and arrangement of the
 Israelites. The early part of it, from the first through the tenth
 chapters, appears to be a supplement to Leviticus, being occupied with
 relating the appointment of the Levites to the sacred offices. The
 journal of the march through the wilderness is then given as far as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:20">Nu 21:20</A>;

 after which the early incidents of the invasion are narrated. One 
 direct quotation only from this book

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:5">Nu 16:5</A>)
 
 is made in the New Testament 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:19">2Ti 2:19</A>);

 but indirect references to it by the later sacred writers are very 
 numerous.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 D<FONT SIZE=-1>EUTERONOMY,</FONT> the <I>second law,</I> a title which
 plainly shows what is the object of this book, namely, a recapitulation
 of the law. It was given in the form of public addresses to the people;
 and as Moses spoke in the prospect of his speedy removal, he enforced
 obedience to it by many forcible appeals to the Israelites, concerning
 their long and varied experience both of the mercies and the judgments 
 of God. The minute notices of the heathen people with whom they had 
 come in contact, but who afterward disappeared from the pages of 
 history, as well as the accounts of the fertility and products of 
 Canaan, and the counsels respecting the conquest of that country, fix 
 the date of this book and the time of its composition by the hand of 
 Moses. The close, however, must have been added by another; and, 
 indeed, it is supposed by some to have formed the original preface to 
 the Book of Joshua.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSHUA.</FONT> The title of this book is derived from the
 pious and valiant leader whose achievements it relates and who is
 commonly supposed to have been its author. The objections to this idea
 are founded chiefly on the clause, "unto this day," which occurs
 several times

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+4:9,6:25,8:28">Jos 4:9; 6:25; 8:28</A>).

 But this, at least in the case of Rahab, is no valid reason for 
 rejecting the idea of his authorship; for assuming what is most 
 probable, that this book was composed toward the close of Joshua's long 
 career, or compiled from written documents left by him, Rahab might 
 have been still alive. A more simple and satisfactory way of accounting 
 for the frequent insertion of the clause, "unto this day," is the 
 opinion that it was a comment introduced by Ezra, when revising the 
 sacred canon; and this difficulty being removed, the direct proofs of 
 the book having been produced by a witness of the transactions related 
 in it, the strong and vivid descriptions of the passing scenes, and the
 use of the words "we" and "us,"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:1-6">Jos 5:1-6</A>),

 viewed in connection with the fact, that, after his farewell address to
 the people, Joshua "wrote these words in the book of the law of God"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:26">Jos 24:26</A>]

 --all afford strong presumptive proof that the entire book was the work
 of that eminent individual. Its inspiration and canonical authority are 
 fully established by the repeated testimonies of other Scripture 
 writers (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+6:26,1Ki+16:34">Jos 6:26
 with 1Ki 16:34</A>;

 with Jas 2:25;
 Ps 44:2; 68:12-14; 78:54-55</A>).

 As a narrative of God's faithfulness in giving the Israelites 
 possession of the promised land, this history is most valuable, and 
 bears the same character as a sequel to the Pentateuch, that the Acts
 of the Apostles do to the Gospels.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 J<FONT SIZE=-1>UDGES</FONT> is the title given to the next book, from
 its containing the history of those non-regal rulers who governed the
 Hebrews from the time of Joshua to that of Eli, and whose functions in
 time of peace consisted chiefly in the administration of justice,
 although they occasionally led the people in their wars against their 
 public enemies.  The date and authorship of this book are not precisely 
 known. It is certain, however, that it preceded the Second Book of 
 Samuel (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:35,2Sa+11:21">Jud 9:35
 with 2Sa 11:21</A>),

 as well as the conquest of Jerusalem by David (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:21,2Sa+5:6">Jud 1:21
 with 2Sa 5:6</A>).

 Its author was in all probability Samuel, the last of the judges (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:1,21:25">Jud 19:1; 21:25</A>),

 and the date of the first part of it is fixed in the reign of Saul,
 while the five chapters at the close might not have been written till
 after David's establishment as king in Israel (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:31">Jud 18:31</A>).

 It is a fragmentary history, being a collection of important facts and
 signal deliverances at different times and in various parts of the
 land, during the intermediate period of three hundred years between
 Joshua and the establishment of the monarchy. The inspired character of
 this book is confirmed by allusions to it in many passages of Scripture
 (compare

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 R<FONT SIZE=-1>UTH</FONT> is properly a supplement to the preceding 
 book, to which, in fact, it was appended in the ancient Jewish canon.  
 Although it relates an episode belonging to the time of the Judges, its
 precise date is unknown. It appears certain, however, that it could not
 have been written prior to the time of Samuel (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:17-22">Ru 4:17-22</A>),

 who is generally supposed to have been its author; and this opinion, in
 addition to other reasons on which it rests, is confirmed by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:7">Ru 4:7</A>,

 where it is evident that the history was not compiled till long after 
 the transactions recorded. The inspiration and canonical authority of 
 the book is attested by the fact of Ruth's name being inserted by 
 Matthew in the Saviour's genealogy

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:5">Mt 1:5</A>].</P>

 The two were, by the ancient Jews, conjoined so as to make one book, 
 and in that form could be called the Book of Samuel with more propriety
 than now, the second being wholly occupied with the relation of
 transactions that did not take place till after the death of that
 eminent judge. Accordingly, in the <I>Septuagint</I> and the
 <I>Vulgate,</I> it is called the First and Second Books of Kings.  The
 early portion of the First Book, down to the end of the twenty-fourth
 chapter, was probably written by Samuel; while the rest of it and the
 whole of the Second, are commonly ascribed to Nathan and Gad, founding
 the opinion on

 Commentators, however, are divided about this, some supposing that the
 statements in

 that its composition must be referred to a later age. It is probable, 
 however, that these supposed marks of an after-period were
 interpolations of Ezra. This uncertainty, however, as to the authorship
 does not affect the inspired authority of the book, which is
 indisputable, being quoted in the New Testament

 in the ancient copies of the <I>Hebrew</I> Bible, constitute one book.  
 Various titles have been given them; in the <I>Septuagint</I> and the 
 <I>Vulgate</I> they are called the Third and Fourth Books of Kings. The 
 authorship of these books is unknown; but the prevailing opinion is 
 that they were compiled by Ezra, or one of the later prophets, from the 
 ancient documents that are so frequently referred to in the course of 
 the history as of public and established authority. Their inspired 
 character was acknowledged by the Jewish Church, which ranked them in 
 the sacred canon; and, besides, it is attested by our Lord, who 
 frequently quotes from them (compare

 were also considered as one by the ancient Jews, who called them "words 
 of days," that is, diaries or journals, being probably compiled from 
 those registers that were kept by the king's historiographers of 
 passing occurrences. In the <I>Septuagint</I> the title given them is 
 <I>Paraleipomenon,</I> "of things omitted," that is, the books are 
 supplementary because many things unnoticed in the former books are 
 here recorded; and not only the omissions are supplied, but some 
 narratives extended while others are added. The authorship is commonly 
 ascribed to Ezra, whose leading object seems to have been to show the 
 division of families, possessions, &c., before the captivity, with a 
 view to the exact restoration of the same order after the return from 
 Babylon. Although many things are restated and others are exact 
 repetitions of what is contained in Kings, there is so much new and 
 important information that, as J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> has well 
 said, the Chronicles furnish the means of comprehending parts of the 
 New Testament, which must have been unintelligible without them. They 
 are frequently referred to by Christ and the Apostles as forming part 
 of "the Word of God" (see the genealogies in

 E<FONT SIZE=-1>ZRA</FONT> was, along with Nehemiah, reckoned one book 
 by the ancient Jews, who called them the First and Second Books of 
 Ezra, and they are still designated by Roman Catholic writers the First 
 and Second Books of Esdras. This book naturally divides itself into two 
 parts or sections, the one contained in the first six chapters, and 
 which relates the circumstances connected with the return of the first 
 detachment of Babylonish exiles under Zerubbabel with the consequent 
 rebuilding of the temple and the re-establishment of the divine 
 service. The other part, embraced in the four concluding chapters, 
 narrates the journey of a second caravan of returning captives under 
 the conduct of Ezra himself, who was invested with powers to restore, 
 in all its splendor, the entire system of the Jewish ritual. The 
 general opinion of the Church in every succeeding age has been that 
 Ezra was the author of this book. The chief objection is founded on

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:4">Ezr 5:4</A>,

 where the words, "Then said we unto them after this manner, What are 
 the names of the men that make this building?" have occasioned a 
 surmise that the first portion of the book was not written by Ezra, who 
 did not go to Jerusalem for many years after. But a little attention 
 will show the futility of this objection, as the words in question did 
 not refer to the writer, but were used by Tatnai and his associates

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:3">Ezr 5:3</A>].

 The style and unity of object in the book clearly prove it to have been 
 the production of but one author. The canonical authority of this book 
 is well established; but another under the name of Ezra is rejected as
 apocryphal.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 N<FONT SIZE=-1>EHEMIAH</FONT> appears to have been the author of this 
 book, from his usually writing in his own name, and indeed, except in 
 those parts which are unmistakably later editions or borrowed from 
 public documents, he usually employs the first person. The major
 portion of the book is occupied with a history of Nehemiah's twelve
 years' administration in Jerusalem, after which he returned to his
 duties in Shushan. At a later period he returned with new powers and
 commenced new and vigorous measures of reform, which are detailed in
 the later chapters of the book.</P>

 <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 E<FONT SIZE=-1>STHER</FONT> derives its name from the Jewess, who,
 having become wife of the king of Persia, employed her royal influence
 to effect a memorable deliverance for the persecuted Church of God.
 Various opinions are embraced and supported as to the authorship of
 this book, some ascribing it to Ezra, to Nehemiah, or to Mordecai. The
 preponderance of authorities is in favor of the last. The historical
 character of the book is undoubted, since, besides many internal 
 evidences, its authenticity is proved by the strong testimony of the 
 feast of Purim, the celebration of which can be traced up to the events 
 which are described in this book. Its claim, however, to canonical 
 authority has been questioned on the ground that the name of God does 
 not once occur in it. But the uniform tradition both of the Jewish and 
 the Christian Churches supports this claim, which nothing in the book 
 tends to shake; while it is a record of the superintending care of 
 divine providence over his chosen people, with which it is of the 
 utmost importance the Church should be furnished. The name of God is 
 strangely enough omitted, but the presence of God is felt throughout 
 the history; and the whole tone and tendency of the book is so 
 decidedly subservient to the honor of God and the cause of true 
 religion that it has been generally received by the Church in all ages
 into the sacred canon.</P>
