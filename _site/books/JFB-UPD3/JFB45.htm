 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT>
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ENUINENESS</FONT> of the Epistle to the Romans has never been
 questioned. It has the unbroken testimony of all antiquity, up to
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> R<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT>, the apostle's "fellow laborer in the Gospel, whose
 name was in the Book of Life" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:3">Php 4:3</A>),

 and who quotes from it in his undoubted Epistle to the Corinthians, 
 written before the close of the first century. The most searching 
 investigations of modern criticism have left it untouched.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 W<FONT SIZE=-1>HEN</FONT> and
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>HERE</FONT> this Epistle was written we have the means of
 determining with great precision, from the Epistle itself compared with
 the Acts of the Apostles. Up to the date of it the apostle had never
 been at Rome 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:11,13,15">Ro 1:11, 13, 15</A>).

 He was then on the eve of visiting Jerusalem with a pecuniary 
 contribution for its Christian poor from the churches of Macedonia and 
 Achaia, after which his purpose was to pay a visit to Rome on his way 
 to Spain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:23-28">Ro 15:23-28</A>).

 Now this contribution we know that he carried with him from Corinth, at 
 the close of his third visit to that city, which lasted three months

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:2,3,24:17">Ac 20:2, 3; 24:17</A>).

 On this occasion there accompanied him from Corinth certain persons 
 whose names are given by the historian of the Acts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:4">Ac 20:4</A>),

 and four of these are expressly mentioned in our Epistle as being with 
 the apostle when he wrote it--Timotheus, Sosipater, Gaius, and Erastus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:21,23">Ro 16:21, 23</A>).

 Of these four, the third, Gaius, was an inhabitant of Corinth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:14">1Co 1:14</A>),

 and the fourth, Erastus, was "chamberlain of <I>the city</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:23">Ro 16:23</A>),

 which can hardly be supposed to be other than Corinth. Finally, 
 Ph&oelig;bebe, the bearer, as appears, of this Epistle, was a deaconess 
 of the Church at Cenchrea, the eastern port of Corinth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:1">Ro 16:1</A>).

 Putting these facts together, it is impossible to resist the 
 conviction, in which all critics agree, that Corinth was the place from 
 which the Epistle was written, and that it was despatched about the 
 close of the visit above mentioned, probably in the early spring of the 
 year 58.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The F<FONT SIZE=-1>OUNDER</FONT> of this celebrated church is unknown. 
 That it owed its origin to the apostle Peter, and that he was its first 
 bishop, though an ancient tradition and taught in the Church of Rome as 
 a fact not to be doubted, is refuted by the clearest evidence, and is 
 given up even by candid Romanists. On that supposition, how are we to 
 account for so important a circumstance being passed by in silence by 
 the historian of the Acts, not only in the narrative of Peter's labors, 
 but in that of Paul's approach to the metropolis, of the deputations of 
 Roman "brethren" that came as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns 
 to meet him, and of his two years' labors there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:15,30">Ac 28:15, 30</A>)?

 And how, consistently with his declared principle--not to build on
 another man's foundation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:20">Ro 15:20</A>)

 --could he express his anxious desire to come to them that he might 
 have some fruit among them also, even as among other Gentiles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:13">Ro 1:13</A>),

 if all the while he knew that they had the apostle of the circumcision 
 for their spiritual father? And how, if so, is there no salutation to 
 Peter among the many in this Epistle? or, if it may be thought that he 
 was known to be elsewhere at that particular time, how does there occur 
 in all the Epistles which our apostle afterwards wrote from Rome not 
 one allusion to such an origin of the church at Rome? The same 
 considerations would seem to prove that this church owed its origin to 
 no prominent Christian laborer; and this brings us to the 
 much-litigated question.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 For W<FONT SIZE=-1>HAT</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LASS</FONT> of Christians was this Epistle principally
 designed--Jewish or Gentile? That a large number of Jews and Jewish
 proselytes resided at this time at Rome is known to all who are
 familiar with the classical and Jewish writers of that and the
 immediately subsequent periods; and that those of them who were at
 Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:10">Ac 2:10</A>),

 and formed probably part of the three thousand converts of that day,
 would on their return to Rome carry the glad tidings with them, there 
 can be no doubt. Nor are indications wanting that some of those 
 embraced in the salutations of this Epistle were Christians already of 
 long standing, if not among the earliest converts to the Christian 
 faith. Others of them who had made the apostle's acquaintance 
 elsewhere, and who, if not indebted to him for their first knowledge of 
 Christ, probably owed much to his ministrations, seemed to have charged 
 themselves with the duty of cherishing and consolidating the work of 
 the Lord in the capital. And thus it is not improbable that up to the 
 time of the apostle's arrival the Christian community at Rome had been 
 dependent upon subordinate agency for the increase of its numbers, 
 aided by occasional visits of stated preachers from the provinces; and 
 perhaps it may be gathered from the salutations of the last chapter 
 that it was up to that time in a less organized, though far from less 
 flourishing state, than some other churches to whom the apostle had 
 already addressed Epistles.  Certain it is, that the apostle writes to 
 them expressly as a Gentile Church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:13,15,15:15,16">Ro 1:13, 15; 15:15, 16</A>);

 and though it is plain that there were Jewish Christians among them,
 and the whole argument presupposes an intimate acquaintance on the part 
 of his readers with the leading principles of the Old Testament, this 
 will be sufficiently explained by supposing that the bulk of them, 
 having before they knew the Lord been Gentile proselytes to the Jewish 
 faith, had entered the pale of the Christian Church through the gate of 
 the ancient economy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It remains only to speak briefly of the
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>LAN</FONT> and
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HARACTER</FONT> Of this
 Epistle. Of all the undoubted Epistles of our apostle, this is the most
 elaborate, and at the same time the most glowing. It has just as much
 in common with a theological treatise as is consistent with the freedom
 and warmth of a real letter. Referring to the headings which we have
 prefixed to its successive sections, as best exhibiting the progress of
 the argument and the connection of its points, we here merely note that
 its first great topic is what may be termed
 <I>the legal relation of man to God</I> as a violator of His holy law, whether
 as merely written on the heart, as in the case of the heathen, or, as
 in the case of the Chosen People, as further known by external
 revelation; that it next treats of that legal relation as wholly
 <I>reversed</I> through believing connection with the Lord Jesus Christ; and
 that its third and last great topic is <I>the new life</I> which accompanies
 this change of relation, embracing at once a blessedness and a
 consecration to God which, rudimentally complete already, will open, in
 the future world, into the bliss of immediate and stainless fellowship
 with God. The bearing of these wonderful truths upon the condition and
 destiny of the Chosen People, to which the apostle next comes, though
 it seem but the practical application of them to his kinsmen according
 to the flesh, is in some respects the deepest and most difficult part
 of the whole Epistle, carrying us directly to the eternal springs of
 Grace to the guilty in the sovereign love and inscrutable purposes of
 God; after which, however, we are brought back to the historical
 platform of the visible Church, in the calling of the Gentiles, the
 preservation of a faithful Israelitish remnant amidst the general
 unbelief and fall of the nation, and the ultimate recovery of all
 Israel to constitute, with the Gentiles in the latter day, one catholic
 Church of God upon earth. The remainder of the Epistle is devoted to
 sundry practical topics, winding up with salutations and outpourings of
 heart delightfully suggestive.</P>

 "bond-servant," or one subject to the will and wholly at the disposal of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:21-23">1Co 7:21-23</A>),

 He was called at one and the same time to the faith and the apostleship

 yet as it consisted mostly of proselytes to the Jewish faith (see on

 <A HREF="JFB45.htm#Introduction"><I>Introduction</I></A>

 to this Epistle), they are here reminded that in embracing Christ they

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:5,Joh+1:14">Ro 9:5;
 Joh 1:14</A>); 

 implying, of course, that He had <I>another</I> nature, of which the
 apostle immediately proceeds to speak.</P>

 <A NAME="Ro1_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. And declared</B>--literally, "marked off," "defined," "determined,"
 that is, "shown," or "proved."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B><I>to be</I> the Son of God</B>--Observe how studiously the language 
 changes here. He "<I>was</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>MADE</FONT> [says the
 apostle] of the seed of David, according to the flesh"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:3">Ro 1:3</A>);

 but He was <I>not</I> made, He was only "<I>declared</I> [or proved]
 <I>to</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>BE</FONT> the Son of God." So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1,14">Joh 1:1, 14</A>,

 "In the beginning <FONT SIZE=-1>WAS</FONT> the Word .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6">Isa 9:6</A>,

 "Unto us <I>a Child</I> is <FONT SIZE=-1>BORN</FONT>, unto us <I>a Son
 is</I> <FONT SIZE=-1>GIVEN</FONT>." Thus the Sonship of Christ is in no 
 proper sense a <I>born</I> relationship to the Father, as some, 
 otherwise sound divines, conceive of it. By His birth in the flesh, 
 that Sonship, which was essential and uncreated, merely effloresced 
 into palpable manifestation.  (See on

 <A HREF="JFB44.htm#Ac13_32">Ac 13:32, 33</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>with power</B>--This may either be connected with "declared," and then the
 meaning will be "powerfully declared" [L<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHER</FONT>,
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>EZA</FONT>,
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>,
 F<FONT SIZE=-1>RITZSCHE</FONT>,
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, &c.]; or (as in our version, and as we think rightly) with "the
 Son of God," and then the sense is, "declared to be the Son of God" in
 possession of that "power" which belonged to Him as the only-begotten of
 the Father, no longer shrouded as in the days of His flesh, but "by His
 resurrection from the dead" gloriously displayed and henceforth to be
 for ever exerted in this nature of ours [<I>Vulgate,</I>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>,
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>,
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>HILIPPI</FONT>,
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>EHRING</FONT>, &c.].

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>according to the spirit of holiness</B>--If "according to the flesh" means
 here, "in His human nature," this uncommon expression must mean "in His
 <I>other</I> nature," which we have seen to be that "of the Son of God"--an
 eternal, uncreated nature. This is here styled the "<I>spirit,</I>" as an
 impalpable and immaterial nature 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:24">Joh 4:24</A>),

 and "the spirit of <I>holiness,</I>" probably in absolute contrast with 
 that "likeness, of sinful flesh" which He assumed. One is apt to wonder 
 that if this be the meaning, it was not expressed more simply. But if 
 the apostle had said "He was declared to be the Son of God according to 
 <I>the Holy Spirit,</I>" the reader would have thought he meant "<I>the 
 Holy Ghost</I>"; and it seems to have been just to avoid this 
 misapprehension that he used the rare expression, "the spirit of 
 holiness."</P>

 This language implies that it required some courage to bring to "the

 from the sense of such phrases elsewhere) take it to mean, "from one

 design, which has nothing to do with the progressive stages of faith,
 but solely with faith itself as the appointed way of receiving God's
 "righteousness." We prefer, therefore, to understand it thus: "The
 righteousness of God is in the gospel message, revealed (to be) from (or
 'by') faith to (or 'for') faith," that is, "in order to be by faith
 received." (So substantially, M<FONT SIZE=-1>ELVILLE</FONT>,

 so far from disturbing, only continued and developed the ancient

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 On the foregoing verses, <I>Note</I> (1) What manner of persons ought the
 ministers of Christ to be, according to the pattern here set up:
 absolutely subject and officially dedicated to the Lord Jesus; separated
 unto the gospel of God, which contemplates the subjugation of all
 nations to the faith of Christ: debtors to all classes, the refined and
 the rude, to bring the gospel to them all alike, all shame in the
 presence of the one, as well as pride before the other, sinking before
 the glory which they feel to be in their message; yearning over all
 faithful churches, not lording it over them, but rejoicing in their
 prosperity, and finding refreshment and strength in their fellowship!
 (2) The peculiar features of the gospel here brought prominently forward
 should be the devout study of all who preach it, and guide the views and
 the taste of all who are privileged statedly to hear it: that it is "the
 gospel of God," as a message from heaven, yet not absolutely new, but on
 the contrary, only the fulfilment of Old Testament promise, that not
 only is Christ the great theme of it, but Christ in the very nature of
 God as His own Son, and in the nature of men as partaker of their
 flesh--the Son of God now in resurrection--power and invested with
 authority to dispense all grace to men, and all gifts for the
 establishment and edification of the Church, Christ the righteousness
 provided of God for the justification of all that believe in His name;
 and that in this glorious Gospel, when preached as such, there resides
 the very power of God to save Jew and Gentile alike who embrace it. (3)
 While Christ is to be regarded as the ordained <I>Channel</I> of all grace
 from God to men 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:8">Ro 1:8</A>),

 let none imagine that His proper divinity is in any respect compromised 
 by this arrangement, since He is here expressly associated with "God 
 the Father," in prayer for "grace and peace" (including all spiritual 
 blessings) to rest upon this Church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:7">Ro 1:7</A>).

 (4) While this Epistle teaches, in conformity with the teaching of our 
 Lord Himself, that all salvation is suspended upon <I>faith,</I> this 
 is but half a truth, and will certainly minister to self-righteousness, 
 if dissociated from another feature of the same truth, here explicitly 
 taught, that this faith in <I>God's own gift</I>--for which accordingly 
 in the case of the Roman believers, he "thanks his God through Jesus 
 Christ"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:8">Ro 1:8</A>).

 (5) Christian fellowship, as indeed all real fellowship, is a mutual 
 benefit; and as it is not possible for the most eminent saints and 
 servants of Christ to impart any refreshment and profit to the meanest 
 of their brethren without experiencing a rich return into their bosoms, 
 so just in proportion to their humility and love will they feel their 
 need of it and rejoice in it.</P>

 with a comprehensive proposition regarding men in general, takes up in

 meant to apply it; thus gently sliding into his argument. But before
 enumerating their actual iniquities, he goes back to the origin of them
 all, their stifling the light which still remained to them. As darkness
 overspreads the mind, so impotence takes possession of the heart, when
 the "still small voice" of conscience is first disregarded, next
 thwarted, and then systematically deadened. Thus "the truth" which God
 left with and in men, instead of having free scope and developing
 itself, as it otherwise would, was obstructed (compare

 who, believing neither in any fall from primeval innocence, nor in the
 noble traces of that innocence which lingered even after the fall and
 were only by degrees obliterated by wilful violence to the dictates of

 trenching on things which "ought not to be named among us as become the
 saints." But observe how vice is here seen consuming and exhausting
 itself. When the passions, scourged by violent and continued indulgence
 in <I>natural</I> vices, became impotent to yield the craved enjoyment,
 resort was had to artificial stimulants by the practice of <I>unnatural</I> and
 monstrous vices. How early these were in full career, in the history
 of the world, the case of Sodom affectingly shows; and because of such
 abominations, centuries after that, the land of Canaan "spued out" its
 old inhabitants. Long before this chapter was penned, the Lesbians and
 others throughout refined Greece had been luxuriating in such
 debasements; and as for the Romans,
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>ACITUS</FONT>, speaking of the emperor
 Tiberius, tells us that new words had then to be coined to express the
 newly invented stimulants to jaded passion. No wonder that, thus sick
 and dying as was this poor humanity of ours under the highest earthly
 culture, its many-voiced cry for the balm in Gilead, and the Physician

 <B>the judgment of God</B>--the stern law of divine procedure.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that they which commit such things are worthy of death</B>--here used in

 sin: see

 temptation and in the heat of passion.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but have pleasure in them that do them</B>--deliberately set their seal
 to such actions by encouraging and applauding the doing of them in
 others. This is the climax of our apostle's charges against the
 heathen; and certainly, if the things are in themselves as black as
 possible, this settled and unblushing satisfaction at the practice of
 them, apart from all the blinding effects of present passion, must be
 regarded as the darkest feature of human depravity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 On this section, <I>Note</I> (1) "The wrath of God" against sin has all
 the dread reality of a "revelation from heaven" sounding in the
 consciences of men, in the self-inflicted miseries of the wicked, and in
 the vengeance which God's moral government, sooner or later, takes upon
 all who outrage it; so this "wrath of God" is not confined to
 high-handed crimes, or the grosser manifestations of human depravity,
 but is "revealed" against all violations of divine law of whatever
 nature--"against all ungodliness" as well as "unrighteousness of men,"
 against all disregard of God in the conduct of life as well as against
 all deviations from moral rectitude; and therefore, since no child of
 Adam can plead guiltless either of "ungodliness" or of
 "unrighteousness," to a greater or less extent, it follows that every
 human being is involved in the awful sweep of "the wrath of God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:18">Ro 1:18</A>).

 The apostle places this terrible truth in the forefront of his argument 
 on justification by faith, that upon the basis of <I>universal 
 condemnation</I> he might rear the edifice of a free, world-wide 
 salvation; nor can the Gospel be scripturally preached or embraced, 
 save as the good news of salvation to those that are all equally 
 "lost." (2) We must not magnify the supernatural revelation which God 
 has been pleased to make of Himself, through Abraham's family to the 
 human race, at the expense of that older, and, in itself, lustrous 
 revelation which He has made to the whole family of man through the 
 medium of their own nature and the creation around them. Without the 
 latter, the former would have been impossible, and those who have not 
 been favored with the former will be without excuse, if they are deaf 
 to the voice and blind to the glory of the latter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:19,20">Ro 1:19, 20</A>).

 (3) Wilful resistance of light has a retributive tendency to blunt the 
 moral perceptions and weaken the capacity to apprehend and approve of 
 truth and goodness; and thus is the soul prepared to surrender itself, 
 to an indefinite extent, to error and sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:21">Ro 1:21</A>,

 &c.). (4) Pride of wisdom, as it is a convincing evidence of the want 
 of it, so it makes the attainment of it impossible

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:22">Ro 1:22</A>;
 
 and compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:25,1Co+3:18-20">Mt 11:25;
 1Co 3:18-20</A>).

 (5) As idolatry, even in its most plausible forms, is the fruit of
 unworthy views of the Godhead, so its natural effect is to vitiate and 
 debase still further the religious conceptions; nor is there any depth 
 of degradation too low and too revolting for men's ideas of the Godhead 
 to sink to, if only their natural temperament and the circumstances 
 they are placed in be favorable to their unrestrained development

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:23,25">Ro 1:23, 25</A>).

 The apostle had Greece and Egypt in his eye when he penned this 
 description. But all the paganisms of the East at this day attest its 
 accuracy, from the more elaborate idolatry of India and the simpler and 
 more stupid idolatry of China down to the childish rudiments of nature 
 worship prevalent among the savage tribes. Alas! Christendom itself 
 furnishes a melancholy illustration of this truth; the constant use of 
 material images in the Church of Rome and the materialistic and 
 sensuous character of its entire service (to say nothing of the less 
 offensive but more stupid service of the Greek Church,) debasing the 
 religious ideas of millions of nominal Christians, and lowering the 
 whole character and tone of Christianity as represented within their 
 immense pale. (6) Moral corruption invariably follows religious 
 debasement. The grossness of pagan idolatry is only equalled by the 
 revolting character and frightful extent of the immoralities which it 
 fostered and consecrated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:24,26,27">Ro 1:24, 26, 27</A>).

 And so strikingly is this to be seen in all its essential features in 
 the East at this day, that (as H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT> says) the 
 missionaries have frequently been accused by the natives of having 
 forged the whole of the latter part of this chapter, as they could not 
 believe that so accurate a description of themselves could have been 
 written eighteen centuries ago. The kingdoms of Israel and Judah 
 furnish a striking illustration of the inseparable connection between 
 religion and morals. Israel corrupted and debased the worship of 
 Jehovah, and the sins with which they were charged were mostly of the 
 grosser kind--intemperance and sensuality: the people of Judah, 
 remaining faithful to the pure worship, were for a long time charged 
 mostly with formality and hypocrisy; and only as they fell into the 
 idolatries of the heathen around them, did they sink into their vices. 
 And may not a like distinction be observed between the two great 
 divisions of Christendom, the Popish and the Protestant? To test this, 
 we must not look to Popery, surrounded with, and more or less 
 influenced by, the presence and power of Protestantism; nor to 
 Protestantism under every sort of disadvantage, internal and external. 
 But look at Romanism where it has unrestrained liberty to develop its 
 true character, and see whether impurity does not there taint society 
 to its core, pervading alike the highest and the lowest classes; and 
 then look at Protestantism where it enjoys the same advantages, and see 
 whether it be not marked by a comparatively high standard of social 
 virtue. (7) To take pleasure in what is sinful and vicious for its own 
 sake, and knowing it to be such, is the last and lowest stage of human 
 recklessness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:32">Ro 1:32</A>).

 But (8) this knowledge can never be wholly extinguished in the breast 
 of men. So long as reason remains to them, there is still a small voice 
 in the worst of men, protesting, in the name of the Power that 
 implanted it, "that they which do such things are worthy of death"

 that the case here supposed is an impossible one, and put merely for

 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HALMERS</FONT>,
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>]; <I>second</I> that it is the case
 of the heathen who may and do please God when they act, as has been and
 is done, up to the light of nature
 [G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>,
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>, &c.]. The
 first interpretation is, in our judgment, unnatural; the second, opposed
 to the apostle's own teaching. But the case here put is, we think, such
 as that of Cornelius 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:1-48">Ac 10:1-48</A>),

 who, though outside the <I>external</I> pale of God's covenant, yet
 having come to the knowledge of the truths contained in it, do manifest 
 the grace of the covenant without the seal of it, and exemplify the 
 character and walk of Abraham's children, though not called by the name 
 of Abraham. Thus, this is but another way of announcing that God was 
 about to show the insufficiency of the mere badge of the Abrahamic 
 covenant, by calling from among the Gentiles a seed of Abraham that had 
 never received the seal of circumcision (see on

 <A HREF="JFB48.htm#Ga5_6">Ga 5:6</A>);

 <B>28. he is not a Jew which is one outwardly,</B> &c.--In other words, the
 name of "Jew" and the rite of "circumcision" were designed but as
 outward symbols of a separation from the irreligious and ungodly world
 unto holy devotedness in heart and life to the God of salvation. Where
 this is realized, the signs are full of significance; but where it is
 not, they are worse than useless.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Note,</I> (1) It is a sad mark of depravity when all that is designed
 and fitted to melt only hardens the heart

 to men, and the mysterious bearing of this upon their character and 
 destiny for eternity, the same great principles of judgment, in a form 
 suited to their respective discipline, will be applied to all, and 
 perfect equity will be seen to reign throughout every stage of the 
 divine administration

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:11-16">Ro 2:11-16</A>).

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:14,15">Ro 2:14, 15</A>)

 --or the Ethics of Natural Theology--may be said to be the one deep
 foundation on which all revealed religion reposes; and see on

 <A HREF="JFB45.htm#Ro1_19">Ro 1:19, 20</A>,

 where we have what we may call its other foundation--the Physics and 
 Metaphysics of Natural Theology. The testimony of these two passages is 
 to the theologian invaluable, while in the breast of every teachable 
 Christian it wakens such deep echoes as are inexpressibly solemn and 
 precious. (4) High religious professions are a fearful aggravation of 
 the inconsistencies of such as make them

 (5) As no external privileges, or badge of discipleship, will shield 
 the unholy from the wrath of God, so neither will the want of them shut 
 out from the kingdom of heaven such as have experienced without them 
 that change of heart which the seals of God's covenant were designed to 
 mark. In the sight of the great Searcher of hearts, the Judge of quick 
 and dead, the renovation of the character in heart and life is all in 
 all. In view of this, have not all baptized, sacramented disciples of 
 the Lord Jesus, who "profess that they know God, but in works deny 
 Him," need to tremble--who, under the guise of friends, are "the 
 enemies of the cross of Christ?"</P>

 <B>7, 8. For if the truth of God,</B> &c.--A further illustration of the
 same sentiment: that is, "Such reasoning amounts to this--which indeed
 we who preach salvation by free grace are slanderously accused of
 teaching--that the more evil we do, the more glory will redound to God;
 a damnable principle." (Thus the apostle, instead of refuting this
 principle, thinks it enough to hold it up to execration, as one that
 shocks the moral sense).</P>

 On this brief section, <I>Note</I> (1) Mark the place here assigned to
 the Scriptures. In answer to the question, "What advantage hath the
 Jew?" or, "What profit is there of circumcision?" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:1">Ro 3:1</A>)

 those holding Romish views would undoubtedly have laid the stress upon 
 the <I>priesthood,</I> as the glory of the Jewish economy. But in the 
 apostle's esteem, "the oracles of God" were the jewel of the ancient 
 Church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:1,2">Ro 3:1, 2</A>).

 (2) God's eternal purposes and man's free agency, as also the doctrine 
 of salvation by grace and the unchanging obligations of God's law, have 
 ever been subjected to the charge of inconsistency by those who will 
 bow to no truth which their own reason cannot fathom. But amidst all 
 the clouds and darkness which in this present state envelop the divine 
 administration and many of the truths of the Bible, such broad and deep 
 principles as are here laid down, and which shine in their own luster, 
 will be found the sheet-anchor of our faith. "Let God be true, and 
 every man a liar"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:4">Ro 3:4</A>);

 and as many advocates of salvation by grace as say, "Let us do evil 
 that good may come," "their damnation is just"

 guilt, the condemnation, by reason of the breach of divine law, of the
 whole world, and the impossibility of justification before God by
 obedience to that violated law! Only when these humiliating conclusions

 clause; teaching us that though justification is quite gratuitous, it is
 not a mere <I>fiat</I> of the divine will, but based on a "Redemption,"
 that is, "the payment of a Ransom," in Christ's death. That this is the
 sense of the word "redemption," when applied to Christ's death, will

 that "faith <I>upon</I>" is the usual phrase in <I>Greek,</I> not "faith
 <I>in</I>" Christ, would place a "comma" after "faith," and understand the
 words as if written thus: "to be a propitiation, in His blood, through
 faith." But "faith <I>in</I> Christ" is used in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:26">Ga 3:26</A>
 
 and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:15">Eph 1:15</A>;

 and "faith in His blood" is the natural and appropriate meaning here.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to declare his righteousness for the remission</B>--rather, "pretermission"
 or "passing by."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of sins</B>--"the sins."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that are past</B>--not the sins committed by the believer before he
 embraces Christ, but the sins committed under the old economy, before
 Christ came to "put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>through the forbearance of God</B>--God not <I>remitting</I> but only
 <I>forbearing</I> to punish them, or passing them by, until an adequate
 atonement for them should be made. In thus not imputing them, God
 <I>was</I> righteous, but He was not <I>seen</I> to be so; there was no
 "manifestation of His righteousness" in doing so under the ancient
 economy. But now that God can "set forth" Christ as a "propitiation for
 sin through faith in His blood," the righteousness of His procedure in
 passing by the sins of believers before, and in now remitting them, is
 "manifested," declared, brought fully out to the view of the whole
 world. (Our translators have unfortunately missed this glorious truth,
 taking "the sins that are past" to mean the past sins of
 believers--committed before faith--and rendering, by the word
 "remission," what means only a "passing by"; thus making it appear that
 "remission of sins" is "through the forbearance of God," which it
 certainly is not).</P>

 Gospel.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him that
 believeth in Jesus</B>--Glorious paradox! "Just in punishing," and
 "merciful in pardoning," men can understand; but "just in justifying the
 guilty," startles them. But the propitiation through faith in Christ's
 blood resolves the paradox and harmonizes the discordant elements. For
 in that "God hath made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin,"
 <I>justice</I> has full satisfaction; and in that "we are made the
 righteousness of God in Him," <I>mercy</I> has her heart's delight!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Note,</I> (1) One way of a sinner's justification is taught in the
 Old Testament and in the New alike: only more dimly during the twilight
 of Revelation; in unclouded light under "its perfect day" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:21">Ro 3:21</A>).

 (2) As there is no difference in the <I>need,</I> so is there none in 
 the <I>liberty to appropriate</I> the provided salvation. The best need 
 to be saved by faith in Jesus Christ; and the worst only need that. On 
 this common ground all saved sinners meet here, and will stand for ever

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:22-24">Ro 3:22-24</A>).

 (3) It is on the atoning blood of Christ, as the one propitiatory 
 sacrifice which God hath set forth to the eye of the guilty, that the 
 faith of the convinced and trembling sinner fastens for deliverance 
 from wrath. Though he knows that he is "justified freely, by God's 
 grace," it is only because it is "through the <I>redemption</I> that is 
 in Christ Jesus" that he is able to find peace and rest even in this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:25">Ro 3:25</A>).

 (4) The strictly accurate view of believers under the Old Testament is 
 not that of a company of <I>pardoned</I> men, but of men whose sins, 
 put up with and passed by in the meantime, awaited a <I>future 
 expiation</I> in the fulness of time

 that, important as was this objection, and opening up as it did so noble
 a field for the illustration of the peculiar glory of the Gospel, the
 apostle does no more here than indignantly repel it, intending at a
 subsequent stage of his argument

 (2) The fitness of the Gospel to be a universal religion, beneath which 
 the guilty of every name and degree are invited and warranted to take 
 shelter and repose, is a glorious evidence of its truth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:29,30">Ro 3:29, 30</A>).

 (3) The glory of God's law, in its eternal and immutable obligations, 
 is then only fully apprehended by the sinner, and then only is it 
 enthroned in the depths of his soul, when, believing that "He was made 
 sin for him who knew no sin," he sees himself "made the righteousness 
 of God in Him"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:21">2Co 5:21</A>).

 Thus do we not make void the law through faith: yea, we establish the 
 law. (4) This chapter, and particularly the latter part of it, "is the 
 proper seat of the Pauline doctrine of Justification, and the grand 
 proof-passage of the Protestant doctrine of the Imputation of Christ's 
 righteousness and of Justification not on account of, but through faith 
 alone" [P<FONT SIZE=-1>HILIPPI</FONT>].  To make good this doctrine, 
 and reseat it in the faith and affection of the Church, was worth all 
 the bloody struggles that it cost our fathers, and it will be the 
 wisdom and safety, the life and vigor of the churches, to "stand fast 
 in this liberty wherewith Christ hath made them free, and not be again 
 entangled"--in the very least degree--"with the yoke of bondage"

 First: <I>Abraham was justified by faith.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1-3. What shall we say then that Abraham, our father as pertaining to
 the flesh, hath found?</B>--that is, (as the order in the original shows),
 "hath found, as pertaining to ('according to,' or 'through') the flesh";
 meaning, "by all his natural efforts or legal obedience."</P>

 <A NAME="Ro4_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory;
 but not before God</B>--"If works were the ground of Abraham's
 justification, he would have matter for boasting; but as it is perfectly
 certain that he hath none in the sight of God, it follows that Abraham
 could not have been justified by works." And to this agree the words of
 Scripture.</P>

 <A NAME="Ro4_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3. For what saith the, Scripture? Abraham believed God, and
 it</B>--his faith.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>was counted to him for righteousness</B>--

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:6">Ge 15:6</A>).

 Romish expositors and Arminian Protestants make this to mean that God
 accepted Abraham's act of believing as a substitute for complete 
 obedience. But this is at variance with the whole spirit and letter of 
 the apostle's teaching.  Throughout this whole argument, <I>faith</I> 
 is set in direct opposition to <I>works,</I> in the matter of 
 justification--and even in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:4,5">Ro 4:4, 5</A>.

 The meaning, therefore, cannot possibly be that the mere act of 
 believing--which is as much a work as any other piece of commanded duty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:29,1Jo+3:23">Joh 6:29;
 1Jo 3:23</A>)

 --was counted to Abraham for all obedience. The meaning plainly is that
 Abraham believed in the promises which embraced Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:3,15:5">Ge 12:3; 15:5</A>,

 &c.), as we believe in Christ Himself; and in both cases, faith is
 merely the instrument that puts us in possession of the blessing 
 gratuitously bestowed.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here sings in express terms only of "transgression forgiven, sin

 point.</P>

 God's <I>general</I> way of justifying men; for Abraham's justification
 took place long before he was circumcised, and so could have no
 dependence upon that rite: nay, 'the sign of circumcision' was given to
 Abraham as 'a seal' (or token) of the (justifying) righteousness which
 he had <I>before</I> he was circumcised; in order that he might stand forth
 to every age as <I>the parent believer</I>--the model man of justification
 by faith--after whose type, as the first public example of it, all were

 <I>circumcision.</I>

 natural seed or no--may be assured of the like justification with the

 This is quoted to justify his calling Abraham the "father of us all," 
 and is to be viewed as a parenthesis.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>before</B>--that is, "in the reckoning of."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>him whom he believed</B>--that is, "Thus Abraham, in the reckoning of Him
 whom he believed, is the father of us all, in order that all may be
 assured, that doing as he did, they shall be treated as he was."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>even God, quickeneth the dead</B>--The nature and greatness of that faith
 of Abraham which we are to copy is here strikingly described. What he
 was required to believe being above nature, his faith had to fasten upon
 God's power to surmount physical incapacity, and call into being what
 did not then exist. But God having made the promise, Abraham believed
 Him in spite of those obstacles. This is still further illustrated in
 what follows.</P>

 <B>our justification</B>--As His resurrection was the divine assurance that
 He had "put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself," and the crowning of
 His whole work, our justification is fitly connected with that glorious
 act.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Note,</I> (1) The doctrine of justification by works, as it generates
 self-exaltation, is contrary to the first principles of all true
 religion 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:2">Ro 4:2</A>;

 and see on

 <A HREF="JFB45.htm#Ro3_21">Ro 3:21-26</A>, 

 <I>Note</I> 1).  (2) The way of a sinner's justification has been the 
 same in all time, and the testimony of the Old Testament on this 
 subject is one with that of the New

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:3">Ro 4:3</A>,

 &c., and see on

 <A HREF="JFB45.htm#Ro3_27">Ro 3:27-31</A>, 

 <I>Note</I> 1).  (3) Faith and works, in the matter of justification, 
 are opposite and irreconcilable, even as grace and debt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:4,5">Ro 4:4, 5</A>;

 and see on

 <A HREF="JFB45.htm#Ro11_6">Ro 11:6</A>). 

 If God "justifies the ungodly," works cannot be, in any sense or to any 
 degree, the ground of justification. For the same reason, the first 
 requisite, in order to justification, must be (under the conviction 
 that we are "ungodly") to despair of it by works; and the next, to 
 "believe in Him that justifieth the ungodly"--that hath a justifying 
 righteousness to bestow, and is ready to bestow it upon those who 
 deserve none, and to embrace it accordingly. (4) The sacraments of the 
 Church were never intended, and are not adapted, to <I>confer</I> 
 grace, or the blessings of salvation, upon men. Their proper use is to 
 set a divine <I>seal</I> upon <I>a state already existing,</I> and so, 
 they <I>presuppose,</I> and do not <I>create</I> it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:8-12">Ro 4:8-12</A>).

 As circumcision merely "sealed" Abraham's already existing acceptance 
 with God, so with the sacraments of the New Testament. (5) As Abraham 
 is "the heir of the world," all nations being blessed in him, through 
 his Seed Christ Jesus, and justified solely according to the pattern of 
 his faith, so the transmission of the true religion and all the 
 salvation which the world will ever experience shall yet be traced back 
 with wonder, gratitude, and joy, to that morning dawn when "the God of 
 glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, 
 before he dwelt in Charran," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:2">Ac 7:2</A>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:13">Ro 4:13</A>).

 (6) Nothing gives more glory to God than simple faith in His word, 
 especially when all things seem to render the fulfilment of it hopeless

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:18-21">Ro 4:18-21</A>).

 (7) All the Scripture examples of faith were recorded on purpose to 
 beget and encourage the like faith in every succeeding age

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:23,24">Ro 4:23, 24</A>;
 
 and compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:4">Ro 15:4</A>).

 (8) <I>Justification,</I> in this argument, cannot be taken--as 
 Romanists and other errorists insist--to mean a change upon men's 
 <I>character;</I> for besides that this is to confound it with 
 <I>Sanctification,</I> which has its appropriate place in this Epistle, 
 the whole argument of the present chapter--and nearly all its more 
 important clauses, expressions, and words--would in that case be 
 unsuitable, and fitted only to mislead. Beyond all doubt it means 
 exclusively a change upon men's <I>state</I> or <I>relation to God;</I> 
 or, in scientific language, it is an <I>objective,</I> not a 
 <I>subjective</I> change--a change from guilt and condemnation to 
 acquittal and acceptance. And the best evidence that this is the key to 
 the whole argument is, that it opens all the wards of the 
 many-chambered lock with which the apostle has enriched us in this 
 Epistle.</P>

 The <I>proof</I> of this doctrine being now concluded, the apostle comes

 <B>1. Therefore being</B>--"having been."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>justified by faith, we have peace with God,</B> &c.--If we are to be
 guided by manuscript authority, the true reading here, beyond doubt, is,
 "Let us have peace"; a reading, however, which most reject, because they
 think it unnatural to exhort men to <I>have</I> what it belongs to God to
 <I>give,</I> because the apostle is not here giving exhortations, but
 stating matters of fact. But as it seems hazardous to set aside the
 decisive testimony of manuscripts, as to what the apostle <I>did</I> write,
 in favor of what we merely think he <I>ought</I> to have written, let us
 pause and ask--If it be the privilege of the justified to "<I>have</I> peace
 with God," why might not the apostle begin his enumeration of the
 fruits of justification by calling on believers to "realize" this peace
 as belonged to them, or cherish the joyful consciousness of it as their
 own? And if this is what he has done, it would not be necessary to
 continue in the same style, and the other fruits of justification might
 be set down, simply as matters of fact. This "peace" is first a change
 in God's relation to us; and next, as the consequence of this, a change
 on our part towards Him. God, on the one hand, has "reconciled us to
 Himself by Jesus Christ" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:18">2Co 5:18</A>);

 and we, on the other hand, setting our seal to this, "are reconciled to 
 God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:20">2Co 5:20</A>).

 The "propitiation" is the meeting-place; there the controversy on both

 us 'peace with God' we owe our introduction into that
 <I>permanent standing</I> in the favor of God which the justified enjoy."

 removed, whether it be the withholding of promised good 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:25">Ro 8:25</A>),
 
 or the continued experience of positive ill (as here). There is indeed
 a patience of unrenewed nature, which has something noble in it, though
 in many cases the offspring of pride, if not of something lower. Men
 have been known to endure every form of privation, torture, and death,
 without a murmur and without even visible emotion, merely because they
 deemed it unworthy of them to sink under unavoidable ill. But this
 proud, stoical hardihood has nothing in common with the <I>grace</I> of
 patience--which is either the meek endurance of ill because it is of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:21,22,2:10">Job 1:21, 22; 2:10</A>),

 in the full persuasion that such trials are divinely appointed, are the
 needed discipline of God's children, are but for a definite period, and 
 are not sent without abundant promises of "songs in the night." If such 
 be the "patience" which "tribulation worketh," no wonder that</P>

 abiding access to God 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:1">Ro 5:1</A>);

 all time and for each believer.
 (<I>The Holy Ghost is here first introduced in this Epistle.</I>) It is as
 if the apostle had said, "And how can this hope of glory, which as
 believers we cherish, put us to shame, when we feel God Himself, by His
 Spirit given to us, drenching our hearts in sweet, all-subduing
 sensations of His wondrous love to us in Christ Jesus?" This leads the

 are here given: First, "Christ died <I>for the ungodly,</I>" whose character,
 so far from meriting any interposition in their behalf, was altogether
 repulsive to the eye of God; second, He did this "when they were
 <I>without strength</I>"--with nothing between them and perdition but that
 self-originating divine compassion; third, He did this
 "<I>at the due time,</I>" when it was most fitting that it should take place
 (compare

 the moment of justification, when the wrath of God is turned away from
 them, till the Judge on the great white throne shall discharge that
 wrath upon them that "obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ"; and
 that work may all be summed up in "keeping them from falling, and
 presenting them faultless before the presence of His glory with

 (In fact, the earlier meaning of the English word "atonement" was "the 
 <I>reconciliation</I> of two estranged parties") [T<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>RENCH</FONT>]. The foregoing effects of justification were all 
 benefits to ourselves, calling for gratitude; this last may be termed a 
 purely disinterested one. Our first feeling towards God, after we have 
 found peace with Him, is that of clinging gratitude for so costly a
 salvation; but no sooner have we learned to cry, Abba, Father, under 
 the sweet sense of reconciliation, than "gloriation" in Him takes the 
 place of dread of Him, and now He appears to us "altogether 
 lovely!"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 On this section, <I>Note,</I> (1) How gloriously does the Gospel evince its
 divine origin by basing all acceptable obedience on "peace with God,"
 laying the foundations of this peace in a righteous "justification" of
 the sinner "through our Lord Jesus Christ," and making this the entrance
 to a permanent standing in the divine favor, and a triumphant
 expectation of future glory! 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:1,2">Ro 5:1, 2</A>).

 Other peace, worthy of the name, there is none; and as those who are 
 strangers to it rise not to the enjoyment of such high fellowship with 
 God, so they have neither any taste for it nor desire after it. (2) As 
 only believers possess the true secret of patience under trials, so, 
 although "not joyous but grievous" in themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:17">Heb 12:17</A>),

 when trials divinely sent afford them the opportunity of evidencing 
 their faith by the grace of patience under them, they should "count it 
 all joy"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:3,4">Ro 5:3, 4</A>;
 
 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:2,3">Jas 1:2, 3</A>).

 (3) "Hope," in the New Testament sense of the term,
 is not a lower degree of faith or assurance (as many now say, I <I>hope</I>
 for heaven, but am not <I>sure</I> of it); but invariably means "the
 confident expectation of future good." It presupposes faith; and what
 faith <I>assures</I> us will be ours, hope accordingly <I>expects.</I> In the
 nourishment of this hope, the soul's look <I>outward</I> to Christ for the
 ground of it, and <I>inward</I> upon ourselves for evidence of its reality,
 must act and react upon each other 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:2">Ro 5:2</A>
 
 and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:4">Ro 5:4</A>

 compared).  (4) It is the proper office of the Holy Ghost to beget in 
 the soul the full conviction and joyful consciousness of the love of 
 God in Christ Jesus to sinners of mankind, and to ourselves in 
 particular; and where this exists, it carries with it such an assurance 
 of final salvation as cannot deceive

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:5">Ro 5:5</A>).

 (5) The <I>justification</I> of sinful men is not in virtue of their 
 amendment, but of "the <I>blood</I> of God's Son"; and while this is 
 expressly affirmed in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:9">Ro 5:9</A>,

 our <I>reconciliation</I> to God by the "<I>death</I> of His Son," 
 affirmed in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:10">Ro 5:10</A>,

 is but a variety of the same statement. In both, the blessing meant is 
 the <I>restoration of the sinner to a righteous standing</I> in the 
 sight of God; and in both, the meritorious ground of this, which is 
 intended to be conveyed, is the <I>expiatory sacrifice</I> of God's 
 Son. (6) Gratitude to God for redeeming love, if it could exist without 
 delight in God Himself, would be a selfish and worthless feeling; but 
 when the one rises into the other--the transporting sense of eternal 
 "reconciliation" passing into "gloriation in God" Himself--then the 
 lower is sanctified and sustained by the higher, and each feeling is 
 perfective of the other

 (This profound and most weighty section has occasioned an immense deal
 of critical and theological discussion, in which every point, and almost
 every clause, has been contested. We can here but set down what appears
 to us to be the only tenable view of it as a whole and of its successive
 clauses, with some slight indication of the grounds of our judgment).</P>

 preceding argument.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>sin</B>--considered here in its guilt, criminality, penal desert.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>entered into the world, and death by sin</B>--as the penalty of sin.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned</B>--rather,
 "all sinned," that is, in that one man's first sin. Thus death reaches
 every individual of the human family, as the penalty due to <I>himself.</I>
 (So, in substance, B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>,
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>,
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>HILIPPI</FONT>). Here we should have
 expected the apostle to finish his sentence, in some such way as this:
 "Even so, by one man righteousness has entered into the world, and life
 by righteousness." But, instead of this, we have a digression, extending
 to five verses, to illustrate the important statement of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:12">Ro 5:12</A>;
 
 and it is only at

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:18">Ro 5:18</A>

 that the comparison is resumed and finished.</P>

 <A NAME="Ro5_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13, 14. For until the law sin was in the world</B>--that is during all the
 period from Adam "until the law" of Moses was given, God continued to
 treat men as sinners.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but sin is not imputed where there is no law</B>--"There must therefore
 have been a law during that period, because sin <I>was</I> then imputed";
 as is now to be shown.</P>

 <A NAME="Ro5_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that
 had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression</B>--But who
 are they?--a much contested question. <I>Infants</I> (say some), who being
 guiltless of <I>actual sin,</I> may be said not to have sinned in the way
 that Adam did [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT>,
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>EZA</FONT>,
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>]. But why should infants be
 specially connected with the period "from Adam to Moses," since they die
 alike in every period? And if the apostle meant to express here the
 death of infants, why has he done it so enigmatically? Besides, the
 death of infants is comprehended in the universal mortality on account
 of the first sin, so emphatically expressed in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:12">Ro 5:12</A>;

 what need then to specify it here? and why, if not necessary, should we 
 presume it to be meant here, unless the language unmistakably point to 
 it--which it certainly does not? The meaning then must be, that "death 
 reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those that had not, like Adam, 
 transgressed against a positive commandment, threatening death to the 
 disobedient." (So most interpreters). In this case, the particle 
 "even," instead of specifying one particular class of those who lived 
 "from Adam to Moses" (as the other interpretation supposes), merely 
 explains what it was that made the case of those who died from Adam to 
 Moses worthy of special notice--namely, that "though unlike Adam and 
 all since Moses, those who lived between the two had no positive 
 threatening of death for transgression, nevertheless, death reigned 
 <I>even over them.</I>"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>who is the figure</B>--or, "a type."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of him that was to come</B>--Christ. "This clause is inserted on the first
 mention of the name "Adam," the <I>one man</I> of whom he is speaking, to
 recall the purpose for which he is treating of him, as
 <I>the figure of Christ</I>"
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. The point of analogy intended here
 is plainly the <I>public character</I> which both sustained, neither of
 the two being regarded in the divine procedure towards men as mere
 <I>individual</I> men, but both alike as <I>representative</I> men. (Some
 take the proper supplement here to be "Him [that is] to come";
 understanding the apostle to speak from his own time, and to refer to
 Christ's second coming [F<FONT SIZE=-1>RITZSCHE</FONT>,
 D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ETTE</FONT>,
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. But this is
 unnatural, since the analogy of the second Adam to the first has been
 in full development ever since "God exalted Him to be a Prince and a
 Saviour," and it will only remain to be consummated at His second
 coming. The simple meaning is, as nearly all interpreters agree, that
 Adam is a type of Him who was to come after him in the same public
 character, and so to be "the second Adam").</P>

 <A NAME="Ro5_15"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>15. But</B>--"Yet," "Howbeit."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>not as the offence</B>--"trespass."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>so also is the free gift</B>--or "the gracious gift," "the gift of grace."
 The two cases present points of contrast as well as resemblance.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>For if,</B> &c.--rather, "For if through the offense of the one the 
 many died (that is, in that one man's first sin), much more did the 
 grace of God, and the free gift by grace, even that of the one man, 
 Jesus Christ, abound unto the many." By "the many" is meant the
 <I>mass</I> of mankind represented respectively by Adam and Christ, as 
 opposed, not to <I>few,</I> but to "the one" who represented them. By 
 "the free gift" is meant (as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:17">Ro 5:17</A>)

 the glorious gift of <I>justifying righteousness;</I> this is expressly
 distinguished from "the grace of God," as the <I>effect</I> from the 
 <I>cause;</I> and both are said to "abound" towards us in Christ--in 
 what sense will appear in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:16,17">Ro 5:16, 17</A>.

 And the "much more," of the one case than the other, does not mean that 
 we get much more of good by Christ than of evil by Adam (for it is not 
 a case of quantity at all); but that we have much more reason to 
 expect, or it is much more agreeable to our ideas of God, that the many 
 should be benefited by the merit of one, than that they should suffer 
 for the sin of one; and if the latter has happened, <I>much more</I> 
 may we assure ourselves of the former [P<FONT SIZE=-1>HILIPPI</FONT>, 
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>].</P>

 <A NAME="Ro5_16"> </A>

 <B>16. And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift</B>--"Another
 point of contrast may be mentioned."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for the judgment</B>--"sentence."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>was by one</B>--rather, "was of one," meaning not "one man," but, as
 appears from the next clause, "one offense."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to condemnation, but the free gift</B>--"gift of grace."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>is of many offences unto justification</B>--a glorious point of contrast.
 "The condemnation by Adam was for <I>one sin;</I> but the justification by
 Christ is an absolution not only from the guilt of that first offense,
 mysteriously attaching to every individual of the race, but from the
 <I>countless offenses</I> it, to which, as a germ lodged in the bosom of
 every child of Adam, it unfolds itself in his life." This is the meaning
 of "grace <I>abounding</I> towards us in the <I>abundance of the gift</I> of
 righteousness." It is a grace not only rich in its <I>character,</I> but
 rich in <I>detail;</I> it is a "righteousness" not only rich in a
 <I>complete justification</I> of the guilty, condemned sinner; but rich in
 the <I>amplitude of the ground</I> which it covers, leaving no one sin of
 any of the justified uncancelled, but making him, though loaded with the
 guilt of myriads of offenses, "the righteousness of God in Christ."</P>

 <A NAME="Ro5_17"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>17. For if by</B>--"the"

 <B>abundance of grace and of the gift of</B>--justifying

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>righteousness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. reign in life by one Jesus 
 Christ</B>--"through the one." We have here the two ideas of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:15,16">Ro 5:15
 and Ro 5:16</A>

 sublimely combined into one, as if the subject had grown upon the 
 apostle as he advanced in his comparison of the two cases. Here, for 
 the first time in this section, he speaks of that <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LIFE</FONT> which springs out of justification, in contrast 
 with the death which springs from sin and follows condemnation. The 
 proper idea of it therefore is, "Right to live"--"Righteous life"--life 
 possessed and enjoyed with the good will, and in conformity with the 
 eternal law, of "Him that sitteth on the Throne"; life therefore in its 
 widest sense--life in the whole man and throughout the whole duration 
 of human existence, the life of blissful and loving relationship to God 
 in soul and body, for ever and ever. It is worthy of note, too, that 
 while he says death "reigned over" us through Adam, he does not say 
 Life "reigns over us" through Christ; lest he should seem to invest 
 this new life with the very attribute of death--that of fell and 
 malignant tyranny, of which we were the hapless victims. Nor does he 
 say Life reigns <I>in</I> us, which would have been a scriptural enough 
 idea; but, which is much more pregnant, "<I>We</I> shall reign in 
 life." While <I>freedom</I> and <I>might</I> are implied in the figure 
 of "reigning," "life" is represented as the glorious territory or 
 atmosphere of that reign. And by recurring to the idea of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:16">Ro 5:16</A>,

 as to the "many offenses" whose complete pardon shows "the abundance of
 grace and of the gift of righteousness," the whole statement is to this 
 effect: "If one man's one offense let loose against us the tyrant power 
 of Death, to hold us as its victims in helpless bondage, 'much more,' 
 when we stand forth enriched with God's 'abounding grace' and in the 
 beauty of a complete absolution from countless offenses, shall we 
 expatiate in a life divinely owned and legally secured, 'reigning' in 
 exultant freedom and unchallenged might, through that other matchless 
 'One,' Jesus Christ!" (On the import of the <I>future</I> tense in this

 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ETTE</FONT>,
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, <I>Revised Version</I>). In
 this case, the apostle, resuming the statement of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:12">Ro 5:12</A>,

 expresses it in a more concentrated and vivid form--suggested no doubt 
 by the expression in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:16">Ro 5:16</A>,

 "through one offense," representing Christ's whole work, considered as 
 the ground of our justification, as "<FONT SIZE=-1>ONE 
 RIGHTEOUSNESS</FONT>." (Some would render the peculiar word here 
 employed, "one righteous act" [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, &c.]; 
 understanding by it Christ's <I>death</I> as the one redeeming act 
 which reversed the one undoing act of Adam. But this is to limit the 
 apostle's idea too much; for as the same word is properly rendered 
 "righteousness" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:4">Ro 8:4</A>,

 where it means "the righteousness of the law as fulfilled by us who
 walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit," so here it denotes 
 Christ's whole "obedience unto death," considered as the one 
 meritorious ground of the reversal of the condemnation which came by 
 Adam. But on this, and on the expression, "all men," see on

 <A HREF="JFB45.htm#Ro5_19">Ro 5:19</A>. 

 The expression "justification of life," is a vivid combination of two 
 ideas already expatiated upon, meaning "justification entitling to and 
 issuing in the rightful possession and enjoyment of life").</P>

 <A NAME="Ro5_19"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>19. For,</B> &c.--better, "For as by the one man's disobedience the
 many were made sinners, even so by the obedience of the One shall the
 many be made righteous." On this great verse observe: <I>First,</I> By the
 "obedience" of Christ here is plainly not meant more than what divines
 call His <I>active</I> obedience, as distinguished from His sufferings and
 death; it is the entire work of Christ in its <I>obediential</I> character.
 Our Lord Himself represents even His death as His great act of obedience
 to the Father: "This commandment (that is, to lay down and resume His life)
 have I received of My Father" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:8">Joh 10:8</A>).

 <I>Second,</I> The significant word twice rendered <I>made,</I> does
 not signify to <I>work a change upon</I> a person or thing, but to 
 <I>constitute</I> or <I>ordain,</I> as will be seen from all the places 
 where it is used. Here, accordingly, it is intended to express that 
 <I>judicial act</I> which holds men, in virtue of their connection with 
 Adam, as sinners; and, in connection with Christ, as righteous. 
 <I>Third,</I> The change of <I>tense</I> from the past to the 
 future--"as through Adam we <I>were</I> made sinners, so through Christ 
 we <I>shall be</I> made righteous"--delightfully expresses the enduring 
 character of the act, and of the economy to which such acts belong, in 
 contrast with the for-ever-past ruin of believers in Adam.  (See on

 <A HREF="JFB45.htm#Ro6_5">Ro 6:5</A>). 
 
 <I>Fourth,</I> The "all men" of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:18">Ro 5:18</A>
 
 and the "many" of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:19">Ro 5:19</A>

 are the same party, though under a slightly different aspect. In the 
 latter case, the contrast is between the <I>one</I> representative 
 (Adam--Christ) and the <I>many</I> whom he represented; in the former 
 case, it is between the one <I>head</I> (Adam--Christ) and the <I>human 
 race,</I> affected for death and life respectively by the actings of 
 that one. Only in this latter case it is the redeemed family of man 
 that is alone in view; it is <I>humanity</I> as actually lost, but also 
 as actually saved, as ruined and recovered. Such as refuse to fall in 
 with the high purpose of God to constitute His Son a "second Adam," the 
 Head of a new race, and as impenitent and unbelieving finally perish, 
 have no place in this section of the Epistle, whose sole object is to 
 show how God repairs in the second Adam the evil done by the first. 
 (Thus the doctrine of <I>universal restoration</I> has no place here. 
 Thus too the forced interpretation by which the "justification of all" 
 is made to mean a justification merely in <I>possibility</I> and 
 <I>offer</I> to all, and the "justification of the many" to mean the 
 <I>actual</I> justification of as many as believe [A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, &c.], is completely avoided. And thus the 
 harshness of comparing a <I>whole</I> fallen family with a recovered 
 <I>part</I> is got rid of. However true it be in <I>fact</I> that part 
 of mankind is not saved, this is not the <I>aspect</I> in which the 
 subject is here presented. It is <I>totals</I> that are compared and 
 contrasted; and it is the <I>same total</I> in two successive 
 conditions--namely, <I>the human race</I> as ruined in Adam and 
 recovered in Christ).</P>

 <B>20, 21. Moreover the law</B>--"The law, however." The Jew might say, If
 the whole purposes of God towards men center in Adam and Christ, where
 does "the law" come in, and what was the use of it? <I>Answer:</I> It

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>entered</B>--But the word expresses an important idea besides "entering."
 It signifies, "entered incidentally," or "parenthetically." (In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:4">Ga 2:4</A>

 the same word is rendered, "came in <I>privily.</I>") The meaning is, 
 that the promulgation of the law at Sinai was no primary or essential 
 feature of the divine plan, but it was "added"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:19">Ga 3:19</A>)
 
 for a subordinate purpose--the more fully to reveal the evil occasioned
 by Adam, and the need and glory of the remedy by Christ.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that the offence might abound</B>--or, "be multiplied." But what offense?
 Throughout all this section "the offense" (four times repeated besides
 here) has one definite meaning, namely, "the one first offense of Adam";
 and this, in our judgment, is its meaning here also: "All our
 multitudinous breaches of the law are nothing but
 <I>that one first offense,</I> lodged mysteriously in the bosom of every
 child of Adam as an <I>offending principal,</I> and <I>multiplying itself</I>
 into myriads of particular offenses in the life of each." What was one
 <I>act</I> of disobedience in the head has been converted into a vital and
 virulent <I>principle</I> of disobedience in all the members of the human
 family, whose every act of wilful rebellion proclaims itself the child
 of the original transgression.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>But where sin abounded</B>--or, "was multiplied."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>grace did much more abound</B>--rather, "did exceedingly abound," or
 "superabound." The comparison here is between the multiplication of one
 offense into countless transgressions, and such an overflow of grace as
 more than meets that appalling case.</P>

 <A NAME="Ro5_21"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>21. That as sin</B>--Observe, the word "offense" is no more used, as that
 had been sufficiently illustrated; but--what better befitted this
 comprehensive summation of the whole matter--the great general term
 <I>sin.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>hath reigned unto death</B>--rather, "in death," triumphing and (as it
 were) revelling in that complete destruction of its victims.

 <B>even so might grace reign</B>--In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:14,17">Ro 5:14, 17</A>

 and of G<FONT SIZE=-1>RACE</FONT>, the grace which originated the
 scheme of salvation, the grace which "sent the Son to be the Saviour of
 the world," the grace which "made Him to be sin for us who knew no 
 sin," the grace which "makes us to be the righteousness of God in Him," 
 so that "we who receive <I>the abundance of grace</I> and of the gift 
 of righteousness do reign in life by One, Jesus Christ!"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>through righteousness</B>--not <I>ours</I> certainly ("the obedience of
 Christians," to use the wretched language of 
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT>) 
 nor yet exactly "justification" 
 [S<FONT SIZE=-1>TUART</FONT>,

 the same which in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:19">Ro 5:19</A>

 is called His "obedience," meaning His whole mediatorial work in the
 flesh. This is here represented as the <I>righteous medium</I> through 
 which grace reaches its objects and attains all its ends, the stable 
 throne from which Grace as a Sovereign dispenses its saving benefits to 
 as many as are brought under its benign sway.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>unto eternal life</B>--which is salvation in its highest form and fullest
 development for ever.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>by Jesus Christ our Lord</B>--Thus, on that "Name which is above every
 name," the echoes of this hymn to the glory of "Grace" die away, and
 "Jesus is left alone."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 On reviewing this golden section of our Epistle, the following
 additional remarks occur: (1) If this section does not teach that the
 whole race of Adam, standing in him as their federal head, "sinned in
 him and fell with him in his first transgression," we may despair of any
 intelligible exposition of it. The apostle, after saying that Adam's sin
 introduced death into the world, does not say "and so death passed upon
 all men for that <I>Adam</I> "sinned," but "for that <I>all sinned.</I>" Thus,
 according to the teaching of the apostle, "the death of all is for the
 sin of all"; and as this cannot mean the personal sins of each
 individual, but some sin of which unconscious infants are guilty equally
 with adults, it can mean nothing but the one "first transgression" of
 their common head, regarded as <I>the sin of each</I> of his race, and
 punished, as such, with death. It is vain to start back from this
 imputation to all of the guilt of Adam's first sin, as wearing the
 appearance of <I>injustice.</I> For not only are all other theories liable
 to the same objection, in some other form--besides being inconsistent
 with the text--but the actual <I>facts of human nature,</I> which none
 dispute, and which cannot be explained away, involve essentially the
 same difficulties as the great <I>principle</I> on which the apostle here
 explains them. If we admit this principle, on the authority of our
 apostle, a flood of light is at once thrown upon certain features of the
 divine procedure, and certain portions of the divine oracles, which
 otherwise are involved in much darkness; and if the principle itself
 seem hard to digest, it is not harder than the <I>existence of evil,</I>
 which, as a fact, admits of no dispute, but, as a feature in the divine
 administration, admits of no explanation in the present state. (2) What
 is called <I>original sin</I>--or that depraved tendency to evil with which
 every child of Adam comes into the world--is not formally treated of in
 this section (and even in the seventh chapter, it is rather its nature
 and operation than its connection with the first sin which is handled).
 But indirectly, this section bears testimony to it; representing the one
 original offense, unlike every other, as having an <I>enduring vitality</I> in the bosom of every child of Adam, as a principle
 of disobedience,
 whose virulence has gotten it the familiar name of "original sin." (3)
 In what sense is the word "<I>death</I>" used throughout this section? Not
 certainly as mere <I>temporal</I> death, as Arminian commentators affirm.
 For as Christ came to undo what Adam did, which is all comprehended in
 the word "death," it would hence follow that Christ has merely dissolved
 the sentence by which soul and body are parted in death; in other words,
 merely procured the resurrection of the body. But the New Testament
 throughout teaches that the salvation of Christ is from a vastly more
 comprehensive "death" than that. But neither is death here used merely
 in the sense of <I>penal evil,</I> that is, "any evil inflicted in
 punishment of sin and for the support of law" [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>]. This is too
 indefinite, making death a mere figure of speech to denote "penal evil"
 in general--an idea foreign to the simplicity of Scripture--or at least
 making death, strictly so called, only one part of the thing meant by
 it, which ought not to be resorted to if a more simple and natural
 explanation can be found. By "death" then, in this section, we
 understand the sinner's <I>destruction,</I> in the only sense in which he
 is capable of it. Even temporal death is called "destruction"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:23,1Sa+5:11">De 7:23;
 1Sa 5:11</A>, 

 &c.), as extinguishing all that men regard as life. But a destruction
 extending to the <I>soul</I> as well as the body, and <I>into the 
 future world,</I> is clearly expressed in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:13,2Th+1:9,2Pe+3:16">Mt 7:13;
 2Th 1:9; 
 2Pe 3:16</A>, 

 &c. This is the penal "death" of our section, and in this view of it we 
 retain its proper sense. Life--as a state of enjoyment of the favor of 
 God, of pure fellowship with Him, and voluntary subjection to Him--is a 
 blighted thing from the moment that sin is found in the creature's 
 skirts; in that sense, the threatening, "In the day that thou eatest 
 thereof thou shalt surely die," was carried into immediate effect in 
 the case of Adam when he fell; who was thenceforward "dead while he 
 lived." Such are all his posterity from their birth. The separation of 
 soul and body in temporal death carries the sinner's destruction" a 
 stage farther; dissolving his connection with that world out of which 
 he extracted a pleasurable, though unblest, existence, and ushering him 
 into the presence of his Judge--first as a disembodied spirit, but 
 ultimately in the body too, in an enduring condition--"to be punished 
 (and this is the final state) with <I>everlasting destruction</I> from 
 the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power." This final 
 extinction in soul and body of all that constitutes life, but yet 
 eternal consciousness of a blighted existence--this, in its amplest and 
 most awful sense, is "<FONT SIZE=-1>DEATH</FONT>"! Not that Adam 
 understood all that. It is enough that he understood "the day" of his 
 disobedience to be the terminating period of his blissful "life." In 
 that simple idea was wrapt up all the rest. But that he should 
 comprehend its <I>details</I> was not necessary. Nor is it necessary to 
 suppose all that to be intended in every passage of Scripture where the
 word occurs. Enough that all we have described is in the bosom of the
 <I>thing,</I> and will be realized in as many as are not the happy
 subjects of the Reign of Grace. Beyond doubt, the whole of this is
 intended in such sublime and comprehensive passages as this: "God
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gave His .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Son that whosoever believeth
 in Him <I>might not</I> 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>PERISH</FONT>, 
 <I>but have everlasting</I> 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>LIFE</FONT>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:16">Joh 3:16</A>).

 And should not the untold horrors of that "<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>DEATH</FONT>"--already "reigning over" all that are not in 
 Christ, and hastening to its consummation--quicken our flight into "the 
 second Adam," that having "received the abundance of grace and of the 
 gift of righteousness, we may reign in <FONT SIZE=-1>LIFE</FONT> by the 
 One, Jesus Christ?"</P>

 <B>1. What,</B> &c.--The subject of this <I>third</I> division of our 
 Epistle announces itself at once in the opening question, "Shall we 
 (or, as the true reading is, "May we," "Are we to") continue in sin, 
 that grace may abound?" Had the apostle's doctrine been that salvation 
 depends <I>in any degree</I> upon our good works, no such objection to 
 it could have been made. Against the doctrine of a purely gratuitous 
 justification, the objection is plausible; nor has there ever been an 
 age in which it has not been urged. That it <I>was</I> brought against
 the apostles, we know from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:8">Ro 3:8</A>;

 and we gather from

 show.</P>

 <B>were baptized into his death?</B>--sealed with the seal of heaven, and as
 it were formally entered and articled, to all the <I>benefits</I> and all
 the <I>obligations</I> of Christian discipleship in general, and of His
 <I>death</I> in particular. And since He was "made sin" and "a curse for
 us" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:21,Ga+5:13">2Co 5:21;

 "bearing our sins in His own body on the tree," and "rising again for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:25,1Pe+2:24">Ro 4:25;
 1Pe 2:24</A>),

 our whole sinful case and condition, thus taken up into His Person, has 
 been brought to an end in His death. Whoso, then, has been baptized
 into Christ's death has formally surrendered the whole state and life 
 of sin, as in Christ a dead thing. He has sealed himself to be not only 
 "the righteousness of God in Him," but "a new creature"; and as he 
 cannot be in Christ to the one effect and not to the other, for they 
 are one thing, he has bidden farewell, by baptism into Christ's death, 
 to his entire connection with sin. "How," then, "can he live any longer 
 therein?" The two things are as contradictory in the fact as they are 
 in the terms.</P>

 <A NAME="Ro6_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>4. Therefore we are</B>--rather, "were" (it being a past act, completed
 at once).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>buried with him, by baptism into death</B>--(The <I>comma</I> we 
 have placed after "him" will show what the sense is. It is not, "By 
 baptism we are buried with Him into death," which makes no sense at 
 all; but, "By <I>baptism with Him into death</I> we are buried with 
 Him"; in other words, "By the same baptism which publicly enters us 
 into His <I>death,</I> we are made partakers of His <I>burial</I> 
 also"). To leave a dead body unburied is represented, alike in heathen 
 authors as in Scripture, as the greatest indignity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:8,9">Re 11:8, 9</A>).

 It was fitting, therefore, that Christ, after "dying for our sins
 according to the Scriptures," should "descend into the lower parts of 
 the earth"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:9">Eph 4:9</A>).

 As this was the last and lowest step of His humiliation, so it was the 
 honorable dissolution of His last link of connection with that life 
 which He laid down for us; and we, in being "buried with Him by our 
 baptism into His death," have by this public act severed our last link 
 of connection with that whole sinful condition and life which Christ 
 brought to an end in His death.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the
 Father</B>--that is, by such a forth-putting of the Father's <I>power</I> as was the effulgence of His whole glory.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>even so we also</B>--as risen to a new life with Him.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>should walk in newness of life</B>--But what is that "newness?" Surely
 if our <I>old</I> life, now dead and buried with Christ, was wholly sinful,
 the <I>new,</I> to which we rise with the risen Saviour, must be altogether
 a holy life; so that every time we go back to "those things whereof we
 are now ashamed" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:21">Ro 6:21</A>),

 we belie our resurrection with Christ to newness of life, and "forget 
 that we have been purged from our old sins"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:9">2Pe 1:9</A>).

 (Whether the mode of baptism by immersion be alluded to in this verse,
 as a kind of symbolical burial and resurrection, does not seem to us of 
 much consequence. Many interpreters think it is, and it may be so. But 
 as it is not clear that baptism in apostolic times was exclusively by 
 immersion [see on

 <A HREF="JFB44.htm#Ac2_41">Ac 2:41</A>],

 so <I>sprinkling</I> and <I>washing</I> are indifferently used in the 
 New Testament to express the cleansing efficacy of the blood of Jesus. 
 And just as the woman with the issue of blood got virtue out of Christ 
 by simply <I>touching</I> Him, so the essence of baptism seems to lie 
 in the simple <I>contact</I> of the element with the body, symbolizing 
 living contact with Christ crucified; the mode and extent of suffusion 
 being indifferent and variable with climate and circumstances).</P>

 been discharged once for all, by the believer's penal death in the death

 Not content with showing that his doctrine has no tendency to relax the

 <B>12. Let not sin therefore</B>--as a Master

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>reign</B>--(The reader will observe that wherever in this section the words
 "Sin," "Obedience," "Righteousness," "Uncleanness," "Iniquity," are
 figuratively used, to represent a <I>Master,</I> they are here printed in
 capitals, to make this manifest to the eye, and so save explanation).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in your mortal body, that ye should obey it</B>--sin.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in the lusts thereof</B>--"the lusts of the body," as the <I>Greek</I> makes
 evident. (The other reading, perhaps the true one, "that ye should obey
 the lusts thereof," comes to the same thing). The "body" is here viewed
 as the instrument by which all the sins of the heart become facts of the
 outward life, and as itself the seat of the lower appetites; and it is
 called "our <I>mortal</I> body," probably to remind us how unsuitable is
 this reign of sin in those who are "alive from the dead." But the reign
 here meant is the unchecked dominion of sin <I>within</I> us. Its outward
 acts are next referred to.</P>

 <A NAME="Ro6_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>13. Neither yield ye your members instruments of unrighteousness unto
 Sin, but yield yourselves</B>--this is the great surrender.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>unto God as those that are alive from the dead, and</B>--as the fruit of
 this.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>your members</B>--till now prostituted to sin.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>instruments of righteousness unto God</B>--But what if indwelling sin
 should prove too strong for us? The reply is: But it will not.</P>

 <A NAME="Ro6_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>14. For Sin shall not have dominion over you</B>--as the slaves of a tyrant
 lord.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for ye are not under the law, but under grace</B>--The force of this 
 glorious assurance can only be felt by observing the grounds on which 
 it rests. To be "under the law" is, first, to be under its claim to 
 entire obedience; and so, next under its curse for the breach of these. 
 And as all power to obey can reach the sinner only through 
 <I>Grace,</I> of which the law knows nothing, it follows that to be 
 "under the law" is, finally, to be shut up under an <I>inability to 
 keep it,</I> and consequently to be the <I>helpless slave of sin.</I> 
 On the other hand, to be "under grace," is to be under the glorious 
 canopy and saving effects of that "grace which reigns through 
 righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (see on

 <A HREF="JFB45.htm#Ro5_20">Ro 5:20, 21</A>).

 The curse of the law has been completely lifted from off them; they are 
 made "the righteousness of God in Him"; and they are "alive unto God 
 through Jesus Christ." So that, as when they were "under the law," Sin 
 <I>could not but</I> have dominion over them, so now that they are 
 "under grace," Sin <I>cannot</I> but be subdued under them.  If before, 
 Sin resistlessly triumphed, Grace will now be more than conqueror.</P>

 we are (see on

 There is no middle state of personal independence; for which we were 
 never made, and to which we have no claim. When we would not that God 
 should reign over us, we were in righteous judgment "sold under Sin"; 
 now being through grace "made free from Sin," it is only to become 
 "servants to Righteousness," which is our true freedom.</P>

 <B>Righteousness</B>--Difficulties have been made about this clause where
 none exist. The import of it seems clearly to be this:--"Since no
 servant can serve two masters, much less where their interests come into
 deadly collision, and each demands the whole man, so, while ye were in
 the service of Sin ye were in no proper sense the servants of
 Righteousness, and never did it one act of real service: whatever might
 be your conviction of the claims of Righteousness, your real services
 were all and always given to Sin: Thus had ye full proof of the nature
 and advantages of Sin's service." The searching question with which this
 is followed up, shows that this is the meaning.</P>

 things yielded? The apostle answers his own question:--"Abiding 
 satisfaction, did I ask?  They have left only a sense of 
 '<I>shame.</I>' Permanent advantage? 'The end of them is 
 <I>death.</I>'" By saying they were "<I>now</I> ashamed," he makes it 
 plain that he is not referring to that disgust at themselves, and 
 remorse of conscience by which those who are the most helplessly "sold 
 under sin" are often stung to the quick; but that ingenuous feeling of 
 self-reproach, which pierces and weighs down the children of God, as 
 they think of the dishonor which their past life did to His name, the 
 ingratitude it displayed, the violence it did to their own conscience, 
 its deadening and degrading effects, and the death--"the second 
 death"--to which it was dragging them down, when mere Grace arrested 
 them. (On the sense of "death" here, see on

 <B>Jesus Christ our Lord</B>--This concluding verse--as pointed as it is
 brief--contains the marrow, the most fine gold, of the Gospel. As the
 laborer is worthy of his hire, and feels it to be his due--his own of
 right--so is death the due of sin, the wages the sinner has well
 wrought for, his own. But "eternal life" is in no sense or degree the
 wages of our righteousness; we do nothing whatever to earn or become
 entitled to it, and never can: it is therefore, in the most absolute
 sense, "<FONT SIZE=-1>THE GIFT OF</FONT>
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>." Grace reigns in the bestowal of it in every
 case, and that "in Jesus Christ our Lord," as the righteous Channel of
 it. In view of this, who that hath tasted that the Lord is gracious can
 refrain from saying, "Unto Him that loved us, and washed us from our
 sins in His own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and
 His Father, to Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen!"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:5,6">Re 1:5, 6</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Note,</I> (1) As the most effectual refutation of the oft-repeated
 calumny, that the doctrine of Salvation by grace encourages to continue
 in sin, is the holy life of those who profess it, let such ever feel
 that the highest service they can render to that Grace which is all
 their hope, is to "yield themselves unto God, as those that are alive
 from the dead, and their members instruments of righteousness unto God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:12,13">Ro 6:12, 13</A>).

 By so doing they will "put to silence the ignorance of foolish men," 
 secure their own peace, carry out the end of their calling, and give 
 substantial glory to Him that loved them. (2) The fundamental principle 
 of Gospel obedience is as original as it is divinely rational; that "we 
 are set free from the law in order to keep it, and are brought 
 graciously under servitude to the law in order to be free"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:14,15,18">Ro 6:14, 15, 18</A>).

 So long as we know no principle of obedience but the terrors of the 
 law, which condemns all the breakers of it, and knows nothing whatever 
 of grace, either to pardon the guilty or to purify the stained, we are 
 shut up under a moral impossibility of genuine and acceptable 
 obedience: whereas when Grace lifts us out of this state, and through 
 union to a righteous Surety, brings us into a state of conscious 
 reconciliation, and loving surrender of heart to a God of salvation, we 
 immediately feel the glorious <I>liberty to be holy,</I> and the 
 assurance that "Sin shall not have dominion over us" is as sweet to our 
 renewed tastes and aspirations as the ground of it is felt to be firm, 
 "because we are not under the Law, but under Grace." (3) As this most 
 momentous of all transitions in the history of a man is wholly of God's 
 free grace, the change should never be thought, spoken, or written of 
 but with lively thanksgiving to Him who so loved us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:17">Ro 6:17</A>).
 
 (4) Christians, in the service of God, should emulate their former
 selves in the zeal and steadiness with which they served sin, and the
 length to which they went in it 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:19">Ro 6:19</A>).

 (5) To stimulate this holy rivalry, let us often "look back to the rock 
 whence we were hewn, the hole of the pit whence we were digged," in 
 search of the enduring advantages and permanent satisfactions which the 
 service of Sin yielded; and when we find to our "shame" only gall and 
 wormwood, let us follow a godless life to its proper "end," until, 
 finding ourselves in the territories of "death," we are fain to hasten 
 back to survey the service of Righteousness, that new Master of all 
 believers, and find Him leading us sweetly into abiding "holiness," and 
 landing us at length in "everlasting life"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:20-22">Ro 6:20-22</A>).

 (6) Death and life are before all men who hear the Gospel: the one, the 
 natural issue and proper reward of sin; the other, the absolutely free 
 "<FONT SIZE=-1>GIFT OF</FONT> G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>" to sinners, "in 
 Jesus Christ our Lord." And as the one is the <I>conscious</I> sense of 
 the hopeless loss of all blissful existence, so the other is the 
 conscious possession and enjoyment of all that constitutes a rational 
 creature's highest "life" for evermore

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:23">Ro 6:23</A>).

 Ye that read or hear these words, "I call heaven and earth to record 
 this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, 
 blessing and cursing, therefore choose life, that both thou and thy 
 seed may live!"

 <B>to the law by the body of Christ</B>--through His slain body. The apostle
 here departs from his usual word "died," using the more expressive
 phrase "were slain," to make it clear that he meant their being
 "crucified with Christ"
 (as expressed in

 <B>raised from the dead</B>--to the intent.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that we should bring forth fruit unto God</B>--It has been thought that the
 apostle should here have said that "the <I>law</I> died to us," not "we to
 the law," but that purposely inverted the figure, to avoid the harshness
 to Jewish ears of <I>the death of the law</I>
 [C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT>,
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>,
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>,
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>HILIPPI</FONT>, &c.]. But this is to mistake the apostle's design in
 employing this figure, which was merely to illustrate the general
 principle that "<I>death dissolves legal obligation.</I>" It was essential
 to his argument that <I>we,</I> not the law, should be the dying party,
 since it is we that are "crucified with Christ," and not the law. This
 death dissolves our marriage obligation to the law, leaving us at
 liberty to contract a new relation--to be joined to the Risen One, in
 order to spiritual fruitfulness, to the glory of God [B<FONT SIZE=-1>EZA</FONT>,
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>,
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>EYER</FONT>,
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, &c.]. The confusion, then, is in the expositors, not the
 text; and it has arisen from not observing that, like Jesus Himself,
 believers are here viewed as having a double life--the old sin-condemned
 life, which they lay down with Christ, and the new life of acceptance
 and holiness to which they rise with their Surety and Head; and all the
 issues of this new life, in Christian obedience, are regarded as the
 "fruit" of this blessed union to the Risen One. How such holy
 fruitfulness was impossible before our union to Christ, is next
 declared.</P>

 <I>Greek</I>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I had not known sin but by the law</B>--It is important to fix what is
 meant by "sin" here. It certainly is not "the general nature of sin"
 [A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>, &c.], though it be true that this is learned from the law; for
 such a sense will not suit what is said of it in the following verses,
 where the meaning is the same as here. The only meaning which suits all
 that is said of it in this place is "the <I>principle</I> of sin in the
 heart of fallen man." The sense, then, is this: "It was by means of the
 law that I came to know what a virulence and strength of sinful
 propensity I had within me." The <I>existence</I> of this it did not need
 the law to reveal to him; for even the heathens recognized and wrote of
 it. But the dreadful nature and desperate power of it the law alone
 discovered--in the way now to be described.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for I had not known lust, except,</B> &c.--Here the same <I>Greek</I> word
 is unfortunately rendered by three different English ones--"lust";
 "covet"; "concupiscence" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:8">Ro 7:8</A>)

 --which obscures the meaning. By using the word "lust" only, in the 
 wide sense of all "irregular desire," or every outgoing of the heart 
 towards anything forbidden, the sense will best be brought out; thus, 
 "For I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not 
 lust; But sin, taking ('having taken') occasion by the commandment 
 (that one which forbids it), wrought in me all manner of lusting." This 
 gives a deeper view of the tenth commandment than the mere words 
 suggest. The apostle saw in it the prohibition not only of desire after 
 <I>certain things there specified,</I> \ but of "desire after 
 <I>everything divinely forbidden</I>"; in other words, all "lusting" or 
 "irregular desire." It was this which "he had not known but by the 
 law." The law forbidding all such desire so stirred his corruption that 
 it wrought in him "all manner of lusting"--desire of every sort after 
 what was forbidden.</P>

 view, through its turning God's holy, just, and good law into a 
 provocative to the very things which is forbids." So much for <I>the 
 law in relation to the unregenerate,</I> of whom the apostle takes 
 himself as the example; first, in his ignorant, self-satisfied 
 condition; next, under humbling discoveries of his inability to keep 
 the law, through inward contrariety to it; finally, as self-condemned, 
 and already, in law, a dead man. Some inquire to what period of his 
 recorded history these circumstances relate. But there is no reason to 
 think they were wrought into such conscious and explicit discovery at 
 any period of his history before he "met the Lord in the way"; and 
 though, "amidst the multitude of his thoughts within him" during his 
 memorable three day's blindness immediately after that, such views of 
 the law and of himself would doubtless be tossed up and down till they 
 <I>took shape</I> much as they are here described (see on

 <A HREF="JFB44.htm#Ac9_9">Ac 9:9</A>)

 we regard this whole description of his inward struggles and progress 
 rather as the <I>finished result</I> of all his past recollections and 
 subsequent reflections on his unregenerate state, which he throws into 
 historical form only for greater vividness. But now the apostle 
 proceeds to repel false inferences <I>regarding the law,</I> secondly:

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:14-25">Ro 7:14-25</A>,

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but sin which dwelleth in me</B>--that principle of sin that still 
 has its abode in me. To explain this and the following statements, as 
 many do (even
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT> 
 and
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT>), 
 of the sins of unrenewed men against their better convictions, is to do
 painful violence to the apostle's language, and to affirm of the 
 unregenerate what is untrue. That coexistence and mutual hostility of 
 "flesh" and "spirit" in the same renewed man, which is so clearly 
 taught in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:4">Ro 8:4</A>,

 &c., and in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:16">Ga 5:16</A>,

 &c., is the true and only key to the language of this and the following 
 verses.  (It is hardly necessary to say that the apostle means not to 
 disown the blame of yielding to his corruptions, by saying, "it is not 
 he that does it, but sin that dwelleth in him." Early heretics thus 
 abused his language; but the whole strain of the passage shows that his 
 sole object in thus expressing himself was to bring more vividly before 
 his readers the conflict of two opposite principles, and how entirely, 
 as a new man--honoring from his inmost soul the law of God--he 
 condemned and renounced his corrupt nature, with its affections and 
 lusts, its stirrings and its outgoings, root and branch).</P>

 supplement "how," in our version, weakens the statement.

 <B>I find not</B>--Here, again, we have the <I>double self</I> of the renewed

 evil, cannot be the struggles between conscience and passion in the

 good" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:22">Ro 7:22</A>

 than "consent" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:16">Ro 7:16</A>;

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity 
 to the law of sin which is in my members</B>--In this important verse, 
 observe, first, that the word "law" means <I>an inward principle of 
 action, good or evil, operating with the fixedness and regularity of a 
 law.</I> The apostle found two such laws within him; the one "the law 
 of sin in his members," called (in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:17,24">Ga 5:17, 24</A>)

 "the flesh which lusteth against the spirit," "the flesh with the
 affections and lusts," that is, the sinful principle in the regenerate; 
 the other, "the law of the mind," or the holy principle of the renewed 
 nature. Second, when the apostle says he "sees" the one of these 
 principles "warring against" the other, and "bringing him into 
 captivity" to itself, <I>he is not referring to any actual rebellion 
 going on within him while he was writing, or to any captivity to his 
 own lusts then existing.</I> He is simply describing the two 
 conflicting principles, and pointing out what it was the inherent 
 property of each to aim at bringing about.  Third, when the apostle 
 describes himself as "<I>brought into captivity</I>" by the triumph of 
 the sinful principle of his nature, he clearly speaks in the person of 
 a <I>renewed man.</I> Men do not feel themselves to be in captivity in 
 the territories of their own sovereign and associated with their own 
 friends, breathing a congenial atmosphere, and acting quite 
 spontaneously. But here the apostle describes himself, when drawn under 
 the power of his sinful nature, as forcibly seized and reluctantly 
 dragged to his enemy's camp, from which he would gladly make his 
 escape. This ought to settle the question, whether he is here speaking 
 as a regenerate man or the reverse.</P>

 <A NAME="Ro7_24"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>24. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of 
 this death?</B>--The apostle speaks of the "body" here with reference 
 to "the law of sin" which he had said was "in his members," but merely 
 as the instrument by which the sin of the heart finds vent in action, 
 and as itself the seat of the lower appetites (see on

 <A HREF="JFB45.htm#Ro6_6">Ro 6:6</A>, 
 
 and

 <A HREF="JFB45.htm#Ro7_5">Ro 7:5</A>);

 and he calls it "the body of <I>this</I> death," as feeling, at the 
 moment when he wrote, the horrors of that death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:21">Ro 6:21</A>,
 
 and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:5">Ro 7:5</A>)

 into which it dragged him down. But the language is not that of a 
 sinner newly awakened to the sight of his lost state; it is the cry of 
 a living but agonized believer, weighed down under a burden which is 
 not himself, but which he longs to shake off from his renewed self. Nor 
 does the question imply ignorance of the way of relief at the time 
 referred to. It was designed only to prepare the way for that outburst 
 of thankfulness for the divinely provided remedy which immediately

 <I>Note,</I> (1) This whole chapter was of essential service to the
 Reformers in their contendings with the Church of Rome. When the divines
 of that corrupt church, in a Pelagian spirit, denied that the sinful
 principle in our fallen nature, which they called "Concupiscence," and
 which is commonly called "Original Sin," had the nature of <I>sin</I> at
 all, they were triumphantly answered from this chapter, where--both in
 the first section of it, which speaks of it in the unregenerate, and in
 the second, which treats of its presence and actings in believers--it is
 explicitly, emphatically, and repeatedly called "<I>sin.</I>" As such, they
 held it to be <I>damnable.</I> (See the Confessions both of the Lutheran
 and Reformed churches). In the following century, the orthodox in
 Holland had the same controversy to wage with "the Remonstrants" (the
 followers of Arminius), and they waged it on the field of this chapter.
 (2) Here we see that <I>Inability</I> is consistent with <I>Accountability.</I>
 (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:18,Ga+5:17">Ro 7:18;
 Ga 5:17</A>). 

 "As the Scriptures constantly recognize the truth of these two things,
 so are they constantly united in Christian experience. Everyone feels 
 that he cannot do the things that he would, yet is sensible that he is 
 guilty for not doing them. Let any man test his power by the 
 requisition to love God perfectly at all times. Alas!  how entire our 
 inability! Yet how deep our self-loathing and self-condemnation!" 
 [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>].  (3) If the first sight of the Cross by 
 the eye of faith kindles feelings never to be forgotten, and in one 
 sense never to be repeated--like the first view of an enchanting 
 landscape--the experimental discovery, in the latter stages of the 
 Christian life, of its power to beat down and mortify inveterate 
 corruption, to cleanse and heal from long-continued backslidings and 
 frightful inconsistencies, and so to triumph over all that threatens to 
 destroy those for whom Christ died, as to bring them safe over the 
 tempestuous seas of this life into the haven of eternal rest--is 
 attended with yet more heart--affecting wonder draws forth deeper 
 thankfulness, and issues in more exalted adoration of Him whose work 
 Salvation is from first to last

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:24,25">Ro 7:24, 25</A>).

 (4) It is sad when such topics as these are handled as mere questions 
 of biblical interpretation or systematic theology. Our great apostle 
 could not treat of them apart from personal experience, of which the 
 facts of his own life and the feelings of his own soul furnished him 
 with illustrations as lively as they were apposite. When one is unable 
 to go far into the investigation of indwelling sin, without breaking 
 out into an, "O wretched man that I am!" and cannot enter on the way of 
 relief without exclaiming "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord," 
 he will find his meditations rich in fruit to his own soul, and may 
 expect, through Him who presides in all such matters, to kindle in his 
 readers or hearers the like blessed emotions

 is to show how "the law of sin and death" is deprived of its power to

 receives in them the homage of a living obedience

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>no condemnation: to them which are in Christ Jesus</B>--As Christ, who
 "knew no sin," was, to all legal effects, "made sin for us," so are we,
 who believe in Him, to all legal effects, "made the righteousness of God
 in Him" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:21">2Co 5:21</A>);

 and thus, one with Him in the divine reckoning.  there is to such 
 "<FONT SIZE=-1>NO CONDEMNATION</FONT>." (Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:18,5:24,Ro+5:18,19">Joh 3:18; 5:24;

 But this is no mere legal <I>arrangement:</I> it is a union in
 <I>life;</I> believers, through the indwelling of Christ's Spirit in 
 them, having one life with Him, as truly as the head and the members of 
 the same body have one life.

 <B>who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit</B>--The evidence of
 manuscripts seems to show that this clause formed no part of the

 introduced, and the second later, from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:4">Ro 8:4</A>,

 probably as an explanatory comment, and to make the transition to

 <B>2. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
 free</B>--rather, "freed me"--referring to the time of his conversion,
 when first he believed.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>from the law of sin and death</B>--It is the Holy Ghost who is here 
 called "the Spirit of <I>life,</I>" as opening up in the souls of 
 believers a fountain of spiritual life (see on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh7_38">Joh 7:38, 39</A>);

 just as He is called "the Spirit of truth," as "guiding them into all 
 truth"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:13">Joh 16:13</A>),

 and "the Spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the 
 fear of the Lord"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:2">Isa 11:2</A>),

 as the inspirer of these qualities. And He is called "the Spirit of 
 life <I>in Christ Jesus,</I>" because it is as members of Christ that 
 He takes up His abode in believers, who in consequence of this have one 
 life with their Head. And as the word "<I>law</I>" here has the same 
 meaning as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:23">Ro 7:23</A>,

 namely, "an inward principle of action, operating with the fixedness 
 and regularity of a law," it thus appears that "<I>the law of the 
 Spirit of life in Christ Jesus</I>" here means, "that new principle of 
 action which the Spirit of Christ has opened up within us--the law of 
 our new being." This "<I>sets us free,</I>" as soon as it takes 
 possession of our inner man, "from the law of sin and death" that is, 
 from the enslaving power of that corrupt principle which carries death 
 in its bosom. The "strong man armed" is overpowered by the "stronger 
 than he"; the weaker principle is dethroned and expelled by the more 
 powerful; the principle of spiritual life prevails against and brings 
 into captivity the principle of spiritual death--"leading captivity 
 captive." If this be the apostle's meaning, the whole verse is to this 
 effect: That the triumph of believers over their inward corruption, 
 through the power of Christ's Spirit in them, <I>proves</I> them to be 
 in Christ Jesus, and as such absolved from condemnation. But this is 
 now explained more fully.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>3, 4. For what the law could not do,</B> &c.--a difficult and much 
 controverted verse. But it is clearly, we think, the law's inability to 
 <I>free us from the dominion of sin</I> that the apostle has in view; 
 as has partly appeared already (see on

 <A HREF="JFB45.htm#Ro8_2">Ro 8:2</A>), 

 and will more fully appear presently. The law could irritate our sinful 
 nature into more virulent action, as we have seen in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:5">Ro 7:5</A>,

 but it could not secure its own fulfilment. How that is accomplished 
 comes now to be shown.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in that it was weak through the flesh</B>--that is, having to address
 itself to us through a corrupt nature, too strong to be influenced by
 mere commands and threatenings.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>God,</B> &c.--The sentence is somewhat imperfect in its structure, which
 occasions a certain obscurity. The meaning is, that <I>whereas</I> the law
 was powerless to secure its own fulfilment for the reason given, God
 took the method now to be described for attaining that end.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>sending</B>--"having sent"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>his own Son</B>--This and similar expressions plainly imply that 
 Christ was God's "<FONT SIZE=-1>OWN</FONT> S<FONT SIZE=-1>ON</FONT>"
 <I>before</I> He was sent--that is, in His own proper Person, and 
 independently of His mission and appearance in the flesh (see on

 <A HREF="JFB45.htm#Ro8_32">Ro 8:32</A> 
 
 and

 <A HREF="JFB48.htm#Ga4_4">Ga 4:4</A>); 

 and if so, He not only has the <I>very nature</I> of God, even as a son
 of his father, but is essentially <I>of</I> the Father, though in a 
 sense too mysterious for any language of ours properly to define (see 
 on the first through fourth chapters). And this peculiar relationship 
 is put forward here to <I>enhance the greatness</I> and <I>define the 
 nature</I> of the relief provided, as coming <I>from beyond the 
 precincts of sinful humanity altogether,</I> yea, <I>immediately from 
 the Godhead itself.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in the likeness of sinful flesh</B>--literally, "of the flesh of sin"; a
 very remarkable and pregnant expression. He was made in the reality of
 our flesh, but only in the <I>likeness</I> of its sinful condition. He took
 our nature as it is in us, compassed with infirmities, with nothing to
 distinguish Him as man from sinful men, save that He was without sin.
 Nor does this mean that He took our nature with all its properties save
 one; for sin is <I>no property of humanity at all,</I> but only the
 disordered state of our souls, as the fallen family of Adam; a disorder
 affecting, indeed, and overspreading our entire nature, but still purely
 <I>our own.</I>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and for sin</B>--literally, "and about sin"; that is, "on the business of
 sin." The expression is purposely a general one, because the design was
 not to speak of Christ's mission to <I>atone</I> for sin, but in virtue of
 that atonement to <I>destroy its dominion</I> and <I>extirpate it altogether</I>
 from believers. We think it wrong, therefore, to render the words
 (as in the <I>Margin</I>) "by a sacrifice for sin"
 (suggested by the language of
 the <I>Septuagint</I> and approved by C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>, &c.);
 for this sense is too
 definite, and makes the idea of <I>expiation</I> more prominent than it is.

 we owe nothing to the flesh, we disown its unrighteous claims and are

 The apostle is not satisfied with assuring them that they are under no 
 <I>obligations</I> to the flesh, to hearken to its suggestions, without 
 reminding them where it will end if they do; and he uses the word 
 "mortify" (put to death) as a kind of play upon the word "die" just 
 before. "If <I>ye</I> do not kill sin, <I>it</I> will kill you." But he 
 tempers this by the bright alternative, that if they do, through the 
 Spirit, mortify the deeds of the body, such a course will infallibly 
 terminate in "life" everlasting.  And this leads the apostle into a new 
 line of thought, opening into his final subject, the "glory" awaiting 
 the justified believer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Note,</I> (1) "There can be no <I>safety,</I> no holiness, no happiness,
 to those who are out of Christ: No "safety," because all such are under
 the condemnation of the law 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:1">Ro 8:1</A>);

 no <I>holiness,</I> because such only as are united to Christ have the 
 spirit of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:9">Ro 8:9</A>);

 no <I>happiness,</I> because to be "carnally minded is death"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:6">Ro 8:6</A>)"
 
 [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>].
 (2) The sanctification of believers, as it has its whole foundation in
 the atoning death, so it has its living spring in the indwelling of the 
 Spirit of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:2-4">Ro 8:2-4</A>).

 (3) "The bent of the thoughts, affections, and pursuits, is the only 
 decisive test of character

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:5">Ro 8:5</A>)"
 
 [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>].
 (4) No human refinement of the carnal mind will make it spiritual, or
 compensate for the absence of spirituality. "Flesh" and "spirit" are 
 essentially and unchangeably opposed; nor can the carnal mind, as such, 
 be brought into real subjection to the law of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:5-7">Ro 8:5-7</A>).

 Hence (5) the estrangement of God and the sinner is mutual. For as the 
 sinner's state of mind is "enmity against God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:7">Ro 8:7</A>),

 so in this state he "cannot please God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:8">Ro 8:8</A>).

 (6) Since the Holy Ghost is, in the same breath, called 
 indiscriminately "the Spirit of God," "the Spirit of Christ," and 
 "Christ" Himself (as an indwelling life in believers), the <I>essential 
 unity</I> and yet Personal <I>distinctness</I> of the Father, the Son, 
 and the Holy Ghost, m the one adorable Godhead must be believed, as the 
 only consistent explanation of such language

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:9-11">Ro 8:9-11</A>).

 (7) The consciousness of spiritual life in our renewed souls is a 
 glorious assurance of resurrection life in the body also, in virtue of 
 the same quickening Spirit whose inhabitation we already enjoy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:11">Ro 8:11</A>).
 
 (8) Whatever professions of spiritual life men may make, it remains
 eternally true that "if we live after the flesh we shall die," and only
 "if we through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body we shall
 live"

 this cry is said to proceed from <I>the Spirit</I> in us, drawing forth

 "Abba" is the <I>Syro-Chaldaic</I> word for "Father"; and the 
 <I>Greek</I> word for that is added, not surely to tell the reader that 
 both mean the same thing, but for the same reason which drew both words 
 from the lips of Christ Himself during his agony in the garden

 <I>conscious sonship,</I> "Abba, Father"; but we are not therein alone; for
 the Holy Ghost within us, yea, even in that very cry which it is His to
 draw forth, sets His own distinct seal to ours; and thus, "in the mouth
 of two witnesses" the thing is established. The apostle had before
 called us "<I>sons</I> of God," referring to our <I>adoption;</I> here the
 word changes to "children," referring to our <I>new birth.</I> The one
 expresses the <I>dignity</I> to which we are <I>admitted;</I> the other the
 new <I>life</I> which we <I>receive.</I> The latter is more suitable here;
 because a son by <I>adoption</I> might not be heir of the property, whereas

 imperfection of all human language as a vehicle for expressing the 
 subtle spiritual feelings of the heart. In these circumstances, how can 
 it be but that much uncertainty should surround all our spiritual 
 exercises, and that in our nearest approaches and in the freest

 up within us whether our <I>frame</I> of mind in such exercises is

 has kindled the only language of which they are capable; so that though

 resurrection, to experience a corresponding emancipation from its 
 blighted condition into undecaying life and unfading beauty

 have the fewest and faintest glimpses of heaven, that they sigh most 
 fervently to be there; but, on the contrary, when through the 
 unobstructed working of the Spirit in their hearts, "the first-fruits" 
 of the glory to be revealed are most largely and frequently tasted, 
 then, and just for that reason, is it that they "groan within 
 themselves" for full redemption

 as He is? (6) "The patience of hope"

 (7) As prayer is the breath of the spiritual life, and the believer's 
 only effectual relief under the "infirmity" which attaches to his whole 
 condition here below, how cheering is it to be assured that the blessed 
 Spirit, cognizant of it all, comes in aid of it all; and in particular, 
 that when believers, unable to articulate their case before God, can at 
 times do nothing but lie "groaning" before the Lord, these inarticulate 
 groanings are the Spirit's own vehicle for conveying into "the ears of 
 the Lord of Sabaoth" their whole case; and come up before the Hearer of 
 prayer as the Spirit's own intercession in their behalf, and that they 
 are recognized by Him that sitteth on the Throne, as embodying only 
 what His own "will" determined before to bestow upon them

 "all things work together for good [even] to them who are the called
 (rather, 'who are called') according to His (eternal) purpose." 
 Glorious assurance! And this, it seems, was a "household word," a 
 "known" thing, among believers. This working of all things for good is 
 done quite naturally to "them that love God," because such souls, 
 persuaded that He who gave His own Son for them cannot but mean them 
 well in all His procedure, learn thus to take in good part whatever He 
 sends them, however trying to flesh and blood: and to them who are the 
 called, according to "His purpose," all things do in the same 
 intelligible way "work together for good"; for, even when "He hath His 
 way in the whirlwind," they see "His chariot paved with love"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:10">So 3:10</A>).

 And knowing that it is in pursuance of an eternal "<I>purpose</I>" of

 Jesus Christ"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:9">1Co 1:9</A>),

 they naturally say within themselves, "It cannot be that He 'of whom, 
 and through whom, and to whom are all things,' should suffer that 
 purpose to be thwarted by anything really adverse to us, or that He 
 should not make all things, dark as well as light, crooked as well as 
 straight, to co-operate to the furtherance and final completion of His 
 high design."</P>

 <B>whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate</B>--foreordain. In what
 sense are we to take the word "foreknow" here? "Those who He foreknew
 would repent and believe," say <I>Pelagians</I> of every age and every hue.
 But this is to thrust into the text what is contrary to the whole
 spirit, and even letter, of the apostle's teaching (see

 In 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:2,Ps+1:6">Ro 11:2,

 God's "knowledge" of His people cannot be restricted to a mere 
 foresight of future events, or acquaintance with what is passing here 
 below. Does "whom He did foreknow," then, mean "whom He foreordained?" 
 Scarcely, because both "foreknowledge" and "foreordination" are here 
 mentioned, and the one as the <I>cause</I> of the other. It is 
 difficult indeed for our limited minds to distinguish them as states of 
 the Divine Mind towards men; especially since in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Ac 2:23</A>

 "the counsel" is put <I>before</I> "the foreknowledge of God," while in

 "election" is said to be "<I>according to</I> the foreknowledge of 
 God." But probably God's foreknowledge of His own people means His 
 "<I>peculiar, gracious, complacency in them,</I>" while His 
 "predestinating" or "foreordaining" them signifies His fixed 
 <I>purpose,</I> flowing from this, to "save them and call them with an

 sin, but redeemed by His blood from condemnation and wrath, and
 transformed into His likeness: He "the First-born from the dead"; they

 the Gospel (as in

 denotes the <I>first great step</I> in personal salvation and answers

 "calling" expresses the <I>divine authorship</I> of the change, and the 
 <I>sovereign power</I> by which we are summoned, Matthew-like, 
 Zaccheus-like, out of our old, wretched, perishing condition, into a 
 new, safe, blessed life.

 Noble climax, and so rhythmically expressed! And all this is viewed as 
 past; because, starting from the past decree of "predestination to be 
 conformed to the image of God's Son" of which the other steps are but

 This whole passage, to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:34">Ro 8:34</A>,

 and even to the end of the chapter, strikes all thoughtful interpreters

 O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT> notices the "profound and colossal" 
 character of the thought.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>If God be for us, who can be against us?</B>--If God be

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that spared not</B>--"withheld not," "kept not back." This expressive
 phrase, as well as the whole thought, is suggested by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:12">Ge 22:12</A>,

 where Jehovah's touching commendation of Abraham's conduct regarding 
 his son Isaac seems designed to furnish something like a glimpse into 
 the spirit of His own act in <I>surrendering</I> His own Son. "Take now 
 (said the Lord to Abraham) thy <I>son,</I> thine <I>only, whom thou 
 lovest,</I> and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. offer him for a burnt offering"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:2">Ge 22:2</A>);

 and only when Abraham had all but performed that loftiest act of
 self-sacrifice, the Lord interposed, saying, "Now I know that thou 
 fearest God, seeing thou <FONT SIZE=-1>HAST NOT WITHHELD THY SON, THINE 
 ONLY SON</FONT>, from Me." In the light of this incident, then, and of 
 this language, our apostle can mean to convey nothing less than this, 
 that in "not sparing His own Son, but delivering Him up," or 
 surrendering Him, God exercised, in His <I>Paternal</I> character, a 
 mysterious act of <I>Self-sacrifice,</I> which, though involving none 
 of the <I>pain</I> and none of the <I>loss</I> which are inseparable 
 from the very idea of self-sacrifice on our part, was not less real, 
 but, on the contrary, as far transcended any such acts of ours as His 
 nature is above the creature's. But this is inconceivable if Christ be 
 not God's "own (or proper) Son," partaker of His very nature, as really 
 as Isaac was of his father Abraham's. In that sense, certainly, the 
 Jews charged our Lord with making Himself "equal with God" (see on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh5_18">Joh 5:18</A>), 

 which He in reply forthwith proceeded, not to disown, but to illustrate 
 and confirm. Understand Christ's Sonship thus, and the language of 
 Scripture regarding it is intelligible and harmonious; but take it to 
 be an <I>artificial</I> relationship, ascribed to Him in virtue either 
 of His miraculous birth, or His resurrection from the dead, or the 
 grandeur of His works, or all of these together--and the passages which 
 speak of it neither explain of themselves nor harmonize with each 
 other.

 <B>delivered him up</B>--not to <I>death</I> merely (as many take it), for
 that is too narrow an idea here, but "surrendered Him" in the most
 comprehensive sense; compare

 himself (see

 and see on

 <A HREF="JFB45.htm#Ro1_12">Ro 1:12</A>); 

 not meaning that the resurrection of Christ was of more saving value 
 than His death, but that having "put away sin by the sacrifice of 
 Himself"--which though precious to us was to Him of unmingled 
 bitterness--it was incomparably more delightful to think that He was 
 again <I>alive,</I> and living to see to the efficacy of His death in 
 our behalf.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>who is even</B>--"also"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>at the right hand of God</B>--The right hand of the king was anciently the
 seat of honor (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:25,1Ki+2:19,Ps+45:9">1Sa 20:25;

 and denoted participation in the royal power and glory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:21">Mt 20:21</A>).

 The classical writings contain similar allusions. Accordingly Christ's 
 sitting at the right hand of God--predicted in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps 110:1</A>,

 --signifies the <I>glory</I> of the exalted Son of man, and the
 <I>power</I> in the government of the world in which He participates. 
 Hence it is called "sitting on the right hand of <I>Power</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:64">Mt 26:64</A>),

 and "sitting on the right hand of the <I>Majesty</I> on high"

 <B>who also maketh intercession for us</B>--using all His boundless
 <I>interest</I> with God in our behalf. This is the top of the climax. "His
 <I>Session</I> at God's right hand denotes His <I>power</I> to save us; His
 <I>Intercession,</I> His <I>will</I> to do it"
 [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. 
 But how are we to conceive of this intercession? Not certainly as of
 one pleading "on bended knees and with outstretched arms," to use the
 expressive language of
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>.
 But yet, neither is it merely a figurative intimation that the power of
 Christ's redemption is continually operative
 [T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT>],
 or merely to show the fervor and vehemence of His love for us
 [C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT>].
 It cannot be taken to mean less than this: that the glorified Redeemer,
 conscious of His claims, expressly <I>signifies His will</I> that the 
 efficacy of His death should be made good to the uttermost, and 
 signifies it in some such royal style as we find Him employing in that 
 wonderful Intercessory Prayer which He spoke <I>as from within the 
 veil</I> (see on

 <A HREF="JFB43.htm#Joh17_11">Joh 17:11, 12</A>):

 "Father, I <FONT SIZE=-1>WILL</FONT> that they also whom Thou hast

 the chapter, which refer to the same subject. Nor would the other sense
 harmonize with the scope of the chapter, which is to exhibit the ample
 ground of the believer's confidence in Christ. "It is no ground of
 confidence to assert, or even to feel, that we will never forsake
 Christ; but it is the strongest ground of assurance to be convinced that
 His love will never change" [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>].

 (4) "As there is a beautiful harmony and necessary connection between 
 the several doctrines of grace, so must there be a like harmony in the 
 character of the Christian. He cannot experience the joy and confidence 
 flowing from his election without the humility which" the consideration 
 of its being gratuitous must produce; nor can he have the peace of one 
 who is justified without the holiness of one who is saved"

 [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>]. (5) However difficult it may be for 
 finite minds to comprehend the emotions of the Divine Mind, let us 
 never for a moment doubt that in "not sparing His own Son, but 
 delivering Him up for us all," God made a real sacrifice of all that 
 was dearest to His heart, and that in so doing He meant for ever to 
 assure His people that all other things which they need--inasmuch as 
 they are nothing to this stupendous gift, and indeed but the necessary 
 sequel of it--will in due time be forthcoming

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:32">Ro 8:32</A>).

 (6) In return for such a sacrifice on God's part, what can be 
 considered too great on ours? (7) If there could be any doubt as to the 
 meaning of the all-important word "J<FONT SIZE=-1>USTIFICATION</FONT>" 
 in this Epistle--whether, as the Church of Rome teaches, and many 
 others affirm, it means "<I>infusing</I> righteousness into the unholy, 
 so as to <I>make</I> them righteous," or, according to Protestant 
 teaching, "<I>absolving, acquitting,</I> or <I>pronouncing 
 righteous</I> the guilty"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:33">Ro 8:33</A>

 ought to set such doubt entirely at rest. For the apostle's question in 
 this verse is, "Who shall <I>bring a charge against</I> God's elect?" 
 In other words, "Who shall <I>pronounce</I>" or "<I>hold them 
 guilty?</I>" seeing that "God <I>justifies</I>" them: showing beyond 
 all doubt, that to "justify" was intended to express precisely the 
 opposite of "holding guilty"; and consequently (as C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT> triumphantly argues) that it means "<I>to absolve 
 from the charge of guilt.</I>" (8) If there could be any reasonable 
 doubt in what light the <I>death</I> of Christ is to be regarded in 
 this Epistle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:34">Ro 8:34</A>

 ought to set that doubt entirely at rest.  For there the apostle's 
 question is, Who shall "<I>condemn</I>" God's elect, since "Christ 
 <I>died</I>" for them; showing beyond all doubt (as P<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>HILIPPI</FONT> justly argues) that it was the <I>expiatory</I> 
 (character of that death which the apostle had in view).  (9) What an 
 affecting view of the love of Christ does it give us to learn that His 
 greatest <I>nearness</I> to God and most powerful <I>interest</I> with 
 Him--as "seated on His right hand"--is employed in behalf of His people 
 here below

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:34">Ro 8:34</A>)!

 (10) "The whole universe, with all that it contains, so far as it is 
 good, is the friend and ally of the Christian; and, so far as it is 
 evil, is more than a conquered foe"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:35-39">Ro 8:35-39</A>)

 (11) Are we who "have tasted that the Lord is gracious," both "kept by

 and embraced in the arms of Invincible <I>Love?</I> Then surely, while 
 "building ourselves up on our most holy faith," and "praying in the 
 Holy Ghost," only the more should we feel constrained to "<I>keep 
 ourselves in the love of God,</I> looking for the mercy of our Lord 
 Jesus Christ unto eternal life"

 vanish, and we shall be reminded of the similar idea so nobly expressed

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>blessed for ever. Amen</B>--To get rid of the bright testimony here borne
 to the supreme divinity of Christ, various expedients have been adopted:
 (1) To place a period, either after the words "concerning the flesh
 Christ came," rendering the next clause as a doxology to the
 Father--"God who is over all be blessed for ever"; or after the word
 "all"--thus, "Christ came, who is over all: God be blessed.", &c.
 [E<FONT SIZE=-1>RASMUS</FONT>,
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>OCKE</FONT>,
 F<FONT SIZE=-1>RITZSCHE</FONT>,
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>EYER</FONT>,
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OWETT</FONT>, &c.]. But it is fatal to
 this view, as even <I>Socinus</I> admits, that in other Scripture
 doxologies the word "Blessed" <I>precedes</I> the name of God on whom the
 blessing is invoked (thus: "Blessed be God,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:35">Ps 68:35</A>;

 "Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:18">Ps 72:18</A>).

 Besides, any such doxology here would be "unmeaning and frigid in the 
 extreme"; the sad subject on which he was entering suggesting anything 
 but a doxology, even in connection with Christ's Incarnation [A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>].  (2) To transpose the words rendered "who is"; 
 in which case the rendering would be, "whose (that is, the fathers') is 
 Christ according to the flesh" [C<FONT SIZE=-1>RELLIUS</FONT>, W<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>HISTON</FONT>, T<FONT SIZE=-1>AYLOR</FONT>, W<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>HITBY</FONT>]. But this is a desperate expedient, in the face 
 of all manuscript authority; as is also the conjecture of G<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT> and others, that the word "God" should be omitted 
 from the text.  It remains then, that we have here no doxology at all, 
 but a naked statement of fact, that while Christ is "of" the 
 Israelitish nation "<I>as concerning the flesh,</I>" He is, <I>in 
 another respect,</I> "God over all, blessed for ever." (In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:31">2Co 11:31</A>

 the very <I>Greek</I> phrase which is here rendered "who is," is used 
 in the same sense; and compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:25">Ro 1:25</A>,

 <I>Greek</I>). In this view of the passage, as a testimony to the 
 supreme divinity of Christ, besides all the orthodox fathers, some of 
 the ablest modern critics concur [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>, T<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT>, S<FONT SIZE=-1>TUART</FONT>, O<FONT

 <B>6. Not as though the word of God had taken none effect</B>--"hath fallen
 to the ground," that is, failed: compare

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for they are not all Israel which are of Israel</B>--better, "for not
 all they which are of Israel are Israel."
 <I>Here the apostle enters upon the profound subject of</I>
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>LECTION</FONT>, the
 treatment of which extends to the end of the eleventh chapter--"Think
 not that I mourn over the total loss of Israel; for that would involve
 the failure of God's word to Abraham; but not all that belong to the
 natural seed, and go under the name of 'Israel,' are <I>the</I> Israel of
 God's irrevocable choice." The difficulties which encompass this
 subject lie not in the apostle's teaching, which is plain enough, but
 in the truths themselves, the evidence for which, taken by themselves,
 is overwhelming, but whose perfect harmony is beyond human
 comprehension in the present state. The great source of error here lies
 in hastily inferring (as T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT> and others), from the apostle's taking
 tip, at the close of this chapter, the calling of the Gentiles in
 connection with the rejection of Israel, and continuing this subject
 through the two next chapters, that the Election treated of in the body
 of this chapter is <I>national,</I> not <I>personal</I> Election, and
 consequently is Election merely to <I>religious advantages,</I> not to
 <I>eternal salvation.</I> In that case, the argument of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:6">Ro 9:6</A>,

 with which the subject of Election opens, would be this: "The choice of 
 Abraham and his seed has not failed; because though Israel has been 
 rejected, <I>the Gentiles</I> have taken their place; and God has a 
 right to choose what nation He will to the privileges of His visible 
 kingdom." But so far from this, the Gentiles are not so much as 
 mentioned at all till towards the close of the chapter; and the 
 argument of this verse is, that "all Israel <I>is not</I> rejected, but 
 only a portion of it, the remainder being <I>the</I> 'Israel' whom God 
 has chosen in the exercise of His sovereign right." And that this is a 
 choice not to mere external privileges, but to eternal salvation, will 
 abundantly appear from what follows.</P>

 children, would be included, which they were not."

 Sarah, as being Abraham's true and first wife, both to the child of
 Hagar, Sarah's maid, and to the children of Keturah, his second wife.
 But there could be no such reason in the case of Rebecca, Isaac's only
 wife; for the choice of her son Jacob was the choice of one of two sons
 by the same mother and of the younger in preference to the elder, and
 before either of them was born, and consequently before either had done
 good or evil to be a ground of preference: and all to show that the
 sole ground of distinction lay in the unconditional choice of
 God--"<I>not of works, but of Him that calleth.</I>"</P>

 "<I>This doctrine is incompatible with human responsibility</I>"; If God
 chooses and rejects, pardons and punishes, whom He pleases, why are
 those blamed who, if rejected by Him, cannot help sinning and perishing?
 This objection shows quite as conclusively as the former the real nature
 of the doctrine objected to--that it is Election and Non-election to
 eternal salvation prior to any difference of personal character; this is
 the only doctrine that could suggest the objection here stated, and to
 this doctrine the objection <I>is</I> plausible. What now is the apostle's
 answer? It is twofold. <I>First:</I> "It is irreverence and presumption in
 the creature to arraign the Creator."</P>

 <B>21. Hath not the potter power over the clay; of the same lump to make
 one vessel unto honour, and another to dishonour?</B>--"The objection is
 founded on ignorance or misapprehension of the relation between God and
 His sinful creatures; supposing that He is under obligation to extend
 His grace to all, whereas He is under obligation to none. All are
 sinners, and have forfeited every claim to His mercy; it is therefore
 perfectly competent to God to spare one and not another, to make one
 vessel to honor and another to dishonor. But it is to be borne in mind
 that Paul does not here speak of God's right over His creatures
 <I>as creatures,</I> but <I>as sinful creatures:</I> as he himself clearly
 intimates in the next verses. It is the cavil of a sinful creature
 against his Creator that he is answering, and be does so by showing that
 God is under no obligation to give His grace to any, but is as sovereign
 as in fashioning the clay" [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>].

 <B>fitted for destruction</B>--It is well remarked by S<FONT SIZE=-1>TUART</FONT>
 that the
 "difficulties which such statements involve are not to be got rid of by
 softening the language of one text, while so many others meet us which
 are of the same tenor; and even if we give up the Bible itself, so long
 as we acknowledge an omnipotent and omniscient God we cannot abate in
 the least degree from any of the difficulties which such texts make." Be
 it observed, however, that if God, as the apostle teaches, expressly
 "designed to manifest His wrath, and to make His power (in the way of
 wrath) known," it could only be by punishing some, while He pardons
 others; and if the choice between the two classes was not to be founded,
 as our apostle also teaches, on their own doings but on God's good
 pleasure, the decision behooved ultimately to rest with God. Yet, even
 in the necessary punishment of the wicked, as H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT> observes, so far
 from proceeding with undue severity, the apostle would have it remarked
 that God "endures with much long-suffering" those objects of His
 righteous displeasure.</P>

 of the Gentiles is introduced;</I> all before having respect, not
 to the substitution of the called Gentiles for the rejected Jews, but to
 the choice of one portion and the rejection of another of the same
 Israel. Had Israel's rejection been total, God's promise to Abraham
 would <I>not</I> have been fulfilled by the substitution of the Gentiles in
 their room; but Israel's rejection being only partial, the preservation
 of a "remnant," in which the promise was made good, was but "according
 to the election of grace." And now, for the first time, the apostle
 tells us that along with this elect remnant of <I>Israel,</I> it is God's
 purpose to "take out of the <I>Gentiles</I> a people for His name"

 a passage relating immediately, not to the heathen, but to the kingdom

 who were "not God's people," and in that sense "not beloved," the

 apostle may seem to differ from that intended by the prophet. But the 
 sameness of sentiment in both places will at once appear, if we 
 understand those words of the prophet, "the consumption decreed shall 
 overflow with righteousness," to mean that while a remnant of Israel 
 should be graciously spared to return from captivity, "the decreed 
 consumption" of the impenitent majority should be "replete with 
 righteousness," or illustriously display God's righteous vengeance 
 against sin. The "short reckoning" seems to mean the speedy completing 
 of His word, both in cutting off the one portion and saving the 
 other.</P>

 seen that "the righteousness of faith" is the righteousness which

 <B>Behold,</B> &c.--Two Messianic predictions are here combined, as is not
 unusual in quotations from the Old Testament. Thus combined, the
 prediction brings together both the classes of whom the apostle is
 treating: those to whom Messiah should be only a stone of stumbling, and
 those who were to regard Him as the Cornerstone of all their hopes. Thus
 expounded, this chapter presents no serious difficulties, none which do
 not arise out of the subject itself, whose depths are unfathomable;
 whereas on every other view of it the difficulty of giving it any
 consistent and worthy interpretation is in our judgment insuperable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Note,</I> (1) To speak and act "in Christ," with a conscience not
 only illuminated, but under the present operation of the Holy Ghost, is
 not peculiar to the supernaturally inspired, but is the privilege, and
 ought to be the aim, of every believer 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:1">Ro 9:1</A>).

 (2) Grace does not destroy, but only intensify and elevate, the 
 feelings of nature; and Christians should study to show this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:2,3">Ro 9:2, 3</A>).

 (3) To belong to the visible Church of God, and enjoy its high and holy 
 distinctions, is of the sovereign mercy of God, and should be regarded 
 with devout thankfulness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4,5">Ro 9:4, 5</A>).

 (4) Yet the most sacred external distinctions and privileges will avail 
 nothing to salvation without the heart's submission to the 
 righteousness of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:31-33">Ro 9:31-33</A>).

 (5) What manner of persons ought "God's elect" to be--in 
 <I>humility,</I> when they remember that He hath saved them and called 
 them, not according to their works, but according to His own purpose 
 and grace, given them in Christ Jesus before the world began

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:9">2Ti 1:9</A>);

 in <I>thankfulness,</I> for "Who maketh thee to differ, and what hast 
 thou that thou didst not receive?"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:7">1Co 4:7</A>);

 in <I>godly jealousy</I> over themselves; remembering that "God is not 
 mocked," but "whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:7">Ga 6:7</A>);

 in <I>diligence</I> "to make our calling and election sure"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:10">2Pe 1:10</A>);

 and yet in calm <I>confidence</I> that "whom God predestinates, and 
 calls, and justifies, them (in due time) He also glorifies"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:30">Ro 8:30</A>).

 (6) On all subjects which from their very nature lie beyond human 
 comprehension, it will be our wisdom to set down what God says in His 
 word, and has actually done in His procedure towards men, as 
 indisputable, even though it contradict the results at which in the 
 best exercise of our limited judgment we may have arrived

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:14-23">Ro 9:14-23</A>).

 (7) Sincerity in religion, or a general desire to be saved, with 
 assiduous efforts to do right, will prove fatal as a ground of 
 confidence before God, if unaccompanied by implicit submission to His 
 revealed method of salvation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:31-33">Ro 9:31-33</A>).

 (8) In the rejection of the great mass of the chosen people, and the 
 inbringing of multitudes of estranged Gentiles, God would have men to 
 see a law of His procedure, which the judgment of the great day will 
 more vividly reveal that "the last shall be first and the first last"

 <B>and in thine heart</B>--when thou believest on Him. Though it is of
 <I>the law</I> which Moses more immediately speaks in the passage quoted,
 yet it is of the law as Israel shall be brought to look upon it when the
 Lord their God shall circumcise their heart "to love the Lord their God
 with all their heart" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:6">Ro 10:6</A>);

 and thus, in applying it, the apostle (as 
 O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT> 
 truly observes) is not merely appropriating the language of Moses, but
 keeping in the line of his deeper thought.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>that is, the word of faith, which we preach</B>--that is, the word which
 men have to believe for salvation (compare

 <A NAME="Ro10_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>9. That if thou shalt,</B> &c.--So understanding the words, the apostle
 is here giving the language of the true method of justification; and
 this sense we prefer (with C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>,
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>EZA</FONT>,
 F<FONT SIZE=-1>ERME</FONT>,
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>OCKE</FONT>,

 confirming the foregoing statements as to the simplicity of the gospel
 method of salvation.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus</B>--that is, probably, "If thou
 shalt confess Jesus [to be] the Lord," which is the proper manifestation
 or evidence of faith 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:32,1Jo+4:15">Mt 10:32;

 This is put first merely to correspond with the foregoing
 quotation--"in thy mouth and in thine heart." So in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10">1Pe 1:10</A>

 the "calling of believers" is put before their "election," as that 
 which is first "made sure," although in point of time it comes after 
 it.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised</B>--"that God
 raised"

 Whether the apostle quoted them as in their primary intention
 applicable to his subject (as O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>, A<FONT

 express his own ideas, as is done involuntarily almost by every

 not agreed. But though the latter may seem the more natural since "the 
 rising of the Sun of righteousness upon the world"

 must have been familiar and delightful to the apostle's ear, we cannot
 doubt that the irradiation of the world with the beams of a better Sun 
 by the universal diffusion of the Gospel of Christ, must have a mode of 
 speaking quite natural, and to him scarcely figurative.</P>

 <A NAME="Ro10_19"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>19. But I say, Did not Israel know?</B>--know, from their own Scriptures,
 of God's intention to bring in the Gentiles?

 <B>First</B>--that is First in the prophetic line [D<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT>
 W<FONT SIZE=-1>ETTE</FONT>].

 <B>Moses saith,</B> &c.--"I will provoke you to jealousy ('against') [them

 I anger you" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:21">De 32:21</A>).

 In this verse God warns His ancient people that because they had (that 
 is, in aftertimes would) moved Him to jealousy with their "no-gods," 
 and provoked Him to anger with their vanities, He in requital would 
 move them to jealousy by receiving into His favor a "no-people," and 
 provoke them to anger by adopting a nation void of understanding.</P>

 words of the prophet 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1">Isa 65:1</A>)

 <B>my hands</B>--the attitude of gracious entreaty.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>unto a disobedient and gainsaying people</B>--These words, which
 immediately follow the announcement just quoted of the calling of the
 Gentiles, were enough to forewarn the Jews both of God's purpose to
 eject them from their privileges, in favor of the Gentiles, and of the
 cause of it on their own part.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Note,</I> (1) Mere sincerity, and even earnestness in
 religion--though it may be some ground of hope for a merciful recovery
 from error--is no excuse, and will not compensate, for the deliberate
 rejection of saving truth, when in the providence of God presented for
 acceptance 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:1-3">Ro 10:1-3</A>;

 and see on

 <A HREF="#Ro9_7">Ro 9:7</A>, 

 <I>Note</I> 7). (2) The true cause of such rejection of saving truth, 
 by the otherwise sincere, is the prepossession of the mind by some 
 false notions of its own. So long as the Jews "sought to set up their 
 own righteousness," it was in the nature of things impossible that they 
 should "submit themselves to the righteousness of God"; the one of 
 these two methods of acceptance being in the teeth of the other

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:3">Ro 10:3</A>).

 (3) The essential terms of salvation have in every age been the same: 
 "Whosoever will" is invited to "take of the water of life freely," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:17">Re 22:17</A>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:13">Ro 10:13</A>).

 (4) How will the remembrance of the simplicity, reasonableness, and 
 absolute freeness of God's plan of salvation overwhelm those that 
 perish from under the sound of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:4-13">Ro 10:4-13</A>).

 (5) How piercingly and perpetually should that question--"H<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>OW SHALL THEY HEAR WITHOUT A PREACHER</FONT>?"--sound in the 
 ears of all churches, as but the apostolic echo of their Lord's parting 
 injunction, "P<FONT SIZE=-1>REACH THE</FONT> G<FONT SIZE=-1>OSPEL TO 
 EVERY CREATURE</FONT>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:15">Mr 16:15</A>),

 and how far below the proper standard of love, zeal, and self-sacrifice
 must the churches as yet be, when with so plenteous a harvest the 
 laborers are yet so few

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:37,38">Mt 9:37, 38</A>),

 and that cry from the lips of pardoned, gifted, consecrated men--"Here 
 am I, send me"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:8">Isa 6:8</A>),
 
 is not heard everywhere

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:14,15">Ro 10:14, 15</A>)!

 (6) The blessing of a covenant relation to God is the irrevocable 
 privilege of no people and no Church; it can be preserved only by 
 fidelity, on our part, to the covenant itself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:19">Ro 10:19</A>).

 (7) God is often found by those who apparently are the farthest from 
 Him, while He remains undiscovered by those who think themselves the 
 nearest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:20,21">Ro 10:20, 21</A>).

 (8) God's dealings even with reprobate sinners are full of tenderness 
 and compassion; all the day long extending the arms of His mercy even 
 to the disobedient and gainsaying. This will be felt and acknowledged 
 at last by all who perish, to the glory of God's forbearance and to 
 their own confusion

 he in his despondency concluded it to be, so now, the rejection of
 Christ by Israel is not so appalling in extent as one would be apt to
 think: There is now, as there was then, a faithful remnant; not however
 of persons naturally better than the unbelieving mass, but of persons
 graciously chosen to salvation." (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:7,2Th+2:13">1Co 4:7;
 2Th 2:13</A>). 

 This establishes our view of the argument on Election in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:1-29">Ro 9:1-29</A>,

 as not being an election of Gentiles in the place of Jews, and merely 
 to religious advantages, but a sovereign choice of some of Israel 
 itself, from among others, to believe and be saved.  (See on

 <B>6. And,</B> &c.--better, "Now if it (the election) be by grace, it 
 is no more of works; for [then] grace becomes no more grace: but if it 
 be of works," &c. (The authority of ancient manuscripts against this 
 latter clause, as superfluous and not originally in the text, though 
 strong, is not sufficient, we think, to justify its exclusion. Such 
 seeming redundancies are not unusual with our apostle). The general 
 position here laid down is of vital importance: That there are but two 
 possible sources of salvation--men's works, and God's grace; and that 
 these are so essentially distinct and opposite, that salvation cannot

 it--which all who have ever labored for the conversion of the Jews are
 made depressingly to feel. That intelligent expositors should think that
 this was meant of <I>individual</I> Jews, reintroduced from time to time
 into the family of God on their believing on the Lord Jesus, is
 surprising; and yet those who deny the <I>national</I> recovery of Israel
 must and do so interpret the apostle. But this is to confound the two
 things which the apostle carefully distinguishes. Individual Jews have
 been at all times admissible, and have been admitted, to the Church
 through the gate of faith in the Lord Jesus. This is the "remnant,
 <I>even at this present time,</I> according to the election of grace," of
 which the apostle, in the first part of the chapter, had cited himself
 as one. But here he manifestly speaks of something <I>not</I> then
 existing, but to be looked forward to as a great future event in the
 economy of God, the reingrafting of <I>the nation as such,</I> when they
 "abide not in unbelief." And though this is here spoken of merely as a
 supposition (if their unbelief shall cease)--in order to set it over
 against the other supposition, of what will happen to the Gentiles if
 they shall not abide in the faith--the supposition is turned into an
 explicit prediction in the verses following.</P>

 the apostle seems to speak of the receiving of Israel, not as

 is to do manifest violence both to it and to the whole context. It can

 <B>turn away ungodliness from Jacob</B>--The apostle, having drawn his
 illustrations of man's <I>sinfulness</I> chiefly from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:1-7,Isa+59:1-21">Ps 14:1-7
 and Isa 59:1-21</A>,

 now seems to combine the language of the same two places regarding
 Israel's <I>salvation</I> from it [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. In the
 one place the Psalmist longs to see the "salvation of Israel coming 
 <I>out of Zion</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:7">Ps 14:7</A>);

 in the other, the prophet announces that "the Redeemer (or, 
 'Deliverer') shall come <I>to</I> (or '<I>for</I>') Zion"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:20">Isa 59:20</A>).

 But as all the glorious manifestations of Israel's God were regarded as 
 issuing out of Zion, as the seat of His manifested glory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:2,110:2,Isa+31:9">Ps 20:2; 110:2;
 Isa 31:9</A>), 

 the turn which the apostle gives to the words merely adds to them that
 familiar idea. And whereas the prophet announces that He "shall come 
 <I>to</I> (or, '<I>for</I>') them that turn from transgression in 
 Jacob," while the apostle makes Him say that He shall come "to turn 
 away ungodliness <I>from</I> Jacob," this is taken from the 
 <I>Septuagint</I> version, and seems to indicate a different reading of 
 the original text. The sense, however, is substantially the same in 
 both. <I>Second,</I></P>

 than the express words of any prediction, Those who believe that there 
 are no predictions regarding the literal Israel in the Old Testament, 
 that stretch beyond the end of the Jewish economy, are obliged to view

 <B>of God are without repentance</B>--"not to be," or "cannot be repented of."
 By the "<I>calling</I> of God," in this case, is meant that sovereign act
 by which God, in the exercise of His free choice, "called" Abraham to be
 the father of a peculiar people; while "the <I>gifts</I> of God" here
 denote the articles of the covenant which God made with Abraham, and
 which constituted the real distinction between his and all other
 families of the earth. Both these, says the apostle, are irrevocable;
 and as the point for which he refers to this at all is the
 <I>final destiny</I> of the Israelitish nation, it is clear that
 <I>the perpetuity through all time of the Abrahamic covenant</I> is the
 thing here affirmed. And lest any should say that though Israel,
 <I>as a nation,</I> has no destiny at all under the Gospel, but as a people
 disappeared from the stage when the middle wall of partition was broken
 down, yet the Abrahamic covenant still endures in the <I>spiritual</I> seed
 of Abraham, made up of Jews and Gentiles in one undistinguished mass of
 redeemed men under the Gospel--the apostle, as if to preclude that
 supposition, expressly states that the very Israel who, as concerning
 the Gospel, are regarded as "enemies for the Gentiles' sakes," are
 "<I>beloved for the fathers' sakes</I>"; and it is in proof of this that he
 adds, "For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance." But
 in what sense are the now unbelieving and excluded children of Israel
 "beloved for the fathers' sakes?" Not merely from ancestral
 <I>recollections,</I> as one looks with fond interest on the child of a
 dear friend for that friend's sake [D<FONT SIZE=-1>R</FONT>.
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>RNOLD</FONT>]--a beautiful thought,
 and not foreign to Scripture, in this very matter (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:7,Isa+41:8">2Ch 20:7;
 Isa 41:8</A>)

 --but it is from ancestral <I>connections</I> and <I>obligations,</I>
 or their lineal descent from and oneness in covenant with the fathers 
 with whom God originally established it. In other words, the natural 
 Israel--not "the <I>remnant</I> of them according to the election of 
 grace," but <FONT SIZE=-1>THE NATION</FONT>, sprung from Abraham 
 according to the flesh--are still an elect people, and as such, 
 "beloved." The very same love which chose the fathers, and rested on 
 the fathers as a parent stem of the nation, still rests on their 
 descendants at large, and will yet recover them from unbelief, and 
 reinstate them in the family of God.</P>

 <B>they also may obtain mercy</B>--Here is an entirely new idea. The apostle
 has hitherto dwelt upon the unbelief of the Jews as making way for the
 faith of the Gentiles--the exclusion of the one occasioning the
 reception of the other; a truth yielding to generous, believing Gentiles
 but mingled satisfaction. Now, opening a more cheering prospect, he
 speaks of the mercy shown to the Gentiles as a means of Israel's
 recovery; which seems to mean that it will be by the instrumentality of
 believing Gentiles that Israel as a nation is at length to "look on Him
 whom they have pierced and mourn for Him," and so to "obtain mercy."

 Certainly it is not "all mankind individually" [M<FONT SIZE=-1>EYER</FONT>,
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]; for the
 apostle is not here dealing with individuals, but with those great
 divisions of mankind, Jew and Gentile. And what he here says is that
 God's purpose was to shut each of these divisions of men to the
 experience first of an humbled, condemned state, without Christ, and
 then to the experience of His mercy in Christ.</P>

 sketched out.

 <B>of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God</B>--Many able

 <I>Revised Version</I>]. The words will certainly
 bear this sense, "the depth of God's riches." But "the riches of God" is
 a much rarer expression with our apostle than the riches of this or that
 perfection of God; and the words immediately following limit our
 attention to the unsearchableness of God's "<I>judgments,</I>" which
 probably means His decrees or plans 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:75">Ps 119:75</A>),

 and of "His <I>ways,</I>" or the method by which He carries these into 
 effect. (So L<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHER</FONT>, C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>, 
 B<FONT SIZE=-1>EZA</FONT>, H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>, &c.). Besides, 
 all that follows to the end of the chapter seems to show that while the 
 <I>Grace</I> of God to guilty men in Christ Jesus is presupposed to be 
 the whole theme of this chapter, that which called forth the special 
 admiration of the apostle, after sketching at some length the divine 
 purposes and methods in the bestowment of this grace, was "the depth of 
 the riches of God's <I>wisdom and knowledge</I>" in these purposes and 
 methods. The "knowledge," then, points probably to the vast sweep of 
 divine comprehension herein displayed; the "wisdom" to that fitness to 
 accomplish the ends intended, which is stamped on all this 
 procedure.</P>

 These questions, it will thus be seen, are just quotations from the Old
 Testament, as if to show how familiar to God's ancient people was the 
 great truth which the apostle himself had just uttered, that God's 
 plans and methods in the dispensation of His Grace have a reach of 
 comprehension and wisdom stamped upon them which finite mortals cannot 
 fathom, much less could ever have imagined, before they were 
 disclosed.</P>

 by its sublimity--does the apostle here sum up this whole matter.
 "O<FONT SIZE=-1>F</FONT>
 Him are all things," as their eternal Source: "<FONT SIZE=-1>THROUGH</FONT>
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>IM</FONT> are all
 things," inasmuch as He brings all to pass which in His eternal counsels
 He purposed: "To Him are all things," as being His own last End; the

 last.</P>

 On this rich chapter, <I>Note,</I> (1) It is an unspeakable consolation
 to know that in times of deepest religious declension and most extensive
 defection from the truth, the lamp of God has never been permitted to go
 out, and that a faithful remnant has ever existed--a remnant larger than
 their own drooping spirits could easily believe 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1-5">Ro 11:1-5</A>).

 (2) The preservation of this remnant, even as their separation at the 
 first, is all of mere grace

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:5,6">Ro 11:5, 6</A>).

 (3) When individuals and communities, after many fruitless warnings, 
 are abandoned of God, they go from bad to worse

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:7-10">Ro 11:7-10</A>).

 (4) God has so ordered His dealings with the great divisions of 
 mankind, "that no flesh should glory in His presence." Gentile and Jew 
 have each in turn been "shut up to unbelief," that each in turn may 
 experience the "mercy" which saves the chief of sinners

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:11-32">Ro 11:11-32</A>).

 (5) As we are "justified by faith," so are we "kept by the power of God 
 through faith"--faith alone--unto salvation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:20-32">Ro 11:20-32</A>).

 (6) God's covenant with Abraham and his natural seed is a perpetual 
 covenant, in equal force under the Gospel as before it. Therefore it 
 is, that the Jews as a nation still survive, in spite of all the laws 
 which, in similar circumstances, have either extinguished or destroyed 
 the identity of other nations. And therefore it is that the Jews as a 
 nation will yet be restored to the family of God, through the 
 subjection of their proud hearts to Him whom they have pierced. And as 
 believing Gentiles will be honored to be the instruments of this 
 stupendous change, so shall the vast Gentile world reap such benefit 
 from it, that it shall be like the communication of life to them from 
 the dead. (7) Thus has the Christian Church the highest motive to the 
 establishment and vigorous prosecution of <I>missions to the Jews;</I> 
 God having not only promised that there shall be a remnant of them 
 gathered in every age, but pledged Himself to the final ingathering of 
 the whole nation assigned the honor of that ingathering to the Gentile 
 Church, and assured them that the event, when it does arrive, shall 
 have a life-giving effect upon the whole world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:12-16,26-31">Ro 11:12-16, 26-31</A>).

 (8) Those who think that in all the evangelical prophecies of the Old
 Testament the terms "Jacob," "Israel," &c., are to be understood solely 
 of <I>the Christian Church,</I> would appear to read the Old Testament 
 differently from the apostle, who, from the use of those very terms in 
 Old Testament prophecy, draws arguments to prove that God has mercy in 
 store for <I>the natural Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:26,27">Ro 11:26, 27</A>).

 (9) Mere intellectual investigations into divine truth in general, and 
 the sense of the living oracles in particular, as they have a hardening 
 effect, so they are a great contrast to the spirit of our apostle, 
 whose lengthened sketch of God's majestic procedure towards men in 
 Christ Jesus ends here in a burst of <I>admiration,</I> which loses 
 itself in the still loftier frame of <I>adoration</I>

 The doctrinal teaching of this Epistle is now followed up by a series of
 exhortations to practical duty. And <I>first,</I> the all-comprehensive
 duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. I beseech you therefore</B>--in view of all that has been advanced in
 the foregoing part of this Epistle.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>by the mercies of God</B>--those mercies, whose free and unmerited nature,
 glorious Channel, and saving fruits have been opened up at such length.

 <B>that ye present</B>--See on

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>your bodies</B>--that is, "yourselves in the body," considered as the organ
 of the inner life. As it is through the body that all the evil that is
 in the unrenewed heart comes forth into palpable manifestation and
 action, so it is through the body that all the gracious principles and
 affections of believers reveal themselves in the outward life.
 Sanctification extends to the whole man 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:23,24">1Th 5:23, 24</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>a living sacrifice</B>--in glorious contrast to the legal sacrifices,
 which, save as they were <I>slain,</I> were no sacrifices at all. The
 death of the one "Lamb of God, taking away the sin of the world," has
 swept all dead victims from off the altar of God, to make room for the
 redeemed themselves as "living sacrifices" to Him who made "Him to be
 sin for us"; while every outgoing of their grateful hearts in praise,
 and every act prompted by the love of Christ, is itself a sacrifice to
 God of a sweet-smelling savor 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15,16">Heb 13:15, 16</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>holy</B>--As the Levitical victims, when offered without blemish to God,
 were regarded as holy, so believers, "yielding themselves to God as
 those that are alive from the dead, and their members as instruments of
 righteousness unto God," are, in His estimation, not ritually but really
 "holy," and so

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>acceptable</B>--"well-pleasing"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>unto God</B>--not as the Levitical offerings, merely as appointed symbols
 of spiritual ideas, but objects, intrinsically, of divine complacency,
 in their renewed character, and endeared relationship to Him through His
 Son Jesus Christ.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which is your reasonable</B>--rather, "rational"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>service</B>--in contrast, not to the senselessness of idol-worship, 
 but to the offering of irrational victims under the law. In this view 
 the presentation of ourselves, as living monuments of redeeming mercy, 
 is here called "our rational service"; and surely it is the most
 rational and exalted occupation of God's reasonable creatures. So

 makes the whole life new--new in its motives and ends, even where the
 actions differ in nothing from those of the world--new, considered as a
 whole, and in such a sense as to be wholly unattainable save through the
 constraining power of the love of Christ.

 it is "<I>well pleasing,</I>" in contrast with all that is arbitrary,

 and it is "<I>perfect,</I>" as it required nothing else than the
 perfection of God's reasonable creature, who, in proportion as he 
 attains to it, reflects God's own perfection. Such then is the great 
 general duty of the redeemed--<FONT SIZE=-1>SELF-CONSECRATION</FONT>, 
 in our whole spirit and soul and body to Him who hath called us into 
 the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ.  Next follow specific duties,

 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>]. This is merely a strong way of characterizing all undue
 self-elevation.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith</B>--Faith
 is here viewed as the inlet to all the other graces, and so, as the

 Anyone speaking with divine authority--whether with reference to the

 B<FONT SIZE=-1>EZA</FONT> and
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>), render this "the
 analogy of faith," understanding by it "the general tenor" or "rule of
 faith," divinely delivered to men for their guidance. But this is
 against the context, whose object is to show that, as all the gifts of
 believers are according to their respective capacity for them, they are
 not to be puffed up on account of them, but to use them purely for their
 proper ends.</P>

 the dispensing of the word of life

 to the administering of the temporal affairs of the Church

 The latter seems intended here, being distinguished from "prophesying," 
 "teaching," and "exhorting."

 Probably it consisted mainly in opening up the evangelical bearings of
 Old Testament Scripture; and it was in this department apparently that 
 Apollos showed his power and eloquence

 the brethren, generally, or small parties of the less instructed, the 
 reference may be to them.

 heathen world! and though Christianity has so changed the spirit of
 society, that a certain beautiful disinterestedness and self-sacrifice
 shines in the character of not a few who are but partially, if at all

 the verbs of the original: "In hope, rejoicing; in tribulation,
 enduring; in prayer, persevering." Each of these exercises helps the
 other. If our "hope" of glory is so assured that it is a rejoicing hope,
 we shall find the spirit of "endurance in tribulation" natural and easy;
 but since it is "prayer" which strengthens the faith that begets hope
 and lifts it up into an assured and joyful expectancy, and since our
 patience in tribulation is fed by this, it will be seen that all depends
 on our "perseverance in prayer."</P>

 charming phase of the unselfish character which belongs to all living
 Christianity. What a world will ours be when this shall become its
 reigning spirit! Of the two, however, it is more easy to sympathize with
 another's sorrows than his joys, because in the one case he <I>needs</I> us;

 <I>Note,</I> (1) The redeeming mercy of God in Christ is, in the souls
 of believers, the living spring of all holy obedience 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1">Ro 12:1</A>).

 (2) As redemption under the Gospel is not by irrational victims, as 
 under the law, but "by the precious blood of Christ"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:18,19">1Pe 1:18, 19</A>),

 and, consequently, is not ritual but real, so the sacrifices which 
 believers are now called to offer are all "living sacrifices"; and 
 these--summed up in self-consecration to the service of God--are "holy 
 and acceptable to God," making up together "our rational service"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1">Ro 12:1</A>).

 (3) In this light, what are we to think of the so-called "unbloody 
 sacrifice of the mass, continually offered to God as a propitiation for 
 the sins both of the living and the dead," which the adherents of 
 Rome's corrupt faith have been taught for ages to believe is the 
 highest and holiest act of Christian worship--in direct opposition to 
 the sublimely simple teaching which the Christians of Rome first 
 received

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1">Ro 12:1</A>)

 --(4) Christians should not feel themselves at liberty to be conformed 
 to the world, if only they avoid what is manifestly sinful; but rather, 
 yielding themselves to the transforming power of the truth as it is in 
 Jesus, they should strive to exhibit before the world an entire 
 renovation of heart and life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:2">Ro 12:2</A>).

 (5) What God would have men to be, in all its beauty and grandeur, is 
 for the first time really apprehended, when "written not with ink, but 
 with the Spirit of the living God, not on tables of stone, but on the 
 fleshy tables of the heart,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:3">2Co 3:3</A>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:2">Ro 12:2</A>).

 (6) Self-sufficiency and lust of power are peculiarly unlovely in the 
 vessels of mercy, whose respective graces and gifts are all a divine 
 trust for the benefit of the common body and of mankind at large

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:3,4">Ro 12:3, 4</A>).

 (7) As forgetfulness of this has been the source of innumerable and 
 unspeakable evils in the Church of Christ, so the faithful exercise by 
 every Christian of his own peculiar office and gifts, and the loving 
 recognition of those of his brethren, as all of equal importance in 
 their own place, would put a new face upon the visible Church, to the 
 vast benefit and comfort of Christians themselves and to the admiration 
 of the world around them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:6-8">Ro 12:6-8</A>).

 (8) What would the world be, if it were filled with Christians having 
 but one object in life, high above every other--to "serve the 
 Lord"--and throwing into this service "alacrity" in the discharge of 
 all duties, and abiding "warmth of spirit"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:11">Ro 12:11</A>)!

 (9) Oh, how far is even the living Church from exhibiting the whole 
 character and spirit, so beautifully portrayed in the latter verses of 
 this chapter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:12-21">Ro 12:12-21</A>)!

 What need of a fresh baptism of the Spirit in order to this! And how 
 "fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with 
 banners," will the Church become, when at length instinct with this 
 Spirit! The Lord hasten it in its time!</P>

 that this is spoken: and the statement applies equally to all forms of
 government, from an unchecked despotism--such as flourished when this
 was written, under the Emperor Nero--to a pure democracy. The
 inalienable right of all subjects to endeavor to alter or improve the
 form of government under which they live is left untouched here. But
 since Christians were constantly charged with turning the world upside
 down, and since there certainly were elements enough in Christianity of
 moral and social revolution to give plausibility to the charge, and
 tempt noble spirits, crushed under misgovernment, to take redress into
 their own hands, it was of special importance that the pacific,
 submissive, loyal spirit of those Christians who resided at the great
 seat of political power, should furnish a visible refutation of this
 charge.</P>

 society in all conditions! As it makes war directly against no specific
 forms of government, so it directly recommends none. While its holy and
 benign principles secure the ultimate abolition of all iniquitous
 government, the reverence which it teaches for magistracy, under
 whatever form, as a divine institution, secures the loyalty and
 peaceableness of its disciples, amid all the turbulence and distractions
 of civil society, and makes it the highest interest of all states to
 welcome it within their pale, as in this as well as every other
 sense--"the salt of the earth, the light of the world" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:1-5">Ro 13:1-5</A>).

 (2) Christianity is the grand specific for the purification and 
 elevation of all the social relations; inspiring a readiness to

 which we have arrived, and the ever-nearing approach of the perfect

 thirteenth chapter) in one particular form.</P>

 not "him that is weak in the truth believed" [C<FONT

 whose faith wants that firmness and breadth which would raise him above 
 small scruples." (See on

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but not to doubtful disputations</B>--rather, perhaps, "not to the deciding
 of doubts," or "scruples;" that is, not for the purpose of arguing him
 out of them: which indeed usually does the reverse; whereas to receive
 him to full brotherly confidence and cordial interchange of Christian
 affection is the most effectual way of drawing them off. Two examples of
 such scruples are here specified, touching Jewish <I>meats</I> and
 <I>days.</I> "The strong," it will be observed, are those who knew these to
 be abolished under the Gospel; "the weak" are those who had scruples on
 this point.</P>

 <B>another, who is weak, eateth herbs</B>--restricting himself probably to
 a vegetable diet, for fear of eating what might have been offered to
 idols, and so would be unclean. (See

 one gave thanks to God for the flesh which the other scrupled to use;
 the other did the same for the herbs to which, for conscience' sake, he
 restricted himself. From this passage about the observance of days,
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> unhappily infers that such language could not have been used if
 the <I>sabbath law</I> had been in force under the Gospel in any form.
 Certainly it could not, if the sabbath were merely one of the Jewish
 festival days; but it will not do to take this for granted merely
 because it was observed <I>under</I> the Mosaic economy. And certainly, if
 the sabbath was more ancient than Judaism; if, even under Judaism, it
 was enshrined among the eternal sanctities of the Decalogue, uttered, as
 no other parts of Judaism were, amidst the terrors of Sinai; and if the
 Lawgiver Himself said of it when on earth, "The Son of man is
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD EVEN OF THE SABBATH DAY</FONT>"
 (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:28">Mr 2:28</A>)

 --it will be hard to show that the apostle must have meant it to be
 ranked by his readers among those vanished Jewish festival days, which 
 only "weakness" could imagine to be still in force--a weakness which 
 those who had more light ought, out of love, merely to bear with.</P>

 inclinations.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and whether we die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live therefore,
 or die, we are the Lord's</B>--Nothing but the most vivid explanation of
 these remarkable words could make them endurable to any Christian ear,
 if Christ were a <I>mere creature.</I> For Christ is here--in the most
 emphatic terms, and yet in the most unimpassioned tone--held up as the
 supreme Object of the Christian's life, and of his death too; and that
 by the man whose horror of creature worship was such, that when the poor
 Lycaonians would have worshipped him, he rushed forth to arrest the
 deed, directing them to "the living God," as the only legitimate Object
 of worship 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:15">Ac 14:15</A>).

 Nor does Paul <I>teach</I> this here, but rather <I>appeals</I> to it 
 as a known and recognized fact, of which he had only to remind his 
 readers. And since the apostle, when he wrote these words, had never 
 been at Rome, he could only know that the Roman Christians would assent 
 to this view of Christ, because it was <I>the common teaching of all 
 the accredited preachers of Christianity, and the common faith of all 
 Christians.</I></P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 His of right.</P>

 (the stronger), why despisest thou thy brother?"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for we shall all</B>--the strong and the weak together.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>stand before the judgment-seat of Christ</B>--All the most ancient
 and best manuscripts read here, "the judgment-seat of God." The present 
 reading doubtless crept in from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:10">2Co 5:10</A>,

 where "the judgment-seat of <I>Christ</I>" occurs. But here "the
 judgment-seat of <I>God</I>" seems to have been used, with reference to 
 the quotation and the inference in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:11,12">Ro 14:11, 12</A>.</P>

 <B>every one of us shall give account of himself to God</B>--Now, if it be
 remembered that all this is adduced quite incidentally, to show that
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRIST</FONT> is the absolute Master of all Christians, to rule their judgments
 and feelings towards each other while "living," and to dispose of them
 "dying," the testimony which it bears to the absolute Divinity of Christ
 will appear remarkable. On any other view, the quotation to show that
 we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of <I>God</I> would be a
 strange proof that Christians are all amenable to <I>Christ.</I></P>

 selected as something contemptible in contrast with the tremendous risk
 run for its sake. Accordingly, in the next clause, that idea is brought
 out with great strength.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost</B>--a 
 beautiful and comprehensive division of living Christianity. The 
 first--"righteousness"--has respect to <I>God,</I> denoting here
 "rectitude," in its widest sense (as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:33">Mt 6:33</A>);

 the second--"peace"--has respect to <I>our neighbors,</I> denoting
 "concord" among brethren (as is plain from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:19">Ro 14:19</A>;

 the third--"joy in the Holy Ghost"--has respect to <I>ourselves.</I>
 This phrase, "joy in the Holy Ghost," represents Christians as so 
 thinking and feeling under the workings of the Holy Ghost, that their 
 joy may be viewed rather as that of the blessed Agent who inspires it 
 than their own (compare

 things as a "kingdom of <I>God,</I>" yet it is "<I>Christ</I>" that we serve
 in so doing; the apostle passing here from God to Christ as naturally as
 before from Christ to God--in a way to us inconceivable, if Christ had

 <A HREF="#Ro14_15">Ro 14:15</A>). 

 The apostle sees in whatever tends to violate a brother's conscience 
 the <I>incipient</I> destruction of God's work (for every converted man 
 is such)--on the same principle as "he that hateth his brother is a 
 murderer"

 <A NAME="Ro14_21"> </A>

 <B>whereby</B>--"wherein"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak</B>--rather, "is
 weak." These three words, it has been remarked, are each intentionally
 weaker than the other:--"Which may cause a brother to stumble, or even
 be obstructed in his Christian course, nay--though neither of these may
 follow--wherein he continues weak; unable wholly to disregard the
 example, and yet unprepared to follow it." But this injunction to
 abstain from <I>flesh,</I> from <I>wine,</I> and from <I>whatsoever</I> may hurt
 the conscience of a brother, must be properly understood. Manifestly,
 the apostle is treating of the regulation of the Christian's conduct
 with reference simply to the prejudices of the weak in faith; and his
 directions are to be considered not as
 <I>prescriptions for one's entire lifetime,</I> even to promote the good
 of men on a large scale, but simply as cautions against the too free
 use of Christian liberty in matters where other Christians, through
 weakness, are not persuaded that such liberty is divinely allowed. How
 far the <I>principle</I> involved in this may be legitimately extended, we
 do not inquire here; but ere we consider that question, it is of great
 importance to fix how far it is here actually expressed, and what is
 the precise nature of the illustrations given of it.</P>

 <B>before God</B>--a most important clause. It is not mere <I>sincerity,</I> or a
 private <I>opinion,</I> of which the apostle speaks; it is conviction as to
 what is the truth and will of God. If thou hast formed this conviction
 in the sight of God, keep thyself in this frame before Him. Of course,
 this is not to be over-pressed, as if it were wrong to discuss such
 points at all with our weaker brethren. All that is here condemned is
 such a zeal for small points as endangers Christian love.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth</B>--allows
 himself to do nothing, about the lawfulness of which he has
 scruples; does only what he neither knows nor fears to be sinful.</P>

 <I>Note,</I> (1) Some points in Christianity are unessential to Christian
 fellowship; so that though one may be in error upon them, he is not on
 that account to be excluded either from the communion of the Church or
 from the full confidence of those who have more light. This distinction
 between essential and non-essential truths is denied by some who affect
 more than ordinary zeal for the honor and truth of God. But they must
 settle the question with our apostle. (2) Acceptance with God is the
 only proper criterion of right to Christian fellowship. Whom God
 receives, men cannot lawfully reject 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:3,4">Ro 14:3, 4</A>).

 (3) As there is much self-pleasing in setting up narrow standards of 
 Christian fellowship, so one of the best preservatives against the 
 temptation to do this will be found in the continual remembrance that 
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRIST</FONT> is the one Object for whom all Christians 
 live, and to whom all Christians die; this will be such a living and 
 exalted bond of union between the strong and the weak as will 
 overshadow all their lesser differences and gradually absorb them

 (4) The consideration of the common judgment-seat at which the strong 
 and the weak shall stand together will be found another preservative 
 against the unlovely disposition to sit in judgment one on another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:10-12">Ro 14:10-12</A>).

 (5) How brightly does the supreme Divinity of Christ shine out in this 
 chapter! The exposition itself supersedes further illustration here.  
 (6) Though forbearance be a great Christian duty, indifference to the 
 distinction between truth and error is not thereby encouraged. The 
 former is, by the tax, made an excuse for the latter. But our apostle, 
 while teaching "the strong" to bear with "the weak," repeatedly 
 intimates in this chapter where the truth really lay on the points in 
 question, and takes care to call those who took the wrong side "the 
 weak"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:1,2,14">Ro 14:1, 2, 14</A>).

 (7) With what holy jealousy ought the purity of the conscience to be 
 guarded, since every deliberate violation of it is incipient perdition

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:15,20">Ro 14:15, 20</A>)!

 Some, who seem to be more jealous for the honor of certain doctrines 
 than for the souls of men, enervate this terrific truth by asking how 
 it bears upon the "perseverance of the saints"; the advocates of that 
 doctrine thinking it necessary to explain away what is meant by 
 "destroying the work of God"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:20">Ro 14:20</A>),

 and "destroying him for whom Christ died" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:15">Ro 14:15</A>),

 for fear of the doctrinal consequences of taking it nakedly; while the 
 opponents of that doctrine are ready to ask, How could the apostle have 
 used such language if he had believed that such a catastrophe was 
 impossible? The true answer to both lies in dismissing the question as 
 impertinent. The apostle is enunciating a great and eternal principle 
 in Christian Ethics--that <I>the wilful violation of conscience 
 contains within itself a seed of destruction;</I> or, to express it 
 otherwise, that the total destruction of the work of God in the renewed 
 soul, and, consequently, the loss of that soul for eternity, needs only 
 the carrying out to its full effect of such violation of the 
 conscience.  Whether such effects <I>do</I> take place, in point of 
 fact, the apostle gives not the most distant hint here; and therefore 
 that point must be settled elsewhere.  But, beyond all doubt, as the 
 position we have laid down is emphatically expressed by the apostle, so 
 the interests of all who call themselves Christians require to be 
 proclaimed and pressed on every suitable occasion. (8) Zeal for 
 comparatively small points of truth is a poor substitute for the 
 substantial and catholic and abiding realities of the Christian life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:17,18">Ro 14:17, 18</A>).

 (9) "Peace" among the followers of Christ is a blessing too precious to 
 themselves, and, as a testimony to them that are without, too 
 important, to be ruptured for trifles, even though some lesser truths 
 be involved in these

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:19,20">Ro 14:19, 20</A>).

 Nor are those truths themselves disparaged or endangered thereby, but 
 the reverse. (10) Many things which are lawful are not expedient. In 
 the use of any liberty, therefore, our question should be, not simply, 
 Is this lawful? but even if so, Can it be used with safety to a 
 brother's conscience?--How will it affect my brother's soul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:21">Ro 14:21</A>)?

 It is permitted to no Christian to say with Cain, "Am I my brother's 
 keeper?"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:9">Ge 4:9</A>).

 (11) Whenever we are in doubt as to a point of duty--where abstinence 
 is manifestly sinless, but compliance not clearly lawful--the safe 
 course is ever to be preferred, for to do otherwise is itself sinful. 
 (12) How exalted and beautiful is the Ethics of Christianity--by a few 
 great principles teaching us how to steer our course amidst practical 
 difficulties, with equal regard to Christian liberty, love, and 
 confidence!</P>

 On the foregoing portion, <I>Note,</I> (1) No Christian is at liberty to
 regard himself as an isolated disciple of the Lord Jesus, having to
 decide questions of duty and liberty solely with reference to himself.

 them to act in all things with tenderness and consideration for their
 brethren in "the common salvation" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:1,2">Ro 15:1, 2</A>).

 diffuse far and wide through this sin-distracted and divided world

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Note,</I> (1) Did "the chiefest of the apostles" apologize for writing
 to a Christian church which he had never seen, and a church that he was
 persuaded was above the need of it, save to "stir up their pure minds by
 way of remembrance" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:13,3:1">2Pe 1:13; 3:1</A>);

 and did he put even this upon the sole plea of apostolic responsibility

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:14-16">Ro 15:14-16</A>)?

 What a contrast is thus presented to hierarchical pride, and in
 particular to the affected humility of the bishop of this very Rome!
 How close the bond which the one spirit draws between ministers and
 people--how wide the separation produced by the other! (2) There is in
 the Christian Church no real priesthood, and none but figurative
 sacrifices. Had it been otherwise, it is inconceivable that

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:16">Ro 15:16</A>

 should have been expressed as it is. Paul's only priesthood and
 sacrificial offerings lay, first, in ministering to them as "the 
 apostle of the Gentiles," not the sacrament with the "real presence" of 
 Christ in it, or the sacrifice of the mass, but "the Gospel of God," 
 and then, when gathered under the wing of Christ, presenting them to 
 God as a grateful offering, "being sanctified [not by sacrificial 
 gifts, but] by the Holy Ghost." (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:9-16">Heb 13:9-16</A>).

 (3) Though the debt we owe to those by whom we have been brought to 
 Christ can never be discharged, we should feel it a privilege when we 
 render them any lower benefit in return

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:26,27">Ro 15:26, 27</A>).

 (4) Formidable designs against the truth and the servants of Christ 
 should, above all other ways of counteracting them, be met by combined 
 prayer to Him who rules all hearts and controls all events; and the 
 darker the cloud, the more resolutely should all to whom Christ's cause 
 is dear "strive together in their prayers to God" for the removal of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:30,31">Ro 15:30, 31</A>).

 (5) Christian fellowship is so precious that the most eminent servants 
 of Christ, amid the toils and trials of their work, find it refreshing 
 and invigorating; and it is no good sign of any ecclesiastic, that he 
 deems it beneath him to seek and enjoy it even amongst the humblest 
 saints in the Church of Christ

 That in the earliest churches there were deaconesses, to attend to the 
 wants of the female members, there is no good reason to doubt. So early 
 at least as the reign of Trajan, we learn from P<FONT

 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 110, or 111--that they existed in the Eastern 
 churches.  Indeed, from the relation in which the sexes then stood to 
 each other, something of this sort would seem to have been a necessity. 
 Modern attempts, however, to revive this office have seldom found 
 favor; either from the altered state of society, or the abuse of the 
 office, or both.</P>

 and doubtless, if not the principal members of that Christian

 that statedly met there for worship. "From his occupation as tent-maker,
 he had probably better accommodations for the meetings of the church
 than most other Christians" [H<FONT SIZE=-1>ODGE</FONT>]. Probably this devoted couple had
 written to the apostle such an account of the stated meetings at their
 house, as made him feel at home with them, and include them in this
 salutation, which doubtless would be read at their meetings with
 peculiar interest.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Salute my well beloved Ep&aelig;netus, who is the first-fruits</B>--that is,
 the first convert

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>of Achaia unto Christ</B>--The true reading here, as appears by the
 manuscripts, is, "the first-fruits of Asia unto Christ"--that is,
 Proconsular Asia (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:6">Ac 16:6</A>).
 
 In 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:15">1Co 16:15</A>

 it is said that "the household of Stephanas was the first-fruit of 
 Achaia"; and though if Ep&aelig;netus was one of that family, the two 
 statements might be reconciled according to the received text, there is 
 no need to resort to this supposition, as that text is in this instance 
 without authority.  Ep&aelig;netus, as the first believer in that 
 region called Proconsular Asia, was dear to the apostle. (See

 None of the names mentioned from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:5-15">Ro 16:5-15</A>

 are otherwise known. One wonders at the number of them, considering
 that the writer had never been at Rome. But as Rome was then the center 
 of the civilized world, to and from which journeys were continually 
 taken to the remotest parts, there is no great difficulty in supposing 
 that so active a travelling missionary as Paul would, in course of 
 time, make the acquaintance of a considerable number of the Christians 
 then residing at Rome.</P>

 <B>7. Andronicus and Junia</B>--or, as it might be, "Junias," a contracted

 probable, the word be, as in our version, "Junia," the person meant was
 no doubt either the wife or the sister of Andronicus.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>my kinsmen</B>--or, "relatives."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and my fellow prisoners</B>--on what occasion, it is impossible to say,
 as the apostle elsewhere tells us that he was "in prisons more frequent"

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>which are of note among the apostles</B>--Those who think the word
 "apostle" is used in a lax sense, in the Acts and Epistles, take this to
 mean "noted apostles" [C<FONT SIZE=-1>HRYSOSTOM</FONT>,
 L<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHER</FONT>,
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALVIN</FONT>,

 O<FONT SIZE=-1>LSHAUSEN</FONT>,
 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOLUCK</FONT>,
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT>,
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>OWETT</FONT>]; others, who are not clear that the word
 "apostle" is applied to any without the circle of the Twelve, save where
 the connection or some qualifying words show that the literal meaning of
 "one sent" is the thing intended, understand by the expression used
 here, "persons esteemed by the apostles" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>EZA</FONT>,

 S<FONT SIZE=-1>TUART</FONT>,
 P<FONT SIZE=-1>HILIPPI</FONT>,

 to be taken for a woman, this latter must be the meaning.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>who also were in Christ before me</B>--The apostle writes as if he envied
 them this priority in the faith. And, indeed, if to be "in Christ" be
 the most enviable human condition, the earlier the date of this blessed
 translation, the greater the grace of it. This latter statement about
 Andronicus and Junia seems to throw some light on the preceding one.
 Very possibly they may have been among the first-fruits of Peter's
 labors, gained to Christ either on the day of Pentecost or on some of
 the succeeding days. In that case they may have attracted the special
 esteem of those apostles who for some time resided chiefly at Jerusalem
 and its neighborhood; and our apostle, though he came late in contact
 with the other apostles, if he was aware of this fact, would have
 pleasure in alluding to it.</P>

 We read in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:21">Mr 15:21</A>

 that Simon of Cyrene, who was compelled to bear our Lord's cross, was
 "the father of Alexander and Rufus." From this we naturally conclude 
 that when Mark wrote his Gospel, Alexander and Rufus must have been 
 well known as Christians among those by whom he expected his Gospel to 
 be first read; and, in all likelihood, this was that very "Rufus"; in 
 which case our interest is deepened by what immediately follows about 
 his mother.

 but in grateful acknowledgment of her motherly attentions to himself, 
 bestowed no doubt for his Master's sake, and the love she bore to his 
 honored servants. To us it seems altogether likely that the conversion 
 of Simon the Cyrenian dated from that memorable day when "passing 
 [casually] by, as he came from the country"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:21">Mr 15:21</A>),

 "they compelled him to bear the" Saviour's cross. Sweet compulsion, if
 what he thus beheld issued in his <I>voluntarily</I> taking up his own
 cross! Through him it is natural to suppose that his wife would be
 brought in, and that this believing couple, now "heirs together of the
 grace of life"

 as they told their two sons, Alexander and Rufus, what honor had 
 unwittingly been put upon their father at that hour of deepest and 
 dearest moment to all Christians, might be blessed to the inbringing of 
 both of them to Christ. In this case, supposing the elder of the two to 
 have departed to be with Christ ere this letter was written, or to have 
 been residing in some other place, and Rufus left alone with his 
 mother, how instructive and beautiful is the testimony here borne to 
 her!</P>

 <B>14, 15. Salute Asyncritus,</B> &c.--These have been thought to be the
 names of ten less notable Christians than those already named. But this
 will hardly be supposed if it be observed that they are divided into two
 pairs of five each, and that after the first of these pairs it is added,
 "and the brethren which are with them," while after the second pair we
 have the words, "and all the saints which are with them." This perhaps
 hardly means that each of the five in both pairs had "a church at his
 house," else probably this would have been more expressly said. But at
 least it would seem to indicate that they were each a center of some few
 Christians who met at his house--it may be for further instruction, for
 prayer, for missionary purposes, or for some other Christian objects.
 These little peeps into the rudimental forms which Christian fellowship
 first took in the great cities, though too indistinct for more than
 conjecture, are singularly interesting. Our apostle would seem to have
 been kept minutely informed as to the state of the church at Rome, both
 as to its membership and its varied activities, probably by Priscilla
 and Aquila.</P>

 The custom prevailed among the Jews, and doubtless came from the East,
 where it still obtains. Its adoption into the Christian churches, as 
 the symbol of a higher fellowship than it had ever expressed before, 
 was probably as immediate as it was natural. In this case the apostle's 
 desire seems to be that on receipt of his epistle, with its 
 salutations, they should in this manner expressly testify their 
 Christian affection. It afterwards came to have a fixed place in the 
 church service, immediately after the celebration of the Supper, and 
 continued long in use. In such matters, however, the state of society 
 and the peculiarities of different places require to be studied.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>The churches of Christ salute you</B>--The true reading is, "All the
 churches"; the word "all" gradually falling out, as seeming probably to
 express more than the apostle would venture to affirm. But no more seems
 meant than to assure the Romans in what affectionate esteem they were
 held by the churches generally; all that knew he was writing to Rome
 having expressly asked their own salutations to be sent to them. (See

 as haughtily disregarding the prejudices of the weak. The direction as 
 to both is, first, to "mark" such, lest the evil should be done ere it 
 was fully discovered; and next, to "avoid" them (compare

 <B>20. And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly</B>--The
 apostle encourages the Romans to persevere in resisting the wiles of
 the devil with the assurance that, as good soldiers of Jesus Christ,
 they are "shortly" to receive their discharge, and have the satisfaction
 of "putting their feet upon the neck" of that formidable enemy--symbol
 familiar, probably, in all languages to express not only the
 completeness of the defeat, but the abject humiliation of the conquered
 foe. (See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:24,2Sa+22:41,Eze+21:29,Ps+91:13">Jos 10:24;
 2Sa 22:41; 
 Eze 21:29; 
 Ps 91:13</A>). 

 Though the apostle here styles Him who is thus to bruise Satan, the God
 of peace," with special reference to the "divisions"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:17">Ro 16:17</A>)

 by which the church at Rome was in danger of being disturbed, this 
 sublime appellation of God has here a wider sense, pointing to the 
 whole "purpose for which the Son of God was manifested, to destroy the 
 works of the devil"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:8">1Jo 3:8</A>);

 and indeed this assurance is but a reproduction of the first great 
 promise, that the Seed of the woman should bruise the Serpent's head

 among the "prophets and teachers" at Antioch with our apostle, before he
 was summoned into the missionary field

 to them he wrote with his own hand

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>26. But is now made manifest</B>--The reference here is to that 
 peculiar feature of the Gospel economy which Paul himself was specially 
 employed to carry into practical effect and to unfold by his
 teaching--the introduction of the Gentile believers to an equality with 
 their Jewish brethren, and the new, and, to the Jews, quite unexpected 
 form which this gave to the whole Kingdom of God (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:1-10">Eph 3:1-10</A>,

 &c.).  This the apostle calls here a mystery hitherto undisclosed, in
 what sense

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:27">Ro 16:27</A>

 will show, but now fully unfolded; and his prayer for the Roman 
 Christians, in the form of a doxology to Him who was able to do what he 
 asked, is that they might be established in the truth of the Gospel, 
 not only in its essential character, but specially in that feature of 
 it which gave themselves, as Gentile believers, their whole standing 
 among the people of God.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of
 the everlasting God, made known to all nations for</B>--in order to

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the obedience of faith</B>--Lest they should think, from what he had
 just said, that God had brought in upon his people so vast a change on
 their condition without giving them any previous notice, the apostle
 here adds that, on the contrary, "the Scriptures of the prophets"
 contain all that he and other preachers of the Gospel had to declare on
 these topics, and indeed that the same "everlasting God," who "from
 eternal ages" had kept these things hid, had given "commandment" that
 they should now, according to the tenor of those prophetic Scriptures,
 be imparted to every nation for their believing acceptance.</P>

 <A NAME="Ro16_27"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>27. To God,</B> &c.--"To the only wise God through Jesus Christ,
 be"--literally, "to whom be"; that is, "to Him, I say, be the glory for ever.
 Amen." At its outset, this is an ascription of glory to the <I>power</I>
 that could do all this; at its close it ascribes glory to the <I>wisdom</I>
 that planned and that presides over the gathering of a redeemed people
 out of all nations. The apostle adds his devout "Amen," which the
 reader--if he has followed him with the astonishment and delight of him
 who pens these words--will fervently echo.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 On this concluding section of the Epistle, <I>Note,</I> (1) In the minute
 and delicate manifestations of Christian feeling, and lively interest in
 the smallest movements of Christian life, love, and zeal, which are here
 exemplified, combined with the grasp of thought and elevation of soul
 which this whole Epistle displays, as indeed all the writings of our
 apostle, we have the secret of much of that grandeur of character which
 has made the name of Paul stand on an elevation of its own in the
 estimation of enlightened Christendom in every age, and of that
 influence which under God, beyond all the other apostles, he has already
 exercised, and is yet destined to exert, over the religious thinking and
 feeling of men. Nor can any approach him in these peculiarities without
 exercising corresponding influence on all with whom they come in contact

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:1-16">Ro 16:1-16</A>).

 (2) "The wisdom of the serpent and the harmlessness of the dove"--in 
 enjoining which our apostle here only echoes the teaching of his Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:16">Mt 10:16</A>)

 --is a combination of properties the rarity of which among Christians 
 is only equalled by its vast importance. In every age of the Church 
 there have been real Christians whose excessive study of the serpent's 
 wisdom has so sadly trenched upon their guileless simplicity, as at 
 times to excite the distressing apprehension that they were no better 
 than wolves in sheep's clothing.  Nor is it to be denied, on the other 
 hand, that, either from inaptitude or indisposition to judge with manly 
 discrimination of character and of measures, many eminently simple, 
 spiritual, devoted Christians, have throughout life exercised little or 
 no influence on any section of society around them. Let the apostle's 
 counsel on this head

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:19">Ro 16:19</A>)

 be taken as a study, especially by young Christians, whose character 
 has yet to be formed, and whose permanent sphere in life is but 
 partially fixed; and let them prayerfully set themselves to the 
 combined exercise of both those qualities. So will their Christian 
 character acquire solidity and elevation, and their influence for good 
 be proportionably extended. (3) Christians should cheer their own and 
 each other's hearts, amidst the toils and trials of their protracted 
 warfare, with the assurance that it will have a speedy and glorious 
 end; they should accustom themselves to regard all opposition to the 
 progress and prosperity of Christ's cause--whether in their own souls, 
 in the churches with which they are connected, or in the world at 
 large--as just "Satan" in conflict, as ever, with Christ their Lord; 
 and they should never allow themselves to doubt that "the God of peace" 
 will "shortly" give them the neck of their Enemy, and make them to 
 bruise the Serpent's head

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:20">Ro 16:20</A>).

 (4) As Christians are held up and carried through solely by divine 
 power, working through the glorious Gospel, so to that power, and to 
 the wisdom that brought that Gospel nigh to them, they should ascribe 
 all the glory of their stability now, as they certainly will of their 
 victory at last

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:25-27">Ro 16:25-27</A>).

 (5) "Has the everlasting God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. commanded" that the Gospel 
 "mystery," so long kept hid but now fully disclosed, shall be "made 
 known to all nations for the obedience of faith"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:26">Ro 16:26</A>)?

 Then, what "necessity is laid upon" all the churches and every 
 Christian, to send the Gospel "to every creature!" And we may rest well 
 assured that the prosperity or decline of churches, and of individual 
 Christians, will have not a little to do with their faithfulness or 
 indifference to this imperative duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The ancient subscription at the end of this epistle--though of course
 of no authority--appears to be in this case quite correct.</P>
