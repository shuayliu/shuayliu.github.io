 <B>1. Now after the death of Joshua</B>--probably not a long period, for the
 Canaanites seem to have taken advantage of that event to attempt
 recovering their lost position, and the Israelites were obliged to
 renew the war.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the children of Israel asked the Lord</B>--The divine counsel on this, as
 on other occasions, was sought by Urim and Thummim, by applying to the
 high priest, who, according to J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, was Phinehas.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first</B>--The
 elders, who exercised the government in their respective tribes, judged
 rightly, that in entering upon an important expedition, they should
 have a leader nominated by divine appointment; and in consulting the
 oracle, they adopted a prudent course, whether the object of their
 inquiry related to the choice of an individual commander, or to the
 honor of precedency among the tribes.</P>

 was thus conferred upon Judah by divine direction, and its appointment
 to take the lead in the ensuing hostilities was of great importance, as 
 the measure of success by which its arms were crowned, would animate 
 the other tribes to make similar attempts against the Canaanites within 
 their respective territories.

 miles south of Jerusalem.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>found Adoni-bezek</B>--that is, "lord of Bezek"--he was "found," that is,
 surprised and routed in a pitched battle, whence he fled; but being
 taken prisoner, he was treated with a severity unusual among the
 Israelites, for they "cut off his thumbs and great toes." Barbarities
 of various kinds were commonly practised on prisoners of war in ancient
 times, and the object of this particular mutilation of the hands and
 feet was to disable them for military service ever after. The
 infliction of such a horrid cruelty on this Canaanite chief would have
 been a foul stain on the character of the Israelites if there were not
 reason for believing it was done by them as an act of retributive
 justice, and as such it was regarded by Adoni-bezek himself, whose
 conscience read his atrocious crimes in their punishment.</P>

 <B>7. Threescore and ten kings</B>--So great a number will not appear strange,
 when it is considered that anciently every ruler of a city or large
 town was called a king. It is not improbable that in that southern
 region of Canaan, there might, in earlier times, have been even more
 till a turbulent chief like Adoni-bezek devoured them in his insatiable
 ambition.</P>

 early incidents in the war of invasion

 is here noticed to account for its being in the possession of the
 Judahites; and they brought Adoni-bezek thither

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:7">Jud 1:7</A>],

 in order, probably, that his fate being rendered so public, might
 inspire terror far and wide. Similar inroads were made into the other 
 unconquered parts of Judah's inheritance

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:9-11">Jud 1:9-11</A>].

 <B>16. the children of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up out of
 the city of palm trees with the children of Judah</B>--called "the Kenite,"
 as probably descended from the people of that name 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:21,22">Nu 24:21, 22</A>).

 If he might not himself, his posterity did accept the invitation of
 Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:32">Nu 10:32</A>)

 to accompany the Israelites to Canaan. Their first encampment was in
 the "city of palm trees"--not Jericho, of course, which was utterly 
 destroyed, but the surrounding district, perhaps En-gedi, in early 
 times called Hazezon-tamar

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:7">Ge 14:7</A>),

 from the palm-grove which sheltered it. Thence they removed for some
 unknown cause, and associating themselves with Judah, joined in an 
 expedition against Arad, in the southern part of Canaan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:1">Nu 21:1</A>).

 On the conquest of that district, some of this pastoral people pitched
 their tents there, while others migrated to the north

 The confederate tribes, pursuing their incursions in that quarter, came
 successively to Gaza, Askelon, and Ekron, which they took. But the 
 Philistines seem soon to have regained possession of these cities.</P>

 inhabitants of the valley</B>--The war was of the Lord, whose omnipotent
 aid would have ensured their success in every encounter, whether on the
 mountains or the plains, with foot soldiers or cavalry. It was
 distrust, the want of a simple and firm reliance on the promise of God,
 that made them afraid of the iron chariots

 Canaanites were doomed to destruction

 but we may assume the promise was suspended on his embracing the true
 religion, or quitting the country, as he did. If they had seen him to 
 be firmly opposed to either of these alternatives, they would not have 
 constrained him by promises any more than by threats to betray his 
 countrymen. But if they found him disposed to be serviceable, and to 
 aid the invaders in executing the will of God, they might promise to 
 spare him.</P>

 <B>27-36.</B> The same course of subjugation was carried on in the other
 tribes to a partial extent, and with varying success. Many of the
 natives, no doubt, during the progress of this exterminating war, saved
 themselves by flight and became, it is thought, the first colonists in
 Greece, Italy, and other countries. But a large portion made a stout
 resistance and retained possession of their old abodes in Canaan. In
 other cases, when the natives were vanquished, avarice led the
 Israelites to spare the idolaters, contrary to the express command of
 God; and their disobedience to His orders in this matter involved them
 in many troubles which this book describes.</P>

 <B>1-3. an angel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. came from Gilgal to Bochim</B>--We are inclined to
 think, from the authoritative tone of his language, that he was the
 Angel of the Covenant 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:20,Jos+5:14">Ex 23:20;
 Jos 5:14</A>); 

 the same who appeared in human form and announced himself captain of
 the Lord's host. His coming from Gilgal had a peculiar significance, 
 for there the Israelites made a solemn dedication of themselves to God 
 on their entrance into the promised land

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+4:1-9">Jos 4:1-9</A>];

 and the memory of that religious engagement, which the angel's arrival
 from Gilgal awakened, gave emphatic force to his rebuke of their 
 apostasy.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Bochim</B>--"the weepers," was a name bestowed evidently in allusion
 to this incident or the place, which was at or near Shiloh.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>I said, I will never break my covenant with you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but ye have not
 obeyed my voice</B>--The burden of the angel's remonstrance was that God
 would inviolably keep His promise; but they, by their flagrant and
 repeated breaches of their covenant with Him, had forfeited all claim
 to the stipulated benefits. Having disobeyed the will of God by
 voluntarily courting the society of idolaters and placing themselves in
 the way of temptation, He left them to suffer the punishment of their
 misdeeds.</P>

 <B>4, 5. when the angel of the Lord spake these words .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the people
 lifted up their voice, and wept</B>--The angel's expostulation made a deep
 and painful impression. But the reformation was but temporary, and the
 gratifying promise of a revival which this scene of emotion held out,
 was, ere long, blasted by speedy and deeper relapses into the guilt of
 defection and idolatry.</P>

 It was inserted here to give the reader the reasons which called forth
 so strong and severe a rebuke from the angel of the Lord. During the 
 lifetime of the first occupiers, who retained a vivid recollection of 
 all the miracles and judgments which they had witnessed in Egypt and 
 the desert, the national character stood high for faith and piety. But, 
 in course of time, a new race arose who were strangers to all the 
 hallowed and solemnizing experience of their fathers, and too readily 
 yielded to the corrupting influences of the idolatry that surrounded 
 them.</P>

 contains a brief but comprehensive summary of the principles developed
 in the following history. An attentive consideration of them, 
 therefore, is of the greatest importance to a right understanding of 
 the strange and varying phases of Israelitish history, from the death

 <B>14. the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered them
 into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them</B>--Adversities in close and
 rapid succession befell them. But all these calamities were designed
 only as chastisements--a course of correctional discipline by which God
 brought His people to see and repent of their errors; for as they
 returned to faith and allegiance, He "raised up judges"

 <B>16. which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled
 them</B>--The judges who governed Israel were strictly God's vicegerents
 in the government of the people, He being the supreme ruler. Those who
 were thus elevated retained the dignity as long as they lived; but
 there was no regular, unbroken succession of judges. Individuals,
 prompted by the inward, irresistible impulse of God's Spirit when they
 witnessed the depressed state of their country, were roused to achieve
 its deliverance. It was usually accompanied by a special call, and the
 people seeing them endowed with extraordinary courage or strength,
 accepted them as delegates of Heaven, and submitted to their sway.
 Frequently they were appointed only for a particular district, and
 their authority extended no farther than over the people whose
 interests they were commissioned to protect. They were without pomp,
 equipage, or emoluments attached to the office. They had no power to
 make laws; for these were given by God; nor to explain them, for that
 was the province of the priests--but they were officially upholders of
 the law, defenders of religion, avengers of all crimes, particularly of
 idolatry and its attendant vices.</P>

 The northern Canaanites had recovered from the effect of their
 disastrous overthrow in the time of Joshua, and now triumphed in their 
 turn over Israel. This was the severest oppression to which Israel had

 deliverance from God.</P>

 somewhat singular request to be accompanied by Deborah was not
 altogether the result of weakness. The Orientals always take what is
 dearest to the battlefield along with them; they think it makes them
 fight better. The policy of Barak, then, to have the presence of the
 prophetess is perfectly intelligible as it would no less stimulate the

 against an oppressor so powerful as Jabin.</P>

 dreaded.</P>

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his
 feet</B>--His chariot being probably distinguished by its superior size
 and elegance, would betray the rank of its rider, and he saw therefore
 that his only chance of escape was on foot.</P>

 Kishon and drowned (see on

 <A NAME="Jud4_17"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>17, 18. Sisera fled .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to the tent of Jael</B>--According to the usages
 of nomadic people, the duty of receiving the stranger in the sheik's
 absence devolves on his wife, and the moment the stranger is admitted
 into his tent, his claim to be defended or concealed from his pursuers
 is established.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>19. she .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gave him drink, and covered him</B>--Sisera reckoned on this
 as a pledge of his safety, especially in the tent of a friendly sheik.
 This pledge was the strongest that could be sought or obtained, after
 he had partaken of refreshments, and been introduced in the inner or
 women's apartment.</P>

 <A NAME="Jud4_20"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>20. he said unto her, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when any man doth come and enquire of thee
 and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No</B>--The privacy
 of the harem, even in a tent, cannot be intruded on without express
 permission.</P>

 <A NAME="Jud4_21"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>21. Then Jael took a nail of the tent</B>--most probably one of the pins
 with which the tent ropes are fastened to the ground. Escape was almost
 impossible for Sisera. But the taking of his life by the hand of Jael
 was murder. It was a direct violation of all the notions of honor and
 friendship that are usually held sacred among pastoral people, and for
 which it is impossible to conceive a woman in Jael's circumstances to
 have had any motive, except that of gaining favor with the victors.
 Though predicted by Deborah 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:9">Jud 4:9</A>],

 it was the result of divine foreknowledge only--not the divine

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:24-27">Jud 5:24-27</A>],

 the eulogy must be considered as pronounced not on the moral character
 of the woman and her deed, but on the public benefits which, in the 
 overruling providence of God, would flow from it.</P>

 tranquil "places of drawing water." Deborah now rouses herself to
 describe, in terms suitable to the occasion, the preparation and the
 contest, and calls in a flight of poetic enthusiasm on Barak to parade
 his prisoners in triumphal procession. Then follows a eulogistic
 enumeration of the tribes which raised the commanded levy, or
 volunteered their services--the soldiers of Ephraim who dwelt near the

 contiguous to Moab. The destructive ravages they are described as at 
 this time committing in the land of Israel are similar to those of the 
 Bedouin Arabs, who harass the peaceful cultivators of the soil. Unless 
 composition is made with them, they return annually at a certain 
 season, when they carry off the grain, seize the cattle and other

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:21">Jud 6:21</A>),

 who sat down in the shade to enjoy a little refreshment and repose.
 Entering into conversation on the engrossing topic of the times, the 
 grievous oppression of the Midianites, he began urging Gideon to exert 
 his well-known prowess on behalf of his country. Gideon, in replying, 
 addresses him at first in a style equivalent (in <I>Hebrew</I>) to 
 "sir," but afterwards gives to him the name usually applied to God.

 emphatically the tale of public distress. The small quantity of grain
 he was threshing, indicated by his using a flail instead of the
 customary treading of cattle--the unusual place, near a wine-press,
 under a tree, and on the bare ground, not a wooden floor, for the
 prevention of noise--all these circumstances reveal the extreme dread
 in which the people were living.</P>

 of the real character of his visitor; and yet like Moses, from a sense
 of humility, or a shrinking at the magnitude of the undertaking, he
 excused himself from entering on the enterprise. And even though
 assured that, with the divine aid, he would overcome the Midianites as
 easily as if they were but one man, he still hesitates and wishes to be
 better assured that the mission was really from God. He resembles
 Moses also in the desire for a sign; and in both cases it was the
 rarity of revelations in such periods of general corruption that made
 them so desirous of having the fullest conviction of being addressed by
 a heavenly messenger. The request was reasonable, and it was graciously
 granted

 pot</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="JFB01.htm#Ge18_7">Ge 18:7</A>).
 
 The flesh seems to have been roasted, which is done by cutting it into
 kobab, that is, into small pieces, fixed on a skewer, and put before
 the fire. The broth was for immediate use; the other, brought in a
 hand-basket was intended to be a future supply to the traveller. The
 miraculous fire that consumed it and the vanishing of the stranger, not
 by walking, but as a spirit in the fire, filled Gideon with awe. A
 consciousness of demerit fills the heart of every fallen man at the
 thought of God, with fear of His wrath; and this feeling was increased
 by a belief prevalent in ancient times, that whoever saw an angel would
 forthwith die. The acceptance of Gideon's sacrifice betokened the
 acceptance of his person; but it required an express assurance of the
 divine blessing, given in some unknown manner, to restore his comfort
 and peace of mind.</P>

 that the second was the only remaining one fit for sacrifice to God.

 the work had to be done under cover of night. A violent commotion was
 excited next day, and vengeance vowed against Gideon as the
 perpetrator. "Joash, his father, quieted the mob in a manner similar to
 that of the town clerk of Ephesus. It was not for them to take the
 matter into their own hands. The one, however, made an appeal to the
 magistrate; the other to the idolatrous god himself"

 make a fresh inroad on Canaan, encamped in the plains of Esdraelon
 (anciently Jezreel). The southern part of the Ghor lies in a very low
 level, so that there is a steep and difficult descent into Canaan by
 the southern wadies. Keeping this in view, we see the reason why the

 enthusiastically obeyed by all the neighboring tribes. On the eve of a
 perilous enterprise, he sought to fortify his mind with a fresh
 assurance of a divine call to the responsible office. The miracle of
 the fleece was a very remarkable one--especially, considering the
 copious dews that fall in his country. The divine patience and
 condescension were wonderfully manifested in reversing the form of the
 miracle. Gideon himself seems to have been conscious of incurring the
 displeasure of God by his hesitancy and doubts; but He bears with the
 infirmities of His people.</P>

 The panic being universal, they soon precipitately fled, directing

 pride; and the occasion only served to bring out an old and deep-seated
 feeling of jealous rivalry that subsisted between the tribes

 The discontent was groundless, for Gideon acted according to divine
 directions. Besides, as their tribe was conterminous with that of 
 Gideon, they might, had they been really fired with the flame of 
 patriotic zeal, have volunteered their services in a movement against 
 the common enemy.</P>

 insolent because it implied a bitter taunt that Gideon was counting
 with confidence on a victory which they believed he would not gain; and
 it was time-serving, because living in the near neighborhood of the
 Midianite sheiks, they dreaded the future vengeance of those roving

 dynasty in his house. But Gideon knew too well, and revered too piously
 the principles of the theocracy, to entertain the proposal for a

 sense of duty, and every worldly motive was kept in check by a supreme

 had been stealthily creeping into Israel during the latter years of
 Gideon was now openly professed; Shechem was wholly inhabited by its
 adherents; at least, idolaters had the ascendency. Abimelech, one of
 Gideon's numerous sons, was connected with that place. Ambitious of
 sovereign power, and having plied successfully the arts of a demagogue
 with his maternal relatives and friends, he acquired both the influence

 the deceased monarch usurping the throne and hastening to confirm 
 himself in the possession by the massacre of all the natural or 
 legitimate competitors. Abimelech slew his brethren <I>on one 
 stone,</I> either by dashing them from one rock, or sacrificing them on 
 one stone altar, in revenge for the demolition of Baal's altar by their 
 father.  This latter view is the more probable, from the Shechemites

 diversified foliage of the valley below. Eastern people are exceedingly 
 fond of parables and use them for conveying reproofs, which they could 
 not give in any other way. The top of Gerizim is not so high in the 
 rear of the town, as it is nearer to the plain. With a little exertion 
 of voice, he could easily have been heard by the people of the city; 
 for the hill so overhangs the valley, that a person from the side or 
 summit would have no difficulty in speaking to listeners at the base. 
 Modern history records a case, in which soldiers on the hill shouted to 
 the people in the city and endeavored to instigate them to an 
 insurrection. There is something about the elastic atmosphere of an

 the leader of a band, acquires fame by his stirring or gallant

 brothers among the deputies. Jephthah was now in circumstances to make
 his own terms. With his former experience, he would have shown little
 wisdom or prudence without binding them to a clear and specific
 engagement to invest him with unlimited authority, the more especially
 as he was about to imperil his life in their cause. Although ambition
 might, to a certain degree, have stimulated his ready compliance, it is
 impossible to overlook the piety of his language, which creates a

 that the pledge given by the deputies in Tob should be ratified in a
 general assembly of the people at Mizpeh; and the language of the
 historian, "Jephthah uttered all his words before the Lord," seems to
 imply that his inauguration with the character and extraordinary office
 of judge was solemnized by prayer for the divine blessing, or some

 credit on his character for prudence and moderation, justice and
 humanity. The bravest officers have always been averse to war; so
 Jephthah, whose courage was indisputable, resolved not only to make it
 clearly appear that hostilities were forced upon him, but to try
 measures for avoiding, if possible, an appeal to arms: and in pursuing
 such a course he was acting as became a leader in Israel

 The subject of quarrel was a claim of right advanced by the Ammonite
 monarch to the lands which the Israelites were occupying. Jephthah's 
 reply was clear, decisive, and unanswerable;--first, those lands were 
 not in the possession of the Ammonites when his countrymen got them, 
 and that they had been acquired by right of conquest from the Amorites

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:21">Jud 11:21</A>];

 secondly, the Israelites had now, by a lapse of three hundred years of
 undisputed possession, established a prescriptive right to the 
 occupation

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:22,23">Jud 11:22, 23</A>];

 now occupied

 to his countrymen, that he was qualified by higher resources than his
 own for the momentous duties of his office.

 <B>he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh</B>--the provinces most exposed and in
 danger, for the purpose of levying troops, and exciting by his presence
 a widespread interest in the national cause. Returning to the camp at
 Mizpeh, he then began his march against the enemy. There he made his
 celebrated vow, in accordance with an ancient custom for generals at
 the outbreak of a war, or on the eve of a battle, to promise the god of
 their worship a costly oblation, or dedication of some valuable booty,
 in the event of victory. Vows were in common practice also among the
 Israelites. They were encouraged by the divine approval as emanating
 from a spirit of piety and gratitude; and rules were laid down in the
 law for regulating the performance. But it is difficult to bring
 Jephthah's vow within the legitimate range

 which, being unclean, was unfit to be offered; but to a person, and it
 looks extremely as if he, from the first, contemplated a human
 sacrifice. Bred up as he had been, beyond the Jordan, where the
 Israelitish tribes, far from the tabernacle, were looser in their
 religious sentiments, and living latterly on the borders of a heathen
 country where such sacrifices were common, it is not improbable that he
 may have been so ignorant as to imagine that a similar immolation would
 be acceptable to God. His mind, engrossed with the prospect of a
 contest, on the issue of which the fate of his country depended, might,
 through the influence of superstition, consider the dedication of the
 object dearest to him the most likely to ensure success.

 it would be offered on the altar.</P>

 the leader of whom was Jephthah's daughter. The vow was full in his
 mind, and it is evident that it had not been communicated to anyone, 
 otherwise precautions would doubtless have been taken to place another 
 object at his door. The shriek, and other accompaniments of 
 irrepressible grief, seem to indicate that her life was to be forfeited 
 as a sacrifice; the nature of the sacrifice (which was abhorrent to the 
 character of God) and distance from the tabernacle does not suffice to 
 overturn this view, which the language and whole strain of the 
 narrative plainly support; and although the lapse of two months might 
 be supposed to have afforded time for reflection, and a better sense of 
 his duty, there is but too much reason to conclude that he was impelled 
 to the fulfilment by the dictates of a pious but unenlightened 
 conscience.</P>

 insulting sneers that the Gileadites were reckoned both by the western
 Manassites and Ephraimites as outcasts--the scum and refuse of their
 common stock. This was addressed to a peculiarly sensitive people. A
 feud immediately ensued. The Gileadites, determined to chastise this
 public affront, gave them battle; and having defeated the Ephraimites,
 they chased their foul-mouthed but cowardly assailants out of the
 territory. Then rushing to the fords of the Jordan, they intercepted
 and slew every fugitive. The method adopted for discovering an
 Ephraimite was by the pronunciation of a word naturally suggested by
 the place where they stood. <I>Shibboleth,</I> means "a stream";
 <I>Sibboleth,</I> "a burden." The Eastern tribe had, it seems, a
 dialectical provincialism in the sound of <I>Shibboleth;</I> and the

 as having fallen universally into a state of gross and confirmed
 idolatry, and in chastisement of this great apostasy, the Lord raised 
 up enemies that harassed them in various quarters, especially the 
 Ammonites and Philistines. The invasions and defeat of the former were 
 narrated in the two chapters immediately preceding this; and now the 
 sacred historian proceeds to describe the inroads of the latter people. 
 The period of Philistine ascendency comprised forty years, reckoning 
 from the time of Elon till the death of Samson.</P>

 of his great anxiety to follow out the instructions given. Blessed was

 offering, it must be presented to the Lord

 Manoah needed this instruction, for his purpose was to offer the
 prepared viands to him, not as the Lord, but as what he imagined him to 
 be, not even an angel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:16">Jud 13:16</A>),

 but a prophet or merely human messenger. It was on this account, and
 not as rejecting divine honors, that he spoke in this manner to Manoah.

 <B>saw a woman .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of the Philistines; and told his father and his
 mother, and said, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. get her for me to wife</B>--In the East parents
 did, and do in many cases still, negotiate the marriage alliances for
 their sons. During their period of ascendency, the Philistine invaders
 had settled in the towns; and the intercourse between them and the
 Israelites was often of such a friendly and familiar character as to
 issue in matrimonial relations. Moreover, the Philistines were not in
 the number of the seven devoted nations of Canaan

 <B>Samson said .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well</B>--literally,
 "she is right in mine eyes"; not by her beautiful countenance or
 handsome figure, but <I>right</I> or <I>fit for his purpose.</I> And this
 throws light on the historian's remark in reference to the resistance
 of his parents: they "knew not that it was of the Lord, that he sought
 an occasion against the Philistines"--rather, "<I>from</I> the
 Philistines"--originating on their side. The Lord, by a course of
 retributive proceedings, was about to destroy the Philistine power, and
 the means which He meant to employ was not the forces of a numerous
 army, as in the case of the preceding judges, but the miraculous prowess
 of the single-handed champion of Israel. In these circumstances, the
 provocation to hostilities could only spring out of a <I>private</I> quarrel, and this marriage scheme was doubtless suggested by the secret
 influence of the Spirit as the best way of accomplishing the intended
 result.</P>

 <B>5-9. a young lion</B>--<I>Hebrew,</I> a lion in the pride of his youthful
 prime. The wild mountain passes of Judah were the lairs of savage
 beasts; and most or all the "lions" of Scripture occur in that wild
 country. His rending and killing the shaggy monster, without any weapon
 in his hand, were accomplished by that superhuman courage and strength
 which the <I>occasional</I> influences of the Spirit enabled him to put
 forth, and by the exertion of which, in such private incidental
 circumstances, he was gradually trained to confide in them for the more
 public work to which he was destined.</P>

 of a year, the usual interval between the ceremonies of betrothal and
 marriage. It was spent by the bride elect with her parents in
 preparation for the nuptials; and at the proper time the bridegroom
 returned to take her home.

 <B>he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was

 together with the influences of the solar rays, would, in a few months,
 put the carcass in a state inviting to such cleanly animals as bees.</P>

 men and women were probably entertained in separate apartments--the
 bride, with her female relatives, at her parents' house; Samson, in
 some place obtained for the occasion, as he was a stranger. A large
 number of paranymphs, or "friends of the bridegroom," furnished, no
 doubt, by the bride's family, attended his party, ostensibly to honor
 the nuptials, but really as spies on his proceedings.</P>

 honey in the lion's carcass. The prize he offered was thirty <I>sindinim,</I> or shirts, and thirty changes of garments, probably woolen. Three days
 were passed in vain attempts to unravel the enigma. The festive week
 was fast drawing to a close when they secretly enlisted the services of
 the newly married wife, who having got the secret, revealed it to her

 not only oxen but cows and heifers were, and continue to be, employed
 in dragging the plough. Divested of metaphor, the meaning is taken by
 some in a criminal sense, but probably means no more than that they had
 resorted to the aid of his wife--an unworthy expedient, which might
 have been deemed by a man of less noble spirit and generosity as
 releasing him from the obligation to fulfil his bargain.</P>

 town was about twenty-four miles west by southwest from Timnah; and his
 selection of this place, which was dictated by the Divine Spirit, was
 probably owing to its bitter hostility to Israel.

 of communicating during the festivities between him and his bride. The
 acceptance of her hand, therefore, was an act of base treachery, that
 could not fail to provoke the just resentment of Samson.</P>

 animal between a wolf and a fox, which, unlike our fox, a solitary
 creature, prowls in large packs or herds and abounds in the mountains
 of Palestine. The collection of so great a number would require both
 time and assistance.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>took firebrands</B>--torches or matches which would burn slowly,
 retaining the fire, and blaze fiercely when blown by the wind. He put
 two jackals together, tail by tail, and fastened tightly a fire match
 between them. At nightfall he lighted the firebrand and sent each pair
 successively down from the hills, into the "Shefala," or plain of
 Philistia, lying on the borders of Dan and Judah, a rich and extensive
 corn district. The pain caused by the fire would make the animals toss
 about to a wide extent, kindling one great conflagration. But no one
 could render assistance to his neighbor: the devastation was so
 general, the panic would be so great.</P>

 provoked such an extraordinary retaliation, soon became known; and the
 sufferers, enraged by the destruction of their crops, rushing with
 tumultuous fury to the house of Samson's wife, "burnt her and her
 father with fire." This was a remarkable retribution. To avoid this
 menace, she had betrayed her husband; and by that unprincipled conduct,
 eventually exposed herself to the horrid doom which, at the sacrifice
 of conjugal fidelity, she had sought to escape

 <B>and spread themselves in Lehi</B>--now El-Lekieh, abounding with 
 limestone cliffs; the sides of which are perforated with caves. The 
 object of the Philistines in this expedition was to apprehend Samson, 
 in revenge for the great slaughter he had committed on their people. 
 With a view of freeing his own countrymen from all danger from the 
 infuriated Philistines, he allowed himself to be bound and surrendered 
 a fettered prisoner into their power. Exulting with joy at the near 
 prospect of riddance from so formidable an enemy, they went to meet 
 him. But he exerted his superhuman strength, and finding a new (or
 moist) jawbone of an ass, he laid hold of it, and with no other weapon, 
 slew a thousand men at a place which he called Ramath-lehi--that is, 
 "the hill of the jawbone."</P>

 <B>1, 2. Gaza</B>--now Guzzah, the capital of the largest of the five
 Philistine principal cities, about fifteen miles southwest of Ashkelon.
 The object of this visit to this city is not recorded, and unless he
 had gone in disguise, it was a perilous exposure of his life in one of
 the enemy's strongholds. It soon became known that he was there; and it
 was immediately resolved to secure him. But deeming themselves certain
 of their prey, the Gazites deferred the execution of their measure till
 the morning.</P>

 the city</B>--A ruinous pile of masonry is still pointed out as the site
 of the gate. It was probably a part of the town wall, and as this ruin

 Hebron"; for otherwise Samson, had he run night and day from the time
 of his flight from Gaza, could only have come on the evening of the
 following day within sight of the city of Hebron. The city of Gaza was,
 in those days, probably not less than three-quarters of an hour distant
 from El-Montar. To have climbed to the top of this hill with the
 ponderous doors and their bolts on his shoulders, through a road of
 thick sand, was a feat which none but a Samson could have accomplished

 wholly of wood. The standing place for the spectators is a wooden floor
 resting upon two pillars and rising on an inclined plane, so as to
 enable all to have a view of the area in the center. In the middle
 there are two large beams, on which the whole weight of the structure

 in fact, as dying for his country's cause. His death was not designed
 or sought, except as it might be the inevitable consequence of his
 great effort. His prayer must have been a silent ejaculation, and, from

 neither attempted to prevent the removal of Samson's corpse, nor to
 molest the Israelites for a long time after. Thus the Israelitish hero
 rendered by his strength and courage signal services to his country,
 and was always regarded as the greatest of its champions. But his
 slavish subjection to the domination of his passions was unworthy of so
 great a man and lessens our respect for his character. Yet he is ranked
 among the ancient worthies who maintained a firm faith in God

 This and the other narratives that follow form a miscellaneous
 collection, or appendix to the Book of Judges. It belongs to a period
 when the Hebrew nation was in a greatly disordered and corrupt state.
 This episode of Micah is connected with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:34">Jud 1:34</A>.

 It relates to his foundation of a small sanctuary of his own--a
 miniature representation of the Shiloh tabernacle--which he stocked 
 with images modelled probably in imitation of the ark and cherubim. 
 Micah and his mother were sincere in their intention to honor God. But 
 their faith was blended with a sad amount of ignorance and delusion. 
 The divisive course they pursued, as well as the will-worship they 
 practised, subjected the perpetrators to the penalty of death.</P>

 Probably the expense of making two such figures of silver, with their
 appurtenances (pedestals, bases, &c.), might easily cost, in those 
 days, two hundred shekels, which (at 2 shillings, 4 pence each, is
 about 23 pounds) would be a sum not adequate to the formation of large

 <B>1-6. In those days .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Danites sought them an inheritance to
 dwell in</B>--The Danites had a territory assigned them as well as the
 other tribes. But either through indolence, or a lack of energy, they
 did not acquire the full possession of their allotment, but suffered a
 considerable portion of it to be wrested out of their hands by the
 encroachments of their powerful neighbors, the Philistines. In
 consequence, being straitened for room, a considerable number resolved
 on trying to effect a new and additional settlement in a remote part of
 the land. A small deputation, being despatched to reconnoitre the
 country, arrived on their progress northward at the residence of Micah.
 Recognizing his priest as one of their former acquaintances, or perhaps
 by his provincial dialect, they eagerly enlisted his services in
 ascertaining the result of their present expedition. His answer, though
 apparently promising, was delusive, and really as ambiguous as those of
 the heathen oracles. This application brings out still more clearly
 and fully than the schism of Micah the woeful degeneracy of the times.
 The Danites expressed no emotions either of surprise or of indignation
 at a Levite daring to assume the priestly functions, and at the
 existence of a rival establishment to that of Shiloh. They were ready
 to seek, through means of the teraphim, the information that could only
 be lawfully applied for through the high priest's Urim. Being thus
 equally erroneous in their views and habits as Micah, they show the low
 state of religion, and how much superstition prevailed in all parts of
 the land.</P>

 supposed to have been peopled by a colony of Zidonians.  The place was
 very secluded--the soil rich in the abundance and variety of its 
 produce, and the inhabitants, following the peaceful pursuits of 
 agriculture, lived in their fertile and sequestered valley, according 
 to the Zidonian style of ease and security, happy among themselves, and 
 maintaining little or no communication with the rest of the world. The 
 discovery of this northern paradise seemed, to the delight of the 
 Danite spies, an accomplishment of the priest's prediction. They 
 hastened back to inform their brethren in the south both of the value 
 of their prize, and how easily it could be made their prey.</P>

 <B>11-21. there went from thence of the family of the Danites .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. six
 hundred men</B>--This was the collective number of the men who were
 equipped with arms to carry out this expeditionary enterprise, without
 including the families and furniture of the emigrants 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:21">Jud 18:21</A>).

 Their journey led them through the territory of Judah, and their first
 halting place was "behind," that is, on the west of Kirjath-jearim, on
 a spot called afterwards "the camp of Dan." Prosecuting the northern
 route, they skirted the base of the Ephraimite hills. On approaching
 the neighborhood of Micah's residence, the spies having given
 information that a private sanctuary was kept there, the priest of
 which had rendered them important service when on their exploring
 expedition, it was unanimously agreed that both he and the furniture of
 the establishment would be a valuable acquisition to their proposed
 settlement. A plan of spoliation was immediately formed. While the
 armed men stood sentinels at the gates, the five spies broke into the
 chapel, pillaged the images and vestments, and succeeded in bribing the
 priest also by a tempting offer to transfer his services to their new
 colony. Taking charge of the ephod, the teraphim, and the graven image,
 he "went in the midst of the people"--a central position assigned him
 in the march, perhaps for his personal security; but more probably in
 imitation of the place appointed for the priests and the ark, in the
 middle of the congregated tribes, on the marches through the
 wilderness. This theft presents a curious medley of low morality and
 strong religious feeling. The Danites exemplified a deep-seated
 principle of our nature--that men have religious affections, which must
 have an object on which these may be exercised, while they are often
 not very discriminating in the choice of the objects. In proportion to
 the slender influence religion wields over the heart, the greater is
 the importance attached to external rites; and in the exact observance
 of these, the conscience is fully satisfied, and seldom or never
 molested by reflections on the breach of minor morals.</P>

 gathered together</B>--The robbers of the chapel being soon detected, a
 hot pursuit was forthwith commenced by Micah, at the head of a
 considerable body of followers. The readiness with which they joined in
 the attempt to recover the stolen articles affords a presumption that
 the advantages of the chapel had been open to all in the neighborhood;
 and the importance which Micah, like Laban, attached to his teraphim,
 is seen by the urgency with which he pursued the thieves, and the risk
 of his life in attempting to procure their restoration.
 Finding his party, however, not a match for the Danites, he

 anarchy and prevailing disorder.

 <B>a certain Levite .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. took to him a concubine</B>--The priests under
 the Mosaic law enjoyed the privilege of marrying as well as other
 classes of the people. It was no disreputable connection this Levite
 had formed; for a nuptial engagement with a concubine wife (though, as
 wanting in some outward ceremonies, it was reckoned a secondary or
 inferior relationship) possessed the true essence of marriage; it was
 not only lawful, but sanctioned by the example of many good men.</P>

 arrived at the house of his father-in-law, who rejoiced to meet him, in
 the hope that a complete reconciliation would be brought about between
 his daughter and her husband. The Levite, yielding to the hospitable
 importunities of his father-in-law, prolonged his stay for days.</P>

 advice of his attendant to enter it and determined rather to press 
 forward to pass the night in Gibeah, which he knew was occupied by 
 Israelites. The distance from Beth-lehem to Jerusalem is about six 
 miles. The event showed that it would have been better to have followed

 of Palestine at this remote period could not, it seems, furnish any
 establishment in the shape of an inn or public lodging-house. Hence we
 conclude that the custom, which is still frequently witnessed in the
 cities of the East, was then not uncommon, for travellers who were late
 in arriving and who had no introduction to a private family, to spread
 their bedding in the streets, or wrapping themselves up in their
 cloaks, pass the night in the open air. In the Arab towns and villages,
 however, the sheik, or some other person, usually comes out and
 urgently invites the strangers to his house. This was done also in
 ancient Palestine

 <B>19, 20. there is no want of any thing</B>--In answering the kindly
 inquiries of the old man, the Levite deemed it right to state that he
 was under no necessity of being burdensome on anyone, for he possessed
 all that was required to relieve his wants. Oriental travellers always
 carry a stock of provisions with them; and knowing that even the khans
 or lodging-houses they may find on their way afford nothing beyond rest
 and shelter, they are careful to lay in a supply of food both for
 themselves and their beasts. Instead of hay, which is seldom met with,
 they used chopped straw, which, with a mixture of barley, beans, or the
 like, forms the provender for cattle. The old man, however, in the
 warmth of a generous heart, refused to listen to any explanation, and
 bidding the Levite keep his stocks for any emergency that might occur
 in the remainder of his journey, invited them to accept of the
 hospitalities of his house for the night.</P>

 appeared incredible, did it not rest on the testimony of the sacred

 consequence of the immense sensation the horrid tragedy of Gibeah had
 produced, a national assembly was convened, at which "the chief of all
 the people" from all parts of the land, including the eastern tribes,
 appeared as delegates.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Mizpeh</B>--the place of convention (for there were other Mizpehs),
 was in a town situated on the confines of Judah and Benjamin

 and it was but a short distance from Shiloh. The phrase, "unto the
 Lord," may be taken in its usual sense, as denoting consultation of the 
 oracle. This circumstance, together with the convention being called 
 "the assembly of the people of God," seems to indicate, that amid the 
 excited passions of the nation, those present felt the profound gravity

 tragic outrage, from which it appears that force was used, which he
 could not resist. His testimony was doubtless corroborated by those of
 his servant and the old Ephraimite. There was no need of strong or
 highly colored description to work upon the feelings of the audience.
 The facts spoke for themselves and produced one common sentiment of
 detestation and vengeance.</P>

 out in many parts, the people were sound at the core; and remembering
 their national covenant with God, they now felt the necessity of wiping
 out so foul a stain on their character as a people. It was resolved
 that the inhabitants of Gibeah should be subjected to condign
 punishment. But the resolutions were conditional. For as the common
 law of nature and nations requires that an inquiry should be made and
 satisfaction demanded, before committing an act of hostility or
 vengeance, messengers were despatched through the whole territory of
 Benjamin, demanding the immediate surrender or execution of the
 delinquents. The request was just and reasonable; and by refusing it
 the Benjamites virtually made themselves a party in the quarrel. It
 must not be supposed that the people of this tribe were insensible or
 indifferent to the atrocious character of the crime that had been
 committed on their soil. But their patriotism or their pride was
 offended by the hostile demonstration of the other tribes. The passions
 were inflamed on both sides; but certainly the Benjamites incurred an
 awful responsibility by the attitude of resistance they assumed.</P>

 of a leather thong, broad in the middle, with a loop at one end, by
 which it was firmly held with the hand; the other end terminated in a
 lash, which was let slip when the stone was thrown. Those skilled in
 the use of it, as the Benjamites were, could hit the mark with unerring
 certainty. A good sling could carry its full force to the distance of
 two hundred yards.</P>

 done it at the commencement of their proceedings. Instead of this, all
 their plans were formed, and never doubting, it would seem, that the
 war was just and inevitable, the only subject of their inquiry related
 to the precedency of the tribes--a point which it is likely was
 discussed in the assembly. Had they asked counsel of God sooner, their
 expedition would have been conducted on a different principle--most
 probably by reducing the number of fighting men, as in the case of
 Gideon's army. As it was, the vast number of volunteers formed an
 excessive and unwieldy force, unfit for strenuous and united action
 against a small, compact, and well-directed army. A panic ensued, and
 the confederate tribes, in two successive engagements, sustained great
 losses. These repeated disasters (notwithstanding their attack on
 Benjamin had been divinely authorized) overwhelmed them with shame and
 sorrow. Led to reflection, they became sensible of their guilt in not
 repressing their national idolatries, as well as in too proudly relying
 on their superior numbers and the precipitate rashness of this
 expedition. Having humbled themselves by prayer and fasting, as well as
 observed the appointed method of expiating their sins, they were
 assured of acceptance as well as of victory. The presence and services
 of Phinehas on this occasion help us to ascertain the chronology thus
 far, that the date of the occurrence must be fixed shortly after the
 death of Joshua.</P>

 men</B>--On comparing this with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:35">Jud 20:35</A>,

 it will be seen that the loss is stated here in round numbers and is
 confined only to that of the third day. We must conclude that a 
 thousand had fallen during the two previous engagements, in order to 
 make the aggregate amount given

 <B>48. the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and
 smote them with the edge of the sword</B>--This frightful vengeance,
 extending from Gibeah to the whole territory of Benjamin, was executed
 under the impetuous impulse of highly excited passions. But doubtless
 the Israelites were only the agents of inflicting the righteous
 retributions of God; and the memory of this terrible crisis, which led
 almost to the extermination of a whole tribe, was conducive to the
 future good of the whole nation.</P>

 <B>2-5. the people came to the house of God, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and lifted up their
 voices, and wept sore</B>--The characteristic fickleness of the Israelites
 was not long in being displayed; for scarcely had they cooled from the
 fierceness of their sanguinary vengeance, than they began to relent and
 rushed to the opposite extreme of self-accusation and grief at the
 desolation which their impetuous zeal had produced. Their victory
 saddened and humbled them. Their feelings on the occasion were
 expressed by a public and solemn service of expiation at the house of
 God. And yet this extraordinary observance, though it enabled them to
 find vent for their painful emotions, did not afford them full relief,
 for they were fettered by the obligation of a religious vow, heightened
 by the addition of a solemn anathema on every violator of the oath.
 There is no previous record of this oath; but the purport of it was,
 that they would treat the perpetrators of this Gibeah atrocity in the
 same way as the Canaanites, who were doomed to destruction; and the
 entering into this solemn league was of a piece with the rest of their
 inconsiderate conduct in this whole affair.</P>

 <B>6. There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day</B>--that is, in danger
 of becoming extinct; for, as it appears from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+21:7">Jud 21:7</A>,

 they had massacred all the women and children of Benjamin, and six
 hundred men alone survived of the whole tribe. The prospect of such a 
 blank in the catalogue of the twelve tribes, such a gap in the national 
 arrangements, was too painful to contemplate, and immediate measures 
 must be taken to prevent this great catastrophe.</P>

 <B>8. there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly</B>--This
 city lay within the territory of eastern Manasseh, about fifteen miles
 east of the Jordan, and was, according to J<FONT SIZE=-1>OSEPHUS</FONT>, the capital of
 Gilead. The ban which the assembled tribes had pronounced at Mizpeh
 seemed to impose on them the necessity of punishing its inhabitants for
 not joining the crusade against Benjamin; and thus, with a view of
 repairing the consequences of one rash proceeding, they hurriedly
 rushed to the perpetration of another, though a smaller tragedy. But it
 appears 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+21:11">Jud 21:11</A>)

 that, besides acting in fulfilment of their oath, the Israelites had
 the additional object by this raid of supplying wives to the Benjamite 
 remnant. This shows the intemperate fury of the Israelites in the 
 indiscriminate slaughter of the women and children.</P>

 <B>16. the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for

 provision must be made for transmitting it to their legitimate heirs,

 the opportunity for which was afforded by the approaching festival--a
 feast generally supposed to be the feast of tabernacles. This, like the 
 other annual feasts, was held in Shiloh, and its celebration was 
 attended with more social hilarity and holiday rejoicings than the 
 other feasts.</P>

 <B>21, 22. daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances</B>--The dance was
 anciently a part of the religious observance. It was done on festive
 occasions, as it is still in the East, not in town, but in the open
 air, in some adjoining field, the women being by themselves. The young
 women being alone indulging their light and buoyant spirits, and
 apprehensive of no danger, facilitated the execution of the scheme of
 seizing them, which closely resembles the Sabine rape in Roman history.
 The elders undertook to reconcile the families to the forced abduction
 of their daughters. And thus the expression of their public sanction to
 this deed of violence afforded a new evidence of the evils and
 difficulties into which the unhappy precipitancy of the Israelites in
 this crisis had involved them.</P>
