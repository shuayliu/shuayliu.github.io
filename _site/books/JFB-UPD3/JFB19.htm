 The Hebrew title of this book is <I>Tehilim</I> ("praises" or "hymns"),
 for a leading feature in its contents is <I>praise,</I> though the word
 occurs in the title of only one Psalm (the hundred forty-fifth). The
 Greek title (in the Septuagint, a translation made two hundred years
 before Christ) is <I>psalmoi,</I> whence our word "Psalms." This corresponds
 to the Hebrew word <I>mizmoi</I> by which sixty-five Psalms are designated
 in their inscriptions, and which the Syriac, a language like the
 Hebrew, uses for the whole book. It means, as does also the Greek name,
 an ode, or song, whose singing is accompanied by an instrument,
 particularly the harp (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:4-8,2Ch+5:12,13">1Ch 16:4-8;
 2Ch 5:12, 13</A>). 

 To some Psalms, the Hebrew word (<I>shir</I>) "a song," is prefixed.
 Paul seems to allude to all these terms in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:19">Eph 5:19</A>,

 "singing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in <I>psalms, hymns,</I> and spiritual
 <I>songs.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>ITLES.</FONT>--To more than a hundred Psalms are prefixed inscriptions,
 which give one or more (and in one case, [Psalm 60], all) of these
 particulars: the direction to the musician, the name of the author or
 the instrument, the style of the music or of the poetry, the subject or
 occasion. The authority of these inscriptions has been disputed by some
 writers. They say that the earliest translators, as the Greek and
 Syriac, evince a disregard for their authority, by variations from a
 proper translation of some, altering others, and, in several instances,
 supplying titles to Psalms which, in Hebrew, had none. It is also
 alleged that the subject of a Psalm, as given in the title, is often
 inconsistent with its contents. But those translators have also varied
 from a right translation of many passages in the Bible, which all agree
 to be of good authority; and the alleged inconsistency may be shown, on
 more accurate investigation, not to exist. The admitted antiquity of
 these inscriptions, on the other hand, and even their obscurity, raise
 a presumption in their favor, while such prefaces to a composition
 accord with the usages of that age and part of the world (compare
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:9">Isa 38:9</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 "The Chief Musician" was the superintendent of the music (compare
 "to oversee,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:21">1Ch 15:21</A>,

 <I>Margin</I>). "To" prefixed to this, means, "pertaining to" in his 
 official character. This inscription is found in fifty-three Psalms and 
 is attached to Habakkuk's prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:1-19">Hab 3:1-19</A>).

 The same Hebrew preposition is prefixed to the name of the author and 
 translated "of," as "a Psalm <I>of</I> David," "<I>of</I> Asaph," 
 except that to "the sons of Korah," it is translated "for," which is 
 evidently wrong, as the usual direction, "to the chief musician," is 
 given, and no other authorship intimated. On the apparent exception to 
 this last remark, see below, and see on

 <A HREF="#Ps88_1">Ps 88:1</A>,

 title. The explanations of other particulars in the titles will be 
 given as they occur.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHORS.</FONT>--This book is often called "The Psalms of David," he being
 the only author mentioned in the New Testament 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:42">Lu 20:42</A>)

 and his name appearing in more titles than that of any other writer.
 Besides about one-half of the Psalms in which it thus appears, Psalms 2
 and 95 are ascribed to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:25,Heb+4:7">Ac 4:25
 and Heb 4:7</A>). 

 He was probably the author of many others which appear without a name. 
 He used great efforts to beautify the worship of the sanctuary. Among 
 the two hundred eighty-eight Levites he appointed for singing and 
 performing instrumental music, we find mentioned the "sons of Korah"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:19">1Ch 9:19</A>);
 
 including Heman 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:33-38">1Ch 6:33-38</A>);
 
 and also Asaph

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:39-44">1Ch 6:39-44</A>);
 
 and Ethan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:17-19">1Ch 15:17-19</A>).

 God was doubtless pleased to endow these men with the inspiration of 
 His Spirit, so that they used those poetic talents which their 
 connection with the kindred art of music had led them to cultivate, in 
 the production of compositions like those of their king and patron. To 
 Asaph are ascribed twelve Psalms; to the sons of Korah, eleven, 
 including the eighty-eighth, which is also ascribed to Heman, that 
 being the only instance in which the name of the "son" (or descendant) 
 is mentioned; and to Ethan, one. Solomon's name appears before the 
 seventy-second and hundred twenty-seventh; and that of Moses before the 
 ninetieth. Special questions respecting authorship will be explained as 
 they arise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ONTENTS.</FONT>--As the book contains one hundred fifty independent
 compositions, it is not susceptible of any logical analysis. The Jews
 having divided it into five books, corresponding to the Five Books of
 Moses (First, Psalms 1-42; Second, Psalms 43-72; Third, Psalms 73-89;
 Fourth, Psalms 90-106; Fifth, Psalms 107-150), many attempts have been
 made to discover, in this division, some critical or practical value,
 but in vain. Sundry efforts have been made to classify the Psalms by
 subject. <I>Angus' Bible Hand Book</I> is perhaps the most useful, and is
 appended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Still the Psalms have a form and character peculiar to themselves;
 and with individual diversities of style and subject, they all
 assimilate to that form, and together constitute a consistent system of
 moral truth. They are all poetical, and of that peculiar parallelism
 (see

 <A HREF="JFB00B.htm"><I>Introduction to the Poetical Books</I></A>,) 

 which distinguished Hebrew poetry. They are all lyrical, or songs 
 adapted to musical instruments, and all religious lyrics, or such as 
 were designed to be used in the sanctuary worship.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The distinguishing feature of the Psalms is their devotional
 character. Whether their matter be didactic, historical, prophetical,
 or practical, it is made the ground or subject of prayer, or praise, or
 both. The doctrines of theology and precepts of pure morality are here
 inculcated. God's nature, attributes, perfections, and works of
 creation, providence, and grace, are unfolded. In the sublimest
 conceptions of the most exalted verse, His glorious supremacy over the
 principalities of heaven, earth, and hell, and His holy, wise, and
 powerful control of all material and immaterial agencies, are
 celebrated. The great covenant of grace resting on the fundamental
 promise of a Redeemer, both alike the provisions of God's exhaustless
 mercy, is set forth in respect of the doctrines of regeneration by the
 Spirit, forgiveness of sins, repentance toward God, and faith toward
 Jesus Christ, while its glorious results, involving the salvation of
 men "from the ends of the earth" 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:47">Ac 13:47</A>],

 are proclaimed in believing, prophetic prayer and thankful praise. The 
 personal history of the authors, and especially David's in its 
 spiritual aspects, is that of God's people generally. Christian 
 biography is edifying only as it is truth illustrated in experience, 
 such as God's Word and Spirit produce. It may be factitious in origin 
 and of doubtful authenticity.  But here the experience of the truly 
 pious is detailed, under divine influence, and "in words which the Holy 
 Ghost" taught

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:13">1Co 2:13</A>].
 
 The whole inner life of the pious man is laid open, and Christians of
 all ages have here the temptations, conflicts, perplexities, doubts,
 fears, penitent moanings, and overwhelming griefs on the one hand, and
 the joy and hope of pardoning mercy, the victory over the seductions of
 false-hearted flatterers, and deliverance from the power of Satan on
 the other, with which to compare their own spiritual exercises. Here,
 too, are the fruits of that sovereign mercy, so often sought in earnest
 prayer, and when found, so often sung in rapturous joy, exhibited by
 patience in adversity, moderation in prosperity, zeal for God's glory,
 love for man, justice to the oppressed, holy contempt for the proud,
 magnanimity towards enemies, faithfulness towards friends, delight in
 the prosperity of Zion, and believing prayer for her enlargement and
 perpetuity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The historical summaries of the Psalms are richly instructive. God's
 choice of the patriarchs, the sufferings of the Israelites in Egypt,
 their exodus, temptations of God, rebellions and calamities in the
 wilderness, settlement in Canaan, backslidings and reformations,
 furnish illustrations of God's providential government of His people,
 individually and collectively, tending to exalt His adorable grace and
 abase human pride. But the promises and prophecies connected with these
 summaries, and elsewhere presented in the Psalms, have a far wider
 reach, exhibiting the relations of the book to the great theme of
 promise and prophecy:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT>
 M<FONT SIZE=-1>ESSIAH AND</FONT>
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>IS</FONT>
 K<FONT SIZE=-1>INGDOM.</FONT>--David was God's chosen servant to rule
 His people, as the head at once of the State and the Church, the lineal
 ancestor, "according to the flesh" 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:30,Ro+1:3">Ac 2:30;
 Ro 1:3</A>], 

 of His adorable Son, and His type, in His official relations, both in
 suffering and in triumph. Generally, David's trials by the ungodly
 depicted the trials of Christ, and his final success the success of
 Christ's kingdom. Typically, he uses language describing his feelings,
 which only finds its full meaning in the feelings of Christ. As such it
 is quoted and applied in the New Testament. And further, in view of the
 great promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:12-16">2Sa 7:12-16</A>)

 to him and his seed, to which such frequent reference is made in the
 Psalms, David was inspired to know, that though his earthly kingdom 
 should perish, his spiritual would ever endure, in the power, 
 beneficence, and glory of Christ's. In repeating and amplifying that 
 promise, he speaks not only as a type, but "being a prophet, and 
 knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of 
 his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on 
 his throne," he "foretold the sufferings of Christ and the glory that 
 should follow. His incarnation, humiliating sorrows, persecution, and 
 cruel death are disclosed in the plaintive cries of a despairing 
 sufferer; and His resurrection and ascension, His eternal priesthood, 
 His royal dignity, His prophetical office, the purchase and bestowal of 
 the gifts of the Spirit, the conversion of the nations, the 
 establishment, increase, and perpetuity of the Church, the end of time, 
 and the blessedness of the righteous who acknowledge, and the ruin of 
 the wicked who reject this King in Zion, are predicted in the language 
 of assured confidence and joy." While these great themes have supplied 
 the people of God with a popular theology and a guide in religious 
 experience and Christian morality, clothed in the language of devotion, 
 they have provided an inspired liturgy in which the pious, of all 
 creeds and sects, have, for nearly three thousand years, poured out 
 their prayers and praises. The pious Jew, before the coming of Christ, 
 mourned over the adversity, or celebrated the future glories, of Zion, 
 in the words of her ancient king. Our Saviour, with His disciples, sang 
 one of these hymns on the night on which He was betrayed

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:30">Mt 26:30</A>];

 He took from one the words in which He uttered the dreadful sorrows of 
 His soul

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:46">Mt 27:46</A>],

 and died with those of another on His lips

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:46">Lu 23:46</A>].
 
 Paul and Silas in the dungeon

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:25">Ac 16:25</A>],

 primitive Christians in their covert places of worship, or the costly 
 churches of a later day, and the scattered and feeble Christian flocks 
 in the prevalence of darkness and error through the Middle Ages, fed 
 their faith and warmed their love with these consoling songs. Now, 
 throughout the Christian world, in untold forms of version, paraphrase, 
 and imitation, by Papists and Protestants, Prelatists and 
 Presbyterians, Independents, Baptists, Methodists--men of all lands and 
 all creeds, in public and private worship, God is still adored in the 
 sentiments expressed in these venerable Psalms.  From the tone of 
 sorrow and suffering which pervade their earlier portions we are 
 gradually borne on amid alternate conflicts and triumphs, mournful 
 complaints and awakening confidence; as we approach the close the tones 
 of sorrow grow feebler, and those of praise wax louder and 
 stronger--till, in the exulting strains of the last Psalm, the chorus 
 of earth mingles with the hallelujahs of the multitude, which no man 
 can number, in the sanctuary above.</P>

 The character and condition, and the present and future destiny, of the
 pious and the wicked are described and contrasted, teaching that true
 piety is the source of ultimate happiness, and sin of misery. As this

 Though the warlike events of David's reign may have suggested its
 imagery, the scenes depicted and the subjects presented can only find a 
 fulfilment in the history and character of Jesus Christ, to which, as 
 above cited and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:5,5:5">Heb 1:5; 5:5</A>,

 the New Testament writers most distinctly testify. In a most animated
 and highly poetical style, the writer, in "four stanzas of three verses 
 each," sets forth the inveterate and furious, though futile, hostility 
 of men to God and His anointed, God's determination to carry out His 
 purpose, that purpose as stated more fully by His Son, the 
 establishment of the Mediatorial kingdom, and the imminent danger of 
 all who resist, as well as the blessing of all who welcome this mighty 
 and triumphant king.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1. Why do the heathen,</B> &c.--Beholding, in prophetic vision, the
 peoples and nations, as if in a tumultuous assembly, raging with a fury
 like the raging of the sea, designing to resist God's government, the
 writer breaks forth into an exclamation in which are mingled surprise
 at their folly, and indignation at their rebellion.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>heathen</B>--nations generally, not as opposed to Jews.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>the people</B>--or, literally, "peoples," or races of men.</P>

 <A NAME="Ps2_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>set themselves</B>--take a stand.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>take counsel</B>--literally, "sit together," denoting their deliberation.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>anointed</B>--<I>Hebrew,</I> "Messiah"; <I>Greek</I>, "Christ" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:41">Joh 1:41</A>).
 
 Anointing, as an emblem of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, was conferred
 on prophets 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:1">Isa 6:1</A>);

 While the prophet has in view men's opposition generally, he here

 great trial. Pilate and Herod, and the rulers of the Jews

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:14">2Sa 7:14</A>,

 "he shall be My son," is a solemn recognition of this relation. The 
 interpretation of this passage to describe the inauguration of Christ

 divine nature. In 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:33">Ac 13:33</A>,

 Paul's quotation does not imply an application of this passage to the 
 resurrection; for "raised up" in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:32">Ac 13:32</A>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:30,3:22">Ac 2:30; 3:22</A>,

 allusion is made to His death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:4">Ro 1:4</A>).

 That passage says He was declared as to His divine nature to be the Son
 of God, by the resurrection, and only teaches that that event
 manifested a truth already existing. A similar recognition of His
 Sonship is introduced in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:5">Heb 5:5</A>,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:10">Ps 65:10</A>).

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5-8.</B> God has placed man next in dignity to angels, and but a little
 lower, and has crowned him with the empire of the world.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:5,45:3">Ps 21:5; 45:3</A>).
 
 The position assigned man is that described

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:26-28">Ge 1:26-28</A>)

 as belonging to Adam, in his original condition, the terms employed in
 detailing the subjects of man's dominion corresponding with those there
 used. In a modified sense, in his present fallen state, man is still
 invested with some remains of this original dominion. It is very
 evident, however, by the apostle's inspired expositions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:6-8,1Co+15:27,28">Heb 2:6-8;
 1Co 15:27, 28</A>)

 that the language here employed finds its fulfilment only in the final
 exaltation of Christ's human nature. There is no limit to the "all
 things" mentioned, God only excepted, who "puts all things under." Man,
 in the person and glorious destiny of Jesus of Nazareth, the second
 Adam, the head and representative of the race, will not only be
 restored to his original position, but exalted far beyond it. "The last
 enemy, death," through fear of which, man, in his present estate, is
 "all his lifetime in bondage"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:15">Heb 2:15</A>],

 "shall be destroyed" 
 
 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:26">1Co 15:26</A>].

 Then <I>all things</I> will have been put under his feet,
 "principalities and powers being made subject to him"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:22">1Pe 3:22</A>].

 This view, so far from being alien from the scope of the passage, is
 more consistent than any other; for man as a race cannot well be 
 conceived to have a higher honor put upon him than to be thus exalted 
 in the person and destiny of Jesus of Nazareth. And at the same time, 
 by no other of His glorious manifestations has God more illustriously 
 declared those attributes which distinguish His name than in the scheme 
 of redemption, of which this economy forms such an important and 
 essential feature. In the generic import of the language, as describing 
 man's present relation to the works of God's hands, it may be regarded 
 as typical, thus allowing not only the usual application, but also this 
 higher sense which the inspired writers of the New Testament have 
 assigned it.</P>

 Such a change of the letter <I>m</I> for <I>b</I> was not unusual. The 
 position of this word in connection with the author's name, being that 
 usually occupied by some term, such as Psalm or song, denoting the 
 style or matter of the composition, favors this view of its meaning, 
 though we know not why this and Psalms 56-60 should be specially, 
 called "a writing." "A golden (Psalm)," or "a memorial" are 
 explanations proposed by some--neither of which, however applicable 
 here, appears adapted to the other Psalms where the term occurs. 
 According to Peter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:25">Ac 2:25</A>)
 
 and Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:35">Ac 13:35</A>),

 this Psalm relates to Christ and expresses the feelings of His human 
 nature, in view of His sufferings and victory over death and the grave, 
 including His subsequent exaltation at the right hand of God. Such was 
 the exposition of the best earlier Christian interpreters. Some moderns 
 have held that the Psalm relates exclusively to David; but this view is 
 expressly contradicted by the apostles; others hold that the language 
 of the Psalm is applicable to David as a type of Christ, capable of the 
 higher sense assigned it in the New Testament. But then the language of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:10">Ps 16:10</A>

 cannot be used of David in any sense, for "he saw corruption." Others 
 again propose to refer the first part to David, and the last to Christ; 
 but it is evident that no change in the subject of the Psalm is 
 indicated.  Indeed, the person who appeals to God for help is evidently 
 the same who rejoices in having found it. In referring the whole Psalm 
 to Christ, it is, however, by no means denied that much of its language 
 is expressive of the feelings of His people, so far as in their humble 
 measure they have the feelings of trust in God expressed by Him, their 
 head and representative. Such use of His language, as recorded in His 
 last prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1-26">Joh 17:1-26</A>),

 and even that which He used in Gethsemane, under similar modifications, 
 is equally proper. The propriety of this reference of the Psalm to 
 Christ will appear in the scope and interpretation. In view of the 
 sufferings before Him, the Saviour, with that instinctive dread of 
 death manifested in Gethsemane, calls on God to "preserve" Him; He 
 avows His delight in holiness and abhorrence of the wicked and their 
 wickedness; and for "the joy that was set before Him, despising the 
 shame"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:2">Heb 12:2</A>],

 encourages Himself; contemplating the glories of the heritage appointed 
 Him. Thus even death and the grave lose their terrors in the assurance 
 of the victory to be attained and "the glory that should follow"

 <B>my goodness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thee</B>--This obscure passage is

 Thee</I>--that is, without Thee I have no other source of happiness. 
 Then, "<I>to the saints</I>," &c., means that the same privilege of

 is not inconsistent with it.</P>

 gives. The sense of the whole passage is clearly this: by the use of
 <I>flesh</I> and <I>soul,</I> the disembodied state produced by death 
 is indicated; but, on the other hand, no more than the <I>state of 
 death</I> is intended; for the last clause of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:10">Ps 16:10</A>

 is strictly parallel with the first, and <I>Holy One</I> corresponds to 
 <I>soul,</I> and <I>corruption</I> to <I>hell.</I> As <I>Holy One,</I> 
 or David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:36,37">Ac 13:36, 37</A>),

 <I>body,</I> of which only corruption can be predicated (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:31">Ac 2:31</A>);

 so, on the contrary, <I>soul,</I> which literally means the immaterial 
 part, is used for the person. The language may be thus paraphrased, "In 
 death I shall hope for resurrection; for I shall not be left under its 
 dominion and within its bounds, or be subject to the corruption which 
 ordinarily ensues."</P>

 <A NAME="Ps16_11"> </A>

 This Psalm is termed a prayer because the language of petition is
 predominant. With a just cause, sincerely presented, the writer prays
 for a just decision and help and protection. Pleading former mercies as
 a ground of hope, he urges his prayer in view of the malice, pride,
 rapacity, and selfishness of his foes, whose character is contrasted
 with his pious devotion and delight in God's favor.</P>

 "The servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1>ORD</FONT>," which in the 
 <I>Hebrew</I> precedes "David," is a significant part of the title (and 
 not a mere epithet of David), denoting the inspired character of the 
 song, as the production of one entrusted with the execution of God's 
 will. He was not favored by God because he served Him, but served Him 
 because selected and appointed by God in His sovereign mercy. After a 
 general expression of praise and confidence in God for the future, 
 David gives a sublimely poetical description of God's deliverance, 
 which he characterizes as an illustration of God's justice to the 
 innocent and His righteous government. His own prowess and success are 
 celebrated as the results of divine aid, and, confident of its 
 continuance, he closes in terms of triumphant praise.

 others than the Jews were regarded as subjects of that spiritual 
 government of which David was head, and in which character his

 In all David's successes he saw the pledges of a fulfilment of that 
 promise, and he mourned in all his adversities, not only in view of his 
 personal suffering, but because he saw in them evidences of danger to 
 the great interests which were committed to his keeping. It is in these

 The obscure words <I>Aijeleth Shahar</I> in this title have various
 explanations. Most interpreters agree in translating them by "hind of
 the morning." But great difference exists as to the meaning of these
 words. By some they are supposed (compare

 <A HREF="#Ps9_1">Ps 9:1</A>)

 to be the name of the tune to which the words of the Psalm were set; by
 others, the name of a musical instrument. Perhaps the best view is to
 regard the phrase as enigmatically expressive of the subject--the 
 sufferer being likened to a hind pursued by hunters in the early 
 morning (literally, "the dawn of day")--or that, while <I>hind</I> 
 suggests the idea of a meek, innocent sufferer, the addition of morning 
 denotes relief obtained. The feelings of a pious sufferer in sorrow and 
 deliverance are vividly portrayed. He earnestly pleads for divine aid 
 on the ground of his relation to God, whose past goodness to His people 
 encourages hope, and then on account of the imminent danger by which he 
 is threatened. The language of complaint is turned to that of rejoicing 
 in the assured prospect of relief from suffering and triumph over his 
 enemies. The use of the words of the first clause of

 as fulfilled in His history, clearly intimate the prophetical and 
 Messianic purport of the Psalm.  The intensity of the grief, and the 
 completeness and glory of the deliverance and triumph, alike appear to 
 be unsuitable representations of the fortunes of any less personage. In 
 a general and modified sense (see on

 the experience here detailed may be adapted to the case of all

 malice of his enemies with his integrity and generosity. The

 In this Psalm a celebration of God's deliverance is followed by a 
 profession of devotion to His service. Then follows a prayer for relief 
 from imminent dangers, involving the overthrow of enemies and the 
 rejoicing of sympathizing friends. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:5">Heb 10:5</A>,
 
 &c., Paul quotes
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:6-8">Ps 40:6-8</A>

 as the words of Christ, offering Himself as a better sacrifice. Some 
 suppose Paul thus accommodated David's words to express Christ's 
 sentiments. But the value of his quotation would be thus destroyed, as 
 it would have no force in his argument, unless regarded by his readers 
 as the original sense of the passage in the Old Testament. Others 
 suppose the Psalm describes David's feelings in suffering and joy; but 
 the language quoted by Paul, in the sense given by him, could not apply 
 to David in any of his relations, for as a type the language is not 
 adapted to describe any event or condition of David's career, and as an 
 individual representing the pious generally, neither he nor they could 
 properly use it (see on

 <A HREF="#Ps40_7">Ps 40:7</A>,

 below). The Psalm must be taken then, as the sixteenth, to express the 
 feelings of Christ's human nature. The difficulties pertinent to this 
 view will be considered as they occur.</P>

 prayer, and the blessed effect of it in eliciting praise from God's 
 true worshippers, teach us that Christ's suffering is our example, and 
 His deliverance our encouragement

 <B>6-8.</B> In Paul's view this passage has more meaning than the mere
 expression of grateful devotion to God's service. He represents Christ
 as declaring that the sacrifices, whether vegetable or animal, general
 or special expiatory offerings, would not avail to meet the demands of
 God's law, and that He had come to render the required satisfaction,
 which he states was effected by "the offering of the body of Christ"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:10">Heb 10:10</A>],

 for that is the "will of God" which Christ came to fulfil or do, in 
 order to effect man's redemption. We thus see that the contrast to the 
 unsatisfactory character assigned the Old Testament offerings in

 is found in the compliance with God's law (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:7,8">Ps 40:7, 8</A>).

 Of course, as Paul and other New Testament writers explain Christ's 
 work, it consisted in more than being made under the law or obeying its 
 precepts. It required an "obedience unto death"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:8">Php 2:8</A>],

 and that is the compliance here chiefly intended, and which makes the 
 contrast with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:6">Ps 40:6</A>
 
 clear.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>mine ears hast thou opened</B>--Whether allusion is made to the custom of
 boring a servant's ear, in token of voluntary and perpetual enslavement

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:6">Ex 21:6</A>),
 
 or that <I>the opening of the ear,</I> as in
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:8,50:5">Isa 48:8; 50:5</A>

 (though by a different word in <I>Hebrew</I>) denotes obedience by the
 common figure of hearing for obeying, it is evident that the clause is 
 designed to express a devotion to God's will as avowed more fully in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:8">Ps 40:8</A>,

 and already explained. Paul, however, uses the words, "a body hast thou 
 prepared me"

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:5">Heb 10:5</A>],

 which are found in the <I>Septuagint</I> in the place of the words, 
 "<I>mine</I> ears hast thou opened." He does not lay any stress on this 
 clause, and his argument is complete without it. It is, perhaps, to be 
 regarded rather as an interpretation or free translation by the 
 <I>Septuagint,</I> than either an addition or attempt at verbal 
 translation.  The <I>Septuagint</I> translators may have had reference 
 to Christ's vicarious sufferings as taught in other Scriptures, as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:4-11">Isa 53:4-11</A>;

 at all events, the sense is substantially the same, as a body was 
 essential to the required obedience (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:4,1Pe+2:24">Ro 7:4;

 The first is the sense adopted by Paul. In either case, the Pentateuch, 
 or law of Moses, is meant, and while it contains much respecting Christ 
 directly, as

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>iniquities</B>--or penal <I>afflictions,</I> and sometimes calamities in the
 wide sense. This meaning of the word is very common

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:11,38:4">Ps 31:11; 38:4</A>;

 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:13">Ge 4:13</A>,

 Cain's punishment;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:15">Ge 19:15</A>,

 Job 19:29;
 Isa 5:18; 53:11</A>).

 This meaning of the word is also favored by the clause, "taken hold of
 me," which follows, which can be said appropriately of
 <I>sufferings,</I> but not of <I>sins</I> (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:20,Ps+69:24">Job 27:20;
 Ps 69:24</A>).

 Thus, the difficulties in referring this Psalm to Christ, arising from 
 the usual reading of this verse, are removed.  Of the terrible 
 <I>afflictions,</I> or sufferings, alluded to and endured for us,
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:39-44">Lu 22:39-44</A>,

 "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>cannot look up</B>--literally, "I cannot see," not denoting the depression
 of conscious guilt, as

 The Psalmist celebrates the blessedness of those who compassionate the
 poor, conduct strongly contrasted with the spite of his enemies and
 neglect of his friends in his calamity. He prays for God's mercy in
 view of his ill desert, and, in confidence of relief, and that God will

 Psalmist recounts God's gracious dealings in former times, and the
 confidence they had learned to repose in Him. After a vivid picture of
 their calamities, he humbly expostulates against God's apparent
 forgetfulness, reminding Him of their faithfulness and mourning their
 heavy sorrows.</P>

 <A HREF="#Ps42_1">Ps 42:1</A>, 

 title) denotes the didactic character of the Psalm; that it gives 
 <I>instruction,</I> the song being of allegorical, and not literal, 
 import.  <I>The union and glories of Christ and his Church are 
 described.</I> He is addressed as a king possessed of all essential 
 graces, as a conqueror exalted on the throne of a righteous and eternal 
 government, and as a bridegroom arrayed in nuptial splendor. The Church 
 is portrayed in the purity and loveliness of a royally adorned and 
 attended bride, invited to forsake her home and share the honors of her 
 affianced lord. The picture of an Oriental wedding thus opened is 
 filled up by representing the complimentary gifts of the wealthy with 
 which the occasion is honored, the procession of the bride clothed in 
 splendid raiment, attended by her virgin companions, and the entrance 
 of the joyous throng into the palace of the king. A prediction of a 
 numerous and distinguished progeny, instead of the complimentary wish 
 for it usually expressed (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:60,Ru+4:11,12">Ge 24:60;
 Ru 4:11, 12</A>), 

 and an assurance of a perpetual fame, closes the Psalm. All ancient
 Jewish and Christian interpreters regarded this Psalm as an allegory of 
 the purport above named. In the Song of Songs the allegory is carried 
 out more fully.  Hosea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:1-3:5">Ho 1:1-3:5</A>)

 treats the relation of God and His people under the same figure, and 
 its use to set forth the relation of Christ and His Church runs through 
 both parts of the Bible (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:5,62:4,5,Mt+22:3,25:1,Joh+3:29,Eph+5:25-32">Isa 54:5; 62:4, 5;
 Mt 22:3; 25:1;
 Joh 3:29;
 Eph 5:25-32</A>,

 &c.). Other methods of exposition have been suggested. Several Jewish
 monarchs, from Solomon to the wicked Ahab, and various foreign princes, 
 have been named as the hero of the song. But to none of them can the 
 terms here used be shown to apply, and it is hardly probable that any 
 mere nuptial song, especially of a heathen king, would be permitted a 
 place in the sacred songs of the Jews. The advocates for any other than 
 the Messianic interpretation have generally silenced each other in 
 succession, while the application of the most rigorous rules of a fair 
 system of interpretation has but strengthened the evidences in its 
 favor. The scope of the Psalm above given is easy and sustained by the 
 explication of its details. The quotation of

 <B>therefore</B>--Because thus glorious, the praise shall be universal and
 perpetual. Some writers have taxed their ingenuity to find in the
 history and fortunes of Christ and His Church exact parallels for every
 part of this splendid allegory, not excepting its gorgeous Oriental
 imagery. Thus, by the dresses of the king and queen, are thought to be
 meant the eminent endowments and graces of Christ and His people. The
 attendant women, supposed (though inconsistently it might seem with the
 inspired character of the work) to be concubines, are thought to
 represent the Gentile churches, and the bride the Jewish, &c. But it
 is evident that we cannot pursue such a mode of interpretation. For,
 following the allegory, we must suspend to the distant future the
 results of a union whose consummation as a marriage is still distant
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:9">Re 21:9</A>).

 In fact, the imagery here and elsewhere sets before us the Church in 
 two aspects. As a body, it is yet incomplete, the whole is yet 
 ungathered. As a moral institution, it is yet imperfect. In the final 
 catastrophe it will be complete and perfect.  Thus, as a bride adorned, 
 &c., it will be united with its Lord. Thus the union of Christ and the 
 Church triumphant is set forth. On the other hand, in regard to its 
 component parts, the relation of Christ as head, as husband, &c., 
 already exists, and as these parts form an institution in this world, 
 it is by His union with it, and the gifts and graces with which He 
 endows it, that a spiritual seed arises and spreads in the world. Hence 
 we must fix our minds only on the <I>one simple but grand truth, that 
 Christ loves the Church, is head over all things for it, raises it in 
 His exaltation to the highest moral dignity--a dignity of which every, 
 even the meanest, sincere disciple will partake.</I> As to the
 <I>time,</I> then, in which this allegorical prophecy is to fulfilled,
 it may be said that no periods of time are specially designated. The 
 <I>characteristics</I> of the relation of Christ and His Church are 
 indicated, and we may suppose that the whole process of His exaltation 
 from the <I>declaration</I> of His Sonship, by His resurrection, to the 
 grand catastrophe of the final judgment, with all the collateral 
 blessings to the Church and the world, lay before the vision of the 
 inspired prophet.</P>

 <B>parable</B>--In <I>Hebrew</I> and <I>Greek</I> "parable" and

 <I>comparison,</I> or form of speech, which under one image includes 
 many, and is expressive of a general truth capable of various 
 illustrations. Hence it may be used for the <I>illustration itself.</I> 
 For the former sense, "proverb" (that is, one word for several) is the 
 usual English term, and for the latter, in which comparison is 
 prominent, "parable" (that is, one thing laid by another). The 
 distinction is not always observed, since here, and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:2">Ps 78:2</A>;

 "proverb" would better express the style of the composition (compare

 In the grandeur and solemnity of a divine judgment, God is introduced
 as instructing men in the nature of true worship, exposing hypocrisy,
 warning the wicked, and encouraging the pious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>1-4.</B> The description of this majestic appearance of God resembles
 that of His giving the law (compare

 amendment, and it is accompanied by a lively faith.</P>

 In great terror on account of enemies, and grieved by the treachery of
 a friend, the Psalmist offers an earnest prayer for relief. He mingles
 confident assurances of divine favor to himself with invocations and
 predictions of God's avenging judgments on the wicked. The tone suits
 David's experience, both in the times of Saul and Absalom, though
 perhaps neither was exclusively before his mind.</P>

 title), perhaps suggested by David's victories, which secured his 
 throne and gave rest to the nation. In general terms, the judgment of 
 God on the wicked, and the equity and goodness of His government to the 
 pious, are celebrated.  The sentiment is illustrated by examples of 
 God's dealings, cited from the Jewish history and related in highly 
 poetical terms. Hence the writer intimates an expectation of equal and 
 even greater triumphs and summons all nations to unite in praises of 
 the God of Israel. The Psalm is evidently typical of the relation which

 --that is, to make this hill, His people or Church, His dwelling. This 
 Psalm typifies the conquests of the Church under her divine leader, 
 Christ. He, indeed, "who was with the Church in the wilderness"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:38">Ac 7:38</A>)

 is the <I>Lord,</I> described in this ideal ascension. Hence Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8">Eph 4:8</A>)

 applies this language to describe His real ascension, when, having 
 conquered sin, death, and hell, the Lord of glory triumphantly entered 
 heaven, attended by throngs of adoring angels, to sit on the throne and 
 wield the scepter of an eternal dominion. The phrase "<I>received gifts 
 for</I> (or literally, among) <I>men</I>" is by Paul, "gave gifts to 
 men." Both describe the acts of a conqueror, who receives and 
 distributes spoils.  The Psalmist uses "receiving" as evincing the 
 success, Paul "gave" as the act, of the conqueror, who, having subdued 
 his enemies, proceeds to reward his friends. The special application of 
 the passage by Paul was in proof of Christ's exaltation. What the Old 
 Testament represents of His descending and ascending corresponds with 
 His history. He who descended is the same who has ascended. As then 
 ascension was an element of His triumph, so is it now; and He, who, in 
 His humiliation, must be recognized as our vicarious sacrifice and the 
 High Priest of our profession, must also be adored as Head of His 
 Church and author of all her spiritual benefits.</P>

 <I>For,</I> or literally, "of Solomon." The closing verse rather relates to
 the second book of Psalms, of which this is the last, and was perhaps
 added by some collector, to intimate that the collection, to which, as
 chief author, David's name was appended, was closed. In this view,
 these may consistently be the productions of others included, as of
 Asaph, sons of Korah, and Solomon; and a few of David's may be placed
 in the latter series. The fact that here the usual mode of denoting
 authorship is used, is strongly conclusive that Solomon was the author,
 especially as no stronger objection appears than what has been now set
 aside. The Psalm, in highly wrought figurative style, describes the
 reign of a king as "righteous, universal, beneficent, and perpetual."
 By the older Jewish and most modern Christian interpreters, it has been
 referred to Christ, whose reign, present and prospective, alone
 corresponds with its statements. As the imagery of the second Psalm was
 drawn from the martial character of David's reign, that of this is from
 the peaceful and prosperous state of Solomon's.</P>

 This Psalm appears to have been occasioned by the removal of the
 sanctuary from Shiloh in the tribe of Ephraim to Zion in the tribe of
 Judah, and the coincident transfer of pre-eminence in Israel from the
 former to the latter tribe, as clearly evinced by David's settlement as
 the head of the Church and nation. Though this was the execution of
 God's purpose, the writer here shows that it also proceeded from the
 divine judgment on Ephraim, under whose leadership the people had
 manifested the same sinful and rebellious character which had
 distinguished their ancestors in Egypt.</P>

 were assigned to Ephraim by Jacob 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:1">Ge 48:1</A>).

 by the selection of the first permanent locality for the ark within its
 borders at Shiloh, and by the extensive and fertile province given for 
 its possession. Traces of this prominence remained after the schism 
 under Rehoboam, in the use, by later writers, of <I>Ephraim</I> for 
 <I>Israel</I> (compare

 it appears, in this place, that it had rather led the rest in cowardice
 than courage; and had incurred God's displeasure, because, diffident of
 His promise, though often heretofore fulfilled, it had failed as a
 leader to carry out the terms of the covenant, by not driving out the
 heathen

 <I>A Prayer of the afflicted,</I> &c.--The general terms seem to denote
 the propriety of regarding the Psalm as suitably expressive of the
 anxieties of any one of David's descendants, piously concerned for the
 welfare of the Church. It was probably David's composition, and, though
 specially suggested by some peculiar trials, descriptive of future
 times. <I>Overwhelmed</I>--(compare

 as addressed to Christ in His divine nature. The scope of the Psalm, as

 The association of the Messiah with a day of future glory to the Church
 was very intimate in the minds of Old Testament writers; and with 
 correct views of His nature it is very consistent that He should be 
 addressed as the Lord and Head of His Church, who would bring about 
 that glorious future on which they ever dwelt with fond delightful 
 anticipations.</P>

 captivity, it must be regarded as an instructive celebration of God's
 praise for His merciful providence to all men in their various

 wanderings by land and sea, and famine; some as evidences of God's
 displeasure, and all the deliverances as evidence of His goodness and

 The writer complains of his virulent enemies, on whom he imprecates
 God's righteous punishment, and to a prayer for a divine interposition
 in his behalf appends the expression of his confidence and a promise of
 his praises. This Psalm is remarkable for the number and severity of its
 imprecations. Its evident typical character (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:8">Ps 109:8</A>)
 
 justifies the explanation of these already given, that as the language
 of David respecting his own enemies, or those of Christ, it has respect
 not to the penitent, but to the impenitent and implacable foes of good
 men, and of God and His cause, whose inevitable fate is thus indicated
 by inspired authority.</P>

 nothing in the position or character, personal or official, of David or
 any other descendant, to justify a reference to either, but utter
 severance from the royal office of all priestly functions (so clearly

 the beautiful vestments of the Aaronic priests

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:4">Le 16:4</A>)
 
 typified. The last very obscure clause--

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>from the womb .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. youth</B>--may, according to this view, be thus
 explained: The word "youth" denotes a period of life distinguished for
 strength and activity (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:9">Ec 11:9</A>)

 --the "dew" is a constant emblem of whatever is refreshing and 
 strengthening

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:12,Ho+14:5">Pr 19:12;
 Ho 14:5</A>).
 
 The Messiah, then, as leading His people, is represented as continually
 in the vigor of youth, refreshed and strengthened by the early dew of
 God's grace and Spirit. Thus the phrase corresponds as a member of a
 parallelism with "the day of thy power" in the first clause. "In the
 beauties of holiness" belongs to this latter clause, corresponding to
 "Thy people" in the first, and the colon after "morning" is omitted.
 Others prefer: Thy youth, or youthful vigor, or body, shall be
 constantly refreshed by successive accessions of people as dew from the
 early morning; and this accords with the New Testament idea that the
 Church is Christ's body (compare

 After invoking others to unite in praise, the writer celebrates God's
 protecting and delivering care towards him, and then represents himself
 and the people of God as entering the sanctuary and uniting in solemn
 praise, with prayer for a continued blessing. Whether composed by David
 on his accession to power, or by some later writer in memory of the
 restoration from Babylon, its tone is joyful and trusting, and, in
 describing the fortune and destiny of the Jewish Church and its visible
 head, it is typically prophetical of the Christian Church and her

 This celebrated Psalm has several peculiarities. It is divided into
 twenty-two parts or stanzas, denoted by the twenty-two letters of the
 Hebrew alphabet. Each stanza contains eight verses, and the first letter
 of each verse is that which gives name to the stanza. Its contents are
 mainly praises of God's Word, exhortations to its perusal, and reverence
 for it, prayers for its proper influence, and complaints of the wicked
 for despising it. There are but two verses 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:122,132">Ps 119:122, 132</A>)

 which do not contain some term or description of God's Word. These 
 terms are of various derivations, but here used, for the most part, 
 synonymously, though the use of a variety of terms seems designed, in 
 order to express better the several aspects in which our relations to 
 the revealed word of God are presented. The Psalm does not appear to 
 have any relation to any special occasion or interest of the Jewish 
 Church or nation, but was evidently "intended as a manual of pious 
 thoughts, especially for instructing the young, and its peculiar 
 artificial structure was probably adopted to aid the memory in 
 retaining the language."</P>
