 Z<FONT SIZE=-1>EPHANIAH,</FONT> ninth in order of the minor prophets,
 prophesied "in the days of Josiah"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:1">Zep 1:1</A>),

 that is, between 642 and 611 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT> The name
 means "Jehovah hath guarded," literally, "hidden"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:5,83:3">Ps 27:5; 83:3</A>).

 The specification in the introductory heading, of not only his father,
 but also his grandfather, and great-grandfather, and 
 great-great-grandfather, implies that the latter were persons of note, 
 or else the design was to distinguish him from another Zephaniah of 
 note at the time of the captivity. The Jews' supposition, that persons 
 recorded as a prophet's ancestors were themselves endowed with the 
 prophetic spirit, seems groundless. There is no impossibility of the 
 Hezekiah, who was Zephaniah's great-great-grandfather, being King 
 Hezekiah as to the number of generations; for Hezekiah's reign of 
 twenty-nine years, and his successor's reign of fifty-five years, admit 
 of <I>four</I> generations interposing between. Yet the omission of the 
 designation, "king of Judah," is fatal to the theory (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:1,Isa+38:9">Pr 25:1;
 Isa 38:9</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He must have flourished in the earlier part of Josiah's reign. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:13-15">Zep 2:13-15</A>

 he foretells the doom of Nineveh, which happened in 625 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>B.C.</FONT>; and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:4">Zep 1:4</A>

 he denounces various forms of idolatry, and specially that of Baal. Now 
 Josiah's reformation began in the twelfth and was completed in the 
 eighteenth year of his reign. Zephaniah, therefore, in denouncing Baal 
 worship, co-operated with that good king in his efforts, and so must 
 have prophesied somewhere between the twelfth and eighteenth years of 
 his reign. The silence of the historical books is no argument against 
 this, as it would equally apply against Jeremiah's prophetical 
 existence at the same time. Jewish tradition says that Zephaniah had 
 for his colleagues Jeremiah, whose sphere of labor was the 
 thoroughfares and market places, and Huldah the prophetess, who 
 exercised her vocation in the college in Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophecy begins with the nation's sin and the fearful retribution 
 coming at the hands of the Chaldeans. These are not mentioned by name, 
 as in Jeremiah; for the prophecies of the latter, being nearer the 
 fulfilment, become more explicit than those of an earlier date. The 
 second chapter dooms the persecuting states in the neighborhood as well 
 as Judea itself. The third chapter denounces Jerusalem, but concludes 
 with the promise of her joyful re-establishment in the theocracy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The style, though not generally sublime, is graphic and vivid in
 details (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:4-12">Zep 1:4-12</A>).

 The language is pure, and free from Aramaisms. There are occasional 
 coincidences with former prophets (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:14,Isa+34:11">Zep 2:14,
 with Isa 34:11</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:15,Isa+47:8">Zep 2:15,
 with Isa 47:8</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:10,Isa+18:1">Zep 3:10,
 with Isa 18:1</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:8,Isa+16:6">Zep 2:8,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:12,Jer+48:11">Zep 1:12,
 with Jer 48:11</A>).

 Such coincidences in part arise from the phraseology of <I>Hebrew</I>
 prophetic poetry being the common language of the inspired brotherhood. 
 The New Testament, at

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:6">Ro 15:6</A>,

 <B>the remnant of Baal</B>--the remains of Baal worship, which as yet Josiah
 was unable utterly to eradicate in remote places. Baal was the
 Ph&oelig;nician tutelary god. From the time of the Judges

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:13">Jud 2:13</A>),

 Israel had fallen into this idolatry; and Manasseh lately had set up
 this idol within Jehovah's temple itself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:3,5,7">2Ki 21:3, 5, 7</A>).

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:5">2Ki 23:5</A>,

 <I>Margin</I>) to have "put down the Chemarim." The <I>Hebrew</I> root 
 means "black" (from the <I>black garments</I> which they wore or the 
 <I>marks</I> which they branded on their foreheads); or "zealous," from 
 their idolatrous fanaticism. The very "name," as well as themselves, 
 shall be forgotten.

 It enhances the bitterness of the judgment that the heathen Chaldeans
 should be <I>sanctified,</I> or consecrated as it were, by God as His 
 priests, and be <I>called</I> to eat the flesh of the elect people; as 
 on feast days the priests used to feast among themselves on the remains

 costume, as in other respects, God would have them to be separate from 
 the nations.  G<FONT SIZE=-1>ROTIUS</FONT> refers the "strange apparel" 
 to garments forbidden by the law, for example, men's garments worn by
