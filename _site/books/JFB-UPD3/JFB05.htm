 <B>1. These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel</B>--The mental
 condition of the people generally in that infantine age of the Church,
 and the greater number of them being of young or tender years, rendered
 it expedient to repeat the laws and counsels which God had given.
 Accordingly, to furnish a recapitulation of the leading branches of
 their faith and duty was among the last public services which Moses
 rendered to Israel. The scene of their delivery was on the plains of
 Moab where the encampment was pitched

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>on this side Jordan</B>--or, as the <I>Hebrew</I> word may be rendered "on
 the bank of the Jordan."

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>in the wilderness, in the plain</B>--the Arabah, a desert plain, or steppe,
 extended the whole way from the Red Sea north to the Sea of Tiberias.
 While the high tablelands of Moab were "cultivated fields," the Jordan
 valley, at the foot of the mountains where Israel was encamped, was a
 part of the great desert plain, little more inviting than the desert of
 Arabia. The locale is indicated by the names of the most prominent
 places around it. Some of these places are unknown to us. The <I>Hebrew</I> word, <I>Suph,</I> "red" (for "sea," which our translators have inserted,
 is not in the original, and Moses was now farther from the Red Sea than ever),
 probably meant a place noted for its reeds 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:14">Nu 21:14</A>).

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Tophel</B>--identified as Tafyle or Tafeilah, lying between Bozrah and
 Kerak.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Hazeroth</B>--is a different place from that at which the Israelites
 encamped after leaving "the desert of Sinai."</P>

 <A NAME="De1_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. There are eleven days' journey from Horeb</B>--Distances are computed in
 the East still by the hours or days occupiesd by the journey. A day's
 journey on foot is about twenty miles--on camels, at the rate of three
 miles an hour, thirty miles--and by caravans, about twenty-five miles.
 But the Israelites, with children and flocks, would move at a slow
 rate. The length of the Ghor from Ezion-geber to Kadesh is a hundred
 miles. The days here mentioned were not necessarily successive days
 [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>], for the journey can be made in a much shorter period. But
 this mention of the <I>time</I> was made to show that the great number of
 years spent in travelling from Horeb to the plain of Moab was not owing
 to the length of the way, but to a very different cause; namely,
 banishment for their apostasy and frequent rebellions.

 <B>3-8. in the fortieth year .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Moses spake unto the children of
 Israel,</B> &c.--This impressive discourse, in which Moses reviewed all
 that God had done for His people, was delivered about a month before his
 death, and after peace and tranquillity had been restored by the
 complete conquest of Sihon and Og.</P>

 <B>Edrei</B>--now Edhra, the ruins of which are fourteen miles in
 circumference [B<FONT SIZE=-1>URCKHARDT</FONT>]; its general breadth is about
 two leagues.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>5. On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare
 this law</B>--that is, explain this law. He follows the same method here
 that he elsewhere observes; namely, that of first enumerating the
 marvellous doings of God in behalf of His people, and reminding them
 what an unworthy requital they had made for all His kindness--then he
 rehearses the law and its various precepts.</P>

 <A NAME="De1_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>6. The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long
 enough in this mount</B>--Horeb was the general name of a mountainous
 district; literally, "the parched" or "burnt region," whereas Sinai was
 the name appropriated to a particular peak
 [see on

 <A HREF="JFB02.htm#Ex19_2">Ex 19:2</A>].
 
 About a year had been spent among the recesses of that wild solitude,
 in laying the foundation, under the immediate direction of God, of a
 new and peculiar community, as to its social, political, and, above
 all, religious character; and when this purpose had been accomplished,
 they were ordered to break up their encampment in Horeb. The command
 given them was to march straight to Canaan, and possess it

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:7">De 1:7</A>].</P>

 <A NAME="De1_7"> </A>

 Kadesh-barnea in the south of Canaan.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon</B>--that is,
 Ph&oelig;nicia, the country of Sidon, and the coast of the 
 Mediterranean--from the Philistines to Lebanon. The name "Canaanite" is 
 often used synonymously with that of "Ph&oelig;nician."</P>

 <A NAME="De1_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>8. I have set the land before you</B>--literally, "before your faces"--it
 is accessible; there is no impediment to your occupation. The order of
 the journey as indicated by the places mentioned would have led to a
 course of invasion, the opposite of what was eventually followed;
 namely, from the seacoast eastward--instead of from the Jordan westward
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB04.htm#Nu20_1">Nu 20:1</A>).</P>

 <A NAME="De1_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>9-18. I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you
 myself alone</B>--a little before their arrival in Horeb. Moses addresses
 that new generation as the representatives of their fathers, in whose
 sight and hearing all the transactions he recounts took place. A
 reference is here made to the suggestion of Jethro 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:18">Ex 18:18</A>).

 In noticing his practical adoption of a plan by which the
 administration of justice was committed to a select number of 
 subordinate officers, Moses, by a beautiful allusion to the patriarchal 
 blessing, ascribed the necessity of that memorable change in the 
 government to the vast increase of the population.</P>

 <A NAME="De1_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10. ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude</B>--This was
 neither an Oriental hyperbole nor a mere empty boast. Abraham was told

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:5,6">Ge 15:5, 6</A>)

 to look to the stars, and though they "appear" innumerable, yet those
 seen by the naked eye amount, in reality, to no more than three 
 thousand ten in both hemispheres. The Israelites already far exceeded 
 that number, being at the last census above six hundred thousand

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:51">Nu 26:51</A>].

 It was a seasonable memento, calculated to animate their faith in the
 accomplishment of other parts of the divine promise.</P>

 <B>19-21. we went through all that great and terrible wilderness</B>--of
 Paran, which included the desert and mountainous space lying between
 the wilderness of Shur westward, or towards Egypt and mount Seir, or
 the land of Edom eastwards; between the land of Canaan northwards, and
 the Red Sea southwards; and thus it appears to have comprehended really
 the wilderness of Sin and Sinai
 [F<FONT SIZE=-1>ISK</FONT>]. It is called by the Arabs El
 Tih, "the wandering." It is a dreary waste of rock and of calcareous
 soil covered with black sharp flints; all travellers, from a feeling of
 its complete isolation from the world, describe it as a great and
 terrible wilderness.</P>

 <B>22-33. ye came .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and said, We will send men before us, and they
 shall search us out the land</B>--The proposal to despatch spies emanated
 from the people through unbelief; but Moses, believing them sincere,
 gave his cordial assent to this measure, and God on being consulted
 permitted them to follow the suggestion (see on

 <A HREF="JFB04.htm#Nu13_1">Nu 13:1</A>). 

 The issue proved disastrous to them, only through their own sin and
 folly.</P>

 <B>28. the cities are great, and walled up to heaven</B>--an Oriental
 metaphor, meaning very high. The Arab marauders roam about on
 horseback, and hence the walls of St. Catherine's monastery on Sinai
 are so lofty that travellers are drawn up by a pulley in a basket.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Anakims</B>--(See on

 <A HREF="JFB04.htm#Nu13_33">Nu 13:33</A>). 

 The honest and uncompromising language of Moses, in reminding the
 Israelites of their perverse conduct and outrageous rebellion at the 
 report of the treacherous and fainthearted scouts, affords a strong 
 evidence of the truth of this history as well as of the divine 
 authority of his mission. There was great reason for his dwelling on 
 this dark passage in their history, as it was their unbelief that 
 excluded them from the privilege of entering the promised land

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:19">Heb 3:19</A>);

 and that unbelief was a marvellous exhibition of human perversity,
 considering the miracles which God had wrought in their favor, 
 especially in the daily manifestations they had of His presence among 
 them as their leader and protector.</P>

 <B>34-36. the Lord heard the voice of your words, and was wroth</B>--In
 consequence of this aggravated offense (unbelief followed by open
 rebellion), the Israelites were doomed, in the righteous judgment of
 God, to a life of wandering in that dreary wilderness till the whole
 adult generation had disappeared by death. The only exceptions
 mentioned are Caleb and Joshua, who was to be Moses' successor.</P>

 <B>37. Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes</B>--This statement
 <I>seems</I> to indicate that it was on this occasion Moses was condemned
 to share the fate of the people. But we know that it was several years
 afterwards that Moses betrayed an unhappy spirit of distrust at the
 waters of strife 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:32,33">Ps 106:32, 33</A>).

 <B>39. your children .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who in that day had no knowledge between good
 and evil</B>--All ancient versions read "to-day" instead of "that day";
 and the sense is--"your children who now know," or "who know not
 <I>as yet</I> good or evil." As the children had not been partakers of the
 sinful outbreak, they were spared to obtain the privilege which their
 unbelieving parents had forfeited. God's ways are not as man's ways

 <B>40-45. turn you, and take your journey into the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Red Sea</B>--This
 command they disregarded, and, determined to force an onward passage in
 spite of the earnest remonstrances of Moses, they attempted to cross
 the heights then occupied by the combined forces of the Amorites and
 Amalekites (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:43">Nu 14:43</A>),

 but were repulsed with great loss.  People often experience distress
 even while in the way of duty. But how different their condition who 
 suffer in situations where God is with them from the feelings of those 
 who are conscious that they are in a position directly opposed to the 
 divine will! The Israelites were grieved when they found themselves 
 involved in difficulties and perils; but their sorrow arose not from a 
 sense of the guilt so much as the sad effects of their perverse 
 conduct; and "though they wept," they were not true penitents. So the 
 Lord would not hearken to their voice, nor give ear unto them.</P>

 <B>1. Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the
 way of the Red Sea</B>--After their unsuccessful attack upon the
 Canaanites, the Israelites broke up their encampment at Kadesh, and
 journeying southward over the west desert of Tih as well as through the
 great valley of the Ghor and Arabah, they extended their removals as
 far as the gulf of Akaba.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>we compassed mount Seir many days</B>--In these few words Moses comprised
 the whole of that wandering nomadic life through which they passed
 during thirty-eight years, shifting from place to place, and regulating
 their stations by the prospect of pasturage and water. Within the
 interval they went northward a second time to Kadesh, but being refused
 a passage through Edom and opposed by the Canaanites and Amalekites,
 they again had no alternative but to traverse once more the great
 Arabah southwards to the Red Sea, where turning to the left and
 crossing the long, lofty mountain chain to the eastward of Ezion-geber

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:4,5">Nu 21:4, 5</A>),

 they issued into the great and elevated plains, which are still
 traversed by the Syrian pilgrims in their way to Mecca. They appear to 
 have followed northward nearly the same route, which is now taken by 
 the Syrian hadji, along the western skirts of this great desert, near 
 the mountains of Edom [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>]. It was on 
 entering these plains they received the command, "Ye have compassed 
 this mountain (this hilly tract, now Jebel Shera) long enough, turn ye 
 northward"

 come round upon the weak side of their country.</P>

 --for there was another branch of Esau's posterity, namely, the
 Amalekites, who were to be fought against and destroyed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:12,Ex+17:14,De+25:17">Ge 36:12;
 Ex 17:14; 
 De 25:17</A>). 

 But the people of Edom were not to be injured, either in their persons
 or property. And although the approach of so vast a nomadic horde as 
 the Israelites naturally created apprehension, they were to take no 
 advantage of the prevailing terror to compel the Edomites to accept 
 whatever terms they imposed. They were merely to pass "through" or 
 along their border, and to buy meat and water of them for money

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:6">De 2:6</A>).

 The people, kinder than their king, did sell them bread, meat, fruits,
 and water in their passage along their border

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:29">De 2:29</A>),

 in the same manner as the Syrian caravan of Mecca is now supplied by
 the people of the same mountains, who meet the pilgrims as at a fair or 
 market on the hadji route [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>]. Although the 
 Israelites still enjoyed a daily supply of the manna, there was no 
 prohibition against their eating other food when opportunity afforded. 
 Only they were not to cherish an inordinate desire for it. Water is a 
 scarce commodity and is often paid for by travellers in those parts. It 
 was the more incumbent on the Israelites to do so, as, by the blessing 
 of God, they possessed plenty of means to purchase, and the 
 long-continued experience of the extraordinary goodness of God to them, 
 should inspire such confidence in Him as would suppress the smallest 
 thought of resorting to fraud or violence in supplying their wants.</P>

 <B>8-18. we passed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. through the way of the plain</B>--the Arabah or
 great valley, from Elath ("trees") (the Ailah of the Greeks and Romans).
 The site of it is marked by extensive mounds of rubbish.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>Ezion-geber</B>--now Akaba, both were within the territory of Edom; and
 after making a circuit of its southeastern boundary, the Israelites
 reached the border of Moab on the southeast of the Salt Sea. They had
 been forbidden by divine command to molest the Moabites in any way; and
 this special honor was conferred on that people not on their own
 account, for they were very wicked, but in virtue of their descent from
 Lot. (See on

 <A HREF="#De23_3">De 23:3</A>). 

 Their territory comprised the fine country on the south, and partly on
 the north of the Arnon. They had won it by their arms from the original 
 inhabitants, the Emims, a race, terrible, as their name imports, for 
 physical power and stature

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:5">Ge 14:5</A>),

 in like manner as the Edomites had obtained their settlement by the
 overthrow of the original occupiers of Seir, the Horims

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:6">Ge 14:6</A>),

 who were troglodytes, or dwellers in caves. Moses alluded to these
 circumstances to encourage his countrymen to believe that God would 
 much more enable them to expel the wicked and accursed Canaanites. At 
 that time, however, the Moabites, having lost the greater part of their 
 possessions through the usurpations of Sihon, were reduced to the small 
 but fertile region between the Zered and the Arnon.</P>

 <B>13. Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered</B>--The southern border
 of Moab, <I>Zered</I> ("woody"), now Wady Ahsy, separates the modern district
 of Kerak from Jebal, and, indeed, forms a natural division of the
 country between the north and south. Ar, called in later times Rabbah,
 was the capital of Moab and situated twenty-five miles south of the
 Arnon on the banks of a small but shady stream, the Beni Hamed. It is
 here mentioned as representative of the country dependent on it, a rich

 <B>19-37. when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
 distress them not, nor meddle with them</B>--The Ammonites, being kindred
 to the Moabites, were, from regard to the memory of their common
 ancestor, to remain undisturbed by the Israelites. The territory of
 this people had been directly north from that of Moab. It extended as
 far as the Jabbok, having been taken by them from a number of small
 Canaanitish tribes, namely, the Zamzummins, a bullying, presumptuous
 band of giants, as their name indicates; and the Avims, the aborigines
 of the district extending from Hazerim or Hazeroth (El Hudhera) even
 unto Azzah (Gaza), but of which they had been dispossessed by the
 Caphtorim (Philistines), who came out of Caphtor (Lower Egypt) and
 settled in the western coast of Palestine. The limits of the Ammonites
 were now compressed; but they still possessed the mountainous region
 beyond the Jabbok

 <B>24-36. Rise ye up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and pass over the river Arnon</B>--At its mouth,
 this stream is eighty-two feet wide and four deep. It flows in a
 channel banked by perpendicular cliffs of sandstone. At the date of the
 Israelitish migration to the east of the Jordan, the whole of the fine
 country lying between the Arnon and the Jabbok including the
 mountainous tract of Gilead, had been seized by the Amorites, who,
 being one of the nations doomed to destruction (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:2,20:16">De 7:2; 20:16</A>),

 were utterly exterminated. Their country fell by right of conquest into
 the hands of the Israelites. Moses, however, considering this doom as 
 referring solely to the Amorite possessions west of Jordan, sent a 
 pacific message to Sihon, requesting permission to go through his 
 territories, which lay on the east of that river. It is always 
 customary to send messengers before to prepare the way; but the 
 rejection of Moses' request by Sihon and his opposition to the advance 
 of the Israelites

 drew down on himself and his Amorite subjects the predicted doom on the
 first pitched battlefield with the Canaanites. It secured to Israel not 
 only the possession of a fine and pastoral country, but, what was of 
 more importance to them, a free access to the Jordan on the east.</P>

 which, together with other fifty-nine cities in the same province, were
 conspicuous for their lofty and fortified walls. It was a war of
 extermination. Houses and cities were razed to the ground; all classes
 of people were put to the sword; and nothing was saved but the cattle,
 of which an immense amount fell as spoil into the hands of the
 conquerors. Thus, the two Amorite kings and the entire population of
 their dominions were extirpated. The whole country east of the
 Jordan--first upland downs from the torrent of the Arnon on the south
 to that of the Jabbok on the north; next the high mountain tract of
 Gilead and Bashan from the deep ravine of Jabbok--became the possession

 <B>behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron</B>--Although beds in the
 East are with the common people nothing more than a simple mattress,
 bedsteads are not unknown. They are in use among the great, who prefer
 them of iron or other metals, not only for strength and durability, but
 for the prevention of the troublesome insects which in warm climates
 commonly infest wood. Taking the cubit at half a yard, the bedstead of
 Og would measure thirteen and a half feet, so that as beds are usually
 a little larger than the persons who occupy them, the stature of the
 Amorite king may be estimated at about eleven or twelve feet; or he
 might have caused his bed to be made much larger than was necessary, as
 Alexander the Great did for each of his foot soldiers, to impress the
 Indians with an idea of the extraordinary strength and stature of his
 men [L<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LERC</FONT>].
 But how did Og's bedstead come to be in Rabbath, of the
 children of Ammon? In answer to this question, it has been said, that
 Og had, on the eve of engagement, conveyed it to Rabbath for safety. Or
 it may be that Moses, after capturing it, may have sold it to the
 Ammonites, who had kept it as an antiquarian curiosity till their
 capital was sacked in the time of David. This is a most unlikely
 supposition, and besides renders it necessary to consider the latter
 clause of this verse as an interpolation inserted long after the time
 of Moses. To avoid this, some eminent critics take the <I>Hebrew</I> word
 rendered "bedstead" to mean "coffin." They think that the king of
 Bashan having been wounded in battle, fled to Rabbath, where he died
 and was buried; hence the dimensions of his "coffin" are given

 six or seven miles south of the Jabbok, and eight miles in length. The

 extreme proneness of the Israelites to idolatry, from their position in

 accounts for their attention being repeatedly drawn to the fact that

 things are here specified of which God prohibited any image or
 representation to be made for the purposes of worship; and, from the
 variety of details entered into, an idea may be formed of the extensive
 prevalence of idolatry in that age. In whatever way idolatry originated,
 whether from an intention to worship the true God through those things
 which seemed to afford the strongest evidences of His power, or whether
 a divine principle was supposed to reside in the things themselves,
 there was scarcely an element or object of nature but was deified. This
 was particularly the case with the Canaanites and Egyptians, against
 whose superstitious practices the caution, no doubt, was chiefly
 directed. The former worshipped Baal and Astarte, the latter Osiris and
 Isis, under the figure of a male and a female. It was in Egypt that
 animal-worship most prevailed, for the natives of that country deified
 among beasts the ox, the heifer, the sheep, and the goat, the dog, the
 cat, and the ape; among birds, the ibis, the hawk, and the crane; among
 reptiles, the crocodile, the frog, and the beetle; among fishes, all
 the fish of the Nile; some of these, as Osiris and Isis, were
 worshipped over all Egypt, the others only in particular provinces. In
 addition they embraced the Zabian superstition, the adoration of the
 Egyptians, in common with that of many other people, extending to the
 whole starry host. The very circumstantial details here given of the
 Canaanitish and Egyptian idolatry were owing to the past and
 prospective familiarity of the Israelites with it in all these forms.</P>

 moment; it was addressed either directly or indirectly to the Hebrew
 people as principles of their peculiar constitution as a nation; and
 hence, as has been well observed, "the Jewish law has no obligation
 upon Christians, unless so much of it as given or commanded by Jesus
 Christ; for whatever in this law is conformable to the laws of nature,
 obliges us, not as given by Moses, but by virtue of an antecedent law

 of Sinai; a law was not given to them as to us, nor was the covenant

 Or, finally, the meaning may be "not with our fathers" who died in the
 wilderness, in consequence of their rebellion, and to whom God did not

 the law, to secure the privilege of sabbatic rest to servants, of 
 which, in some Hebrew families, they had been deprived. In this view, 
 the allusion to the period of Egyptian bondage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:15">De 5:15</A>),

 <B>1-9. Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments,
 which the Lord your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do
 them .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whither ye go to possess it</B>--The grand design of all the
 institutions prescribed to Israel was to form a religious people, whose
 national character should be distinguished by that fear of the Lord
 their God which would ensure their divine observance of His worship and
 their steadfast obedience to His will. The basis of their religion was
 an acknowledgment of the unity of God with the understanding and the
 love of God in the heart 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:4,5">De 6:4, 5</A>).

 Compared with the religious creed of all their contemporaries, how
 sound in principle, how elevated in character, how unlimited in the 
 extent of its moral influence on the heart and habits of the people! 
 Indeed, it is precisely the same basis on which rests the purer and 
 more spiritual form of it which Christianity exhibits

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:37,Mk+12:30,Lu+10:27">Mt 22:37;
 Mr 12:30; 
 Lu 10:27</A>). 

 Moreover, to help in keeping a sense of religion in their minds, it was
 commanded that its great principles should be carried about with them 
 wherever they went, as well as meet their eyes every time they entered 
 their homes.  A further provision was made for the earnest inculcation 
 of them on the minds of the young by a system of parental training, 
 which was designed to associate religion with all the most familiar and 
 oft-recurring scenes of domestic life. It is probable that Moses used 
 the phraseology in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:7">De 6:7</A>

 merely in a figurative way, to signify assiduous, earnest, and frequent
 instruction; and perhaps he meant the metaphorical language in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:8">De 6:8</A>

 to be taken in the same sense also. But as the Israelites interpreted
 it literally, many writers suppose that a reference was made to a 
 superstitious custom borrowed from the Egyptians, who wore jewels and 
 ornamental trinkets on the forehead and arm, inscribed with certain 
 words and sentences, as amulets to protect them from danger. These, it 
 has been conjectured, Moses intended to supersede by substituting 
 sentences of the law; and so the Hebrews understood him, for they have 
 always considered the wearing of the <I>Tephilim,</I> or frontlets, a 
 permanent obligation. The form was as follows: Four pieces of 
 parchment, inscribed, the first with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:2-10">Ex 13:2-10</A>;

 the second with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:11-16">Ex 13:11-16</A>;

 the third with
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:1-8">De 6:1-8</A>;

 and the fourth with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+11:18-21">De 11:18-21</A>,

 were enclosed in a square case or box of tough skin, on the side of
 which was placed the Hebrew letter (<I>shin</I>), and bound round the 
 forehead with a thong or ribbon. When designed for the arms, those four 
 texts were written on one slip of parchment, which, as well as the ink, 
 was carefully prepared for the purpose. With regard to the other usage 
 supposed to be alluded to, the ancient Egyptians had the lintels and 
 imposts of their doors and gates inscribed with sentences indicative of 
 a favorable omen [W<FONT SIZE=-1>ILKINSON</FONT>]; and this is still 
 the case, for in Egypt and other Mohammedan countries, the front doors 
 of houses (in Cairo, for instance) are painted red, white, and green, 
 bearing conspicuously inscribed upon them such sentences from the 
 Koran, as "God is the Creator," "God is one, and Mohammed is his 
 prophet." Moses designed to turn this ancient and favorite custom to a
 better account and ordered that, instead of the former superstitious 
 inscriptions, there should be written the words of God, persuading and 
 enjoining the people to hold the laws in perpetual remembrance.</P>

 But in the lapse of near five hundred years, it cannot be surprising
 that some of them had been extinguished in the many intestine feuds 
 that prevailed among those warlike tribes.  It is more than probable 
 that some, stationed on the east of Jordan, had fallen under the

 <B>2-6. thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make
 no covenant with them</B>--This relentless doom of extermination which God
 denounced against those tribes of Canaan cannot be reconciled with the
 attributes of the divine character, except on the assumption that their
 gross idolatry and enormous wickedness left no reasonable hope of their
 repentance and amendment. If they were to be swept away like the
 antediluvians or the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, as incorrigible
 sinners who had filled up the measure of their iniquities, it mattered
 not to them in what way the judgment was inflicted; and God, as the
 Sovereign Disposer, had a right to employ any instruments that pleased
 Him for executing His judgments. Some think that they were to be
 exterminated as unprincipled usurpers of a country which God had
 assigned to the posterity of Eber and which had been occupied ages
 before by wandering shepherds of that race, till, on the migration of
 Jacob's family into Egypt through the pressure of famine, the Canaanites
 overspread the whole land, though they had no legitimate claim to it,
 and endeavored to retain possession of it by force. In this view their
 expulsion was just and proper. The strict prohibition against
 contracting any alliances with such infamous idolaters was a prudential
 rule, founded on the experience that "evil communications corrupt good
 manners" 

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:33">1Co 15:33</A>],

 <B>5. thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars,</B>
 &c.--The removal of the temples, altars, and everything that had been
 enlisted in the service, or might tend to perpetuate the remembrance,
 of Canaanite idolatry, was likewise highly expedient for preserving the
 Israelites from all risk of contamination. It was imitated by the
 Scottish Reformers, and although many ardent lovers of architecture and
 the fine arts have anathematized their proceedings as vandalism, yet
 there was profound wisdom in the favorite maxim of Knox--"pull down the

 purposes of His providence. Their selection to this high destiny was
 neither on account of their numerical amount (for, till after the death
 of Joseph, they were but a handful of people); nor because of their
 extraordinary merits (for they had often pursued a most perverse and
 unworthy conduct); but it was in consequence of the covenant or promise
 made with their pious forefathers; and the motives that led to that
 special act were such as tended not only to vindicate God's wisdom, but
 to illustrate His glory in diffusing the best and most precious
 blessings to all mankind.</P>

 of blessings so long as they continued obedient to Him as their heavenly
 King. He pledged His veracity that His infinite perfections would be
 exerted for this purpose, as well as for delivering them from every evil
 to which, as a people, they would be exposed. That people accordingly
 were truly happy as a nation, and found every promise which the faithful
 God made to them amply fulfilled, so long as they adhered to that
 obedience which was required of them. See a beautiful illustration of

 and religious) people: a course of prosperity is often called "life"

 <B>2, 3. thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee
 these forty years in the wilderness</B>--The recapitulation of all
 their checkered experience during that long period was designed to
 awaken lively impressions of the goodness of God. First, Moses showed
 them the object of their protracted wanderings and varied hardships.
 These were trials of their obedience as well as chastisements for sin.
 Indeed, the discovery of their infidelity, inconstancy, and their
 rebellions and perverseness which this varied discipline brought to
 light, was of eminently practical use to the Israelites themselves, as
 it has been to the church in all subsequent ages. Next, he enlarged on
 the goodness of God to them, while reduced to the last extremities of
 despair, in the miraculous provision which, without anxiety or labor,
 was made for their daily support
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB02.htm#Ex16_4">Ex 16:4</A>). 

 Possessing no nutritious properties inherent in it, this contributed to
 their sustenance, as indeed all food does

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:4">Mt 4:4</A>)

 their outset; they might also have obtained supplies of various
 articles of food and raiment in barter with the neighboring tribes for
 the fleeces and skins of their sheep and goats; and in furnishing them
 with such opportunities the care of Providence appeared. But the strong
 and pointed terms which Moses here uses (see also

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:5">De 29:5</A>)

 confines of the promised land, but were obliged, to their great
 mortification, to return. But now they certainly were to enter it. No
 obstacle could prevent their possession; neither the fortified defenses
 of the towns, nor the resistance of the gigantic inhabitants of whom
 they had received from the spies so formidable a description.

 <B>cities great and fenced up to heaven</B>--Oriental cities generally cover
 a much greater space than those in Europe; for the houses often stand
 apart with gardens and fields intervening. They are almost all
 surrounded with walls built of burnt or sun-dried bricks, about forty
 feet in height. All classes in the East, but especially the nomad
 tribes, in their ignorance of engineering and artillery, would have
 abandoned in despair the idea of an assault on a walled town, which
 to-day would be demolished in a few hours.</P>

 care to guard his countrymen against the vanity of supposing that their
 own merits had procured them the distinguished privilege. The
 Canaanites were a hopelessly corrupt race, and deserved extermination;
 but history relates many remarkable instances in which God punished
 corrupt and guilty nations by the instrumentality of other people as
 bad as themselves. It was not for the sake of the Israelites, but for
 His own sake, for the promise made to their pious ancestors, and in
 furtherance of high and comprehensive purposes of good to the world,
 that God was about to give them a grant of Canaan.</P>

 Moses rehearses their acts of disobedience and rebellion committed so
 frequently, and in circumstances of the most awful and impressive
 solemnity, that they had forfeited all claims to the favor of God. The
 candor and boldness with which he gave, and the patient submission with
 which the people bore, his recital of charges so discreditable to their
 national character, has often been appealed to as among the many
 evidences of the truth of this history.</P>

 their infidelity. He begins with the impiety of the golden calf--an
 impiety which, while their miraculous emancipation from Egypt, the most
 stupendous displays of the Divine Majesty that were exhibited on the
 adjoining mount, and the recent ratification of the covenant by which
 they engaged to act as the people of God, were fresh in memory,
 indicated a degree of inconstancy or debasement almost incredible.</P>

 <B>21. I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the
 mount</B>--that is, "the smitten rock" (El Leja) which was probably
 contiguous to, or a part of, Sinai. It is too seldom borne in mind that
 though the Israelites were supplied with water from this rock when they
 were stationed at Rephidim (Wady Feiran), there is nothing in the
 Scripture narrative which should lead us to suppose that the rock was
 in the immediate neighborhood of that place
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB02.htm#Ex17_5">Ex 17:5</A>).
 
 The water on this smitten rock was probably the brook that descended
 from the mount. The water may have flowed at the distance of many miles
 from the rock, as the winter torrents do now through the wadies of
 Arabia-Petr&aelig;a 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:15,16">Ps 78:15, 16</A>).

 And the rock may have been smitten at such a height, and at a spot
 bearing such a relation to the Sinaitic valleys, as to furnish in this 
 way supplies of water to the Israelites during the journey from Horeb 
 by the way of mount Seir and Kadesh-barnea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:1,2">De 1:1, 2</A>).

 On this supposition new light is, perhaps, cast on the figurative
 language of the apostle, when he speaks of "the rock following" the 
 Israelites

 <B>6-9. the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the
 children of Jaakan to Mosera</B>--So sudden a change from a spoken
 discourse to a historical narrative has greatly puzzled the most
 eminent biblical scholars, some of whom reject the parenthesis as a
 manifest interpolation. But it is found in the most ancient Hebrew
 manuscripts, and, believing that all contained in this book was given
 by inspiration and is entitled to profound respect, we must receive it
 as it stands, although acknowledging our inability to explain the
 insertion of these encampment details in this place. There is another
 difficulty in the narrative itself. The stations which the Israelites
 are said successively to have occupied are enumerated here in a
 different order from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+33:31">Nu 33:31</A>.

 That the names of the stations in both passages are the same there can 
 be no doubt; but, in Numbers, they are probably mentioned in reference 
 to the <I>first</I> visit of the Hebrews during the long wandering 
 southwards, before their return to Kadesh the second time; while here 
 they have a reference to the <I>second</I> passage of the Israelites, 
 when they again marched south, in order to compass the land of Edom. It 
 is easy to conceive that Mosera (Hor) and the wells of Jaakan might lie 
 in such a direction that a nomadic horde might, in different years, at
 one time take the former <I>first</I> in their way, and at another time 
 the latter [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>].</P>

 reason for the frequent repetition of the same or similar counsels is
 to be traced to the infantine character and state of the church, which
 required line upon line and precept upon precept. Besides, the
 Israelites were a headstrong and perverse people, impatient of control,
 prone to rebellion, and, from their long stay in Egypt, so violently
 addicted to idolatry, that they ran imminent risk of being seduced by
 the religion of the country to which they were going, which, in its

 judgment which God had wrought in effecting their release from the
 tyranny of Pharaoh, as well as those which had taken place in the
 wilderness. He knew that he might dwell upon these, for he was
 addressing many who had been witnesses of those appalling incidents.
 For it will be remembered that the divine threatening that they should

 twenty years and upward, who were able to go forth to war. No males
 under twenty years of age, no females, and none of the tribe of Levi,
 were objects of the denunciation (see

 There might, therefore, have been many thousands of the Israelites at
 that time of whom Moses could say, "Your eyes have seen all the great 
 acts which He did"; and with regard to those the historic review of 
 Moses was well calculated to stir up their minds to the duty and 
 advantages of obedience.</P>

 <B>10-12. For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the
 land of Egypt, from whence ye came out</B>--The physical features of
 Palestine present a striking contrast to those of the land of bondage.
 A widely extending plain forms the cultivated portion of Egypt, and on
 the greater part of this low and level country rain never falls. This
 natural want is supplied by the annual overflow of the Nile, and by
 artificial means from the same source when the river has receded within
 its customary channel. Close by the bank the process of irrigation is
 very simple. The cultivator opens a small sluice on the edge of the
 square bed in which seed has been sown, making drill after drill; and
 when a sufficient quantity of water has poured in, he shuts it up with
 his foot. Where the bank is high, the water is drawn up by hydraulic
 engines, of which there are three kinds used, of different power,
 according to the subsidence of the stream. The water is distributed in
 small channels or earthen conduits, simple in construction, worked by
 the foot, and formed with a mattock by the gardener who directs their
 course, and which are banked up or opened, as occasion may require, by
 pressing in the soil with the foot. Thus was the land watered in which
 the Israelites had dwelt so long. Such vigilance and laborious industry
 would not be needed in the promised land. Instead of being visited with
 moisture only at one brief season and left during the rest of the year
 under a withering blight, every season it would enjoy the benign
 influences of a genial climate. The hills would attract the frequent
 clouds, and in the refreshing showers the blessing of God would
 especially rest upon the land.</P>

 all the winter; but, at the autumnal and vernal seasons, they were more
 frequent, copious, and important; for the early rain was necessary,
 after a hot and protracted summer, to prepare the soil for receiving
 the seed; and the latter rain, which shortly preceded the harvest, was
 of the greatest use in invigorating the languishing powers of
 vegetation

 It was threatened to be withdrawn on their disobedience or apostasy;
 and most signally is the execution of that threatening seen in the 
 present sterility of Palestine. MR. L<FONT SIZE=-1>OWTH</FONT>IAN, an 
 English farmer, who was struck during his journey from Joppa to 
 Jerusalem by not seeing a blade of grass, where even in the poorest 
 localities of Britain some wild vegetation is found, directed his 
 attention particularly to the subject, and pursued the inquiry during a 
 month's residence in Jerusalem, where he learned that a miserably small 
 quantity of milk is daily sold to the inhabitants at a dear rate, and 
 that chiefly asses' milk. "Most clearly," says he, "did I perceive that 
 the barrenness of large portions of the country was owing to the 
 cessation of the early and latter rain, and that the absence of grass 
 and flowers made it no longer the land

 <B>1. These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe</B>--Having
 in the preceding chapter inculcated upon the Israelites the general
 obligation to fear and love God, Moses here enters into a detail of
 some special duties they were to practise on their obtaining possession
 of the promised land.</P>

 <A NAME="De12_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which
 ye shall possess served their gods</B>--This divine command was founded on
 the tendencies of human nature; for to remove out of sight everything
 that had been associated with idolatry, that it might never be spoken
 of and no vestige of it remain, was the only effectual way to keep the
 Israelites from temptations to it. It is observable that Moses does not
 make any mention of temples, for such buildings were not in existence
 at that early period. The "places" chosen as the scene of heathen
 worship were situated either on the summit of a lofty mountain, or on
 some artificial mound, or in a grove, planted with particular trees,
 such as oaks, poplars, and elms 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:5-7,Ho+4:13">Isa 57:5-7;
 Ho 4:13</A>). 

 The reason for the selection of such sites was both to secure
 retirement and to direct the attention upward to heaven; and the 
 "place" was nothing else than a consecrated enclosure, or at most, a 
 canopy or screen from the weather.</P>

 in the impure superstitious manner of the heathen, or in any of the
 places frequented by them. A particular place for the general
 rendezvous of all the tribes would be chosen by God Himself; and the
 choice of one common place for the solemn rites of religion was an act
 of divine wisdom, for the security of the true religion. It was
 admirably calculated to prevent the corruption which would otherwise
 have crept in from their frequenting groves and high hills--to preserve
 uniformity of worship and keep alive their faith in Him to whom all
 their sacrifices pointed. The place was successively Mizpeh, Shiloh,
 and especially Jerusalem. But in all the references made to it by
 Moses, the name is never mentioned. This studied silence was maintained
 partly lest the Canaanites within whose territories it lay might have
 concentrated their forces to frustrate all hopes of obtaining it;
 partly lest the desire of possessing a place of such importance might
 have become a cause of strife or rivalry amongst the Hebrew tribes, as
 about the appointment to the priesthood

 during the abode in the wilderness ordered to be slain as a peace
 offering at the door of the tabernacle; its blood to be sprinkled, and
 its fat burnt upon the altar by the priest. The encampment, being then
 round about the altar, made this practice, appointed to prevent
 idolatry, easy and practicable. But on the settlement in the promised
 land, the obligation to slay at the tabernacle was dispensed with. The
 people were left at liberty to prepare their meat in their cities or

 permission to hunt and use venison for food was doubtless a great boon
 to the Israelites, not only in the wilderness, but on their settlement
 in Canaan, as the mountainous ranges of Lebanon, Carmel, and Gilead, on
 which deer abounded in vast numbers, would thus furnish them with a
 plentiful and luxuriant repast.</P>

 deities, who expected their dues of all who came to inhabit the country 
 which they honored with their protection, and severely resented the 
 neglect of payment in all newcomers [W<FONT SIZE=-1>ARBURTON</FONT>].

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:32">De 12:32</A>;

 and the purport of them is, that every attempt to seduce others from
 the course of duty which that divine standard of faith and worship 
 prescribes must not only be strenuously resisted, but the seducer 
 punished by the law of the land. This is exemplified in three cases of 
 enticement to idolatry.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>a prophet</B>--that is, some notable person laying claim to the character
 and authority of the prophetic office 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:6,1Sa+10:6">Nu 12:6;

 performing feats of dexterity or power in support of his pretensions,
 or even predicting events which occurred as he foretold; as, for 
 instance, an eclipse which a knowledge of natural science might enable 
 him to anticipate (or, as Caiaphas,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:14">Joh 18:14</A>).

 Should the aim of such a one be to seduce the people from the worship
 of the true God, he is an impostor and must be put to death. No 
 prodigy, however wonderful, no human authority, however great, should 
 be allowed to shake their belief in the divine character and truth of a 
 religion so solemnly taught and so awfully attested (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:8">Ga 1:8</A>).

 The modern Jews appeal to this passage as justifying their rejection of
 Jesus Christ. But He possessed all the characteristics of a true 
 prophet, and He was so far from alienating the people from God and His 
 worship that the grand object of His ministry was to lead to a purer, 
 more spiritual and perfect observance of the law.</P>

 Hebrew slave was the remembrance that the whole nation was once a
 degraded and persecuted band of helots in Egypt. Thus, kindness towards

 <B>1. Observe the month of Abib</B>--or first-fruits. It comprehended the
 latter part of our March and the beginning of April. Green ears of the
 barley, which were then full, were offered as first-fruits, on the
 second day of the passover.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>for in the month of Abib the Lord thy God brought thee out of Egypt by
 night</B>--This statement is apparently at variance with the prohibition

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:22">Ex 12:22</A>)

 But it is susceptible of easy reconciliation. Pharaoh's permission, the
 first step of emancipation, was extorted during the night, the 
 preparations for departure commenced, the rendezvous at Rameses made, 
 and the march entered on in the morning.</P>

 <A NAME="De16_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>2. Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover</B>--not the paschal
 lamb, which was strictly and properly the passover. The whole solemnity

 and from the allusion to the continued use of unleavened bread for
 seven days, whereas the passover itself was to be eaten at once. The 
 words before us are equivalent to "thou shalt observe the feast of the 
 passover."</P>

 <A NAME="De16_3"> </A>

 <B>5, 6. Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy

 the tabernacle or temple, as it was not a religious feast or
 sacramental occasion merely, but an actual sacrifice

 <B>6. at the season</B>--that is, the month and day, though not perhaps
 the precise hour. The immense number of victims that had to be
 immolated on the eve of the passover--that is, within a space of four
 hours--has appeared to some writers a great difficulty. But the large
 number of officiating priests, their dexterity and skill in the
 preparation of the sacrifices, the wide range of the court, the

 <B>thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents</B>--The sense
 of this passage, on the first glance of the words, seems to point to
 the morning after the first day--the passover eve. Perhaps, however,
 the divinely appointed duration of this feast, the solemn character and
 important object, the journey of the people from the distant parts of
 the land to be present, and the recorded examples of their continuing
 all the time 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:21,35:17">2Ch 30:21 35:17</A>),

 Various conjectures have been formed to account for the appointment of
 this feast at the conclusion of the whole harvest. Some imagine that it 
 was designed to remind the Israelites of the time when they had no 
 cornfields to reap but were daily supplied with manna; others think 
 that it suited the convenience of the people better than any other 
 period of the year for dwelling in booths; others that it was the time 
 of Moses' second descent from the mount; while a fourth class are of 
 opinion that this feast was fixed to the time of the year when the Word 
 was made flesh and <I>dwelt</I>--literally, "tabernacled"--among us

 They might be placed near the earthen and temporary altars erected in
 the wilderness, but they could not exist either at the tabernacle or 
 temples. They were places, which, with their usual accompaniments,

 statues of idols. A superstitious reverence was attached to them, and
 hence they were forbidden.</P>

 idolatry of any kind, whether of the heavenly bodies or in some grosser
 form, is called "a transgression of His covenant." No rank or sex could
 palliate this crime. Every reported case, even a flying rumor of the
 perpetration of so heinous an offense, was to be judicially examined;
 and if proved by the testimony of competent witnesses, the offender was
 to be taken without the gates and stoned to death, the witnesses
 casting the first stone at him. The object of this special arrangement
 was partly to deter the witnesses from making a rash accusation by the
 prominent part they had to act as executioners, and partly to give a
 public assurance that the crime had met its due punishment.</P>

 civil or criminal cases, where there was any doubt or difficulty in
 giving a decision, the local magistrates were to submit them by
 reference to the tribunal of the Sanhedrim--the supreme council, which
 was composed partly of civil and partly of ecclesiastical persons. "The
 priests and Levites," should rather be "the priests--the Levites"; that
 is, the Levitical priests, including the high priest, who were members
 of the legislative assembly; and who, as forming one body, are called
 "the judge." Their sittings were held in the neighborhood of the
 sanctuary because in great emergencies the high priest had to consult
 God by Urim 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:21">Nu 27:21</A>).

 From their judgment there was no appeal; and if a person were so
 perverse and refractory as to refuse obedience to their sentences, his 
 conduct, as inconsistent with the maintenance of order and good 
 government, was then to be regarded and punished as a capital 
 crime.</P>

 <B>14. When thou .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shalt say, I will set a king over me</B>--In the
 following passage Moses <I>prophetically</I> announces a revolution which
 should occur at a later period in the national history of Israel. No
 sanction or recommendation was indicated; on the contrary, when the
 popular clamor had effected that constitutional change on the theocracy
 by the appointment of a king, the divine disapproval was expressed in
 the most unequivocal terms 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:7">1Sa 8:7</A>).

 Permission at length was granted, God reserving to Himself the
 nomination of the family and the person who should be elevated to the 
 regal dignity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:15,10:24,16:12,1Ch+28:4">1Sa 9:15; 10:24; 16:12;
 1Ch 28:4</A>). 

 In short, Moses foreseeing that his ignorant and fickle countrymen,
 insensible to their advantages as a peculiar people, would soon wish to 
 change their constitution and be like other nations, provides to a 
 certain extent for such an emergency and lays down the principles on 
 which a king in Israel must act. He was to possess certain 
 indispensable requisites. He was to be an Israelite, of the same race 
 and religion, to preserve the purity of the established worship, as 
 well as be a type of Christ, a spiritual king, one of their 
 brethren.</P>

 they might not be employed as part of the state equipage. But the
 multiplication of horses would inevitably lead to many evils, to
 increased intercourse with foreign nations, especially with Egypt, to
 the importation of an animal to which the character of the country was
 not suited, to the establishment of an Oriental military despotism, to
 proud and pompous parade in peace, to a dependence upon Egypt in time
 of war, and a consequent withdrawal of trust and confidence in God.

 prohibition on this point, founded on the practice of neighboring
 countries in which polygamy prevailed, and whose kings had numerous
 harems; besides, the monarch of Israel was to be absolutely independent
 of the people and had nothing but the divine law to restrain his
 passions. The mischievous effects resulting from the breach of this
 condition were exemplified in the history of Solomon and other princes,
 who, by trampling on the restrictive law, corrupted themselves as well
 as the nation.

 Each monarch, on his accession, was to be furnished with a true and
 faithful copy, which he was to keep constantly beside him, and daily
 peruse it, that his character and sentiments being cast into its
 sanctifying mould, he might discharge his royal functions in the spirit
 of faith and piety, of humility and a love or righteousness.</P>

 that the Levites served in rotation from the earliest times; but, from
 their great numbers, it was only at infrequent intervals they could be
 called into actual service. Should any Levite, however, under the
 influence of eminent piety, resolve to devote himself wholly and
 continually to the sacred duties of the sanctuary, he was allowed to
 realize his ardent wishes; and as he was admitted to a share of the
 work, so also to a share of the remuneration. Though he might have
 private property, that was to form no ground for withholding or even
 diminishing his claim to maintenance like the other ministering
 priests. The reason or principle of the enactment is obvious

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:13">1Co 9:13</A>).

 At the same time, while every facility was afforded for the admission
 of such a zealous and self-denying officer, this admission was to be in 
 an orderly manner: he was to minister "as all his brethren"--that is, a 
 Gershonite with Gershonites; a Merarite with Merarites; so that there

 that order of true prophets whom God commissioned in unbroken
 succession to instruct, to direct, and warn His people; and in this

 that if the kinsman of a person inadvertently killed should, under the 
 impulse of sudden excitement and without inquiring into the 
 circumstances, inflict summary vengeance on the homicide, however 
 guiltless, the law tolerated such an act; it was to pass with impunity. 
 But to prevent such precipitate measures, the cities of refuge were 
 established for the reception of the homicide, that "innocent blood 
 might not be shed in thy land"

 But it was obscurely hinted that this last provision would never be
 carried into effect, as the Israelites would not fulfil the conditions, 
 namely, "that of keeping the commandments, to love the Lord, and walk 
 ever in his ways." In point of fact, although that region was brought 
 into subjection by David and Solomon, we do not find that cities of 
 refuge were established; because those sovereigns only made the ancient 
 inhabitants tributary, instead of sending a colony of Israelites to 
 possess it. The privilege of sanctuary cities, however, was given only 
 for Israelites; and besides, that conquered territory did not remain 
 long under the power of the Hebrew kings.</P>

 gardens and vineyards are surrounded by dry-stone walls or hedges of

 fill the gutter with earth, or remove these stones a few feet without
 much risk of detection and so enlarge his own field by a stealthy
 encroachment on his neighbor's. This law, then, was made to prevent

 <B>2-4. when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall

 a war priest appointed by a special ceremonial to attend the army. It
 was natural that the solemn objects and motives of religion should have
 been applied to animate patriotism, and so give additional impulse to
 valor; other people have done this. But in the case of Israel, the
 regular attendance of a priest on the battlefield was in accordance
 with their theocratic government, in which everything was done directly
 by God through His delegated ministers. It was the province of this
 priest to sound the trumpets 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:9,31:6">Nu 10:9; 31:6</A>),

 They might be keepers of the muster-roll, or perhaps rather military
 heralds, whose duty it was to announce the orders of the generals

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+26:11">2Ch 26:11</A>).
 
 This proclamation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:5-8">De 20:5-8</A>)

 must have been made previous to the priest's address, as great disorder
 and inconvenience must have been occasioned if the serried ranks were 
 broken by the departure of those to whom the privilege was granted. 
 Four grounds of exemption are expressly mentioned: (1) The dedication 
 of a new house, which, as in all Oriental countries still, was an 
 important event, and celebrated by festive and religious ceremonies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+12:27">Ne 12:27</A>);

 exemption for a year. (2) The planting of a vineyard. The fruit of the
 first three years being declared unfit for use, and the first-fruits 
 producible on the fourth, the exemption in this case lasted at least 
 four years. (3) The betrothal of a wife, which was always a 
 considerable time before marriage. It was deemed a great hardship to 
 leave a house unfinished, a new property half cultivated, and a 
 recently contracted marriage; and the exemptions allowed in these cases 
 were founded on the principle that a man's heart being deeply engrossed 
 by something at a distance, he would not be very enthusiastic in the 
 public service. (4) The ground of exemption was cowardice. From the 
 composition of the Israelitish army, which was an irregular militia, 
 all above twenty years being liable to serve, many totally unfit for 
 war must have been called to the field; and it was therefore a 
 prudential arrangement to rid the army of such unwarlike 
 elements--persons who could render no efficient service, and the 
 contagion of whose craven spirit might lead to panic and defeat.</P>

 <B>10-20. When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then
 proclaim peace unto it</B>--An important principle is here introduced into
 the war law of Israel regarding the people they fought against and the
 cities they besieged. With "the cities of those people which God doth
 give thee" in Canaan, it was to be a war of utter extermination

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:17,18">De 20:17, 18</A>).

 But when on a just occasion, they went against other nations, they were
 first to make a proclamation of peace, which if allowed by a surrender, 
 the people would become dependent

 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:11">De 20:11</A>],
 
 and in the relation of tributaries the conquered nations would receive
 the highest blessings from alliance with the chosen people; they would
 be brought to the knowledge of Israel's God and of Israel's worship, as
 well as a participation of Israel's privileges. But if the besieged
 city refused to capitulate and be taken, a universal massacre was to be
 made of the males while the women and children were to be preserved and
 kindly treated 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:13,14">De 20:13, 14</A>).

 By this means a provision was made for a friendly and useful connection
 being established between the captors and the captives; and Israel, 
 even through her conquests, would prove a blessing to the nations.</P>

 <B>1-6. If one be found slain .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lying in the field, and it be not

 on the discovery of a slaughtered corpse show the ideas of sanctity
 which the Mosaic law sought to associate with human blood, the horror
 which murder inspired, as well as the fears that were felt lest God
 should avenge it on the country at large, and the pollution which the
 land was supposed to contract from the effusion of innocent, unexpiated
 blood. According to Jewish writers, the Sanhedrin, taking charge of
 such a case, sent a deputation to examine the neighborhood. They
 reported to the nearest town to the spot where the body was found. An
 order was then issued by their supreme authority to the elders or
 magistrates of that town, to provide the heifer at the civic expense
 and go through the appointed ceremonial. The engagement of the public
 authorities in the work of expiation, the purchase of the victim
 heifer, the conducting it to a "rough valley" which might be at a
 considerable distance, and which, as the original implies, was a wady,
 a perennial stream, in the waters of which the polluting blood would be
 wiped away from the land, and a desert withal, incapable of
 cultivation; the washing of the hands, which was an ancient act
 symbolical of innocence--the whole of the ceremonial was calculated to
 make a deep impression on the Jewish, as well as on the Oriental, mind
 generally; to stimulate the activity of the magistrates in the
 discharge of their official duties; to lead to the discovery of the
 criminal, and the repression of crime.</P>

 <B>10-14. When thou goest to war .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and seest among the captives a
 beautiful woman .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that thou wouldest have her to thy
 wife</B>--According to the war customs of all ancient nations, a female
 captive became the slave of the victor, who had the sole and
 unchallengeable control of right to her person. Moses improved this
 existing usage by special regulations on the subject. He enacted that,
 in the event that her master was captivated by her beauty and
 contemplated a marriage with her, a month should be allowed to elapse,
 during which her perturbed feelings might be calmed, her mind reconciled
 to her altered condition, and she might bewail the loss of her parents,
 now to her the same as dead. A month was the usual period of mourning
 with the Jews, and the circumstances mentioned here were the signs of
 grief--the shaving of the head, the allowing the nails to grow uncut,
 the putting off her gorgeous dress in which ladies, on the eve of being
 captured, arrayed themselves to be the more attractive to their captors.
 The delay was full of humanity and kindness to the female slave, as well
 as a prudential measure to try the strength of her master's affections.
 If his love should afterwards cool and he become indifferent to her
 person, he was not to lord it over her, neither to sell her in the slave
 market, nor retain her in a subordinate condition in his house; but she
 was to be free to go where her inclinations led her.</P>

 the original and all other translations, the words are rendered "have
 had," referring to events that have already taken place; and that the
 "had" has, by some mistake, been omitted in our version, seems highly
 probable from the other verbs being in the past tense--"hers that was
 hated," not "hers that is hated"; evidently intimating that she (the
 first wife) was dead at the time referred to. Moses, therefore, does
 not here legislate upon the case of a man who has two wives at the same
 time, but on that of a man who has married twice in succession, the
 second wife after the decease of the first; and there was an obvious
 necessity for legislation in these circumstances; for the first wife,
 who was hated, was dead, and the second wife, the favorite, was alive;
 and with the feelings of a stepmother, she would urge her husband to
 make her own son the heir. This case has no bearing upon polygamy,
 which there is no evidence that the Mosaic code legalized.</P>

 they would not both agree to a criminal information against their son

 enjoined in the law delivered by God to His people. Indifference or 
 dissimulation in the circumstances supposed would not only be cruelty 
 to the dumb animals, but a violation of the common rights of humanity;

 certain times in heathen temples, it is probable that a reference was
 made to unbecoming levities practised in common life. They were
 properly forbidden; for the adoption of the habiliments of the one sex
 by the other is an outrage on decency, obliterates the distinctions of
 nature by fostering softness and effeminacy in the man, impudence and
 boldness in the woman as well as levity and hypocrisy in both; and, in

 instance of the humanizing spirit of the Mosaic law, in checking a
 tendency to wanton destructiveness and encouraging a spirit of kind and
 compassionate tenderness to the tiniest creatures. But there was wisdom
 as well as humanity in the precept; for, as birds are well known to
 serve important uses in the economy of nature, the extirpation of a
 species, whether of edible or ravenous birds, must in any country be
 productive of serious evils. But Palestine, in particular, was situated
 in a climate which produced poisonous snakes and scorpions; and the
 deserts and mountains would have been overrun with them as well as
 immense swarms of flies, locusts, mice, and vermin of various kinds if
 the birds which fed upon them were extirpated
 [M<FONT SIZE=-1>ICHAELIS</FONT>]. Accordingly,
 the counsel given in this passage was wise as well as humane, to leave
 the hen undisturbed for the propagation of the species, while the
 taking of the brood occasionally was permitted as a check to too rapid
 an increase.</P>

 branches or twigs laid across large beams, and covered with a cement of
 clay or strong plaster. They were surrounded by a parapet breast high.
 In summer the roof is a favorite resort for coolness, and accidents
 would frequently happen from persons incautiously approaching the edge
 and falling into the street or court; hence it was a wise and prudent
 precaution in the Jewish legislator to provide that a stone balustrade
 or timber railing round the roof should form an essential part of every
 new house.</P>

 may or may not have been the case. But the prohibition prevented a
 great inhumanity still occasionally practised by the poorer sort in 
 Oriental countries. An ox and ass, being of different species and of 
 very different characters, cannot associate comfortably, nor unite 
 cheerfully in drawing a plough or a wagon. The ass being much smaller 
 and his step shorter, there would be an unequal and irregular draft. 
 Besides, the ass, from feeding on coarse and poisonous weeds, has a 
 fetid breath, which its yoke fellow seeks to avoid, not only as 
 poisonous and offensive, but producing leanness, or, if long continued, 
 death; and hence, it has been observed always to hold away its head 
 from the ass and to pull only with one shoulder.</P>

 <B>1-3. He that is wounded .&nbsp;.&nbsp;., shall not enter into the congregation of
 the Lord</B>--"To enter into the congregation of the Lord" means either
 admission to public honors and offices in the Church and State of
 Israel, or, in the case of foreigners, incorporation with that nation
 by marriage. The rule was that strangers and foreigners, for fear of
 friendship or marriage connections with them leading the people into
 idolatry, were not admissible till their conversion to the Jewish
 faith. But this passage describes certain limitations of the general
 rule. The following parties were excluded from the full rights and
 privileges of citizenship: (1) Eunuchs--It was a very ancient practice
 for parents in the East by various arts to mutilate their children, with
 a view to training them for service in the houses of the great. (2)
 Bastards--Such an indelible stigma in both these instances was designed
 as a discouragement to practices that were disgraceful, but too common
 from intercourse with foreigners. (3) Ammonites and Moabites--Without
 provocation they had combined to engage a soothsayer to curse the
 Israelites; and had further endeavored, by ensnaring them into the guilt
 and licentious abominations of idolatry, to seduce them from their
 allegiance to God.</P>

 Many of the Israelites being established on the east side of Jordan in
 the immediate neighborhood of those people, God raised this partition
 wall between them to prevent the consequences of evil communications.
 More favor was to be shown to Edomites and Egyptians--to the former
 from their near relationship to Israel; and to the latter, from their
 early hospitalities to the family of Jacob, as well as the many acts of
 kindness rendered them by private Egyptians at the Exodus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:36">Ex 12:36</A>).

 The grandchildren of Edomite or Egyptian proselytes were declared
 admissible to the full rights of citizenship as native Israelites; and 
 by this remarkable provision, God taught His people a practical lesson 
 of generosity and gratitude for special deeds of kindness, to the 
 forgetfulness of all the persecution and ill services sustained from 
 those two nations.</P>

 <B>1-4. When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass

 divorces was at this early period very prevalent amongst the
 Israelites, who had in all probability become familiar with it in Egypt
 [L<FONT SIZE=-1>ANE</FONT>].
 The usage, being too deep-rooted to be soon or easily
 abolished, was tolerated by Moses 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:8">Mt 19:8</A>).

 But it was accompanied under the law with two conditions, which were
 calculated greatly to prevent the evils incident to the permitted 
 system; namely: (1) The act of divorcement was to be certified on a 
 written document, the preparation of which, with legal formality, would 
 afford time for reflection and repentance; and (2) In the event of the 
 divorced wife being married to another husband, she could not, on the 
 termination of that second marriage, be restored to her first husband, 
 however desirous he might be to receive her.</P>

 by which it is turned. The propriety of the law was founded on the
 custom of grinding corn every morning for daily consumption. If either

 gathered in the hands of the vintager. Here is a beneficent provision
 for the poor. Every forgotten sheaf in the harvest-field was to lie;
 the olive tree was not to be beaten a second time; nor were grapes to
 be gathered, in order that, in collecting what remained, the hearts of
 the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow might be gladdened by the
 bounty of Providence.</P>

 <B>2, 3. if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten</B>--In judicial sentences,
 which awarded punishment short of capital, scourging, like the Egyptian
 bastinado, was the most common form in which they were executed. The
 Mosaic law, however, introduced two important restrictions; namely: (1)
 The punishment should be inflicted in presence of the judge instead of
 being inflicted in private by some heartless official; and (2) The
 maximum amount of it should be limited to forty stripes, instead of
 being awarded according to the arbitrary will or passion of the
 magistrate. The Egyptian, like Turkish and Chinese rulers, often applied
 the stick till they caused death or lameness for life. Of what the
 scourge consisted at first we are not informed; but in later times, when
 the Jews were exceedingly scrupulous in adhering to the letter of the
 law and, for fear of miscalculation, were desirous of keeping within the
 prescribed limit, it was formed of three cords, terminating in leathern
 thongs, and thirteen strokes of this counted as thirty-nine stripes

 the wide open spaces which form the threshing-floors. The animals were
 allowed freely to pick up a mouthful, when they chose to do so: a wise
 as well as humane regulation, introduced by the law of Moses (compare

 But the Mosaic law rendered the custom obligatory

 on younger brothers, or the nearest kinsman, to marry the widow

 by associating the natural desire of perpetuating a brother's name with
 the preservation of property in the Hebrew families and tribes. If the 
 younger brother declined to comply with the law, the widow brought her 
 claim before the authorities of the place at a public assembly (the 
 gate of the city); and he having declared his refusal, she was ordered 
 to loose the thong of his shoe--a sign of degradation--following up 
 that act by spitting on the ground-- the strongest expression of 
 ignominy and contempt among Eastern people. The shoe was kept by the 
 magistrate as an evidence of the transaction, and the parties 
 separated.</P>

 <B>thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaister them with

 unhewn, and unpolished--the occasion on which they were used not
 admitting of long or elaborate preparation; and they were to be daubed
 over with paint or whitewash, to render them more conspicuous. Stones

 the conditions of the covenant, so elevated as to be visible to the
 whole congregation of Israel; and the religious ceremonial performed on
 the occasion was to consist: first, of the elementary worship needed
 for sinful men; and secondly, of the peace offerings, or lively, social
 feasts, that were suited to the happy people whose God was the Lord.

 <B>11-13. These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse</B>--Those long, rocky ridges
 lay in the province of Samaria, and the peaks referred to were near
 Shechem (Nablous), rising in steep precipices to the height of about
 eight hundred feet and separated by a green, well-watered valley of
 about five hundred yards wide. The people of Israel were here divided
 into two parts. On mount Gerizim (now Jebel-et-Tur) were stationed the
 descendants of Rachel and Leah, the two principal wives of Jacob, and
 to them was assigned the most pleasant and honorable office of
 pronouncing the benedictions; while on the twin hill of Ebal (now
 Imad-el-Deen) were placed the posterity of the two secondary wives,
 Zilpah and Bilhah, with those of Reuben, who had lost the primogeniture,
 and Zebulun, Leah's youngest son; to them was committed the necessary
 but painful duty of pronouncing the maledictions
 (see on

 <A HREF="JFB07.htm#Jud9_7">Jud 9:7</A>).

 The ceremony might have taken place on the lower spurs of the
 mountains, where they approach more closely to each other; and the 
 course observed was as follows: Amid the silent expectations of the 
 solemn assembly, the priests standing round the ark in the valley 
 below, said aloud, looking to Gerizim, "Blessed is the man that maketh 
 not any graven image," when the people ranged on that hill responded in 
 full simultaneous shouts of "Amen"; then turning round to Ebal, they 
 cried, "Cursed is the man that maketh any graven image"; to which those 
 that covered the ridge answered, "Amen." The same course at every pause 
 was followed with all the blessings and curses (see on

 <A HREF="JFB06.htm#Jos8_33">Jos 8:33, 34</A>).
 
 These curses attendant on disobedience to the divine will, which had been
 revealed as a law from heaven, be it observed, are given in the form of
 a <I>declaration,</I> not a <I>wish,</I> as the words should be rendered,
 "Cursed is he," and not, "Cursed be he."</P>

 They were strangers to that grace of wisdom which is liberally given to
 all who ask it; and their insensibility was all the more inexcusable
 that so many miracles had been performed which might have led to a
 certain conviction of the presence and the power of God with them. The
 preservation of their clothes and shoes, the supply of daily food and
 fresh water--these continued without interruption or diminution during
 so many years' sojourn in the desert. They were miracles which
 unmistakably proclaimed the immediate hand of God and were performed
 for the express purpose of training them to a practical knowledge of,
 and habitual confidence in, Him. Their experience of this extraordinary

 successes by which, with little exertion or loss on their part, God
 enabled them to acquire the valuable territory on which they stood, is
 mentioned again to enforce a faithful adherence to the covenant, as the
 direct and sure means of obtaining its promised blessings.</P>

 <B>10-29. Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God</B>--The
 whole congregation of Israel, of all ages and conditions, all--young as
 well as old; menials as well as masters; native Israelites as well as
 naturalized strangers--all were assembled before the tabernacle to
 renew the <I>Sinaitic</I> covenant. None of them were allowed to consider
 themselves as exempt from the terms of that national compact, lest any
 lapsing into idolatry might prove a root of bitterness, spreading its
 noxious seed and corrupt influence all around (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:15">Heb 12:15</A>).
 
 It was of the greatest consequence thus to reach the heart and
 conscience of everyone, for some might delude themselves with the vain
 idea that by taking the oath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:12">De 29:12</A>)

 by which they engaged themselves in covenant with God, they would 
 surely secure its blessings. Then, even though they would not rigidly 
 adhere to His worship and commands, but would follow the devices and 
 inclinations of their own hearts, yet they would think that He would 
 wink at such liberties and not punish them.  It was of the greatest 
 consequence to impress all with the strong and abiding conviction, that 
 while the covenant of grace had special blessings belonging to it, it 
 at the same time had curses in reserve for transgressors, the 
 infliction of which would be as certain, as lasting and severe. This 
 was the advantage contemplated in the law being rehearsed a second 
 time. The picture of a once rich and flourishing region, blasted and 
 doomed in consequence of the sins of its inhabitants, is very striking, 
 and calculated to awaken awe in every reflecting mind. Such is, and 
 long has been, the desolate state of Palestine; and, in looking at its 
 ruined cities, its blasted coast, its naked mountains, its sterile and 
 parched soil--all the sad and unmistakable evidences of a land lying 
 under a curse--numbers of travellers from Europe, America, and the 
 Indies ("strangers from a far country,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:22">De 29:22</A>)

 in the present day see that the Lord has executed His threatening. Who 
 can resist the conclusion that it has been inflicted "because the 
 inhabitants had forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers. 
 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the anger of the Lord was kindled against this
 land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this 
 book"?</P>

 <B>29. The secret things belong unto the Lord</B>--This verse has no apparent
 connection with the thread of discourse. It is thought to have been
 said in answer to the looks of astonishment or the words of inquiry as
 to whether they would be ever so wicked as to deserve such punishments.
 The recorded history of God's providential dealings towards Israel
 presents a wonderful combination of "goodness and severity." There is
 much of it involved in mystery too profound for our limited capacities
 to fathom; but, from the comprehensive wisdom displayed in those parts
 which have been made known to us, we are prepared to enter into the
 full spirit of the apostle's exclamation, "How unsearchable are his
 judgments"

 <B>1-10. when all these things are come upon thee, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and 
 <I>thou</I> shalt return .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then the Lord thy God will 
 turn thy captivity</B>--The hopes of the Hebrew people are ardently 
 directed to this promise, and they confidently expect that God, 
 commiserating their forlorn and fallen condition, will yet rescue them 
 from all the evils of their long dispersion. They do not consider the 
 promise as fulfilled by their restoration from the captivity in 
 Babylon, for Israel was not then scattered in the manner here 
 described--"among all the nations," "unto the utmost parts of heaven"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:4">De 30:4</A>).

 When God recalled them from that bondage, all the Israelites were not
 brought back. They were not multiplied above their fathers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:5">De 30:5</A>),

 nor were their hearts and those of their children circumcised to love
 the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:6">De 30:6</A>).

 It is not, therefore, of the Babylonish captivity that Moses was
 speaking in this passage; it must be of the dispersed state to which
 they have been doomed for eighteen hundred years. This prediction may
 have been partially accomplished on the return of the Israelites from
 Babylon; for, according to the structure and design of Scripture
 prophecy, it may have pointed to several similar eras in their national
 history; and this view is sanctioned by the prayer of Nehemiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:8,9">Ne 1:8, 9</A>).

 But undoubtedly it will receive its full and complete accomplishment in
 the conversion of the Jews to the Gospel of Christ.  At the restoration 
 from the Babylonish captivity, that people were changed in many 
 respects for the better. They were completely weaned from idolatry; and 
 this outward reformation was a prelude to the higher attainments they 
 are destined to reach in the age of Messiah, "when the Lord God will 
 circumcise their hearts and the hearts of their seed to love the Lord." 
 The course pointed out seems clearly to be this: that the hearts of the 
 Hebrew people shall be circumcised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:2">Col 2:2</A>);

 in other words, by the combined influences of the Word and spirit of
 God, their hearts will be touched and purified from all their 
 superstition and unbelief. They will be converted to the faith of Jesus 
 Christ as their Messiah--a spiritual deliverer, and the effect of their 
 conversion will be that they will return and obey the voice (the 
 Gospel, the evangelical law) of the Lord. The words may be interpreted 
 either wholly in a spiritual sense

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:51,52">Joh 11:51, 52</A>),

 or, as many think, in a literal sense also

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1-36">Ro 11:1-36</A>).

 They will be recalled from all places of the dispersion to their own
 land and enjoy the highest prosperity. The mercies and favors of a 
 bountiful Providence will not then be abused as formerly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:20,32:15">De 31:20; 32:15</A>).

 They will be received in a better spirit and employed to nobler
 purposes. They will be happy, "for the Lord will again rejoice over 
 them for good, as He rejoiced over their fathers."</P>

 <B>11-14. For this commandment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is not hidden .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. neither is it far
 off</B>--That law of loving and obeying God, which was the subject of
 Moses' discourse, was well known to the Israelites. They could not
 plead ignorance of its existence and requirements. It was not concealed
 as an impenetrable mystery in heaven, for it had been revealed; nor was
 it carefully withheld from the people as a dangerous discovery; for the
 youngest and humblest of them were instructed in those truths, which
 were subjects of earnest study and research among the wisest and
 greatest of other nations. They were not under a necessity of
 undertaking long journeys or distant voyages, as many ancient sages did
 in quest of knowledge. They enjoyed the peculiar privilege of a
 familiar acquaintance with it. It was with them a subject of common
 conversation, engraven on their memories, and frequently explained and
 inculcated on their hearts. The apostle Paul 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:6-8">Ro 10:6-8</A>)

 has applied this passage to the Gospel, for the law of Christ is
 substantially the same as that of Moses, only exhibited more clearly in 
 its spiritual nature and extensive application; and, accompanied with 
 the advantages of Gospel grace, it is practicable and easy.</P>

 miserable life. Love of God and compliance with His will are the only
 ways of securing the blessings and avoiding the evils described. The
 choice was left to them, and in urging upon them the inducements to a
 wise choice, Moses warmed as he proceeded into a tone of solemn and
 impressive earnestness similar to that of Paul to the elders of Ephesus

 <B>1. Moses went and spake</B>--It is probable that this rehearsal of the
 law extended over several successive days; and it might be the last and
 most important day on which the return of Moses to the place of
 assembly is specially noticed. In drawing his discourse towards a
 conclusion, he adverted to his advanced age; and although neither his
 physical nor intellectual powers had suffered any decay 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+34:7">De 34:7</A>),

 people, Moses exhorted them not to be intimidated by the menacing
 opposition of enemies; to take encouragement from the continued presence
 of their covenanted God; and to rest assured that the same divine power,
 which had enabled them to discomfit their first assailants on the east
 of Jordan, would aid them not less effectually in the adventurous
 enterprise which they were about to undertake, and by which they would
 obtain possession of "the land which He had sworn unto their fathers to

 <B>9-13. And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests</B>--The
 law thus committed to writing was either the whole book of Deuteronomy,
 or the important part of it contained between the twenty-seventh and
 thirtieth chapters. It was usual in cases of public or private contract
 for two copies of the engagement to be made--one to be deposited in the
 national archives or some secure place for reference, should occasion
 require. The other was to remain in the hands of the contracting parties

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:12-14">Jer 32:12-14</A>).

 The same course was followed on this renewal of the covenant between
 God and Israel. Two written copies of the law were prepared, the one of 
 which was delivered to the public representatives of Israel; namely, 
 the priests and the elders.

 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 tabernacles, the law was to be publicly read. This order of Moses was a
 future and prospective arrangement; for the observance of the sabbatic
 year did not commence till the conquest and peaceful occupation of
 Canaan. The ordinance served several important purposes. For, while the
 people had opportunities of being instructed in the law every Sabbath
 and daily in their own homes, this public periodical rehearsal at
 meetings in the courts of the sanctuary, where women and children of
 twelve years were present (as they usually were at the great
 festivals), was calculated to produce good and pious impressions of
 divine truth amid the sacred associations of the time and place.
 Besides, it formed a public guarantee for the preservation, integrity,
 and faithful transmission of the Sacred Book to successive ages.</P>

 Palestine was reserved by the wisdom and goodness of Heaven for the
 possession of His peculiar people and the display of the most 
 stupendous wonders. The theater was small, but admirably suited for the 
 convenient observation of the human race--at the junction of the two 
 great continents of Asia and Africa, and almost within sight of Europe. 
 From this spot as from a common center the report of God's wonderful 
 works, the glad tidings of salvation through the obedience and 
 sufferings of His own eternal Son, might be rapidly and easily wafted 
 to every part of the globe.

 Adam and set the bounds of every people, the children of Israel were
 few in numbers, when the Lord chose that people and made Jacob His
 inheritance" (compare

 progeny are sufficiently advanced to soar in their native element, she,
 in their first attempts at flying, supports them on the tip of her
 wing, encouraging, directing, and aiding their feeble efforts to longer
 and sublimer flights. So did God take the most tender and powerful care
 of His chosen people; He carried them out of Egypt and led them through
 all the horrors of the wilderness to the promised inheritance.</P>

 beams on all the adjoining region in directing Israel's march to
 Canaan. In these descriptions of a <I>theophania,</I> God is represented as
 coming from the south, and the allusion is in general to the
 thunderings and lightnings of Sinai; but other mountains in the same
 direction are mentioned with it. The location of Seir was on the east
 of the Ghor; mount Paran was either the chain on the west of the Ghor,
 or rather the mountains on the southern border of the desert towards
 the peninsula [R<FONT SIZE=-1>OBINSON</FONT>].

 The general name given to the whole mountain range east of Jordan, was
 Abarim (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:49">De 32:49</A>),

 and the peak to which Moses ascended was dedicated to the heathen Nebo,
 as Balaam's standing place had been consecrated to Peor. Some modern 
 travellers have fixed on Jebel Attarus, a high mountain south of the 
 Jabbok (Zurka), as the Nebo of this passage [B<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>URCKHARDT</FONT>, S<FONT SIZE=-1>EETZEN,</FONT> &c.]. But it is

 <B>the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead</B>--That pastoral region was
 discernible at the northern extremity of the mountain line on which he
 stood, till it ended, far beyond his sight in Dan. Westward, there were
 on the horizon, the distant hills of "all Naphtali." Coming nearer, was
 "the land of Ephraim and Manasseh." Immediately opposite was "all the
 land of Judah," a title at first restricted to the portion of this
 tribe, beyond which were "the utmost sea" (the Mediterranean) and the
 Desert of the "South." These were the four great marks of the future
 inheritance of his people, on which the narrative fixes our attention.
 Immediately below him was "the circle" of the plain of Jericho, with
 its oasis of palm trees; and far away on his left, the last inhabited
 spot before the great desert "Zoar." The foreground of the picture
 alone was clearly discernible. There was no miraculous power of vision
 imparted to Moses. That he should see all that is described is what
 any man could do, if he attained sufficient elevation. The atmosphere
 of the climate is so subtle and free from vapor that the sight is
 carried to a distance of which the beholder, who judges from the more
 dense air of Europe, can form no idea [V<FONT SIZE=-1>ERE</FONT>

 that "good land," the deep valley of the Jordan intervened; "he was not

 <B>9. Joshua .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was full of the spirit of wisdom</B>--He was appointed to
 a peculiar and extraordinary office. He was not the successor of Moses,
 for he was not a prophet or civil ruler, but the general or leader,
 called to head the people in the war of invasion and the subsequent
 allocation of the tribes.</P>

 <A NAME="De34_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <B>10-12. there arose not a prophet since</B>--In whatever light we view this
 extraordinary man, the eulogy pronounced in these inspired words will
 appear just. No Hebrew prophet or ruler equalled him in character or
 official dignity, or in knowledge of God's will and opportunities of
 announcing it.</P>
