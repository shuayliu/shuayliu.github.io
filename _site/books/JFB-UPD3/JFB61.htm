 A<FONT SIZE=-1>UTHENTICITY AND GENUINENESS</FONT>.--If not a gross 
 imposture, <I>its own internal witness</I> is unequivocal in its favor. 
 It has <I>Peter's</I> name and apostleship in its heading: not only his 
 surname, but his original name <I>Simon,</I> or <I>Simeon,</I> he thus, 
 at the close of his life, reminding his readers who he originally was
 before his call.  Again, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:16-18">2Pe 1:16-18</A>,

 he mentions <I>his presence at the Transfiguration,</I> and <I>Christ's 
 prophecy of his death!</I> and in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:15">2Pe 3:15</A>,
 
 <I>his brotherhood with Paul.</I> Again, in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:1">2Pe 3:1</A>,

 the author speaks of himself as author of the former Epistle: it is, 
 moreover, addressed so as to <I>include</I> (but not to be restricted 
 to) the same persons as the first, whom he presupposes to be acquainted 
 with the writings of Paul, by that time recognized as "Scripture"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:15">2Pe 3:15</A>,

 "the long-suffering of God," compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:4">Ro 2:4</A>).
 
 This necessarily implies a <I>late date,</I> when Paul's Epistles
 (including Romans) already had become generally diffused and accepted 
 as Scripture in the Church. The Church of the fourth century had, 
 besides the testimony which we have of the <I>doubts</I> of the earlier 
 Christians, other external evidence which we have not, and which, 
 doubtless, under God's overruling providence, caused them to accept it. 
 It is hard to understand how a book palpably false (as it would be if 
 Peter be not the author) could have been accepted in the Canon as 
 finally established in the Councils of Laodicea, <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 360 (if the fifty-ninth article be genuine), Hippo, 
 and Carthage in the fourth century (393 and 397). The whole tone and 
 spirit of the Epistle disprove its being an imposture. He writes as one 
 not speaking of himself, but <I>moved by the Holy Ghost</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:21">2Pe 1:21</A>).

 An attempt at such a fraud in the first ages would have brought only 
 shame and suffering, alike from Christians and heathen, on the 
 perpetrator: there was then <I>no temptation to pious frauds</I> as in 
 later times. That it must have been written in the earliest age is 
 plain from the <I>wide gulf in style</I> which separates it and the 
 other New Testament Scriptures from even the earliest and best of the 
 post-apostolic period. D<FONT SIZE=-1>AILLE</FONT> well says, "God has 
 allowed a fosse to be drawn by human weakness around the sacred canon 
 to protect it from all invasion."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Traces of acquaintance with it appear in the earliest Fathers.
 H<FONT SIZE=-1>ERMAS</FONT> [<I>Similitudes,</I> 6.4] (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:13">2Pe 2:13</A>),

 <I>Greek,</I> "<I>luxury</I> in the day .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. luxuriating
 with their own deceivings"; and [<I>Shepherd, Vision</I> 3.7], "They 
 have left their true way" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:15">2Pe 2:15</A>);

 and [<I>Shepherd, Vision</I> 4.3], "Thou hast escaped this world" 
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:20">2Pe 2:20</A>).

 C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> R<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT>, [<I>Epistle 
 to the Corinthians,</I> 7.9; 10], as to <I>Noah's preaching</I> and 
 <I>Lot's</I> deliverance, "<I>the Lord</I> making it known that He does 
 not abandon those that trust in Him, but appoints those otherwise 
 inclined to <I>judgment</I>" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:5,6,7,9">2Pe 2:5, 6, 7, 9</A>).

 I<FONT SIZE=-1>REN&AElig;US</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 178 ("the
 day of the Lord is as a thousand years"), and 
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>USTIN</FONT> M<FONT SIZE=-1>ARTYR</FONT> seem to allude
 to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:8">2Pe 3:8</A>.

 H<FONT SIZE=-1>IPPOLYTUS</FONT> [<I>On Antichrist</I>], seems to refer 
 to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:21">2Pe 1:21</A>,

 "<I>The prophets spake not of their own private</I> (individual) 
 ability and <I>will,</I> but what was (revealed) to them alone by God." 
 The difficulty is, neither T<FONT SIZE=-1>ERTULLIAN</FONT>, C<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>YPRIAN</FONT>, C<FONT SIZE=-1>LEMENT OF</FONT> A<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>LEXANDRIA</FONT>, nor the oldest <I>Syriac</I> 
 (<I>Peschito</I>) version (the <I>later Syriac</I> has it), nor the 
 fragment known as <I>Muratori's Canon,</I> mentions it. The first 
 writer who has expressly named it is O<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGEN</FONT>, in 
 the third century (<I>Homily</I> on Joshua; also <I>Homily 4</I> on 
 Leviticus, and <I>Homily 13</I> on Numbers), who names it "Scripture," 
 quoting

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:4,2:16">2Pe 1:4; 2:16</A>;

 however (in E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical
 History,</I> 6.25]), he mentions that the Second Epistle was doubted by 
 some. F<FONT SIZE=-1>IRMILIAN</FONT>, bishop of Cappadocia, in 
 <I>Epistle to Cyrpian</I> speaks of Peter's <I>Epistles</I> as warning 
 us to avoid heretics (a monition which occurs in the <I>Second,</I> not 
 the <I>First</I> Epistle). Now <I>Cappadocia</I> is one of the 
 countries mentioned (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1,2Pe+3:1">1Pe 1:1
 with 2Pe 3:1</A>)

 as addressed; and it is striking, that from Cappadocia we get the
 earliest decisive testimony.  "Internally it claims to be written by 
 Peter, and this claim is confirmed by the Christians of that very 
 region in whose custody it <I>ought</I> to have been found" [T<FONT 
 SIZE=-1>REGELLES</FONT>].</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The books disputed (<I>Antilegomena</I>), as distinguished from those 
 universally recognized (<I>Homologoumena</I>), are Epistles Second 
 Peter, James, Second and Third John, Jude, the Apocalypse, Epistle to 
 Hebrews (compare E<FONT SIZE=-1>USEBIUS</FONT> [<I>Ecclesiastical 
 History,</I> 3.3,25]). The <I>Antilegomena</I> stand in quite a
 different class from the <I>Spurious;</I> of these there was no
 <I>dispute,</I> they were universally rejected; for example, <I>the
 Shepherd of Hermas, the Revelation of Peter, the Epistle of
 Barnabas.</I>
 C<FONT SIZE=-1>YRIL OF</FONT>
 J<FONT SIZE=-1>ERUSALEM</FONT>
 (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 348) enumerates
 <I>seven</I> Catholic Epistles, including Second Peter; so also
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>REGORY</FONT>
 N<FONT SIZE=-1>AZIANZEN</FONT>
 (<FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 389), and
 E<FONT SIZE=-1>PIPHANIUS</FONT> (A.D. 367). The oldest <I>Greek</I>
 manuscripts extant (of the fourth century) contain the 
 <I>Antilegomena.</I> J<FONT SIZE=-1>EROME</FONT> [<I>On Illustrious 
 Men</I>], conjectured, from a supposed difference of style between the 
 two Epistles, that Peter, being unable to write <I>Greek,</I> employed 
 a different translator of his <I>Hebrew</I> dictation in the Second 
 Epistle, and not the same as translated the First into <I>Greek.</I> 
 Mark is said to have been his translator in the case of the Gospel 
 according to Mark; but this is all gratuitous conjecture. Much of the 
 same views pervade both Epistles. In both alike he looks for the Lord's 
 coming suddenly, and the end of the world (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:8-10,1Pe+4:5">2Pe 3:8-10
 with 1Pe 4:5</A>);

 the inspiration of the prophets (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10-12,2Pe+1:19-21,3:2">1Pe 1:10-12
 with 2Pe 1:19-21; 3:2</A>);

 the new birth by the divine word a motive to abstinence from worldly
 lusts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:22,2:2">1Pe 1:22; 2:2</A>;

 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:4">2Pe 1:4</A>);

 also compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:9,2Pe+1:3">1Pe 2:9
 with 2Pe 1:3</A>,

 both containing in the <I>Greek</I> the rare word "virtue"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:17,2Pe+2:3">1Pe 4:17
 with 2Pe 2:3</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is not strange that <I>distinctive peculiarities</I> of
 <FONT SIZE=-1>STYLE</FONT> should mark each Epistle, the design of both
 not being the same. Thus the <I>sufferings</I> of Christ are more 
 prominent in the First Epistle, the object there being to encourage 
 thereby Christian sufferers; the <I>glory</I> of the exalted Lord is 
 more prominent in the Second, the object being to communicate fuller 
 "knowledge" of Him as the antidote to the false teaching against which 
 Peter warns his readers. Hence His title of redemption, "Christ," is 
 the one employed in the First Epistle; but in the Second Epistle, "the 
 Lord." <I>Hope</I> is characteristic of the First Epistle; <I>full 
 knowledge,</I> of the Second Epistle. In the First Epistle he puts his 
 <I>apostolic authority</I> less prominently forward than in the Second, 
 wherein his design is to warn against false teachers.  The same 
 difference is observable in Paul's Epistles. Contrast

 The reference to Paul's writings as already existing in numbers, and as
 then a recognized part of <I>Scripture</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:15,16">2Pe 3:15, 16</A>),

 implies that this Epistle was written at a late date, just before 
 Peter's death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Striking verbal coincidences occur: compare

 "tabernacle," that is, the body, and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:15">2Pe 1:15</A>,

 "decease," which at once remind us of the transfiguration narrative in
 the Gospel. Both Epistles refer to the deluge, and to Noah as the
 <I>eighth</I> that was saved. Though the First Epistle abounds in
 <I>quotations</I> of the Old Testament, whereas the Second contains
 none, yet <I>references</I> to the Old Testament occur often

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:21,2:5-8,15,3:5,6,10,13">2Pe 1:21;

 <I>The testimony of Jude,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:17,18">Jude 17, 18</A>,

 is strong for its genuineness and inspiration, by adopting its very 
 words, and by referring to it as received by the churches to which he, 
 Jude, wrote, "Remember the words which were spoken before of the 
 <I>apostles</I> of our Lord Jesus Christ; how that they told you 
 <I>there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after 
 their own ungodly lusts.</I>" Jude, therefore, must have written 
 <I>after</I> Second Peter, to which he plainly refers; not before, as 
 A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> thinks. No less than eleven passages of 
 Jude rest on similar statements of Second Peter.

 Just in the same way Micah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:1-4">Mic 4:1-4</A>,

 leans on the somewhat earlier prophecy of Isaiah, whose inspiration he
 thereby confirms. A<FONT SIZE=-1>LFORD</FONT> reasons that because 
 Jude, in many of the passages akin to Second Peter, is fuller than 
 Second Peter, he must be prior. This by no means follows. It is at 
 least as likely, if not more so, that the briefer is the earlier, 
 rather than the fuller. The dignity and energy of the style is quite 
 consonant to what we should expect from the prompt and ardent foreman 
 of the apostles. The difference of style between First and Second Peter 
 accords with the distinctness of the subjects and objects.</P>

 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE DATE</FONT>, from what has been said, would be about
 <FONT SIZE=-1>A.D.</FONT> 68 or 69, about a year after the first, and 
 shortly before the destruction of Jerusalem, the typical precursor of 
 the world's end, to which

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:10-13">2Pe 3:10-13</A>

 so solemnly calls attention, after Paul's ministry had closed (compare 
 <I>Greek</I> aorist tense, "wrote," past time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:15">2Pe 3:15</A>),

 just before Peter's own death. It was written to <I>include</I> the 
 same persons, and perhaps in, or about the same place, as the first. 
 Being without salutations of individuals, and entrusted to the care of 
 no one church, or particular churches as the first is, but directed 
 generally "to them that have obtained like precious faith with us"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:1">2Pe 1:1</A>),

 it took a longer time in being recognized as canonical. Had Rome been 
 the place of its composition or publication, it could hardly have 
 failed to have had an early acceptance--an incidental argument against 
 the tradition of Peter's martyrdom <I>at Rome.</I> The remote scene of 
 its composition in Babylon, or else in some of the contiguous regions 
 beyond the borders of the Roman empire, and of its circulation in 
 Cappadocia, Pontus, &c., will additionally account for its tardy but at 
 last universal acceptance in the catholic Church. The former Epistle, 
 through <I>its more definite address,</I> was earlier in its general 
 acceptance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 O<FONT SIZE=-1>BJECT</FONT>.--In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:17,18">2Pe 3:17, 18</A>

 the twofold design of the Epistle is set forth; namely, to guard his 
 readers against "the error" of false teachers, and to exhort them to 
 grow in experimental "knowledge of our Lord and Saviour"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:18">2Pe 3:18</A>).
 
 The ground on which this <I>knowledge</I> rests is stated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:12-21">2Pe 1:12-21</A>,

 namely, the inspired testimony of apostles and prophets. The danger 
 now, as of old, was about to arise from false teachers, who soon were 
 to come among them, as Paul also (to whom reference is made,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:15,16">2Pe 3:15, 16</A>)

 testified in the same region.  The grand antidote is "the <I>full 
 knowledge</I> of our Lord and Saviour," through which we know God the 
 Father, partake of His nature, escape from the pollutions of the world, 
 and have entrance into Christ's kingdom. The aspect of Christ presented 
 is not so much that of the past <I>suffering,</I> as of the future 
 <I>reigning,</I> Saviour, His present <I>power,</I> and future new 
 kingdom. This aspect is taken as best fitted to counteract the 
 <I>theories</I> of the false teachers who should "deny" His 
 <I>Lordship</I> and His <I>coming</I> again, the two very points which, 
 as an <I>apostle and eye-witness,</I> Peter attests (His "power" and 
 His "coming"); also, to counteract <I>their evil example in 
 practice,</I> blaspheming the way of truth, despising governments, 
 slaves to covetousness and filthy lusts of the flesh, while boasting of 
 Christian freedom, and, worst of all, apostates from the truth. The 
 <I>knowledge of Christ,</I> as being the knowledge of "the way of 
 righteousness," "the right way," is the antidote of their bad practice. 
 Hence "the preacher" of righteousness, Noah, and "righteous Lot," are 
 instanced as escaping the destruction which overtook the "unjust" or 
 "unrighteous"; and Balaam is instanced as exemplifying the awful result 
 of "unrighteousness" such as characterized the false teachers. Thus the 
 Epistle forms one connected whole, the parts being closely bound 
 together by mutual relation, and the end corresponding with the 
 beginning; compare

 the apostolic age, before the <I>development</I> of the Gnostic 
 heresies in the end of the first and the beginning of the second

 any particular one of the subsequent forms of heresy, but applies 
 generally to them all.</P>

 Though altogether distinct in aim from the First Epistle, yet a

 His mention of his original name accords with the design of this Second 
 Epistle, which is to warn against the coming false teachers, by setting 
 forth the true "knowledge" of Christ on the testimony of the

 required in the First Epistle.

 Saviour." "The <I>common</I> salvation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the faith once

 Though putting forward his <I>apostleship</I> to enforce his 
 exhortation, he with true humility puts himself, as to "the faith," on 
 a level with all other believers. The degree of faith varies in 
 different believers; but <I>in respect to its objects,</I> present 
 justification, sanctification, and future glorification, it is common 
 alike to all. Christ is to all believers "made of God wisdom, 
 righteousness, sanctification, and redemption."

 both nouns requires, "the righteousness of <I>Him who is</I> (at once) 
 <I>our God and</I> (our) Saviour." Peter, confirming Pau;'s testimony 
 to the same churches, adopts Paul's inspired phraseology. The Gospel 
 plan sets forth <I>God's righteousness,</I> which is Christ's 
 righteousness, in the brightest light. Faith has its sphere <FONT 
 SIZE=-1>IN</FONT> it as its peculiar element: God is in redemption 
 "righteous," and at the same time a "Saviour"; compare

 that Christ's <I>sufferings,</I> now past, are to be followed by 
 Christ's <I>glory,</I> still future: the Transfiguration gives us a 
 pledge to make our faith still stronger, that "the day" of His glory 
 will "dawn" ere long. He does not mean to say that "the word of 
 prophecy," or Scripture, is surer than <I>the voice of God</I> heard at 
 the Transfiguration, as <I>English Version;</I> for this is plainly not 
 the fact. The fulfilment of <I>prophecy</I> so far in Christ's history 
 makes us the <I>surer</I> of what is yet to be fulfilled, His 
 consummated glory. The word was the "lamp (<I>Greek</I> for 'light') 
 heeded" by Old Testament believers, until a gleam of the "day dawn" was 
 given at Christ's first coming, and especially in His Transfiguration. 
 So the word is <I>a lamp</I> to us still, until "the day" burst forth 
 fully at the second coming of "the Sun of righteousness." <I>The

 "by the will of man" (namely, the individual writer). In a secondary

 it cannot be <I>interpreted</I> by its <I>readers</I> (any more than by

 Moses there says, Thy <I>eternity,</I> knowing no distinction between a

 day seems to us, short-lived beings, long in coming, but <I>with the 
 Lord</I> the interval is irrespective of the idea of long or short. His 
 eternity exceeds all measures of time: to His divine knowledge all 
 future things are present: His power requires not long delays for the 
 performance of His work: His long-suffering excludes all impatient 
 expectation and eager haste, such as we men feel. He is equally blessed 
 in one day and in a thousand years. He can do the work of a thousand

 doubted altogether His coming" [B<FONT SIZE=-1>ENGEL</FONT>]. Though 
 there be some things hard to be understood, there are enough besides, 
 plain, easy, and sufficient for perfecting the man of God. "There is 
 scarce anything drawn from the obscure places, but the same in other 
 places may be found most plain" [A<FONT SIZE=-1>UGUSTINE</FONT>]. It is

 recognized in the Church, as "Scripture": a term never applied in any 
 of the fifty places where it occurs, save to the Old and New Testament 
 sacred writings. Men in each Church having miraculous <I>discernment of 
 spirits</I> would have prevented any uninspired writing from being put 
 on a par with the Old Testament word of God; the apostles' lives also 
 were providentially prolonged, Paul's and Peter's at least to 
 thirty-four years after Christ's resurrection, John's to thirty years 
 later, so that fraud in the canon is out of question. The three first 
 Gospels and Acts are included in "the other Scriptures," and perhaps 
 all the New Testament books, save John and Revelation, written later.
